800002
javadoc	doxygen
it supports a wide range of comment formats documentation xml doxygen javadoc qt and can even convert legacy comments and handles c# visual basic c++-cli c++ c and java source code

800009
web-config	app-config
i presume the business logic will use the app-config web-config business logic is in another layer - a class project

800009
logging	trace
log4net seems to me the ultimate logging framework but elmah has that edge of submitting all the server variables and stack trace etc

800015
formatting	printing
the problem i am facing is to printing out the floating point value again with the exact same formatting

800016
stderr	stdout
in more complex scenarios where you want to fetch stdout stderr or the return code you can use well known standard modules like ipc open2 and ipc open3

800032
configuration	logging
however log4net does provide an easier way to get more detailed and extensive logging information since you have so many configuration options to work with

800034
stderr	stdout
there is also no point in returning stdout stderr or exit status of the command

800034
stderr	stdout
it allows you to read stdout stderr and write to stdin of your command

800045
exception-handling	try-catch
log4net on the other hand is for logging events including errors caused by exception-handling that you kind of knew could happen otherwise you would not have a try-catch block

800045
debugging	trace
to answer your specific question you can get log4net to log stacktrace of exception but you should not generally log stack trace for every debugging message that you log

800054
linux	unix
bare line feeds newline in linux unix are n

800055
application-pool	was
no idea what the real reason to this was but changing the virtual directory into an application in iis and moving it on top of an application-pool which ran using local system account the access denied errors went away

800071
keyboard	mouse
and then the command can be pushed in an execution queue both when the user presses a keyboard button moves the mouse or without a triggers with the playback mechanism

800072
python	java
of course it would require you to rewrite your application in java instead of python but as someone who s worked with gwt let me tell you the advantages of using a modern ide on your ajax codebase are totally worth it

800074
csv	xml
i want users to be able to user their own file format when doing so xml or csv

800076
32-bit	64bit
i m not sure i understand it properly does a 64bit os run compile code faster than a 32-bit os on the same system

800076
compatibility	legacy
we re using 64bit oss where i am and it seems to only cause compatibility issues with legacy and proprietary software

800091
textbox	button
the data templates for editing has a one-way binding on the textbox and a save button

800091
textbox	button
what changes do i need to make so that when i press the save button after putting the list item in edit mode the value i change the textbox to replaces the value in the observablecollection and the display

800094
deep-copy	object
i would consider taking the hit with icloneable for deep-copy and or icomparable for comparing if the object are different .

800098
32-bit	64bit
also you need to transfer these instructions to and from the cpu 64bit instructions are twice as big as 32-bit instructions which means more traffic to and from memory and the caches

800105
stdin	pipe
open run a process and create a pipe to its stdin or stderr

800105
stdin	pipe
ipc open2 run a process and create a pipe to both stdin and stdout

800105
stdin	pipe
ipc open3 run a process and create a pipe to stdin stdout and stderr

800106
32-bit	64bit
as a general rule developing--or using--a 64bit operating system in any context will be slower than the same 32-bit operating system

800106
32-bit	64bit
it will work due to a technology called pae or paged addressing extensions that intel invented to bridge the gap between 32-bit systems and 64bit systems but the result is slow painful to work with as a developer and not very well supported on windows. going to a 64bit os can provide tremendous benefits

800137
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to make a for-loop that checks a 16 element arrays so it loops from 0 to 15

800137
arrays	loops
is there any way to make a loops go and check all 16 elements of the arrays while never being greater than 15 at the end of the loops

800139
handler	service
finally if you have interrupt service routines assembly can make all the difference in the world -- there are certain operations you just don t want occurring under interrupt and you want your interrupt handler to get in and get out fast .

800157
contains	any
note however that your example text doesn t contains any slashes - is this what your sample text is actually like

800169
for-loop	loops
the criteria of using a for-loops instead of a while loops is that you know beforehand exactly how many times a for-loops will execute

800179
wmv	asf
i m compression raw avi files to wmv using the asf writer

800179
compression	streaming
the files contains just video in rgb 24bits format and the compression level for the video streaming is between 200kbps and 2000kbps

800179
delphi	c++
any configuration hints using c++ c# delphi etc

800187
for-loop	loops
the for-loops is equivalent to the following while loops

800217
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
because the dictionary doesn t implements inotifypropertychanged or inotifycollectionchanged

800230
keyboard	mouse
if i have no nodes selecteded and that treeview gains focus i ll get an afterselected event with the first node selecteded even though i didn t selected it using the keyboard mouse or programmatically

800235
bash	zsh
i need to change the following bash code to zsh

800237
for-loop	loops
you cannot accomplish this with the built-in loops structures and as bill the lizard said you probably don t really want to reuse the for-loops variable

800245
updating	updates
you could also have the init block not updates the hash which would protect you from that kind of error but you d still be vulnerable to the opposite - updating the symbol versioning wouldn t updates the string versioning

800269
contains	any
the first index in string at which the start of the substring can be found or -1 if string does not contains any instances of the substring

800287
updating	updates
if you don t need msi or really need the application to pull it s own updates then use nsis or some other tool and write your own updating routine service

800289
web-services	security
see what is some good wcf web-services security reading

800295
stderr	stdout
when i wrote this code i would also get the error via stdout stderr

800295
stderr	stdout
the best way to redirect stdout stderr in your process is by using freopen

800296
swing	awt
what you really must understand with dealing with swing and in fact awt is that you need to keep all interaction with the components of the awt event dispatch thread edt

800318
nhibernate	ado.net
nhibernate or fluent nhibernate be carefull - great tools but very different approach from plain ado.net

800323
entity-framework	nhibernate
one alternative is using orm tools like nhibernate or entity-framework or linq2sql

800334
stderr	stdout
after getting a hold of stdout and stderr which you ll need anyway add -xcheck jni to your jvm command-line to get extra jni-related warnings from the jvm

800336
selected	button
what does the button is changing the session for the new selected language

800354
google-chrome	firefox
but it obviously can t use msxml in firefox google-chrome safari opera etc

800354
json	xml
json is usually preferred over xml

800355
doxygen	latex
i tried using doxygen but the latex code it generates does not compile because it s too deeply nested for the latex compiler

800384
constructor	object
you can t do this directly in c++ since the object is constructed when you define it with the default constructor

800388
relational-database	schema
there is only one rigorous technique for conceptually modeling a relational-database schema that i know of and i ve spent a lot of time looking

800397
bamboo	hudson
atlassian bamboo cost sun hudson free and cruise control free are all popular options in order of my preference and have support to handle phpunit output because phpunit support junit output

800399
startup	launch
if i remember correctly the mac swt jar uses certain startup hooks to launch itself automatically

800399
swing	swt
then swt interferes with swing

800402
contains	set
if the value of displaymember doesn t exist or has its value set to an empty string the tostring methods is called on the object contains in the list item to obtain the text to display in the list

800406
critical-section	multiprocess
critical-section and mutex are not operating system specific their concepts of multithreading multiprocess

800407
listbox	textbox
for example you can add a listbox just below the textbox and set its default visibility to false

800407
selected	listbox
then you can use the ontextchanged event of the textbox and the selectededindexchanged event of the listbox to display and selected items

800414
stream	send
based on the original xml error and the possibility of the session id going bad it appears that the server either send bad data at some point unexpected to xml stream and unaccounted for by the modules using it

800416
conditional	operators
i suggest this because i ve worked places where the conditional operators was forbidden

800433
directory	folder
they certainly can t run in the same folder or virtual directory

800440
required	checked
i have a task files available over webdav on a remote-server ssl required must be checked for whether they may have been updates recently and if so copy-paste to a local folder

800445
expression	evaluation
no data would require calculating or other special processing any more complex than what can be achieved by the evaluation of a single xpath expression

800458
perl	php
vb idl perl php c# and vb.net

800459
textbox	button
but when i run this flex remote hello world app i see a button and a textbox but it does not pick up the output of the httpservice call to my ruby-on-rails url

800475
required	checked
when the owning thread release the critical-section it is required to checked if the mutex is allocated if it is then it will set the mutex to release a waiting thread

800490
configuration	logging
if you want logging to be different between the two builds you have to change your configuration file between the two builds

800496
webserver	upload
their solution was to save the file on the webserver by doing a request.files 0 .saveas and then doing the ftp upload

800497
command-line	cmd
they re talking about undoing changes to the cmd-line before you press enter not undoing the results of a cmd

800505
executable	upx
related question are there any downsides to using upx to compress a windows executable

800509
textbox	button
create a series of textbox s add a submit button and after reading the data from the textbox send it using xmlhttprequest

800513
gzip	zip
gzip zip are just as effective at compressing and don t tinker with your app

800537
contains	elements
8 elements are ok but what if the list was contains 1000

800539
os.path	shutil
i just wrote some code to move vmware virtual machines around and ended up using os.path and shutil to accomplish file copying between subdirectories

800545
show	next
i ve also wondered how to get the + to show up next to childless nodes but i never found a good way

800546
click	mouse
lets say this element is displayed on an event such as a mouse click

800551
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptography hash function not necessarily an encryption methods

800551
salt	md5
you will probably want to save these old passwords in a separate column then when the users login to the new system compare the md5 ed version of that password with the old one and if the digest matches perform sha1 with a salt on that password and store that in a separate column

800574
downgrade	upgrade
if you accidentally upgrade a 1.5 working copy to 1.6 and wish to downgrade back to 1.5 use the change-svn-wc-format.py scripting

800597
constructor	object
the convenience constructor for a lot of types produce an object that is automatically autoreleased - the new object will be retained by the current nsautoreleasepool

800601
arrays	loops
or if you want to loops through each result in the arrays if there are more try

800604
macros	vba
you might want to look at using ado to query the sheet and use some vba macros to format and output the results

800633
arrays	loops
checks a 16 element arrays so it loops

800653
rewrite	rule
can someone provide an example or some guidance on how to add a rewrite rule using the built-in wordpress methods and calling my methods in the plugins which output some content

800682
hash	md5
the part of rex m s answer about using sha1 to generate a hash is a good one md5 is also a popular option

800685
hash	md5
md5 16 bytes time to hash 500mb 1462 ms

800685
hash	md5
under normal situations when you use the md5 algorithm with no malicious intent and no third party has any malicious intent would you expect any collisions meaning two arbitrary byte producing the same hash

800685
hash	md5
2 random file-names with same md5 hash with md5 sha1 sha2xx in general what are the odds for non-malicious collisions

800697
hash	md5
as long as you don t care to protect against collisions you are still safe to use md5 in an hmac as well and you do want the speed sometimes you want a slower hash then you can still use md5 confidently

800699
hash	md5
i am not an expert at this sort of thing but i keep up with the security community and a lot of people there consider the md5 hash broken

800707
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested in ie6 firefox 3.0.5 and google-chrome and they all work

800711
stderr	stdout
if you click on that you will see the stdout and stderr output of your running application

800712
execl	fork
so basically i set up a pipe and fork and then call execl

800713
python	ruby
python and ruby scripting is also an option but isn t preferred

800723
linux	bsd
in what ways is it better than either the kernel used in bsd and or linux

800734
callback	methods
it is in a callback methods docallback but i already called close on the socket

800748
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
i found myself moving from ruby-on-rails to codeigniter too and what i did with partials is basically render the partials in the view as a variable and set it from the controller

800750
value	field
for searching one of them utilize lucene and the other has a table of name value pair for searching with optimization for some more frequently used field defined by the user to be store in the same row as the xml string

800760
constructor	object
to use a casyncsocket object call its constructor then call the create function to create the underlying socket handle .

800768
uart	led
for me it was an infrared receiver point your television remote at the pic plus a couple of parts from radio shack well one part and then either blink an led to show what i received or later bit bang it out a uart

800775
implements	extends
ideally then i d extends zend_view_abstract to allow me to implements other concrete functions that we require but i don t know how to set this up

800786
dom4j	jdom
it doesn t seem like any of the normals xml libraries dom4j jdom java xml have any built-in support for this

800790
bash	zsh
i get bash when i start terminal now although i have bin zsh at terminal settings in mac

800802
daemons	systemd
since the wait systemd call is waiting on the parent daemons process it should exit

800807
apache-mina	mina
mina

800807
apache-mina	mina
mina is a network application framework which helps users develop high

800831
shutdown	restart
now on windows-xp when the user clicks the shutdown button on the start menu a dialog is displayed with various choices shutdown restart etc. while behind it the entire desktop appears to fade from color to shades of gray

800842
biblatex	bibtex
you could look at biblatex it seems to be more oriented to humanities-style citations than bibtex is

800853
required	checked
second task would be to checked what technologies are required for the project and checked if the knowledge is already available

800866
ubuntu	linux
the issue is when use the cleanlooks widget style for the vertical scrollbar it looks ok on the linux ubuntu machine where qt-4.3.3 is running

800874
sql-server	mysql
create a linked server to mysql from sql-server 2005

800929

in md5 s defense there is no known way to produce a file with an arbitrary md5 hash

800992
audio-streaming	streaming
i just developed an iphone audio-streaminging application...now it can play audio files without any problems..the problem arise when the iphone network switches from 3g to wifi and viceversa..i need to pause the streaming while network switches but i couldn t able to resume playback when network comes..can anybody point me to how to handle this situation with code

801001
semantics	keyword
it removes all duplicates value which essentially makes it semantics identical to using the distinct keyword with the exception-handling of the order of results

801067
put	get
being the one that management has put between a rock and the hard place then what you need to do is get them to buy the fastest processor and best tools that they are willing to spend based on the colorful pie charts and graphs that you are going to generate from thin air as justification

801084
put	get
it d suggest to put more than 0.5s because sometimes your lataency can get higher

801087
message	alert
in an alert message box the browser usually interpreter the object instead of simply stringifying it so the result will be different

801090
python	php
i am looking for rad like environment for php and or python free or not does not matter

801090
click	mouse
it should have a visual environment where one can use a point and click interface so that it is possible to selected objects with mouse and move them around

801092
having	select
the sqldatasource control was built to demonstrate how easy it is to bind and update an application with database data and is not intended to be used in real world applications because it kinda defeats the purpose of having a bl layer and datalayer if you are going to store select update delete insert statements in the aspx page

801095
linux	unix
how do i find all the files that were create only today and not in 24 hour period in unix linux

801106
jquery	dojo
dojo and jquery both can do this for you but in case you don t want to use a javascript library this isn t hard with just plain javascript

801106
hide	show
if you re going to use a table to display this don t try to dynamically hide or show table rows it doesn t work well

801113
authentication	login
this allows non-windows clients to login to servers which are only configured to accept windows authentication

801113
single-sign-on	credentials
if the domain parameter is present but no user name and password are provided jtds uses its native single-sign-on library and logs in with the logged windows user s credentials for this to work one would obviously need to be on windows logged into a domain and also have the sso library installed -- consult readme.sso in the distribution on how to do this

801121
wxformbuilder	wxpython
wxformbuilder can generate .xrc files for wxpython

801122
32-bit	64bit
basically single precision floating point arithmetic deals with 32-bit floating point numbers whereas double precision deals with 64bit

801127
packets	lan
when you leave the lan and depend on routers then the majority of udp problems will appear fragmentation duplicates packets delayed packets discarding of packets beyond a certain size lack of error messages being returned

801132
click	mouse
this is a browser extension which lets you record click typing and mouse movements etc like a macros

801135
dialog	pop-up
you can use jquery user-interface library to pop-up dialog box for editing

801139
entity-relationship	diagram
bear in mind that sql-sentity-relationshipventity-relationship since at least 2005 possibly earlientity-relationship has been capable of genentity-relationshipating entity-relationship entity relationship diagram from the management studio

801142
32-bit	64bit
in the usual implementation that s 32-bit for single 64bit for double

801144
xsd	xml
i have created an xml and i am having an xsd file and i have to validate the xml with this schema can i get any example for doing that

801146
32-bit	64bit
many games took advantage of the chip s 32-bit processing mode as the greater data precision available with 64bit data types is not typically required by 3d games as well as the fact that processing 64bit data uses twice as much ram cache and bandwidth thereby reducing the overall system performance

801146
32-bit	64bit
for example if a single-precision number requires 32-bit its double-precision counterpart will be 64bit long

801172
signals	sigpipe
i think you should receive the sigpipe signals when waiting on the read to complete since the other end of the pipe is closed

801177
wxpython	pyqt
this may not answer your question directly but i chose pyqt because there were no good user-interface designers for wxpython

801184
localization	translation
localization to both is similarly complex - besides getting your texts translation you ll need to make sure you don t use bold text doesn t work on either scripting and make sure any linebreaking algroithm works when words are no longer stings of letters seperated by spaces

801198
.when	ready
maybe you problem is that the flash app is not ready .when you make the call

801198
.when	ready
basically enable a javascript function that the flash movie calls .when it s ready and fully loaded

801204
32-bit	64bit
on a 32-bit processor the words are all 32-bit so doubles are 64bit

801204
32-bit	64bit
the n64 used a mips r4300i-based nec vr4300 which is a 64bit processor but the processor communicates with the rest of the system over a 32-bit wide bus

801207
keyboard	mouse
simulate mouse and keyboard input wh_journalplayback

801207
keyboard	mouse
if you try to simulate these events by sending or posting messages windows internals do not update the keyboard or mouse state which can lead to unexpected behavior

801207
keyboard	mouse
if hooks are used to play back keyboard or mouse events these events are processed exactly like real keyboard or mouse events

801224
selected	button
when you click this button a drop down menu is shown where you can selected

801245
delta	diff
of course this would mean a lot of duplicates data but managing this would be a lot easier than trying to maintain delta or diff between versions

801257
put	get
the answer that you will get here is no different from the answer in the other question put in a separate project for each separate dll

801306
freebsd	linux
tested on freebsd and linux

801313
negative-number	numeric
limits int min returns the smallest negative-number while numeric #95

801317
json	xml
we already have xml why is json better apart from being native to javascript

801322
json	xml
json is generally much smaller than its xml equivalent

801327
json	xml
json - the fat free alternative to xml

801347
hash	md5
when inserting it with a special routine which needs a csv file the password in this case the alphanumeric key is stored as a md5 hash

801371
aggregate	grouping
say we have two aggregate roots in a domain model grouping and user

801375
double	int
of course this doesn t explain the strange behaviour of numerics_limits min which could be a result of the fact that there are different min max borders for int min -2 n max 2 n-1 but not for double

801394
arrays	map
it s also worth noting that std string iterators quite often map to pointers into the underlying char arrays

801421
value	field
user id is used as primary key in your properties and a very simple concatenation of your field to store your table value

801437
contains	any
1- is gml proper for encoding geometry file cad shape .. that contains more than 100000 features what is the relation between data volume and gml performance is there any limitation

801457
sqrt	exp
lognorm.pdf x s 1 s x sqrt 2 pi exp -1 2 log x s 2

801462
methods	extend
although i think that using view helpers would be the correct zend-framework -way of doing this you can extend zend_view and implement all additional methods you d like to have - this way you don t loose the features of zend_view

801464
updating	updates
updating and installing plugins on both systems is cumbersome hence it would be nice if there was a way to sync configuration plugins and updates across the systems

801492
triggers	insert
i am trying to write a triggers on a table to avoid insert of two names which are not flagged as isdeleted

801492
triggers	insert
i though that using for keyword causes the triggers to run before the insertion but in this case the insert row is already in the table

801496
xsd	xml
how do i generate based on a xsd and c# an xml containing only the mandatory elements

801505
triggers	insert
sql-server after insert triggers doesn #39

801506
any	set
the twitter doesn t see any cookie being set

801513
contains	any
is there any need to fetch only part of a spreadsheet or query by contains data

801514
triggers	insert
if you want to simulate before triggers use instead of caveat it s not exactly what you would expect on proper before triggers if you fail to provide the necessary instead action your insert updated data could be lost ignored

801553
filesystems	fat
if you need the capabilities they also have a fat filesystems a peg graphical user-interface library usb device and host and tcp ip available for additional license fees

801558
key-value	key
other than serializing the whole thing into a blob field you probably end up with a key-value table where your key is the row and col fields

801562
webserver	host
if you have access to a webserver and can config it to accept all host headers

801562
hosts-file	hosts
makeup a fake subdomain and add it to your hosts like

801566
loading	gif
if it s just an animation could you show an animated gif on a popup and close it when loading operation is complete

801600
integer	numeric
i often find that when i need one of boost numeric conversion or boost integer i need them both

801620
compression	streaming
as the probability you mention will tend to many alternating streaming parts like 0101010 this will give you many streaming parts like 111111 which can usually be compressed better by usual compression algorithms

801622
input-field	textarea
i ve had the exact same problem with both input-field and textarea in ie7 but only if i gave them a width

801635
value	field
i need a query to generate a resultset were the columns fields are all possible tag-names name field in the tag table for a given thingid and the value are the correspondent tag value

801639
export	report
using xml publisher one can allow the user to export it on-demand but i need to have the report form pdf generated automatically

801642
internet-explorer	firefox
this works in firefox but not in internet-explorer

801656
ado	jet
it was developed with access which can be looked at as a user-interface reporting tool for ms jet since ms jet can exist without ms-access and is strongly bundled with both ms jet and ms-access nevertheless it is in the same category where ado would be in

801657
python	c++
i ve always thought that python advantages are code readibility and development speed but time and memory usage were not as good as those of c++

801657
python	c++
what does your experience tell you about python vs c++ time and memory usage

keyboard	mouse
or it could even be hooked to mouse or keyboard events so that when the user doesn t move the mouse or isn t using the keyboard the timer counts down until it reaches the log off time

801670
python	java
here is the pseudo-code which works perfectly in python and should not be difficult to convert to java my java is rusty

801671
python	c++
they show that python is up to about 400 times slower than c++ and with the exception of a single case python is more of a memory hog

801671
python	c++
my experiences with python show the same definite trend that python is on the order of between 10 and 100 times slower than c++ when doing any serious number crunching

801671
python	c++
there are many reasons for this the major ones being a python is interpreted while c++ is compiled

801671
primitive	int
b python has no primitive everything including the builtin types int float etc. are objects

801678
turing-complete	lambda-calculus
the easiest way to show that templates are turing-complete is by the church-turing thesis that is by implements either a turing machine messy and a bit pointless or the three rules app abs variables of the untyped lambda-calculus

801682
textbox	button
onde idea is that you could create usercontrols out of the standard input controls like textbox button and so forth and have them update some sort of timer object when events are invoked

801682
mousemove	keydown
probably it would be simpler to just updates the timer based on the mousemove or keydown events on the form itself

801686
python	c++
is much shorter than either its python or c++ equivalents

801699
tokenize	n-gram
option 2 use n-gram tokenize while indexing and querying

801703
click	mouse
they are the mouse coordinates of the click

801703
onsubmit	onclick
answering prashant s comment digg are adding an onclick handler to the or possibly an onsubmit handler to the form which builds the neat-looking search url and redirects the browser to that url and then returns false to prevent the from submitting the form itself

801728
put	get
i tend to put utilities into one or a few bigger assemblies but work with namespaces to get a clear structure among them

801729
any	set
note that this will be more efficient than an any solution as it will build up the set of registered user ids once as a hashset at which point the test for each user is quick

801735
order	add
i would like to do this from a button that i will add to the purchase order screen

801736
difference	count
what count more is not the slight difference in total size but the total latency of the requests

801767
firefox	gecko
force_p_newline is a gecko only option ie firefox

801783
python	c++
if i would have to write application to transform images and had to use python too all the processing could be written in c++ and connected to python via bindings while interface and process control would be definetely python

801795
primitive	int
when in doubt look at the source theres no magic in string it just uses primitive like int and char just like any other class

801797
directory	folder
how would i get the actual directory path of an iis application virtual folder using wmi

801798
any	set
code some methods on the supplier to iterate through all products and set the product s supplier to null and use this methods before deleting any suppliers

801803
appdata	temp
user appdata local temp temporary

801816
credentials	account
often this is implemented as smtp-after-pop so you ll have to provide the credentials of the mail account first via pop3

801821
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

801821
object-reference	instances
exception-handling details system.nullreferenceexception-handling object-reference not set to an instances of an object

801832
switching	screens
has anyone successfully trapped the power standby button on a wm5 device such that your code prevented users switching off even the screens

801844
contains	elements
an when i print the content of cabinets in rhs i see that it contains all elements also those that are not of class cabinet

801890
rewrite	rule
the directory i am trying to unprotect is not a real directory but a rewrite rule

801914
enterprise	platform
as a popular toolkit used by millions of windows developers especially for internal enterprise applications the mono project decided to produce a compatible implementation winforms to allow these developers to easily port their applications to run on linux and other mono platform

801914
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
in general winforms applications are written using microsoft s visual-studio or sharpdevelop which both provide a visual designer for creating winforms guis

801915
value	field
value aren t necessary for that field anymore so i changed it to not-null false but the table does not get updated in the database

801917
javascript	dom
if the page in the iframe is hosted on the same hostname as the parent page you could access the dom of the child page from the parent page using javascript

801923
http-get	get
if it still does not work let me know and i can send you my bat file that kicks of the msbuild scripting that does the svn get builds the assembly.info file deploy the web site and finally runs a http-get on the site home page just to make sure it built and deployed correctly

801945
panels	grid
if you have multiple grid or multiple panels esc can put the focus on the current grid pane as a whole

801945
panels	grid
tab and shift + tab moves focus among grid panels

801945
panels	grid
pressing esc while focus is on a whole panels grid puts focus back into the grid panels

801945
panels	grid
essentially treat grid or panels within each windows as a â œwindows in a windows.â this makes the most sense if the windowss are related in the same way that the grid within a windows are related all show data objects that are associated with each other

801945
panels	grid
if the user is in a grid then ctrl + tab moves out of the grid but remains in the windows or moves to the next grid panels in that windows

801945
panels	grid
once the user runs out of places to go within a windows ctrl + tab moves to the next windows or to the first panels grid within that windows

801975
value	field
you would have to split the value of the field at spaces and then add an in front of each arrays value then add that back as the value for the input

801976
callback	methods
however one of the api call requires a callback methods example

801978
contains	set
the table contains one text field that is 2000 characters long in db2 but is set up as a varchar 2000 in sql

801988
binary	hex
if the compiler in question is the mspgcc it should put out an assembler listing of the compiled program together with the binary hex file

801988
16-bit	8bit
somehow the 255 gets interpreted as -1 signed 8bit instead of 255 unsigned 16-bit

801988
16-bit	8bit
or it is parsing to 8bit first and then sign-extended to 16-bit

801996
code-coverage	eclemma
eclemma now has a additional component called eclemma equinox runtime that provides headless code-coverage analysis for any osgi equinox application

802000
revision	svn
if you separate this using svn revision this wouldn t be possible

802020
callback	methods
for example in the case of a callback like this you might make a c function that calls objective-c delegate methods on other objects

802029
webforms	asp.net
the data is actually input from users on webforms asp.net app

802035
cursor	row
use the for row in cursor form of a loop and the loop will just not process if there is no data

802039
digits	base
in return the client receives the same code but the digits are multiplied possibly by 2 and converted to base 36

802039
communication	messages
is it a valid way to send messages by three parties when two of them shouldn t need to communication

802063
digits	zero
but from what i can see the cause might be the fact that the expected correct last digits at this place is a zero

802063
digits	zero
my guess is theat somewhere in the calculation or visualisation code this zero is erroneously taken as a stop conditional and causes a random digits to be show at its place

802064
perl	php
un-opinionated software design is more like perl php

802071
double	int
this has the benefit that it also handles cases with mixed data types like when minvalue is an int and value is a double

802073
hide	show
i want to show hide certain parts of a view based on authentication-status or roles

802074
spring	jsf
is it some or all of the following seam ofcourse jsf ejb3 hibernate spring inversion of control container

802074
seam	jsf
jsf - essential for seam to really make sense afaict - i recommend focusing on facelets as a primary way of creating jsf pages

802074
spring	seam
seam takes care of stateful session and conversation scoped beans generally part of your presentation logic tier and spring is best for the stateless context such as interfaces to back end services such as databases and any soa clients

802074
spring	jsf
i ve found seam + jsf facelets + hibernate + spring to be quite a good combination for creating uis over jbpm and also on another project for delivering content pages though that is not really what seam is for

802084
python	c++
python isn t c++

802094
defined	declare
to freeze a freezable object declare in markup you use the freeze attributes defined in xml namespace

802109
duplicates	contains
check each row column and box such that it contains the numbers 1-9 each with no duplicates

802121
command-line	cmd
i don t mind using something else and would be very open to suggestions but just for the sake of knowledge as a zombie craves brains i thought why not inflate my own is there a cmd that allows me to check on the status of a service in cmd-line

802131
asp.net-mvc	wcf
im doing a proof of concept on wcf and asp.net-mvc

802141
methods	extend
the key is to extend and use the shared_from_this methods to get a shared_ptr to

802146
firefox	gecko
linux i686 gecko 20071127 firefox 2.0.0.11 while urllib2 â s default user agent string is python-urllib 2.6 on python 2.6

802155
filtering	sorting
sorting and filtering and wcf have nothing to do with eachother

802155
filtering	sorting
so you have to implement sorting and filtering yourself as in most cases

802191
32-bit	16-bit
with these definitions and assuming unsigned short 16-bit and int 16-bit and unsigned long 32-bit note that the size of int is important

802191
unsigned	short
but it s unnecessary as the presence of one unsigned long in the calculation will cause the other to be automatically promoted from short to long size

802192
32-bit	64bit
we have an application we re trying to deploy on both 64bit and 32-bit platforms

802199
annotations	mapping
ejb3 or rather jpa is a specification for declaring or mapping via java5 annotations and for interfaces to query them

802199
annotations	mapping
hibernate annotations would be an implementation of the mapping and hibernate entitymanager is an implementation of the query interfaces - they use the main hibernate to do their work

802199
seam	jsf
jsf is a prerequisite for using seam

802199
spring	seam
some features of seam overlap with some features of spring

802206
python	php
python and php both have a binding for gtk

802224
salt	md5
alternatively you could salt prepend some secret string your code and then calculate md5 of it

802238
command-line	cmd
running the regsvr32 from the command-line in a cmd windows throws an exception though the number at the end is different

802248
32-bit	64bit
it is a 32-bit application that detects a 64bit environment writes out another binary and deletes it on exit

802285
json	xml
there are a lot of answers here that prefer json over xml

802285
json	xml
so it might depend on what you like more json or xml

802287
32-bit	64bit
this is necessary for portability on 64bit platforms because without the l format qualifier it would assume that the supplied value is an integer typically only 32-bit long

802314
export	report
best is you can use crystal report create graph on crystal report and then export it to pdf

802318
directory	folder
instead it will use a folder under your eclipse workspace directory workspace .metadata .plugins org.eclipse.wst.server.core tmp0

802328
constructor	object
since the object is not yet fully constructed that is the base constructor was not yet run this is not available there

802330
authentication	impersonation
since my web application is setup for impersonation using windows authentication this essentially means i have to assign write permissions to a few file locations on my webserver

802333
nhibernate	ado.net
you can use whatever persistence solution you like be it linq-to-sql ado.net entities nhibernate etc

802343
xsd	xml
the nice part is that if you have an xsd for your document and you can create one through visual-studio by inferring it from one or several xml documents you can import it almost as you would a namespace and visual-studio will give you intellisense completion when writing your query

802363
value	field
that s what i see in the value field of the debugger when i stop there

802392
methods	extend
now i can extend the subsonichelper class with other methods i want to use inside the templates

802419
logfile	tail
standalone alternatives are listed in the question best tail logfile visualization freeware tool

802458
homescreen	icons
you get access to all the blackberry specific user-interface stuff - the bb keycodes special keys events better control over your app s menus touch screen stuff for the storm integration with all the components on the blackberry browser maps homescreen icons

802460
order	add
but in some cases see here and here you may have to add it to the list of known types in order for wcf to serialization everything correctly

802492
markup	xhtml
to be honest if you produce valid xhtml html5 valid css and you follow all of the usual best practices for standards-based web design no table layouts semantic markup etc dial-up really won t be an issue

802499
python	c++
i would prefer to do it in python but c or c++ is also fine

802502
seam	jsf
seam is a meta-framework that combines the ejb3 and jsf frameworks and wraps them with a form of dependency injection

802504
subtract	add
when i check in my code making the methodss alphabetical it updates the hierarchy above so that subtract becomes methods 1 and add becomes methods 0

802526
contains	any
i just returned a string from the service contains any error messages

802549
procedure	records
i was wondering if using a stored procedure with cursor would offer a performance advantage compared to reading the data into a dataset using simple selected stored-procedures and then looping through the records

802569
executable	upx
i asked a question about the con s of using upx on delphi executable here on so a while back and i got some great responses

802569
executable	upx
are there any downsides to using upx to compress a windows executable

802573
cvs	git
what is the difference between git and cvs version control systems

802573
cvs	git
i have been happily using cvs for over 10 years and now i have been told that git is much better

802576
selected	cells
selected the cells before changing their value is unnecessary and formular1c1 is superfluous aswell as you are not entering a range in the formula

802578
python	java
i couldn t find documentation on an equivalent of java s final in python is there such a thing

802586
push	pull
and these operations are by design nondestructive so you can push pull when you go grab a coffee if your central repo is lagged. another nice thing is that it comes batteries include the builtin gitk is a good enough history viewer

802592
cvs	git
git is a dvcs as opposed to cvs being a centralized one

802598
selected	button
in the properties windows click on the prerequisites button and selected whatever you like

802602
getter	setter
the simple setter getter in our example aren t too persuasive

802607
environment	building
java tm 2 runtime environment standard edition building 1.5.0_17-b04

802611
put	get
i believe if you put it inside cdata tags you ll get the whitespace

802617
protected	public
it doesn t have public and protected either except by naming convention

802620
protected	public
when you checkout the class you can specify the order that you like best alphabetical public protected private etc

802627
binary-tree	tree
i had to do this lately to print the vad tree of a windows process and i used dot language just print out nodes from your binary-tree walking function

802652
subtract	add
here s a version of add and subtract that work on any instantiation pattern

802655
scriptmanager	updatepanel
when you call scriptmanager the control parameter must be a control that is within an updatepanel that will be updated

802702
contains	set
you can set the target type to base classes that contains the properties you want and then apply that style to derived classes

802702
checkbox	textbox
for example you could create a style for control objects and then apply it to multiple types of controls button textbox checkbox etc

802705
document	editing
this was important for me because if the user was editing a document and closed the main form i did not want the edit screens to be forced closed at the same time

802739
any	set
edit to set up an async server listening to incoming connections you don t need any manualwaitevent

802740
instance-variables	local-variables
only use local-variables - the most important principle that aids in thread-safe coding is to use only local-variables not instance-variables in your action class

802745
attributes	properties
if you have multiple propertygroup tags use the one without a condition attributes the default properties

802766
any	set
is there any supported mechanism in c# that would enable me to easily parsing this into a nested set of hastables

802769
value	field
you would pretty much need to set the field value in the default constructor.

802772
pointers	stack
if the variables is automatic then you ll get the address in stack where the pointers is stored that s why you get those results

802781
uinavigationbar	uibutton
should i consider just adding a uibutton as a subview of my uinavigationbar and accomplish a right bar button effect this way

802791
perl	php
of course being a perl module you won t be able to use it directly in your php - but the source code does show a working approach which is to use an html parser

802800
unsigned	short
unsigned short min 0 max 65535

802803
web-services	webserver
better to have an automated tool like nagios checking whether your hosts webserver web-services web sites etc are up and running and emailing you when they re not

802825
equals	getter
is it possible to make the default eclipse generate hashcode and equals use getter instead of field references

802849
nested	order
i would make an auxiliary table of all integers from 1 to n see for some ways to make it with a sql-server function but since it s something you will need over and over i d make it into a real table anyway and with any sql engine it s easy to make that just once then use a nested query selected value from integers where value not in selected webordernumber from order c

802863
persistence	hibernate
ejb3 defines jpa api and hibernate can be used as persistence provider for jpa

802863
persistence	hibernate
you still need to use one of persistence providers which could be hibernate openjpa etc

802863
seam	jsf
regarding seam and portal development better question would be is how well jsf and portal work together

802863
seam	jsf
they do work together of course - here is relevant tutorial developing portlets using jsf ajax and seam

802871
udp	tcp
for example it s pretty common to deploy dns services by udp or tcp on port 53

802876
background-image	background-color
you can style your links if desired using a background-image or background-color border and other techniques so that they look like button but under the covers they should be ordinary links

802881
scala	java
i m developing mostly in java but i m planning on moving to scala

802881
scala	java
in the future i might still write some parts of the application code in java but for the tests i would prefer using scala ruby groovy or similar language with a more flexible syntax

802913
bmp	png
there are at least two decoders in hackage stb-image partial implementation of jpeg png tga bmp psd decoders with a really simple api and pngload pure haskell loader for png images

802932
csv	xml
i have a csv string that is embedded within an xml document which is necessary for a flash chart which uses xml

802960
formatting	printing
if you want to printing your string you have to pass the pointer to nslog and tell nslog that the pointer points to an nsstring which is done by the formatting rule

802960
formatting	printing
now if you just want to printing the address pointed to by str1 you still have to pass the pointer str1 but you must tell nslog that you are printinging it as an hexadecimal value using the formatting rule x

802963
javascript	dom
this javascript accesses some dom elements in the parent page the one containing the iframe

802963
hosts-file	hosts
i am currently testing this and have modified the hosts on the windows machine serving the parent page with the following entry

802973
selected	checkbox
i had to do nothing more than selected the right answer in a couple of checkbox

802992
32-bit	64bit
so basically one source file used a 32-bit and another one a 64bit size_t datatype

803018
contains	lookup
i ran a lookup test against an indexed mysql table contains 20 000 000 records and according to my results it takes 0.004 seconds to retrieve a record given an id--even when joining against another table contains 4 000 records

803019
specifications	w3c
according to the w3c specifications on html forms disabled controls arenot

803019

value of the form field in the form s

803052
implements	super
this was an after thought of the original design that was super easy to implements due to our decision to use xml xsl

803055
arrays	loops
the only way i can figure out how to do it is with two nested for loops and a mutable arrays to store the result but it does not feel very functional

803069
environment	building
msdn membership is probably the cheapest way to go and allows you to building test environment for other flavors of the os

803083
double	int
i think that this is an error caused by the limited precision above all because using double instead of int

803097
g++	gcc
the following macros are defined in my version of gcc and g++

803109
contains	elements
i m aware that there are answers on so that deal with this problem using javascript to obtain the width of a contains div elements but i wondered if a server-side solution is possible

803111
procedure	records
i ve been working on a stored procedure that checks the time then retrieves records going back over the last full 24 hour period between 8am and the previous 8am

the zip function simply combines the two sequences into one of pairs contains the elements from seq1 and the elements from seq2

803127
short	zero
is there a problem with using such a short sleep interval that it is treated as zero

803149
document	editing
to me the perfect text-editor would be something as fast and lightweight as notepad2 but with added features such as opening document in tabs and remote editing through ftp

803156
external	embed
it s the easiest way to embed inline content from an external to your host domain scripting

803170
dialog	pop-up
in my winforms application i need to pop-up a little custom dialog that stays on the screen for x amount of seconds and then disappears

803170
invokerequired	begininvoke
this of course means that i have to do the whole if invokerequired begininvoke dance which isn t really a problem

803173
sql-agent	msde
yes you can sql-agent is part of sql 2000 msde unlike sql2005 express.

803174
callback	methods
system.windows.validatevaluecallback which represents a methods used as a callback that validates the effective value of a dependency property

803181
command-prompt	cmd

803198
build-system	scons
scons is a cross-platform build-system implemented in python

803200
hide	show
add one to the pop up form and start it as soon as the form is show then hide the form on the tick event

803200
backgroundworker	winforms
in this case because you are using winforms backgroundworker is probably the best option

803202
session-cookies	cookies
i used to be one of the cookies module testers and i don t think there is any design reason this would behave differently although if you crash the session-cookiess might be designed to live on when you restart...

803216
filtering	sorting
i can then bind the ordersview along with supporting sorting and filtering to a list in wpf

803218
getter	setter
i have no property compiler directive no synthesize so no getter and no setter

803226
recvfrom	datagram
if you friend receives the udp datagram using something like the recvfrom systemd call the address parameter will receive the ip endpoint information to respond to

803228
having	select
i m having a problem with one particular row in which i can select and update the int fields but when i attempt to select or update the nvarchar fields the query runs indefinitely at least 45 minutes before i cancel

803254
value	field
now if you re really trying to find out is a particular attributes applied to a field whose value is a reference to this object then that s even harder - because you d have to know all about every object in the system

803254
value	field
you should also bear in mind that there could be two field both with the same value referencing the same object

803256
selected	listbox
bind the selected property on the container to this for listbox in this case

803277
webforms	asp.net
ps i am using asp.net 2.0 c# webforms so don t give me tips that relate to to asp mvc only

803290
contains	any
in any case the app thus contains unneeded complexity and indirection making it harder and slower to grok and make changes and enhancements to existing functionality in this case for little or no real-world benefit

803293
self-extracting	prerequisites
i want to take all of the files that are needed to deploy setup.exe whatever.msi prerequisites and package them in a single self-extracting archive

803294
basic	vba
i have a microsoft word add-in written in vba visual basic for applications that compresses a document and all of it s related contents embedded media into a zip archive

vb.net	vba
are there examples of doing this or any recommended techniques either on the client in vba or in the web service in c# vb.net

803310
lookup	any
any suggestions on how i could create a lookup table to take that into account somehow

803320
return-type	arguments
that is 1 the return-type and 2 the input arguments

803343
mta	sta
edit the background-thread is an sta thread the background-thread processing model was put in-place because i couldn t process images using wpf on a mta thread so the thread apartment model shouldn t be the culprit

803354
progress-bar	progress
the main down-side is that the progress-bar will progress in a somewhat choppy fashion

803356
configuration	installation
installation of driver configuration tools is done

i ve generally found this good enough for example for estimating the number of lines that some text will take up on a browser in order to estimate how many adverts to show next to the text

803430
firefox	opera
in terms of running debugging i use firebug on firefox and opera safari ie8 s built in javascript debuggers

803441
google-chrome	safari
if you re using a webkit based browser safari or google-chrome then you can use the web inspector

803443
groovy	java
roo - a build assistant with command-line options similar to grails for creating domain classes controllers and views but for vanilla java instead of groovy

803455
order	add
in order to implement this new feature i need to add a few new columns to existing database tables

803468
udp	tcp
would you use tcp udp for the lobby that is should users connect to server to observe the lobby or would you go for a request-response mechanism

803468
order	add
it should be easy to add more servers in order to cope with growing awdience while all the users should see one big list that consists from multiple servers

803483
implements	extends
so here you are only saying that s1 is something either object or some class extends object that implements serialization

803485
ref	out
the restrictions for a multicastdelegation are that the methods delegation signature should not have any return-value void and the keyword out and ref are not used in the signature

803492
random-seed	generator
it is possible to generator random numbers purely but you have to pass around the random-seed manually

803492
implements	abstract
you ll want to implements something less pure or use a facility like monads arrows or uniqueness value to abstract it away

803494
modifiers	final
the difference between this and your implicit super interface is that object has a number of final and protected methods and you couldn t have those modifiers in an interface

803501
linux	unix
assuming you have access to linux unix

803502
updating	updates
specifically in your case which involves a fast-acting game which is constantly updating it sounds reasonable to use a scalability server again non-blocking i o which holds a connection to each client via tcp and updates him on information he needs to know

803505
json	xml
json s a text-based object serialization format that s more lightweight than xml and that directly integrates with javascript s object model

803505
json	xml
its disadvantages compared to xml are roughly fewer available tools forget about standard validation and or transformation to say nothing of syntax highlighting or well-formedness checking in most editors less likely to be human-readable there s huge variations in the readability of both json and xml so that s a necessarily fuzzy statement tight integration with javascript makes for not-so-tight integration with other environments

803537
versioning	upgrade
edit i personally think that if the team is not able smoothly to upgrade from versioning 1.0 to 1.1 on the same time on dev - smells like bad design and mix in the responsibilities on what should be on the app layer and what on the db server

803540
user-controls	tabcontrol
how can i expose the selectedindex property of the tabcontrol to the user-controls if i want to close the tab with a button inside the user-controls instead

803544
loadrunner	qtp
you also set up other qtp and loadrunner scriptinging to run if a scripting fails

803562
contains	elements
you can use xslt to accomplish this as long as a all of the text you need to output is in elements b you only care about text nodes c you know the names of all the elements that contains text and d it s okay to emit any text in all of those output elements as cdata

803566
python	c++
is there any way to embed python allow callbacks from python to c++ allowing the pythhon code to spawn threads and avoiding deadlocks

803580
httpwebrequest	webrequest
in c# try using the webrequest webresponse or the more specialized httpwebrequest httpwebresponse classes

803581
ubuntu	linux
what tools should i look to install ubuntu linux options prefered for flex development

803583
aspect-ratio	scale
so in other words the image is always at least as big as the containers but will scale beyond it to maintain it s aspect-ratio

803591
methods	extend
you might have to create an interface iinfinity and have k extends iinfinity and iinfinity to have a methods getinfinityvalue and then wrap extend integer double bigdecimal etc in a class that implements iinfinity .

803607
buffering	capture
as described here you can set the pixel buffering attributes within the output from your qtcapturesession to change the resolution of the video being capture

803613
python	php
i don t want to install php just for fckeditor andi see fckeditor offers image uploading and image browsing through python

803643
nstextview	nswindow
__cfrunloopdoobservers | _handlewindowneedsdisplay | - nswindow displayifneeded | - nstextview

803645
droppable	draggable
edit please correct me if i m wrong but these droppable all require a draggable to be dropped at it right

803657
lookup	any
i agree with mcwafflestix best way to learn any programming language is to just jump in to a project and lookup things as you need them

803666
document	element
document type does not allow element

803700
python	ruby
a common setup at least in the ruby and python web world is to run nginx in front of lighttpd or apache

803700
webserver	nginx
nginx serves all static media and proxies dynamic request to the webserver behind it

803701
ubuntu	linux
to clarify i am running my tests under linux ubuntu 7.10

803714
debian	linux
if you are running debian ubuntu or possibly other gnu linux distros there should be examples of this type of completion in your etc bash_completion.d directory

803719
put	get
that said i was able to put together a decent flex-building environment using emacs and some third-party packages to get everything running under linux

803725
any	set
is there any way to also set a value to something which will render as a tooltip or alt text

803741
constructor	object
the way i do it is i basically have a viewmodel for an entity that takes the entity as constructor parameter basically a wrapper object

803748
c++	lua
i d like to pass to a function expecting a c++ object of a pure virtual class a lua object of a class that derives from the pure virtual c++ class

803797
windows-server	windows
the functions that an x11 windows manager would perform are split between the gui toolkit carbon cocoa the dock application and the windows-server

803851
actionscript	mxml
it uses actionscript mxml as its underlying languages

803855
windows-xp	windows
if you ve got a technet msdn subscription you could download the public rc1 of windows 7 beginning april 30th which as i ve heard contains a copy of windows-xp with ie6 licensed for virtual machine use

803856
loading	png
in the original versioning i used png format for saving to avoid quality loss from loading and saving jpeg multiple times

803859
value	field
to set the value of the field and then

803865
forwarding	port
in which case you should also configure port forwarding to the correct internal server and make sure that server s ip does not change dynamically

803874
xsd	xml
the xml file contains some dates and times using the xsd datetime format something like that 2009-04-29t12 00 00z

803883
contains	elements
the difference is that after the two my statements _ only contains 6 elements in this variation whereas in the single my version it still contains 7 elements

803887
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome don t support onbeforeunload and onunload seems to be too late

803887
google-chrome	safari
is there some way to replicate the same functionality in safari google-chrome

803888
associations	model
url contents view chapter model section associations

803905
mapping	unique
and if so how to overcome the above problems fk join unique id across multiple tables and mapping

803917
push	pull
out of the blue i can t push or clone or pull with git

803921
silverlight	xbap
not xbap or silverlight

803926
buffering	streaming
if on the other hand you do the buffering yourself there s no way the caller can go back to a streaming model

803935
selected	listbox
instead the textbox is bound to a property on the view model which can get and set the value for the currently selected key which is updated by binding the selecteditem property of the listbox to another property on the view model

803940
hide	show
now i want to have a jquery code that show only 3 items after each header and hide the rest to make the list shorter and more usable

803956
windows-xp	windows
on 32-bit windows-xp or windows server

803963
udp	tcp
blocking certain networks have protocol priorities so your udp packets may be dropped in favor of allowing tcp traffic through

803965
put	get
makes perfect sense to me so i took the components nodes out of the .wxs file and put them in a separate file but when i attempt to compile the project in visual-studio 2008 i get an error for each componentref stating it s an unresolved reference to symbol ... in section product ...

803980
updating	updates
i have created an n-tier solution where i am retrieving related data from a wcf service updating it within a windows forms application and then returning the updates data via wcf to be persisted to the database

803980
updating	updates
the updates being applied by the client application can as well as updating existing content also insert additional track objects

803982
stderr	stdout
also interesting was that i could not for the life of me capture stdout or stderr correctly with any of the freopen or dup2 tricks

803985
response	timeout
this has the advantage that you can easily log the requests and response and alter them send back timeout errors bad data and the like

804005
installation	upgrade
our installation was an in place upgrade from sps2003 so the database names and ssps were a little goofy

804013
google-chrome	safari
this works perfectly for me in both google-chrome and safari

804022
contains	elements
if an elements spans a fixed cell and an auto cell then the fixed cell s width will increase to the minimum that can contains the whole object

804023
safari	opera
however in opera and safari for windows i am confronted with the following big-nasty-exception

804037
cross-compiling	cmake
the alternative is to use cmake s cross-compiling support

804037
toolchain	cmake
and then when you run cmake set the cmake_toolchain_file variables to the name of your toolchain file

804040
zend-framework	phpunit
if you re looking for a simple introduction to using phpunit and zend_test with the zend-framework i wrote a simple tutorial that covers the basic of setting up phpunit and writing a few simple tests both with phpunit and zend_test

804047
contains	elements
when a unique id is not possible try to wrap common elementss with some html elements that has a unique identifier and then use selenium s xpath tareting abilities to say click the link that contains the text signup that s in the div with the id of foo or click the third link in the div with the id of foo

804050
loading	png
it supports web-formats for images like jpg and png but also supports game-industry style dds textures that are far more optimized for loading into video-card ram

804067
rollback	commit
when this limit is met will the stored proc commit or rollback the statements executed for the current token

804085
priority-queue	linked-list
abstractqueue arrayblockingqueue arraydeque concurrentlinkedqueue delayqueue linkedblockingqueue linkedblockingdeque linked-list priorityblockingqueue priority-queue synchronousqueue

804109
selected	listbox
there s a listbox on the lefthandside where the user can selected a person and the person s information is shown on the righthandside where he can also make changes to it

804117
selected	button
with button for adding users editing the selected user s properties or deleting the selected user

804121
document	element
document type does not allow element span here

804128
factorization	number-theory
in number-theory integer factorization is the breaking down of a composite number into smaller non-trivial divisors which when multiplied together equals the original integer

804129
implements	extends
to answer the core question your own interface that implements a public clone as mmyers wrote and require that c extends that as well

804130
http	ssl
suppose that moments after ssl connection is established client surfs to some other url and shortly there after it again requests via http the original page one with which it has ssl connection established

804134
getter	setter
this looks reasonable but if neither the setter nor the getter uses autorelease the go on to do something part will likely crash because oldvalue has now been deallocated assuming nobody else had retained it

804147
contains	elements
the blockquote tag can only contains block elements such as p h1..n ol ul pre dl div noscript blockquote form hr table fieldset address

804153
triggers	insert
triggers insert update delete how and why

804184
boost	stl
i believe this is one of the parts of boost that is going to be included in the next version of c++ at which time it will become part of the stl but right now it s a free 3rd-party library

804188
contains	elements
see the xhtml reference here - if the scripting elements contains embedded scripting and that scripting contains xhtml markup characters such as and then the scripting should be enclosed in cdata

804194
duplicates	elements
i can get the designer to render the css if i include a link elements in the control itself but then i have duplicates link elementss scattered throughout my pages

804194
duplicates	elements
is there any way to get the designer to play nice with my css in a web control without injecting duplicates link elements everywhere

804196
ref	out
there are a number of questions already on the definition of ref and out parameter but they seem like bad design

804209
queue	fifo
if you click on use you will also find collections.aslifoqueue deque is already a queue but it is fifo rather than a stack

804212
ref	out
i do think that it still makes sense like mentioned above in the case where you need to return some kind of error code from a function as well as a return-value but nothing else so a bigger type isn t really justified. if i were doing this all over the place in a project i would probably define some generic wrapper type for thing-plus-error-code but in any given instances ref and out are ok

804236
ref	out
out trumps ref in this case

804240
ref	out
p invoke is the only place i can really think of a spot where you must use ref or out

804247
subtyping	generics
i can t cast a supertype to a subtyping when cyclic generics type

804254
safari	opera
the background-size property is only supported in newer versions of safari and opera

804254
firefox	opera
using this code will cause the image to stretch in css3 enabled browsers newest opera safari and possibly firefox

804265
selected	textbox
basically the issue is i have a flash movie which contains a textbox and if the user clicks in the textbox and drags to select highlight text and they drag outside the flash movie and release the mouse then the flash move doesn t receive the mouse release event and even though the mouse is up moving the cursor around the page continues to change the selected text within the flash

804284
any	set
i m attempting to set up basic logging to the windows event log in .net via system.diagnostics.eventlog but i m failing to see any events actually getting written to the log

804304
c++	lua
you would have to create a c++ class which implements your pure virtual function then calls the lua code

804304
c++	lua
in general i prefer to use swig when wrapping my c++ for exposure to lua and other scripted languages

804304
perl	ruby
java c# ruby perl and python do all have directors support in swig

804311
getter	setter
i changed the supportticketcategory property to old school getter and setter and it worked...syntax sugar for loss

804344
bar-chart	charts
so although the charts itself is a error bar-charts each of the series can be changed to whatever bar-charts needed

804357
specifications	w3c
i believe this is the rationale for the target attributes being removed by the w3c from the xhtml 1.1 specifications

804358
multiplication	division
the binding class has events called format and parsing which you can use to perform the division the format event takes a value from the trackbar and formats it for the textbox and the multiplication the parsing event takes a value from the textbox and scale it for the trackbar

804366
.when	ready
to summarize it works and is the best solution .when necessary like in the wp-supercache plugins but slows down overall speeds because your content isn t allowed to be sent to the browser as its ready but instead has to wait for the full document to be rendering for ob_end before it can be processed by you and sent to the browser

804369
webforms	asp.net
this is assuming that you re using asp.net webforms of course

804374
put	get
i want to get all mouse clicks on my application but i don t want to put a listener in every child component neither use windows mouse hook

804374
put	get
on flash i could put a listener on stage to get all the mouseevents on the movie

804385
paradox	dbase
back in those days the desktop database market was dominated by dbase and its variants and paradox

804385
ado	jet
oledb was the answer for this with ado as the interface layer on top of oledb just as dao is the interface layer on top of jet

804385
ado	jet
while the goal of dao was to provide access to lots of data stores via the jet database engine oledb was a more neutral data interface layer like odbc a database abstraction layer and ado was the interface to that neutral data interface layer

804385
ado	jet
by 1999 when ms introduced access 2000 with the new versioning of jet 4.0 ms wanted to retire dao in favor of ado

804385
ado	jet
ms made ado the default data interface layer in access even when it made no sense to use ado your data store was jet

804385
ado	jet
as part of this effort ms did not fully updates dao to incorporate support for all the new features of jet 4 -- instead they put their efforts on this front into ado

804385
ado	jet
the result was that jet s native data interface layer dao lacked support for jet features that the database neutral interface layer ado offered

804385
data-access	ado.net
the resemblences between ado and ado.net are quite superficial and are based on completely different models of data interaction with ado.net being almost entirely designed around the idea of disconnected data while ado was not though it certainly supported certain kinds of disconnected data-access

804385
ado	jet
unfortunately while ms was now deprecating ado for use with jet they didn t choose to fix the crippled versioning of dao that went with it

804385
ado	jet
but outside of access the only way to use this ansi-92 sql mode is to use ado to connect to jet

804391
c++	lua
you basically provide a simple c++ wrapper to the luabind class that acts as a pass through to the underlying lua implementation

804399
arrays	loops
i need to loops lot of arrays in different ways and display it in a page

804403
mousemove	mouseup
this means referring to the win32 documention on wm _lbuttondown wm _mousemove wm _lbuttonup etc instead of the conventional mousedown mousemove and mouseup events

804404
typedef	struct
in that hypothetical code windows is actually a typedef for a pointer to struct

804414
filtering	sorting
extendedbindinglist is just something simple i threw together to implement sorting and filtering and some basic state persistence

804439
ref	out
parameters passed with out - is just like ref - passed by reference

804454
message	alert
is there a way to stop the message after i click dismiss the alert

804459
form-submit	onsubmit
the way it currently works is that the ajax.beginform helper class generates a form tag with an onsubmit function to intercept the form-submit event

804505
show	next
cryptanalysis of the winapi guid has show given the initial state one can predict up to next 250 000 guids returned by the function uuidcreate

804508
meta-inf	jar
this will create a directory called meta-inf in the jar archive

804512
ethernet	packets
is there some way to get the frame check sequences fcs from an ethernet frame when using wireshark to capture packets under linux

804518
keyboard	mouse
save as uses the actual href value whereas selected the link otherwise can be intercepted keyboard mouse down and up click to set the location to something else

804521
base-class	inherited
another way would be to have a customer class and 3 other classed such as businesscustomer privatecustomer and corporatecustomer inherited from the base-class

804528
export	csv
i would like to know how i can either import the data correctly or export the data to a csv file in a way that can be imported directly

804546
implements	abstract
just go for the three classes implements some abstract customer interface

804560
verilog	hdl
hdl s like verilog and vhdl really seem to encourage spaghetti code

804560
verilog	vhdl
most modules consist of several always verilog or process vhdl blocks that can be in any order

804562
debugging	trace
in addition if some poor sod comes along and has to debugging the whole thing afterwards it s going to be far easier for him to trace through what s happening where

804582
arrays	loops
since they are arrays of words then you should multiply by 4 assuming 32 bit words the loops control variable classical i variable in c to index the vector

804587
office-app	vsto
i am designing a shared add-in using vb.net 2008 and vsto that has to fire up when any ms office-app is started

804588
constructor	object
as long as the form is created for a particular type of customer and the customer won t change to a different type of customer during the lifetime of the form you could just pass your customer object that stores all of the actual customer data to the viewmodel s constructor and then pass your viewmodel to your form s constructor

804589
any	set
static initializers can be used to set the value of any static variables in a class which should be more efficient than having an if somestaticvar null do stuff block of code at the start of each constructor

804589
any	set
both of these cases assume that the code required to set these variablesiabless is more complex than simply variables value as otherwise there wouldn t seem to be any reason to use an initializer instead of simply setting the value when declaring the variablesiables

804589
constructor	private
even if all constructors for a class share a large amount of code the use of a private initialize function seems to make more sense to me than using an initializer because it doesn t lock you into having that code run when writing a new constructor

804603
tcp-ip	udp
i m looking for a way to efficiently send receive messages over a tcp-ip or udp socket stream connection

804603
json	xml
i m not looking for something that can be sent over an http web service like json or xml marshalled objects

804631
floor	ceil
you can force rounding in a specific directions by using floor or ceil

804646
double-quotes	single-quotes
there are a few caveats to using sed in windows you have to use double-quotes instead of single-quotes you can t escape the double-quotes in the string directly you have to endquote the string escape using the so then beqin quote for the next section

804648
nested	order
in order to gain access to the private-members of the form you would need to declare the uiimplementation classes as nested within the customerform class

804676
authentication	login
is it a good idea to use a hardware token as a sufficient means for authentication to login to a machine containing sensitive data

804686
defined	declare
for the other function-calls their respective declarations are all found too because they are all declare in the global namespace in which the arguments types of the function-calls are defined too myclass1 myclass2 etc

804687
pointers	stack
once the gettopgene function ends that stack is destroyed so you shouldnâ t use pointers to that part of memory

804692
ruby	php
basically there are lots of platforms out there that are web-oriented including php python django ruby and even java or c# asp.net

804695
malloc	free
you should allocate the data on the heap with malloc and explicitly free it with free

804699
pointers	stack
your function says it returns a pointers so when your function is called only space for a pointers is allocated on stack for the return value

804699
pointers	stack
therefore your return value is a pointers that points to a place on stack that will be invalid when your function exits

804702
base-class	inherited
i want to create behavior classes or strategy classes that inherited from an abstract base-class or classes

804709
linux	unix
you know unix linux etc

804710
emacs	vim
the advantage of knowing emacs or textmate or vim my personal preference or any generic editor is that the skills you acquire in that editor apply regardless of what platform you re writing for

804713
expression	evaluation
in order to evaluate any properties or methods calls you have to force evaluation by enclosing the expression in

804721
oracle	mysql
in most cases i am used to work with windows some weeks ago i started to work with oracle i have experience with other dbms like sql and mysql and i have worked with them in windows

804721
ubuntu	linux
i want to know if oracle enterprise linux is the only one linux os where oracle can be installed or we can install oracle even in redhat ubuntu etc

804731
copy-constructor	constructor
for the details look up 1 conversion constructor 2 the explicit keyword and 3 copy-constructor and destructive copy semantics

804736
linux	unix
they are split pretty much 50 50 between windows servers and nix unix or linux

804738
oracle-xe	oracle
the other thing i ll mention is that unless you need the full-blown oracle just stick with oracle-xe express edition

804738
linux	unix
for high end platforms linux unix tends to be preferred over windows but that s probably not an issue for you

804738
oracle-xe	oracle
if you re just developing and aren t yet comfortable with oracle make it as easy on yourself as possible and stick with windows and oracle-xe

804738
solaris	linux
this applies equally well to oracle where every oracle installation i ve ever used has been on solaris or a linux variant primarily red hat but also ubuntu

804744
windows-vista	windows
use a compositing windows manager compiz on linux windowss-vista and mac os probably have analogs

804747
linux	unix
unix linux on the other hand doesn t seem to have those issues according to our dba

804751
implements	abstract
from my brief research all of them typically implements your standard crud methods and abstract away the database-specific details

804755
boolean	int
a boolean isselected property a property called length which returns a timespan and a rating property which is a short int

804769
multiplication	addition
you can do it in 3 lines using basic math - in my example i used multiplication but simple addition would work also

804777
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop i is used for going through an arrays

804778
innodb	myisam
if you start a transaction add or modify data in some innodb tables add or modify data in a myisam table and then you have to rollback your myisam change cannot be removed

804790
handler	service
not really - ms didn t make the tcp ip connection handler to talk to non-wcf services they assumed you d write a web service to do that

804797
service-layer	crud
i like to abstract crud functionality out into a service-layer that any object may call upon and have a base object class from which i can extend any objects needing crud

804798
dictionary	arrays
django does not provide a way to get associative arrays dictionary in python from the request object

804798
key-value	key
as the first answer pointed out you can use .getlist as needed or write a function that can take a querydict and reorganize it to your liking pulling out key-value pairs if the key matches some pattern for example

804813
unsigned	zero
in that case because i is unsigned it will always be greater than or equal to zero

804813
unsigned	zero
when you decrement an unsigned variables that is equal to zero it will wrap around to a very large number

804829
beautifulsoup	lxml
lxml is supposed to be much faster and efficient and can do much more than beautifulsoup

804833
executable	jar
as suggested earlier too you can look at launch4j to create the executable for your jar file

804856
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
you should rather look out for in-memory implementation of outputstreams inputstream such as bytearrayoutputstream with its tobytearray methods or the bytearrayinputstream with the byte constructor

804860
javascript	dom
this is because json can be directly evaluated into a javascript object which is much easier to work with than the dom

804860
json	xml
borrowing and slightly altering the xml and json from above

804860
children	nodes
all the above examples ignore the possibility that one or more nodess are available duplicated or the possibility that the nodes has just one or no children

calloc	malloc
calloc is like malloc but initializes the allocated memory with a constant 0

807949
constructor	object
new initializes the allocated memory by calling the constructor if it s an object

807963
malloc	free
malloc only allocates some memory free deletes memory allocated by malloc

807963
calloc	malloc
calloc does the same thing as malloc and also zeroizes the newly allocated memory

807963
malloc	free
as other posts have pointed out malloc free is part of c++ to be compatible with c

807965
tuples	set
this isn t about sorting but if your using tuples coordinates you may want to use a set instead of a list

807966
realloc	malloc
the main difference between new and malloc i can recall is that you cannot reallocate memory allocated by new using realloc

807966
calloc	malloc
calloc allows you to initialize the memory block you allocate while malloc does not

807969
constructor	object
when you new an object space for the object is not only allocated but the object s constructor is called

807969
calloc	malloc
calloc is the same as malloc except for it clears memory to all bits zero

807970

malloc free + family

807970
malloc	free
malloc free family is the c way to allocate and free memory from the heap

807970

calloc is the same as malloc but also initializes the memory

807970
malloc	free
data cannot be allocated with malloc and free with delete nor delete

807979
binary-tree	tree
as a follow up question related to my question regarding efficient way of storing huffman tree s i was wondering what would be the fastest and most efficient way of searching a binary-tree based on the huffman coding output and storing the path taken to a particular node

807979
put	get
the above is a breadth first search which is considered the best for huffman trees since items that are in the source more often are higher up in the tree to get better compression however i can t figure out a good way to keep track of how we got to a particular node without backtracking using the head pointer i put in the node

807991
ienumerator	ienumerable
i cannot come up with an implementation of ienumerable that would not be able to supply an efficiently cloneable ienumerator vectors linked lists etc

808006

808148
calloc	malloc
what is the difference between new and malloc and calloc in c++

808159
malloc	free
the only reason to do so that i can think of would be a poorly constructed api which expected you to pass in malloc d memory because it would be doing the free

808167
malloc	free
if the memory is to be released by free in your or someone elses code it s pretty darn required to use malloc

808188
web-services	security
i have an app that creates a security token to use remote web-services

try cvs svn or even something paid like perforce

808207
revision	svn
i d like to have a particular version-controlled file always be clobbered by the head revision when i do an svn update instead of manually having to resolve it every time i update

808208
required	checked
required comments when you checked in code it s great if you can tie commits back to your bug tracker

808214
hyperlink	embed
my other option is to provide a hyperlink inside the vb6 application that will open the asp.net app.....but i would prefer to embed the asp.net app within a tab control in vb6 if at all possible

808221
click	mouse
then you can mouse over the available styles selected the dropdown arrow click modify.

808223
python	c++
also c++ python similarly

808229
32-bit	64bit
another remote option is that you have some 32-64bit conflict where regsvr32 is run in 32-bit and dcomcnfg in 64bit or vice versa

808242
configuration	environment
boost program_options provides unified and cross platform support for configuration from command line environment variables and configuration files

808247
dictionary	map
i d use some type of a map dictionary maybe and keep track of the insertion order yourself as the actual data

808252
contains	any
i would like to modify this code so that if column g contains â œlast termâ and column k contains â œokayâ and â œendâ or â œokayâ and â œstayâ in any combination or in any order possibly with other words in between before or behind them as long as these two different combinations are present then 07a will be entered into column i in the same row

808279
debugging	exit
printing debugging output at the entry exit of each routine and using stack dumps can be helpful to see how you got some place

808307
jquery	dojo
try using javascript framework like dojo or jquery

808314
linux	uname
for linux - by checking uname -m -p x86_64

808326
contains	any
there s the old joke that any sufficiently sophisticated system written in a statically-typed language contains an incomplete inferior implementation of lisp

808326
reflection	runtime
in c# i ve found problems that couldn t be solved without reflection because of information i didn t have until runtime

808326
reflection	runtime
one example when trying to manipulate some third-party code that generated proxies to silverlight objects running in another process i had to use reflection to invoke a specific strongly-typed generic version of a methods because the marshalling required the caller to make an assumption about the type of the object in the other process was in order to extract the data we needed from it and c# doesn t allow the type of the generic methods invocation to be specified at runtime except with reflection techniques

808328
highlight	selected
the problem comes when the user submits the form with errors the form is returned with all the form fields re-populated and the errors highlight -- except for the frequency selected field -- whose options are dynamically generated

808342
extends	sealed
this pattern would also be useful in the event that you want to extends a 3rd party s picturebox that is sealed in which case you would not be abel to extends from it

808348
getter	setter
for some reason in other types of programming languages like java i have no problem with using setter and getter for every single variables but when i m programming in php probably because it is so flexible it feels kind of like a waste of time

808348
getter	setter
is it really that wrong not using setter and getter

808355
implements	extends
try extends picturebox to implements your interface

808360
any	set
when any item is to be inserted into the set check to see if it is in the hash table and optionally replace the item in there if such an item is in it

808361
implements	sealed
if the class you re interested in creating an interface for is not sealed then your could create a new class and inherited from the non-sealed class implements the interface

808361
implements	sealed
if it were sealed and i don t think picturebox is you d probably want to build a wrapper class that implements the interface that you re interested in and contains a picturebox control exposing only the members that you re interested in

808365
getter	setter
the point of getter or setter is that you can still add logic to your modifications of the field in one place instead of everyplace you want to modify or retrieve the field

808366
solution-explorer	assemblyinfo
something you can try to fix the issues is to add the following to your assemblyinfo under project properties in solution-explorer

808369
filtering	sorting
this means we re limiting the functionality a fair bit no drill down sorting advanced filtering and only one table worth of data

808378
children	nodes
i would selected a nodes has has minoccurs 0 maxoccurs unbounded for one of its children

808378
children	nodes
next when they try to add children to the account nodes and the choices would be name nodes required password nodes required settings nodes optional etc

808378
children	nodes
how do i determine programmatically what children the account nodes has available to it and what the attributes and settings are on those children

808378
xsd	xml
in my naivety i had hope that since xsd was xml in itself there would be some sort of dom model that i could traverse through

808384
derived-class	base-class
i don t mean dynamic casting in the sense of casting a lower interface or base-class to a more derived-class i mean taking an interface definition that i ve created and then dynamically casting to that interface a different object not derived from that interface but supporting all the calls

808399
subclass	accessor
the main problem with not using property accessor is that if you find out you ever need to change a field to a property later on â to make it a computed property in a subclass for instance â youâ ll break clients of your api

808399
getter	setter
this arguably makes using getter and setter mechanically fairly easy

808402
graphviz	doxygen
you can get similar class diagrams by using graphviz which can be integrated with doxygen pretty easily even for non-object oriented code

808403
derived-class	base-class
but to me it makes sense to specialize a base-class s primary member templates in the derived-class because that is what derived-classes do - specialize things in the base-class

808409
contains	set
when you create an object how do you set the objects properties to contains the data in the database

808413
attributes	properties
is there a way to have an ant fileset- includesfile attributes take a properties file or any other file that contains a list of java class files to exclude

808423
getter	setter
if you access these variables in your scripting lots of time and if you updates yoru class often you should use setter and getter because but if you dont this when you improve your class you have to updates all files which uses this variables

808424
arrays	loops
so links would be an arrays then you can loops through it and append the text to its href

808440
arguments	default
the default model binder only binds posted form value to arguments of the action methods

808459
json	xml
they often utilize json or xml but there are some other approaches as well

808470
calloc	free
you are free to write a wrapper over new or even use calloc but most of the time for non-pod objects this doesn t make much sense

808475
select	union
i have tried using union and other select statements but i am still unable to get a proper result

808475
select	union
do i need to use two select statements or is there another way to handle it with join or union

808476
children	nodes
is there a simple way by which i could move nodes y from x to b such that z1 and z2 continue to remain children of y

808481
constructor	object
they re set by the constructor but they re read-only not private accessors and cannot be changed once the object is created

808487
response	timeout
i m interested in being able to set a timeout with the stubs so that in case the web-services server does not reply within x seconds the application isn t setting there forever waiting for a response

808487
implements	extends
the port class i am instantiating extends com.sun.xml.rpc.client.stubbase and implements javax.xml.rpc.stub and com.sun.xml.rpc.spi.runtime.stubbase

808487
any	set
does anyone have any ideas on how to set enforce a timeout when using a jaxrpc-ri client

808489
any	set
i must have set something up wrong any ideas

808490
getter	setter
i am probably not going to get many upvotes on this one but personally getter and even more so setter feel like a code smell to me

808490
getter	setter
but yes property like getter and setter are a step up from a dependency on a field directly for this very reason

808507
decimal-point	digits
the digits before the decimal-point represent the date

808507
decimal-point	digits
the digits after the decimal-point represent the time

808521
web-deployment	web
what you need to do is add the web-deployment project and set it up so it will grab all the files from the website compile them and using something like wix you can create an installer for the files to be able to easily deploy your web site and all its files needed to a customer s computer

808523
uibutton	uiview
well you can place your uibutton inside a transparent and slightly bigger uiview and then catch the touch events on the uiview instance as in the uibutton

808523
selected	button
you will manually have to deal with selected highlighted states con the button if the user touches the view instead of the button

808530
persistence	hibernate
i m trying to write a simple web app with spring 2.5 core + asp.net-mvc and jpa using hibernate for the persistence mechanism

808534
traversal	parent
it will not automatically traversal your project-structure when you re only building a single module because it s not required that you even have the parent project on your computer much less one directory above the current module

808558
return-value	arguments
if so i believe all those int values that are actually hwnds first arguments to send post return-value from findwindow need to be intptr

808560
ping	lan
ping a host - since the product will be within a lan using an unknown network configuration and unknown hosts

808569
highlight	selected
code already exists within the selectedindexchanged event to highlight the selected item

808569
keyboard	mouse
i should mention that the selectedindexchanged event fires properly on when an item is selected via keyboard or mouse input

808626
syntax-highlighting	gedit
for linux gedit has syntax-highlighting

808626
emacs	vim
of course vim and emacs is available for everything

808630
glib	gtk
you could have your glib mainloop receive the events then dispatch it to gtk main

808631
database-table	mysql
copying the message into a mysql database-table that s associated with that contact

808648
contains	elements
in this case if you can modify the app and the table structure separate the date and time into two separate datetime columns or create a indexed view that selected all the relevant columns of the source table and a further column that contains the time elements you wish to search for use any of the previous answers to compute this - and alter the app to query the view instead

808659
textbox	button
let s say you have your form and you add a textbox and a button

808667
firefox	safari
also besides the firefox extensions you have the safaritidy plugin for safari which will check all your tags

808688
safari	opera
someone claimed yesterday the opera and safari do their own thing and don t give the required permission to untrusted code

808693
put	get
i would suggest rather then arguing against it being installed suggest that they put in place the correct exclusion rules so databases and processes which are extremelly unlikely to get viruses aren t scanned

808695
terminate	timeout
i think you can t get round the race condition whereby the wait timeout and then process terminate just before you call destroy

808701
ironpython	ironruby
and here is a page dedicated to an example answering your very question albeit in a generic dlr-centric way -- this would allow you to host ironpython ironruby or whatever dlr languages you want to support

808701
installation	environment
i ve used these examples in the past to create an ironpython environment inside a private installation of screwturn wiki - it allowed me to create very expressive wiki templates and proved to be very useful in general

808704
derived-class	base-class
extending the logic to the templates specializations when you try to specialize an inner class declared in base-class through an inner class in derived-class you actually are trying to define a different type with the same name but another naming scope

808712
arrays	map
you can map binary data using the binary type which equates to a byte arrays in code and a varbinary in the database

808715
modal-dialog	blockui
you can do this by displaying a div if you want to do it in a modal manner you could use blockui - or one of the many other modal-dialog plugins out there prior to the request then just waiting until the callback succeeds as a quick example you can you getjson as follows you might want to use .ajax if you want to add proper error-handling

808732
callback	methods
if you use async methods and callback your program will use less memory 1mb per thread and won t need to do context switches of threads nearly as much

808748
jsonp	ajax
if there anyway allows ajax between two own domains without proxy hacking jsonp flash or browser security changes

808761
shell	bash
p.s another way is to practice by writing shells - shell scripts bash csh or sh are highly simplified scripting languages

808763
insertion-sort	stable-sort
ie if you did an insertion-sort with index cards you would most likely have a stable-sort

808764
iteration	set
you will have to set the time you sleep during each iteration based on how important it is that you catch the job quickly after it s complete

808770
parentheses	let
let s consider the language of balanced parentheses meaning symbols and and including all strings that are balanced in the usual meaning and none that aren t

808781
xsd	xml
it ll make a dummy xml from xsd or vice versa

808786
python	c++
you can call a python module from c++ by bascially calling the python intepreter and have it execute the python source

808801
click	mouse
i m trying to use hot spots in c# to detect a mouse click on a betting table

808809
show	next
the next column b1 b1000 has a logic mask if a1 0 1 0 where if the value in the a cell is 0 then the b cell show a 1

808809
algebra	formula
is there a way to to algebra in a cell formula to reference a cell

808815
instance-variables	class-variables
the instance of the class contains all kinds of information that it seems to me does not need to be in the database - methods class-variables instance-variables - we write that stuff in our source code and we don t need to reproduce it in the database - we only need certain relevant data that the class is operating on to be stored

808837
sql-server	oracle
the google datastore is not a standard relational database like sql-server or oracle

808837
private-members	object
i don t think private-members or methods are stored along with the data so it s not like the entire object including methods is serialized into the datastore

808850
hide	show
so when javascript was first released a technique was needed to hide the code from older browsers so they wouldn t show it as text in the page

808859
revision	svn
i know i can use svn log with the --xml option to get the proper encoding but i need this for a pre-commit hook and svn.exe can only get information from revision not transactions

808862
uibutton	uiview
what you might want to do is override the touchesbegan withevent methods of the uiview that contains your uibutton and uilabel subviews

808862
cgpoint	cgrect
that is does the cgpoint element intersect with with the cgrect element

808866
python	perl
perhaps you want the answer to how can i read perl data structures from python

808877
git-repo	repo
i have a local git-repo which i recently made a commit to then pushed to a shared repo

808878
databound	gridview
would the performance characteristics be generalizable to all databound controls would it be different for a menu versus a gridview

808889
glut	sdl
i have never used glut but i know that many people will say sdl is better

808901
background-image	transparency
one thing that comes to mind is strategically placing layers with background-image set and layers with solid color on top of each other and on hover animation the opacity property of the right thing if the thing on top becomes transparency the thing on bottom comes through

808908
any	set
does anyone know a way to set the focus to a file input or any other text-type input on page load without access to the body tag

808922
order	add
in your order by add

808927
margins	padding
one such thing is to use padding rather than margins because ie doesn t handle margins collapsing correctly

808927
display	height
that could be things like specifying a height for an element that normally shouldn t need one or specifying display inline on a floating element

808928
order	add
just add binary to your order by

808929
defined	declare
if ds was defined in the code-behind for it to be available in the .aspx side of things you must declare it as protected rather than private

808932
google-chrome	firefox
are not longer really that much in use i try to use features which work in all those browsers firefox 2 ie 7 google-chrome opera

808939
double	int
by flat i mean the most complex property you can have in a business object is a string and a number int decimal double

808951
administration	account
here are a few other commands that are useful for user account administration

808955
linux	unix
linux and indeed unix gives you a third option

808955
linux	unix
only available under linux unix this is a bit different

808963
subtract	add
i am looking for a function that will add or subtract a distance from a longitude or latitude value

windows-server	windows
install the windows support tools that is on the windows-server cd cd 1 if it s windows 2003 r2

809016
dialog	pop-up
when the input file get focus it should be read only or the browser should pop-up a dialog to choose some file

809019
contains	elements
the elements property will contains a collection of the top level elements

809019
attributes	properties
use the xmlschemacomplextype s attributes properties to get attributess or contentmodel to get simple content complex content or particle to get sequence choice all

809065
express-checkout	paypal
paypal has a number of checkout types i have some decent experience with express-checkout so i will try to answer with an example of those calls

809079
sql-server	oracle
i have now checked the following in sql-server i would epxect the same outcome in oracle and it returns the cid for the c record with the maximum creationtime where the status for the related record in a id ok

809079
sql-server	oracle
in response to your comment about each of the statements giving different results i have ran some of the different answers here through sql-server 2005 using my test data above i appreciate you are using oracle

809108
specifications	w3c
element.click is a standard methods outlined by the w3c dom specifications

809108
firefox	gecko
mozilla s gecko firefox follows the standard and only allows this method to be called on input elements

809125
delphi	basic
since named pipes are a basic core feature of windows nt xp vista delphi should be able to communicate with those no problem reading + writing

809133
void	main
you could use your static void main string arguments startup methods to parsing a command-line switch to run in console mode

809137
.when	ready
roughly i want to send someone my number and trust them to pick their own number uninfluenced by mine but then they should be able to reveal mine purely client-side .when they re ready

809138
scala	java
i m new to scala and don t know java

809156
parsing	comma
the parsing is already quite slow because the csv has comma embedded inside quotes which means i have to use a regex split

809179
value	field
the other field are reset to their default value

809179
default	reset
all of my custom metadata properties are visible but are reset to their default value instead of whatever value were previously selected

809179
value	field
can i get the field that show up to be populate to their correct value

809209
radio-button	selected
in member of selected the domain radio-button

809209
administration	credentials
a popup will then appear asking you to provide the credentials of someone that has access to join a computer to the domain ask your administration about this one - many organizations allow employees to join computers to domains

809210
abstract	extends
the desired functionality would be to have a model extends both of these abstract models and grant the ability to only return the results that are both non-deleted and global

809219
locale	french
given that you appear to be a french speaker the fr_fr.utf-8 locale would be a reasonable setting

809222
postback	ajax
i follow the example in atlas creating a confirmation using the modalpopup extender to make a postback when the okbutton in a modalpopup is clicked it uses the modalpopupextender that comes in asp.net ajax control toolkit but as i can see the sys.webforms.postbackaction is no longer present in asp.net ajax the example is for atlas

809235
hide	show
basically i have a detailsview dependent on what query it is i have certain boundfields i d like to show or hide

809244
unsigned	integer
is better because 0xffffffff assumes that unsigned int is a 32-bit integer

809248
subclassing	inherited
if you look at c++ the compiler can do all sorts of fancy stuff like generate subclassing via recursion probably compute a fractal inherited graph as well as computing the numbers of pi on the fly

809255
interface-builder	iboutlet
in addition to making the navcontroller an iboutlet you also need to link the outlet to a uinavigationcontroller object in interface-builder

809268
annotations	mapping
are you using xml mapping or annotations

809279
any	set
of course if the gl_texture_2d mode or any texture2d attributes lower down have the osg stateattribute protected bit set then the override will be ignored but you might be in a positioning where you know that s not going to happen

809289
http-get	get
i am writing a c++ application and would like to request several data files through a http-get request simultaneously where should i look to get started needs to be cross-platform

809293
silverlight	wpf
though you could convert your wpf app somewhat easily into a silverlight app if you want to run it on the web

809307
uilabel	uifont
now in your application you can simply call uifont fontwithname customfontname size 15 to get the custom font to use with your uilabel and uitextviews etcâ

809309
hide	show
so i don t just want to hide and show and panels

809315
any	set
selected takes a set of file descriptors and tells you if any of them have data available

809316
command-prompt	cmd
either on regular cmd-prompt if the environment variables were properly adjusted or through the cygwin cmd windows

809324
defined	declare
is declare in the header distributions.h and defined in distributions.cpp

809326
32-bit	64bit
there might be both 32-bit and 64bit jvm s available on the system and plenty of them

809336
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is another possibility but there are quite major differences between wpf and silverlight and turning a wpf application into a silverlight application requires more rewriting than one might initially think

809337
debugging	trace
i m not sure why this would happen and unfortunately the client is in a remote location so i m having to debugging this by slipping in trace statements and trial and error

809355
contains	set
a struct .net contains information about the .network namespace a set of .network resources available to processes

809380
ruby	php
php is not really fast ruby is not really fast - compared to say c or java or ocaml

809380
memcached	apc
content delivery networks intel ssds sprites combining images to save requests page compression gzip deflate memcached apc bytecode cache for php minifying and merging of multiple css and javascript files conscious handling of http status codes not changed separation of static and dynamic content different servers domains step-by-step loading via ajax important content first .

809381
environment	restart
i find hudson does not pick up environment variables changes unless you restart the server

809385
contains	any
so that any rules i make up are contains to the id of the section of the page i am working on

809387
scala	java
there are many strategies for doing this such as jar jar but ultimately the issue you re seeing is that the java process you ve started can t find the scala jars

809391
value	field
only thing i can think of is to define a nested type as sealed class that extends system.enum and define public|static|literal field with constant value

809409
shell	bash
as much as i like cygwin it s always been a little flaky powershell is a solid fully functional shell on windows another option is windows services for unix it gives you korn shell or c shell not quite as nice as bash but it gets the job done

809413
system.web	.net
my .net 3.5 application sporadically throws the following exception system.web exception

809415
emacs	vim
i heard about vim and emacs which one is better

809432
operators	keyword
you can define the operators braces comment delimiters and keyword for your languages in a few minutes

809432
emacs	vim
the editors komodo edit emacs vim and epsilon give you the power to define almost any kind of syntax highlighting

809439
bitarray	bitset
if you re using c# you have a bitarray class with the necessary operations and in java you have a bitset class

809440
void	main
the public static void main string

809450
postback	ajax
if you don t want to do a postback there are ways to use ajax to handle calling a server side function withou having the user leave the page

809453
textbox	button
if you are writing it in actionscript is your idea to have a textbox in a flash movie and highlight the syntax after a submit button is pushed

809454
iframe	popup
you could use jquery and load the popup modal form in an iframe using standard get requests.

809465
typename	typedef
a further issue to handle is that it is only possible to typedef a particular typename once in any compilation unit

809466
emacs	vim
vim and emacs are fast and have lots of features including syntax highlighting

809468
preprocessor	lexer
the first implements a full lexer and parsing for the language s being highlight exactly identifying each token s type keyword class name instances name variables type preprocessor directive...

809476
webforms	asp.net
it looks like you re trying to do mvc with the standard asp.net webforms framework

809500
asp.net-mvc	webforms
webforms by themselves are not asp.net-mvc friendly

809500
dialog	pop-up
the link needs another attributes target _blank and the next page will appear in a pop-up dialog

809501
png	gif
if you have the original image as jpeg png tiff gif or any other sampled image reduce the original file size with whatever tools you have then convert to eps using sam2p

809502
put	get
if i put the jpg in it s own directory then i d have to read that directory and just get the one and only file in it and use that in the xsl

809544
webforms	asp.net
it s certainly different than webforms -- and knowing webforms can actually be a hindrance in learning asp.net mvc -- but i m not planning to go back

809544
webforms	asp.net
i only expect asp.net mvc to get better and better as we see the same sort of controls built up for it that there are for webforms

809546
qooxdoo	extjs
i ve heard and used some of the libraries like extjs javascript qooxdoo jquery user-interface dijit

809552
asp.net-mvc	webforms
stephen walther has a couple of examples of using a different view engine than the webforms engine with asp.net-mvc

809555
ruby-on-rails	django
i have used ruby-on-rails django and asp.net mvc and the mvc pattern made my development

809563
display	height
an alternative if you don t like the quality drop in scaling is to load the bitmapimage with decodepixelwidth height equal to the size it will be display at

809590
private-key	rsa
i have a pkcs#5 encrypted pkcs#8 rsa private-key stored in a disk file originally generated by sslplus circa 1997 for example

809590
private-key	rsa
the creation of a certificate object was simple but i can t seem to figure out how to go from the above base64 encoded pkcs#5 key to the decrypted pkcs#8 rsa private-key

809610
default	reset
when i restarted xcode all of my windows had reset to default positioning etc but breakpoints worked

809616
stderr	stdout
the reason why your program hangs is that the read function waits for the daemon to write something to its stdout stderr

in your function you checked that the status is 4 and call the other required functions

809818
callback	methods
so i got into a callback after the user clicked on the button download pictures and i call the methods to download the pictures that is within that same class

809823
32-bit	16-bit
if the status variables is a signed 16-bit integer a short on a machine where int is a 32-bit quantity and if the exit status is in the range 128..255 then wexitstatus still gives you a correct value where dividing by 256 or simply shifting right will give you an incorrect value

order	join
you can re-write your left join to be outer applies so that you can use a top 1 and an order by as follows

809925
order	join
note that an outer apply without a top or an order by is exactly equivalent to a left outer join it just gives you a little more control

809927
webforms	asp.net
the intention of the prototype is to demonstrate how silverlight can be used to improve the ux and overcome some of the hurdles of using asp.net webforms in a high latency environment

809927

809946
png	gif
i ve just had a go at loading jpeg png and gif

809951
put	get
you can put a sql join condition which returns all the votes on comments made by the current user for this object if you get no rows the user hasn t voted

809968
mouseleave	mousemove
why not subscribe to the mousemove events in the mousehover event then unsubscribe in the mouseleave event

809968
mouseleave	mousemove
the reason for removing the mousemove events on mouseleave would allow you to only receive events while the mouse is over your control

809977
hide	show
edit forgot that the show hide animation happened asynchronously so you need to use a callback on the fade out to triggers the rest.

809981
splitter	panels
i also need to create a control containers that i can add other controls to at design-time so i can add it to yet another containers splitter panels which is not avaialable to me at design-time plugins architecture

810109
contains	set
from within here you can set the directory that contains your new lib by selected the library files in the show directory for drop down box

810109
contains	set
if you dont have a lib you can omit this but while your here you will also need to set the directory which contains your header-files as well under the include files

810111
button	popup
to do that go to c c++ - additional include directories press the ... button and in the popup dialog press macros

810114
any	set
their instructions specifically say to set ant_opts although any other way to get ant to pick up the setting would be fine as wel

810133

810223
double	int
to do it just put your int double floats etc

810258

810260
business-objects	data-access
i can encapsulate the data-access in my business logic pretty well such that code that uses my business-objects don t need to know anything about the database which is good but it the business layer is still tightly coupled with the data-access layer such that i couldn t swap out the dal without either changing my business layer objects or creating new ones that implement the same interfaces for different data providers

810265
selected	button
b using jquery to trigger the ajax request on selected index change instead of a populate button trigger

810272

i am looking to obfuscate a data-access layer which is written using nhibernate

810386
ruby	php
let s assume most people are aware of ruby on rails php coldfusion and python django and we can take for granted that these are pretty simple and concise

810391
required	checked
if you are implements equals because some application logic required it then that s fine but keep pure testing-only code out of cluttering up stuff also the semantics of checked the same for testing may be different than what your app required

810402
malware	website
in the past 2-3 weeks the php and jquery files on my website have become infected from malware from a site called gumblar.cn

810409
haskell	scheme
after looking at scheme erlang haskell ocaml and sml i ve settled on either haskell or standard ml

810409
haskell	sml
both haskell and sml have pattern matching which makes describing a recursive algorithm a cinch

810409
haskell	sml
essentially sml and haskell are roughly equivalent

810409
return-type	arguments
by explicit confirmation of the function i meant that upon defining the function sml right away tells you the name of the function the types of the arguments and the return-type

810413

810455
micro-optimization	benchmarking
edit see bottom of post for benchmarking on different micro-optimization of the methods

810459
recording	playing
one way you might be able to do it is to build a wav file on the fly whith any application you develop or a pre-developed one that file will be in a predefined folder and with you flash app you keep watching that folder for that file and then you load the sound on the fly as well as you add with your app the flash reads it you could also put a flag file something like recording.txt if that file exist then you are recording which means for the flash app that it should be playing and so it goes

when your button clicked and an item selected call this selected item s focus method

810511
32-bit	64bit
this is possibly in addition to giving the source code to them. most statically linked binaries work on most linux distributions of the same architecture + 32-bit x86 statically linked binaries work on 64bit amd64

810511
32-bit	64bit
and you don t have the superpower to make it work on all linux systems so this situation is inevitable. do you provide 32-bit and 64bit as well including x86 powerpc arm etc

810511
ubuntu	debian
if the .so file works only on debian ubuntu and red hat because you don t have time time to port the file to more distributions you ll most probably upset your suse and gentoo users and more

810521
ironpython	cpython
what would be the ironpython way of doing tasks you would normally use subprocess or os.system for in cpython

810524
contains	elements

810529
submitchanges	datacontext
i insert a new object into linq-to-sql datacontext without calling submitchanges yet

810585
groovy	java
one can use different loggers say a logger for java messages and one for groovy messages

810633
directory	folder
are they actual directory or since this is a webserver virtual folder

810634
hash	md5
basing the hash either md5 or sha on the time makes it guessable if the user knows roughly when the directory is generated

810636
directory	folder
iis can often put you in a temporary directory so it may have copied all your files over to this temp folder but none of the subdirs so there simply are none

810647

810669
google-apps	gmail
note that i m using a regular gmail account and not google-apps

810719
profiling	trace
has anyone seen the issue with sql profiling 2000 where you cannot pause or stop a trace

810726
any	set
i can probably code around the problem by making getmysize and setmysize methods instead of using a property but i d like to know if there s actually any way to set the default property for a size

810738
web-inspector	user-agent
this will give you a developer file menu item with choices to change the user-agent javascript profiling and debugger and a great little web-inspector windows either docked or floating which gives you access to x html css resources assets and timing javascript javascript profiling and html5 database

810738
javascript	dom
in addition it gives you a javascript console so you can make calls into the current rendered page to check for settings variables dom walking and many other various little goodies all in real-time

810752
submitchanges	datacontext
what i wanted to do is to store the datacontext instances inside the session do all the inserts without calling submitchanges and then just call submitchanges once to commit the transaction

810752
submitchanges	datacontext
unfortunately there is a bug in linq-to-sql which prevents you to fetch previously inserted data from the datacontext before you call submitchanges on it see here and i need to do that because before inserting tender s document and headers i need to retrieve the tender itself

810758
python-imaging-library	libjpeg
don t forget to install libjpeg and python-imaging-library

810786
python	java
as far as simplicity goes java or python are going to be the simplest options for a while simply because they re officially supported and have fully developed apis

810789
order	join
generally you need to denormalize your data in order to avoid the need for frequent join

810798
ref	out
if you want to send a value in and out of the methods one would choose ref

810813
button	popup
i recently ran into an issue where i was trying to dynamically create a panel with button labels ect and have it popup using the ajax popupcontrolextender

i am looking for a library to read meta data from compressed and uncompressed audio files mp3 ogg etc.

810881
children	nodes
is a root nodes without children valid

810888
contains	set
the empty tree represents the case where the set of entities you are intersted in is empty and the single node the case where the set contains one entity

810892
early-binding	late-binding
now you can declare your objects as bona-fide excel types and use early-binding rather than declaring them as object and using late-binding

810896
children	nodes
is a root nodes without children valid

810897
binary-tree	nodes
a single nodes with no children is certainly valid and according to binary-tree structure

810897
contains	elements
when it is not empty it contains a data object called the root elements and 2 distinct bitree objects called the left subtree and the right subtree

810905
average	median
if you want the traditional definition of median for even length you might have to run it twice once for each of the two middles at first + last - first 2 and first + last - first 2 - 1 and then average them or something

810922
asp.net-mvc	webforms
personally i would recommend using asp.net-mvc as it is more intuiative and you have more control over your pages than with webforms

810925
exception-handling	try-catch
if you do throw an exception-handling from a constructor keep in mind that you need to use the function try-catch syntax if you need to catch that exception-handling in a constructor initializer list

810935
updating	updates
whenever i am updating existing record of my country table which has versioning 0 it works fine updates the record updates the versioning field to 1

810954
contains	any
how can i determine if string contains only alphabets and i want to have little more than a-za-z + so is there any way to determine alphabets by locale

810966
groovy	scala
groovy scala and clojure are gaining momentum in many sectors for example twitter is written in scala

810972
scala	java
more progress is being made with languages like scala groovy clojure and of course these can leverage off the available java libraries

810993
json	xml
for dto purposes binaryformatter should be avoided - things like xml via xmlserializer or datacontractserializer or json are good as are cross-platform formats like protocol buffers

810995
quicksort	heapsort
for those interested sort uses an introsort quicksort which switches to heapsort when the recursion reaches a certain depth and stable_sort uses a merge sort

811004
web-services	api
i m not sure i have guidelines but i can show you an example of something that i found to be a good set of docs for a web-services api

811005
event-log	logfile
when i navigate to the application the applicationstart methods is not being called as the logfile is not created and the event-log is not updates

811005
exception-handling	try-catch
so i tried a try-catch and wrote a blank file exception-handling.txt if an exception-handling was thrown but still no file was created - although the event log and expected log file were generated

811009
javascript	dom
another javascript implementation of w3c dom level 3 xpath can be found on source forge

811017
authentication	impersonation
if this returns impersonation you can authentication to processes on the local computer using the user s identity

811073
freepascal	fpc
there s fpcunit an implementation to xunit.net for freepascal i m not sure if it s compatible with dunit but i read at fpc fourms they are doing improvement to make it compatible with dunit

811075
scala	java
java does seem to have stood still for some time but there s been a lot of innovation in other languages that run on the jvm such as scala and clojure and i suspect that they are where the future lies

811089
case-statement	subquery
you wouldn t be able to use a subquery like this in a procedural case-statement

811115
unique	words
depending on how many unique words there are you can have only 1 for max 256 words or 2 max 65536 words bytes per word

811115
arrays	map
if you desire speed you can use an std map to look up the index of a string in log n time instead of iterating over the outside arrays

811115
unique	words
65536 unique words

811116
unique	words
then the words list is just a vector of integers being the index into the arrays of unique strings

811116
unique	words
this would save memory at the cost of being slower to read in the file since you would have to do some kind of linear scan in the unique arrays for each new words

811116
arrays	map
you could then use a map as an index into the arrays of unique strings - if the new word is not found in the set then you know to add the word at the end of the list of uniques

811122
methods	extend
using an extension methods you could extend contains to take a string arrays

811136
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you have already done lot of your ui layer jus stick with webforms otherways if you have the time to learn a new technology asp.net-mvc won t disappoint you

811137
methods	extend
should i create a class that inherits from a membershipuser and extend it with my own properties and methods and save this in a seperate table

811154
void	main
int main void unsigned int i

811155
ironpython	ironruby
and if you don t like using vb or c# you could even branch out and use ironruby and ironpython as well and pick up some new languages along the way

811157
silverlight	xbap
silverlight and xbap are pretty similar to each other but they do have some major differences

811157
silverlight	wpf
this results in silverlight lacking some of the features that wpf has which are available in xbaps

811157
firefox	safari
silverlight requires only the silverlight player which is available for ie firefox and safari and works on windows and osx and is much smaller than the full .net in terms of download size

811160
silverlight	wpf
the silverlight toolset is mostly a subset of wpf so with wba you will have access to more tools

811174
textbox	button
the problem the sip panel sucks - sometimes all i need is numbers or letters entered into a mobile application - most of my users wind up not using the stylus but fingers so i need to create big button on the screen with each buttn a number or letter that fills in whatever textbox they are currently working on

811187
macros	vba
doing a complex macros in excel and then learning what the code is doing could be a gateway to vba

811195
contains	any
it need not contains all the data of the original string since i will be only doing comparison with generated checksums i don t expect any sort of decryption

811200
silverlight	wpf
xbap applications have the full clr and entire .net 3.0 3.5 avilable to them whereas silverlight apps only have the reduced silverlight clr and its own lightweight version of the .net wpf though it s not strictly called wpf

811200
firefox	safari
ie 6 7 8 firefox 3 safari

811203
asp.net-mvc	webforms
another option is to do a section of your site in webforms and another in asp.net-mvc

811221
hash	md5
in php you could do it with one line with an md5 hash on a string of length 20 - 500 it should be pretty fast

811248
jfilechooser	jtextfield
however i would like to add the ability for a user to drag-and-drop a file onto this jtextfield and have it place the file path of that file into the jtextfield instead of always having using the jfilechooser

811250
canvas	scale
i need to implement a canvas which scale its contents according to its size

811258
derived-class	base-class
your derived-class needs to add a one-parameter constructor and delegate it to the base-class

811264
protected	public
also if start is protected you will have to create some sort of public methods that calls it

811266
set	bag
on my supportticket class i have an ilist supportticketnotes property and have it mapped as a bag probably really should be a set but that s not important at the moment

811275
canvas	scale
what do you mean by canvas that scale it s contents according to it s size without scaling all the contents as some have fixed size

811275
canvas	scale
if your drawing algorithm already scale the content to the canvas height and width then all you need to do is to resize the canvas to fit the area i believe

811276
derived-class	base-class
either change the access modifier in the base-class to public or figure out a way to call the methods from the derived-class when you need to the latter must have been intended by the writer of udpserver

811277
multiplication	addition
multiplication addition and bitwise rotating would be much better

811292
for-loop	arrays
this however comes at the cost of computing the hash in constructor of binary objects by traversing the arrays with for-loop -

811307
solaris	linux
for linux and probably solaris the dataflavor is a little trickier

811316
textbox	button
the following is an example of a grid which lays two button at the bottom and a textbox at the top

811324
constructor	object
convenience constructor don t have any of those words in their names nsmutablearrays arrays so by convention they return autoreleased object

811324
constructor	object
if you release object returned from a convenience constructor yourself without having explicitly retained them then they will be over-released and your application will probably crash

811339
textbox	button
i cannot figure out how to allow the user to only press the submit button once all textbox are ok

811344
contains	any
but the problem seems to be that if my object s contains any recursion at all i get a stack overflow

811361
unsigned	integer
i want to set a fourcc value in c++ an unsigned 4 byte integer

811370
hide	show
the complexity of when to show hide things when to process input from which fields is way too much

811375
entity-relationship	diagram
maybe this can help you entity-relationship diagram building software

811392

in java we have something called javabeans properties but that is basically a instance-variables that follows a certain naming pattern for its getter and setter

811417
build-server	teamcity
i d like to move teamcity off of my machine and onto the new dev build-server that was just delivered

811417
build-server	teamcity

811430
attributes	properties
in my school days i had professors that said class properties or class attributes all the time

811436
checkbox	textbox
i can get everything to work fine as far as properties go so long as i manually instantiate the new control as a checkbox...but i can t seem to figure out how to make it a checkbox versus a textbox or whatever based on the xml information.

811438
logging	daemon
i m looking at adding logging to an application and i m considering using kiwi syslogd and a freeware library clsyslog to send logging messages to the daemon

811439
sql-server	firebird
sqlite sql-server compact edition or firebird are all good alternatives to ms access for simple light-weight easy rdbms needs

811440
32-bit	64bit
it s also not quite clear whether this works for 64bit processes from a 32-bit process

811465
margins	padding
definitely clear default margins and padding because different browsers cough ie have their own ideas of what margins and padding various elements should have

811478
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i am a newbi in iphone development.i want to build an app which will have a uiviewcontroller first which will have a button.now on clicking the button it shud load a uinavigationcontroller

811479
set	bag
in your course object you need to set the cascade option on what i presume will be a bag or similar with a one-to-many inside

811480
buffering	streaming
as for this music portal is concerned to start off with have a virtual private server so that we will have a control of the streaming buffering methods conversion of the file formats also we would have a full control to install open source libraries to manage the scalability and performance

811489
sql-server	ms-access
how about using the sql-server migration assistant to migrate your ms-access database to sql-server

811492
configuration	logging
it s a framework but it does have a really nice logging layer that acts like log4j and the like as far as configuration is concerned but uses the stl for implementation

811493
webserver	upload
for webserver that means don t just upload user content to 1 machine but distibute it to a cluster

811496
rational-numbers	decimal-point
here s a javascript function to get the nth digit to the right of the decimal-point for the rational-numbers x y

811499
integer	zero

811500
oracle	mysql
only a real db server like mysql or mssql or oracle db2 .

811508
where-clause	sql
your sql isn t a good idea because it will select all rows no where-clause assumes where 1

811510
webforms	asp.net
i added asp.net mvc manually to an existing webforms application.

811515
put	get
when i put print statements before each value i get blanks in both cases but if the print statements come after the increment has been applied i get a value of 1 depending on how many ipv6 resources the organization has

811536
integer	numeric
yes it should be -- otherwise it won t behave like other numeric types and you will see some very strange behavior if you move from integer based code to biginteger based code

811544
pascal	delphi
the class was mostly focused on programming with pascal so delphi was a good next step

811544
click	mouse
...i think you know what is coming next...the no button changed locations on mouse over and was almost impossible to click

811550
put	get
the internal form is an object having get and opt methods for accessing the values by name and put methods for adding or replacing values by name

811586
google-chrome	firefox
works in ie firefox and google-chrome as far as i can tell

811607
shell	bash
an ntfs directory is open in a bash shell

811647
solaris	linux
this linux magazine article explains the difference in the way threads are implemented in linux as compared to commercial unixs such as solaris

811647
solaris	linux
in summary linux uses a 1-to-1 mapping of user threads to kernel threads while solaris uses a many to many mapping

811661
implementation	instantiation
summary of the summary in my opinion this snippet is not a proper implementation of the factory methods oo design pattern since it does not satisfy a class defer instantiation to subclasses. though personally i would freely refer to this solution as factory methods

811691
directory	folder
the other per-application folder contain shortcuts to the executable in that directory

811702
set	bag
many valued end the set or bag

811704
crossover	mutation
i have had some success increasing the diversity of population by setting mutation and crossover from a couple of the genes from the parent chromosomes

811704
crossover	mutation
the smaller reproduction chromosome had a sensible fixed rates for mutation and crossover

811704
crossover	mutation
as an aside i tend to do both crossover and mutation for each child

811763
bad-request	http-error
http-error 400.0 - bad-request asp.net

811797
firefox	safari
firefox on mac indeed understands it but safari does not

811800
treeset	treemap
treemap treeset

811801
haskell	sml
essentially sml and haskell are roughly equivalent

811801
haskell	sml
i like using haskell much more than sml but i would still teach sml first

811801
haskell	sml
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell

811801
haskell	sml
while your class likely wouldn t use them anyways haskell s typeclasses are still an extra bump to get over -- getting them to understand the a versus a distinction in sml is tough enough

811806
linked-list	queue
a linked-list implements the queue inteface in java and allows you to add things in the middle.

811808
function-call	inline
if getcontext is a function-call as opposed to a macros or an inline function then the compiler is going to have to call it every time because the compiler can t necessarily see what it s doing and thus the compiler probably won t know that it can eliminate the call

811820
iteration	elements
per iteration this eliminates between 1 and 12 elements with an average of 25 of the remaining

811820
iteration	elements
in the next iteration you want the m-l-1 th elements of the n-l-1 floats that are bigger than the pivot

811821
temporary	rvalue
a temporary created by a call to a constructor is an rvalue

811832
cvs	git
cvs svn perforce git all adhere to this

811836
gnome	kde
that would be the standard controls on windows cocoa on the mac and on linux it should ideally use either gtk or qt depending on the desktop being gnome or kde

811844
export	csv
for a long time in the java jsp world i used to use the display tag library to generate a table that would allow you to sort a table and export the table as a csv file

811845
put	get
however when i try to put the object into the database i get

811845
persistence	hibernate
note that i am still using hibernate as my jpa persistence layer

811856
multiplying	subtract
to unseal it divide by 9999 subtract the part to the left of the decimal point then multiplying by 9999

811873
xsd	xml
the xsd standard is pretty difficult to work with directly i always use an editor like liquid xml studio

811887
contains	elements
i have some files that each contains a div elements or two but no html or body tags

811898
build-process	nant
if you also incorporate nant into your build-process i think you could find that it helps out in more ways then one

811907
loading	png
here s what i googled as far as loading a png in j2me

811908
buffering	streaming
on top of whatever streaming you are actually using since the buffering they maintain will make multiple reads much faster

811937
testng	junit
testng is much friendlier to this paradigm than junit though

811951
boost	stl
i have a small single-threaded c++ application compiled and linked using visual-studio 2005 that uses boost crc program_options and tokenize a smattering of stl and assorted other system headers

811956
subclassing	base-class
when i have to use a webforms in some cases when working with a cms the easiest way to get the data to return is to extends a base-class which subclassing page i do all the work in the code behind

811990
versioning	upgrade
it will run fine side-by-side with your upgrade versioning vs2008

811994
button	popup
on it is a product slider and for each product mousing over the product popup a large informational bubble with info about the product a dropdown to select buy options and a buy button

811996
buffering	streaming
wrap your input streaming in a buffering reader then use the read methods to read one byte at a time until the end of streaming

811997
query-cache	memcached
there are cases where you can use memcached to cache items at closer to a row level when you and your application can be smarter about cache expiry than mysql query-cache

811999
.when	ready
.when i m ready to push my changes..

812007
firebird	mysql
i migrate from access to firebird very easily i think firebird is better than mysql for delphi

812027
font-size	width
my current approach is to set font-size as a function of the number of text characters and the text components height and width but i can t find the right coefficients to make this work nicely

812035
unsigned	integer
i ve now changed the methods to take and return uint unsigned 32-bit integer instead - this is also in greater accordance with the c++ rotl and rotr functions

812041
visualvm	jvm
if tomcat is running as a windows service and you want to attach to the jvm locally you need to run visualvm or jconsole as the system account

812075
default-value	arguments
the rationale for this is simple every arguments in ruby isn t required to have a default-value so you can t call it the way you ve specified

812075
arguments	default
in your case for example the first two arguments don t have default value

812082
message	alert
you can also fake it by registering a scripting that makes an alert so when you get back from the server s validation it ll prompt with the error message

812084
average	minimum
alex stepanov s new book elements of programming talks at some length about finding order statistics using the minimum number of average comparisons while minimizing runtime overhead

812084
average	median
unfortunately a sizable amount of code is needed just to compute the median of 5 elements and even then he gives as a project finding an alternate solution that uses a fraction of a comparison less on average so i wouldn t dream of extending that framework to finding the median of 27 elements

812085
python	java
we ve recently decoupled our build environment from dependencies on the commercial product s environment and can use any version of python or java we want

812119
order	add
use a sort order id as jon suggested then add an orderby annotation below the onetomany

812121
methods	extend
the extension methods is a nice way to extend the syntax

812129
integer	digits
there s also z which matches one or more digits used to match an integer

812161
gentoo	linux
i use python 2.5 for all my development work but only because it s the version that happens to be available in gentoo linux s package repository

812170
python	php
because it is technology agnostic it can be encapsulated in jsp jsf .net python or php graphic components

812185
getter-setter	setter
i am not sure but i think that if i call self.myinstancevariable then it uses automatically getters setter but if i would call directly myinstancevariable foo for example then i would bypass any getter-setter which would be really really reeeaaallly bad

812185
getter	setter
like you see you must use self.instancevariablename in order to use the getter and setter or you do the call in brackets works too

812185
getter	setter
from the outside when you call someobjectpointer.someinstancevariable it will automatically access the getter and setter yep i tried that out too

812188
docutils	epydoc
we had to go back to docutils to 0.4 so it would work with epydoc 3.0.1

812210
msbuild	nant
i ve read a fair number of questions on how to upgrade a database for developer and such and i m leaning towards using migratordotnet or something similar however it seems the the upgrades need to be run with something like msbuild or nant

812210
progress-bar	progress
if needed i could probably redirect console output and do some naive string parsing to get progress info but i ll resort to that if it looks like it s taking long enough to warrant displaying actual progress instead of just a marquee progress-bar

812213
versioning	migrate
if you have the enterprise versioning of delphi then its not to hard to migrate the system over to a true n-tier solution using tclientdatasets and writing a few server functions

812220
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
the navigationcontroller is designed to take over the screen when it s used so you have to decide how to manage the transition to the navigationcontroller from your original viewcontroller

812220
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
now once you ve created the navigationcontroller and added its first viewcontroller to it you need to transition to it

812224
any	set
a key part of peer-to-peer replication is that each server is responsible for changing its own data set and no other location can change any of the data in that data set

812233
triggers	insert
my question is is there some way i can be notified in java preferably including the data that changed by the database when a record is updated deleted insert using some sort of triggers semantics

812244
triggers	insert
the simplest thing to do is to have the insert update delete triggers make an entry in some log table and have your java program monitor that table

812250
persistence	hibernate
if you re using something like hibernate as your persistence layer it has a set of listeners and interceptors that you can use to monitor records going in and out of the database

812251
handler	service
have the handler call your wcf service to get the url retrieve the image and return it in the http response stream

812254
contains	any
edit its worth noting that your css contains these mods have to be loaded after the richfaces skin your loading as any css loaded after this one may overload it

812255
persistent	transient
that s useful in scenarios where the state is effectively transient - webforms relies on it by default for control state - but the only way for it to actually persistent across page loads is by forcing a postback each time a request is made to the server

812275
perl	php
do you believe that such functionality would be available in other languages and frameworks c php ruby .net perl python etc.

812324
attributes	properties
the idea is you would add a properties-ref attributes on your element that points to the properties you want to reference instead of the primary key

812350
integration	bpm
wli was supposed to go in the direction of bpm but bea aquired fuego and went ahead creating the bpm platform leaving wli to the integration of weblogic product suite than making it a part of aqualogic product suite which is targted towards the business users

812352
freebsd	linux
linux windows solaris freebsd

812354
terminate	timeout
you might want to consider using poll instead of take which will allow the processing thread to timeout and terminate when it has waited for a while with no new input

812361
version-control	git
i recommend git and subversion svn both as free open-source version-control systems that work very well

812378
sequences	unique
if you re using a database for your web site then you can use an auto-incrementing number or a sequences to generate unique filenames for the images

812383
contains	set
use system.codedom to generate a c# class contains code to set the properties according to the respective fields on the idatareader

812384
wordpress	phpbb
as for database setup you might consider writing a setup form within your website that can be called once to initialize the database based on user input think about the setup process from popular open-source projects like wordpress or phpbb that perform a wizard-type function

812402
cvs	git
there are several major source control libraries of which svn also called subversion is one cvs git hg perforce clearcase etc are others

812409
rollback	commit
in example its used for checking legality of some service a operations before executing session b which commit or rollback changes

812426
selection	cell
i don t want to see that blue selection box when the user taps on the cell

812427
jvisualvm	jvm
you ll have to run jmap manually on the linux server to dump the heap of your jvm and then copy the resultant heap dump to your local machine running jvisualvm and use file|load.

812434
data-members	private
also make sure that you re applying the data-members to the property and not the private string

812438
dependency-injection	service-locator
dependency-injection is a counterpoint to the service-locator pattern

812448
myeclipse	maven
myeclipse seems to have had a fun history with the maven team as evidenced in various places especially when dealing with war projects

812448
myeclipse	maven
after fighting with myeclipse and failing to make it recognize a war project easily the question becomes is myeclipse worth it for developing maven war apps

812457
asterisk	pbx
the asterisk pbx is an open-source telephony server that implements a number of voip protocols including sip

812463
value	field
thus you are now comparing the field in the database with a set value rather than scanning the table and transforming the data in each row and comparing that

812467
swing	gwt
therefore i d say that if you are more comfortable writing swing apps use gwt and if you are more comfortable writing web apps use html combined with jquery or another javascript framework

812470
contains	set
i am using .net asp.net-mvc and within view pages i set a contentplaceholder that contains an id to be used on the master page like so

812474
contains	any
the code i am looking to convert does not contains any advanced library usage jdbc system.out etc that would vary significantly from java to .net so i don t think that will be an issue at worst it can be designed around

812474
python	ruby
i know python and ruby both have implementations on for the jvm and clr

812475
keyboard	mouse
i m trying to write a game with support for joypads as well as mouse keyboard

812492
stderr	stdout
one of them is my trusty old exec 2 1 which in the bourne shell permently knots together stderr and stdout for the duration of the scripting so that logging will capture everything good and bad

812494
graphviz	doxygen
but you can get call and caller graphs as well as some kinds of entity relationship diagrams out of doxygen with graphviz

812500
stderr	stdout
you can print the errors and standard output to a single file by using the 1 command to redirect the output for stderr to stdout and then sending the output from stdout to a file

812503
linked-list	nodes
a list would have to reallocate string of interned pointers and a linked-list would have to create nodes and modify pointers so they aren t free to do but if i m concatenating many thousands of interned strings then they would seem like they would be more efficient

812521
stderr	stdout
to redirect the stderr output of the scripting to stdout

812522
profiling	trace
i was running a trace on a sql-server 2005 using the profiling and need to find out what is causing the reported errors

812525
myeclipse	maven
from the using maven in myeclipse overview

812542
scrollbar	margin
however if i open it in an ie7 modal dialog it draws the vertical scrollbar on top of the margin

812542
scrollbar	margin
what s even worse because it draws the scrollbar on top of the margin it also causes a horizontal scrollbar to be drawn

812580
rewrite	rule
what happens is the person requests the link www.example.com profiling 12345 and then apache chops it up using a rewrite rule making it look like this www.example.com profiling.php

812591
configuration	logging
is there a .net logging class that does not rely on xml configuration files

812592
bazaar	git
i use bazaar so this might be a slightly different answer than a git user would give but

812616
google-chrome	firefox
if you try this code it looks smooth for handle 1 and 2 but not others in firefox 3 but still looks jumpy in google-chrome

812618
getter	setter
in objective-c a property is an instance-variables which can take advantage of an overloaded dot operators to call its setter and getter

812626
maya	3ds
if it helps has information for converting many model formats maya 3ds max blendder lightwave softimage into .md5 format

812632
happy	yacc
so it seems like happy is a robust replacement for yacc in haskell

812632
lexer	lex
is there an equally robust lexer generator to replace lex flex

812639
authentication	login
after i authentication user login info i create this session for them

812662
constructor	object
there is a factory class that receives thru its constructor which class s object to create

812662
constructor	object
each of the three classes a b c has a constructor with a parameter to supply the database connection object

812662
constructor	object
i m trying to create an object of class a which has a constructor that takes a variables of type dbconnection

812667
python	java
if you poke around you ll realize that it is possible to write entire applications without a single line of php python java whatever

812677
addition	formula
p t is the calculated positioning of the point t is a scalar ranging from 0 to 1 p1 and p2 are the endpoint and the addition in the above is vector addition so you apply this formula separately to the x y and z components of your points

812682
constructor	object
the invoke method takes the object s that you need to pass into the constructor

812693
javascript	dom
i have an ajax application that downloads a json object and uses the data to add rows to an html table using javascript dom functions

812711
google-chrome	firefox
click here to see what i m talking about this looks best in firefox google-chrome safari

812711
put	get
that documentation gives examples of interacting with the system using http verbs such as get post put delete

812735
kerberos	ldap
there are settings for openid facebook connect ldap ntlm kerberos etc

812739
xsd	xml
i ve used xsd.exe to create an xsd schema from an xml file and then to create a c# class from that xsd

812740
archive	backup
backup generic archive file

812754
contains	elements
expanding on the discussion there the table markup is generally done without explicit thead and tbody markup but the tbody elements is where you actually need to add your new row as table does not contains tr elementss directly

812758
solaris	aix
we use mlton to compile our sml code to native code running on windows linux solaris aix and hp-ux

812760
sql-server	oracle
one of the benefits of sql-server 2008 with respect to ssis is that it includes very fast bulk connectors for oracle and teradata well the development and enterprise versions do

812760
teradata	oracle
see microsoft connectors for oracle and teradata by attunity

812760
contains	any
another major benefit in sql-server 2008 is the new change data capture cdc functionality which means you can build your application in any way you like and then if at later time you are interested in starting some processing when table x changed you can turn on cdc for that table and get a change table that contains all the changes to table x with minimal overhead

812764
typedef	struct
either remove the typedef keyword or create an object of type struct person somewhere in your code

812769
command-prompt	cmd
i m trying to execute these cmd and then close the command-prompt after firefox opens

812785
blacklist	whitelist
but you see the general idea you have to blacklist all html in general before you whitelist the ok stuff

812796
put	get
you can t put using an html form the spec defines only get post for forms

812796
put	get
however any http api should allow you to put in the same way that it allows you to get or post

812797
put	get
put and delete are likely to require that you use ajax and make xmlhttprequests since the form tag only supports get and post verbs and links only make get requests

812797
safari	opera
haven t tested in safari or opera

812802
properties-file	jar
putting the properties-file in the jar

812804
breadth-first-search	dijkstra
since you said the edges are all of the same weight dijkstra s algorithm my usual first choice for this sort of thing will just degrade to breadth-first-search so i suggest using that for simplicity

812819
fckeditor	wysiwyg
i am using the fckeditor wysiwyg editor and was wondering if anyone figured out how to use the absolute-path instead of relative path after you add an image in the editor

812829
integer	zero
this involves rounding but since 100 is a small integer the rounding error is zero

812842
dialog	pop-up
pop-up a dialog and tell the user they re screwed and exit the program

812844
order	add
to order chronologically add a dateadded or similar column with a datetime or smalldatetime datatype

order	add
on methods that query the database add order by dateadded at the end of the query string

812847
jformattedtextfield	jcombobox
replace the jtextfield of jcombobox by jformattedtextfield

812849
directory	folder
however when i try to import the service namespace using the same name as the directory under the app_webreferences folder it doesn t recognize the name and gives me an error if i try to import it

812856
sinatra	ramaze
i m looking for a lightweight ruby web framework and have come across sinatra and ramaze

812865
beautifulsoup	feedparser
the acceptable_elements attributes come from feedparser and beautifulsoup does the work

812874
linqdatasource	gridview
if your database is sql-server and you re uzing .net version 3.5 i recommend using a simple gridview with a linqdatasource

812921
highlight	cell
if you would like to prevent the row from being visually highlight on touch you can ensure that the cell s selectionstyle is set to uitableviewcellselectionstylenone or preferably you can have your uitableviewdelegate implement tableview shouldhighlightrowatindexpath as follows

812937
directory	folder
a great example which is sort of close to the situation i m working on is filesystems explorers windows explorer which show a hierarchy of folder directory and a list of objects within them

812961
getter	setter
i ve been trying to get my head around getter and setter and its not sinking in

812961
getter	setter
i ve read javascript getter and setter and defining getter and setter and just not getting it

812961
getter	setter
what a getter and setter are meant to do and

812995
viewwillappear	viewdidload
viewdidload and viewwillappear are out of the question because i don t know what s in the datasource to the picker yet

813002
getter	setter
defining getter and setter

813042
callback	methods
basically define an interface with a single methods and use instances of it as your callback

813044
arrays	loops
from the example the nested for loops traverses across left - right the arrays row by row and fills in a value for each column

813051
google-chrome	firefox
my issue is the consistency between ie and firefox google-chrome safari

813082
parentheses	operators
we had to insert parentheses because the subscript operators binds better than the dereference operators and it would otherwise be read as which isn t what we want

813085
lookup	any
if you include those columns in the non-clustered key then it won t need to do the key lookup any more

813092
authentication	login
the simplified solution is to only allow authentication users to make web service requests but since you are designing a login system this obviously doesn t stick

813094
profiling	trace
you ll have to run the profiling trace of sql stmtstarting sql stmtcompleted user error message and exception events with text transactionid eventsequence and otehr columns you need to get a picture of what s going on

813095
textbox	button
when i hit the enter button from a textbox the corresponding onclick event for the first imagebutton in the page is fired

813099
value	field
if we re talking strictly about php here and not about c# java etc where the compiler will optimise these things i find getters and setters to be a waste of resources where you simply need to proxy the value of a private field and do nothing else

813099
instances	private
on my setup i made two crappy classes one with five private fields encapsulated by five getter setter pairs proxying the field which looked almost exactly like java code funnily enough and another with five public fields and called memory_get_usage at the end after creating an instances

813099
getter	setter
the scripting with the getter setter used 59708 bytes of memory and the scripting with the public fields used 49244 bytes

813099
getter	setter
in the context of a class library of any significant size such as a web site framework these useless getter and setter can add up to a huge black hole for memory

813099
getter	setter
i wouldn t use it for this if i had the choice but having said that php is not imposing any insurmountable restrictions on us and when i refactored the class library to use public fields instead of getter setter the whole shebang ended up using 25 less memory per request at least

813099
getter	setter
say we have an object which was developed using fields instead of getter setter and we want to rename a field called field to fieldwithbettername because field was inappropriate or no longer described the use accurately or was just plain wrong

813099
value	field
and say we wanted to change a field called field2 to lazy load its value from the database because it isn t known initially using a getter.

813099
getter	setter
getter and setter methods in php are good if the setter has to do something or if the getter has to lazy-evaluation load something or ensure something has been created or whatever but they re unnecessary and wasteful if they do nothing other than proxy the field especially with a few techniques like the ones above to manage interface changes

813114
freebsd	linux
also i have access to linux and freebsd systems no windows sorry

813136
perl	ruby
another alternative approach instead of steps 1--3 if your language supports eval such as perl python ruby use a regexp substitution to convert the template to an eval -able string in the host language and run eval to instantiate the template

813141
user-interface	drawing
o3d does have a high performance canvas for 2d drawing and it would be quser-interfacete possible to write a user-interface library in javascript that could draw on that canvas

813147
python	ruby
is there a method in ruby that is like maketrans in python

813152
voicemail	skype
skype has a voicemail feature which sounds perfect for this and i suppose you would need a skypein number as well

813168
sqldatasource	gridview
i am not using a sqldatasource or an objectdatasource so what is the proper way to delete a row from the gridview and the underlying data in the database

813182
sniffing	traffic
for example the server needs to give the user some tiles and the user can then tell the server where he put those tiles and the server needs to verify those slots are empty because the server can never completely trust the client the client can always be hijacked if not through the scripting then by sniffing the http traffic and modifying that

813191
windows-server	windows
ntbackup the backup program included in previous versions of windows-server and nt-based windows client operating systems is no longer supplied or supported but you still have some choices

813191
archive	backup
it has numerous options that allow you to backup via file-copying and set the archive bit according to what type of backup job you want to achieve

813198
document	element
the external schema is specified in a element at the top of the document

813198
document	element
the type that it s trying to find keyinfotype is defined in one of the the document in the import element

813201
value	field
the field initialization in the constructor takes the place of hard coding constants that are equivalent to the value needed

813208
pixels	line
i started out coloring graph paper and plotting pixels until i got into geometry...and discovered how to use equations to plot curves and line boxes etc

813211
automake	gnu
ideally you ll want to use gnu autoconf automake and libtool to create configure and make scripting then distribute the library as source with the generated configure and makefile.in files

813212
toggleclass	removeclass
its better to use toggleclass 2 in 1 instead of addclass removeclass

813227
getter	setter
getter and setter really only make sense when you have private properties of classes

813230
contains	any
you could verify in the stored procedure that it doesn t contains any single quotes

813235
multiple-inheritance	polymorphism
rtti dynamic casts multiple-inheritance heavy polymorphism and exception-handling all come with some amount of runtime cost for their use

813235
constructor	object
if i had used it straight from the box i would have been mystified by global object whose constructor had never run at all

813235
constructor	object
you will need to remember that constructor for global object are run before main is called so you will need to modify your local crt0.s or its equivalent to get that hardware initialization done before the global constructor themselves are called

813274
attributes	properties
you can use generated attributes for your properties to change the behaviour

813276
command-line	cmd
the sad truth is that central administration doesn t always execute cmd the same way that stsadm command-line utility does and stsadm does it correctly

813277
inherited	subclass
the only issue i ve had is with model inheritedance you always have to define the manager in model subclasses just objects querysetmanager in the subclass even though they will inherited the queryset

813278
windows-vista	windows
microsoft removed this functionality in windows-vista and later in order to make windows explorer more like a web browser

813289
callback	methods
another option is to use a thread callback methods

813297
decimal-point	digits
decimal 18 0 will allow 0 digits after the decimal-point

813297
decimal-point	digits
that gives you a total of 18 digits 4 of which after the decimal-point and 14 before the decimal-point

813322
order	add
order your initial query - add creation desc

813323
configuration	logging
i understand this is subjective but please provide concrete reasons of why you have your opinion such as acme logging worked very well in that configuration or it didn t support remote monitoring which we needed etc

813339
decimal-point	digits
a is the max number of digits you can have after the decimal-point

813343
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
no it s case-sensitive by default at least though you ll want to check - if option compare is set to binary or not set then it s case-sensitive if it s set to text then it s case-insensitive

813350
dialog	pop-up
i think the problem is that you are moving the pop-up and calling focus before the dialog is fully created

813357
lookup	any
perhaps you could change that logic to lookup the data that goes to the list of t-shirts and see if there are any existing t-shirts with that color -- then prompt the user to say you have deactivated red but you have red t-shirts

813372
wait	hang
so not only might a thread wait longer than expected or even indefinitely it may become completely unresponsive causing the entire program to hang

813383
constructor	object
i am creating a single base factory function to drive factories of different types but have some similarities and i want to be able to pass arguments as an arrays to the base factory which then possibly creates an instance of a new object populating the arguments of the constructor of the relevant class via an arrays

813391
specifications	srs
software requirement specifications srs

813401
constructor	object
all the keyword new does is pass in a new object to the constructor which then becomes the this variables inside the constructor function

813418
value	field
i am trying to set the field to a certain value after the form is initialized

813424
hosts-file	hosts
my initial thought is that you are missing an entry in the hosts

813424
directory	folder
this includes public folder in the user s directory

813437
hosts-file	hosts
edit your c windows system32 drivers etc hosts

813456
include	ssi
the best you can do is using ssi to include files

813458
output	cat
the output of ls | cat which is significantly faster might not be enough because that one cannot distinguish files from directory

813463
versioning	migrate
i did choose one of the legacy free versioning though started with pic18 migrate to dspic33

813463
16-bit	8bit
one typically programs the more modern pic18 8bit and the 16-bit architectures 24f 30f and dspic33 which are based on the same principal core in c

813463
microchip	avr
another note meanwhile microchip pic bought avr but i assume that for the first few years that won t affect the productlines much

813487
transfer-encoding	chunked
transfer-encoding chunked

813488
global-asax	web-config
since my project have its own global-asax web-config error handling...etc

813491
order	join
then all you need is an inner join and an order by

813492
decimal-point	digits
the settings for decimal are its precision and scale or in normal language how many digits can a number have and how many digits do you want to have to the right of the decimal-point

813505
32-bit	64bit
also ntfs-3g was funny under 64bit while it worked under 32-bit same distro same kernel same partition it just hung in some circumstances

813522
svn-merge	revert
2 specify a revert on the working copy using svn-merge -r

813533
interpreter	runtime
also be careful to defend your positioning with solutions that require even more skill like embedding interpreter multilingual projects changes of runtime etc

813539
selected	textbox
the best way to do this is to put an textbox somewhere and creat an event for your datagridview on row selected event

813543
slimdx	xna
basically i have checked out xna and some of slimdx promit which has lots of struct

813553
reflection	runtime
in general it s a bad idea to use if your language runtime support it reflection in order to gain access to variables that aren t intended to be visible to your code

813554
backtracking	n-queens
this seems like a pretty obvious case for depth-first-search with backtracking as with the n-queens problem

813574
value	field
optimistic locking works fine for most cases where your records are composed of short simple fields a short string or single numeric value per field giving users the greatest access to the data and not forcing them to worry about locks and stuff

813574
value	field
when user a saves a record the database only updates the field that user a has changed along with any other field that depend on those changed value

813574
value	field
this avoids overwriting with old value the field changed by user b since user a retrieved the record

813574
business-process	integration
if thereâ s really a high chance of wasted work by user integration itâ s better to prevent it through the design of the business-process rather than database locks

813586
carbon	cocoa
it even uses carbon on mac working on cocoa

813614
updating	updates
there is a button to updates the assembly and a button to toggle each function s existence making adding removing updating functions a breeze

813614
attributes	properties
the attributes has a table properties and a field properties which helps the utility build the check constraints

813622
hide	show
you might consider using the hide show methods as well

813626
perl	php
java c perl python ruby php i prefer python but are there performance concerns

813626
turbogears	cherrypy
what other frameworks are out there to consider cherrypy turbogears ruby-on-rails ...

813635
filtering	grouping
then you filtering out the xx strings grouping on the grouping number and filtering out the empty groupinging

813646
haskell	sml
much as i love haskell here are the reasons i would prefer sml for a class in discrete math and data structures and most other beginners classes

813651
arrays	map
at least to me it is a truly remarkable achievement to take the abstractions we do in programming and map those into arrays of bits and bytes that not only are faithful representations of our abstractions but can also be manipulated in ways that generate new creative abstractions themselves

813651
any	set
we might understand that the way that the instances are set up by the runtime is by a reference that holds the instance data so that two objects of the same type donâ t share data duh but i doubt that very many developers understand that the clr doesnâ t have any single place where class information residesâ it actually only has methods information and instance information then links the two under the rubric of a â typeâ

813668
haskell	scheme
operating systems have been written in standard ml scheme and even haskell

813669
python	java
so python on google app engine or a java applet running in a sandbox is still turing-complete

813692
bazaar	git
both git and bazaar has good support for svn

813694
windows-xp	windows
this code works in windows-xp but in windows vista i get an unauthorizedexception

813694
any	set
is there any way to bypass the uac in vista to set a registry key

813695
versioning	upgrade
while one of these transitions is going on all the distros upgrade at their own pace you ideally want to release libs with abis supporting the full range of gcc versioning in use by your users

813704
python	ruby
easiest probably to write a python or ruby program

813722
contains	any
is there any way to pull from a branch contains only this file

813734
version-control	git
you ll be able to use all of the local version-control and change review features of git but ultimately can push up final check-ins to your existing svn repository

813739
contains	set
and the second column in the row will include a nested result set contains the bills for that product

813755
double	int
i m able to work the examples but he doesn t explain exactly why he s using a class in that way nsnumber instead of int or double for example

813760
processor	cpu
regarding os - you still need processor that runs instructions and compiler that translation language into cpu instructions

813760
do-while	goto
if your language is like c but without goto operators loop operators for while do-while and functions then you can not write cyclic program and no environment and libraries can help you

813775
identity-column	sql-server
on sql-server this is called an identity-column

813780
exception-handling	try-catch
i can wrap each child methods call in its own try-catch and throw the custom exception-handling i want but thats just another level of try-catch that gets trapped by another try-catch in addsupportticket and then one in the user-interface to redirect to an intelligent error so that doesn t sound great to me

813791
doxygen	latex
headerdoc only produces html output while doxygen also produces pdf latex and many other output forms besides html

813792
configuration	logging
lots of great stuff on raising wrapping logging exceptions from and between layers as well as setting up policies so you can handle it in configuration if you want to

813800
webserver	host
we had a similar problem where our webserver all froze up because our php was making connections to a mysql server that was set up to do reverse host lookups on incoming connections

813805
instances	private
inside your class you have a reference to the private delegate instances so that s why you can do the assignment

813809
associations	model
see the activerecord api the belongs_to associations is always used in the model that has the foreign key. this makes some sense if you think about the way that belongs_to interacts with both has_one and has_many as you obviously can t put the foreign keys in the has_many model

813836
double	int
as such it provides both primitive-types like int and double and objects

813836
nsinteger	int
it can however contain an nsint which is an objective-c class that represents an int

813838
oracle	mysql
oracle and db2 have sequence but i think you are looking for identity and all major dbms mysql sql server db2 oracle support it

813840
executable	upx
virus scanners that look for unknown viruses can flag upx compressed executable as having a virus

813845
solaris	freebsd
if you are using a macosx solaris or recent freebsd system you can throw a little dtrace at it

813851
treeset	treemap
treemap treeset

813872
solid-principles	principles
there are good principles out there such as solid-principles that will allow you to design and build good meaningful classes

813874
double	int
i m able to work the examples but he doesn t explain exactly why he s using a class in that way nsnumber instead of int or double for example .

813874
double	int
nsnumber is a much more useful type than a primitive type like int or double as it is often used in conjunction with other objects you ll run into as you program in cocoa

813874
double	int
for example in order to package a number as a value into a resizable arrays like an nsmutablearrays or an associative arrays an instance of nsdictionary you need to turn the number primitive int double etc. into a serialization or archivable object â an nsnumber

813874
double	int
that s not to say you can t or shouldn t use int or double variables

813878
textbox	button
then in your xaml you ll have to create a textbox and a button to show a dialog

813878
textbox	button
although you re design options are greatly increased in xaml so you re not locked into the textbox - browse button

813879
margins	padding
the most common case for me is when i need something to have a particular padding margins to be in the right place but it s not an element important enough to have its own id

813883
scp	ssh
i have ssh keys in place so the connection should work since i can use scp without problems

813898
any	set
so when library a was compiled any methods that takes a parameter of type tchar was set to expect a parameter of type char and methodss in library b are set to expect a parameter of type wchar

813915
perl	ruby
you can write scripts for vim in many powerful languages depending on how your vim is compiled such as perl python ruby

813924
derived-class	inherited
if you want to program against the higher concept as well as the derived-class then its inherited

813933
bazaar	git
the python core development team just decided to switch from subversion to mercurial after a long discussion c period where git and bazaar were also considered

813941
double-pointer	pointers
i feel that a double-pointers for the target string should be passed to this function which will be like passing the address of the pointers variable and not the pointers itself

813978
constructor	object
update one other thing to note - try creating instances of the same type with these different methods and then checking to see if their constructor properties are the same - you may want that to be the case if you ever need to check the type of an object

813993
linux	osx
i ve done light ruby-on-rails development on both osx and linux ubuntu and i found the differences to be almost imperceptible in terms of ruby and ruby-on-rails.

813993
linux	unix
a low hassle alternative for setting up a unix environment for ruby-on-rails development is to run one of the easier to use linux distributions like ubuntu or fedora under virtualization software like vmware virtualbox virtualpc etc

814001
json	xml
i am not sure in the json.net framework is it possible to convert a string in json to xml format and viceversa

814027
json	xml
documentation here converting between json and xml with json.net

814039
integer	zero
an integer and 03d for an integer left padded with zero of length 3

814045
traffic	subnet
note that any configuration that involves using a router like the suggestion to use a linux router etc. will only allow you to affect traffic between hosts that are on different subnet

814055
yacc	alex
happy yacc alex lex

814065
json	xml
but if you do it first convert from json to object then from object to xml and vice versa for reverse direction

814109
postgresql	mysql
i use the navicat clients for mysql and postgresql and am happy with them

814134
webforms	asp.net
when we built .net ria services we looked to enable developers to basically build out rapid ria s 100 and as a result we targeted the approach in terms of taken over the burden of asp.net webforms etc

814145
switching	router
but sending a whole new configuration is a pretty blunt instrumentation for controlling your router or switching

814173
priority-queue	heap
now at a lower level it may be that how this works is that internally it s a heap or a priority-queue or whatever

814173
linked-list	tree
and those things may be implemented in terms of tree or self-balancing tree or even sub-optimally a linked-list

814173
traversal	parent
and those things are implemented in terms of tree traversal pre-order always go in the order left parent right

814178
constructor	object
you can then make a jdbctemplate bean and pass in the datasource as a constructor argument and then inject the jdbctemplate into whatever dao object you re using

814185
number-theory	primes
it depends on the chinese remainder theorem from number-theory and the existence of arbitrarily-long arithmetic sequences of primes

814192
mousemove	mouseup
override the paint methods to draw the sizing grip and override the mousedown mouseup and mousemove methodss to add resizing functionality to the control

814210
python	perl
there are also tools to make applications from shell scripts perl python etc

814233
javascript	dom
no screen-scraping library i know does well with javascript -- it s just too hard to anticipate all ways in which js could alter the html dom dynamically conditionally c

814236
contains	any
copy using any methods contains the word copy

814245
web-inspector	webkit
get the latest version of webkit it has a much more powerful version of web-inspector which you can use side by side with the latest safari two browsers open to debugging safari

814251
implements	extends
in you case you ve said to be a valid t a class must implements comparable the keyword is extends but in practice that means extends or implementss .

814251
superclass	subclass
actually to cover more complicated situations where a subclass s implementation of comparable is done by a superclass the more general form would be

814254
any	set
any mixin in the future that wants to add extra functionality to the query set simply needs to extend basemixin or have it somewhere in its heirarchy

814254
any	set
any time i try to filtering the query set down i wrapped it in a try-catch in case that field doesn t actually exist ie it doesn t extend that mixin

814277
malloc	free
generally in objective-c memory must be managed manually via either old c style malloc free or via the reference counting system of retain release

814283
callback	methods
in the interim i have implemented a reflection-based general purpose methods callback in java

814285
freebsd	bsd
i m trying to compile perl 5.10 on my freebsd 7.1 bsd server but when i run the configure script and answer the questions i get the following error

814291
communication	messages
the new thing for managing messages and communication between apps apparently is rabbit

814299
parentheses	operators
if all you want to do is write multi-line lambdas you can string several statements together using the semi-colon operators inside parentheses

814308
python	c++
zeromq has api bindings for c c++ python .net mono and more

814308
python	java
openamq has api binding for python java ruby and c

814334
deployment	install
to ease my deployment i plan to create an install for it

814341
textbox	button
but on clicking submit button where i have written code to save there i am not getting value in textbox

814342
required	checked
of course you could change your preprocessor checked to be normals code checked which can obviously be switched as required

814344
logging	trace
what i usually do is to make sure that my code contains a lot of logging that is activated by trace switches

814344
configuration	logging
that way you can have a system run in production with little or no logging and when you want to research some problem you can switch logging on by altering the configuration file

814376
internet-explorer	google-chrome
in safari google-chrome opera and internet-explorer tested in ie7 and ie8 this will return the following

814376
double-quotes	single-quotes
the single-quotes have been replaced by double-quotes

814376
double-quotes	spaces
also note how the indentation spaces was replaced by four spacess. this gives the impression that at least one browser parsing javascript internally as if everything was written using double-quotes

814376
double-quotes	single-quotes
it seems that single-quotes are sometimes faster in explorer windows roughly 1 3 of my tests did show a faster response time but if mozilla show a difference at all it handles double-quotes slightly faster

814394
any	set
good thing with jms is that if you have that infrastructure set up you don t have to configure any firewalls and so on to let it through.

814408
python	java
as others have said follow pep8 if you re writing python follow sun s java style guide if you re writing java and if you re doing linux kernel hacking follow their style guide

814444
checkbox	textbox
i have a gridview that displays items details i added two templates fields one is a checkbox and the other is a textboc what i want is simply to check all the items the customer wants to buy and write down the quantity in the textbox when i click on a button i should check all rows in the gridview and when the checkbox is checked then i should compare the value in the textbox with the value in a databound field of the gridview called quantity and then carry on my order function.

814459
firefox	safari
the best way to do browser compatibility in general is to start with completely standards-based clean semantic markup that works in for example firefox 3 and safari uses xhtml and an xhtml doctype

814462
buffering	streaming
for transferring mass data i would usually recommend either just a stored procedure if the processing can be done in the database - or if you need richer code something like sqlbulkcopy hooked to an idatareader - this will allow you to streaming data from one table to the other with the minimum of buffering overhead

814464
64bit	x86
it failed to run in x86 mode on my 64bit desktop

814466
pointers	stack
then you have stack pointers ebp which points to the beginning of your stack

814466
64bit	x86
on x86 there are some special cases where two registers get fused when doing 64bit integer computations

814479
domain-driven-design	facade
a repository acts like a collection except with more elaborate querying capability evans domain-driven-design and may be considered as an objects in memory facade repository discussion

814479
datamapper	poeaa
a datamapper moves data between objects and a database while keeping them independent of each other and the mapper itself fowler poeaa mapper

814526
selected	listbox
some of these users work for more than one department which means i need some type of listbox control that allows them to selected more than one department when they enter their contact info

814526
selected	listbox
the option of a listbox or combobox is not feasible here as these only allow the user to selected one option only when inputting their details

814530
set	bag
depending on how you ve created your class and your mapping i think this is the only way since a set and bag mapping represent un-ordered collections in nhibernate

814537
debugging	trace
you can use gdb to trace in to the c-level code provided you have php compiled with debugging symbols

814547
revision	svn
when you have found it update to the newest head revision then apply the svn merge as suggested above

814550
positioning	slider
and i want to databind the value of the slider directly to the storyboards timeline positioning

814573

814770
default-value	arguments
re that s just a methods arguments with a default-value

814770

so if you call hidden_div_if whatever that is passing only the first arguments attributes would default to an empty hash

814773
attributes	properties
for strings i use validators that use reflection to get the maximum lengths of the strings from the column attributes on the linq entity properties and check these

814773
value	field
for boolean which default to false validate the value provider has an attempted value for the field in addition to doing validation on the entity itself

814798
turing-complete	lambda-calculus
on the other hand there is no way to modify any value in the lambda-calculus but it is turing-complete so it it is clearly possible to do it without mutable memory

if-statement	while-loop
a form of conditional goto if-statement while-loop etc

814811
actionscript	mxml
from a programmer s viewpoint the big difference between flash and flex is not so much which ide application you use for programming but whether you program in actionscript as only or use the flex framework and mxml to program your applications

814811

in that article it says memcached is slow and apc is fast so why is everyone choosing memcached

815041
memcached	apc
and a slow one like file sqlite... do you think using apc as the fast and memcached as the slow is a good idea

815047
memcached	apc
so you could for example be using apc for increased execution performance while using memcached for cache storage

815569
contains	elements
you need to only grab the elements with an appropriate jquery selector and then the .val methods to get the string contains in the input textbox and then call the .length on that string

815569
contains	elements
on another note to get the length of a string contains in another non-input elements you can use the .text function to get the string and then use .length on that string to find its length

815582

815622
hash	md5
i d like random-looking ids md5 hash but i also want them to be small

815622
hash	md5
the basis of an id is an md5 hash of the following string user-email-address | latest-counter-value

815622
hash	md5
the resulting md5 hash is then truncated initially to four characters

815622
hash	md5
md5 hash for new ids will now be truncated at length characters rather than four characters

815622
hash	md5
would the length quickly increase to near the length of an md5 hash calling into question the value of the whole approach

815622
hash	md5
would it be better just to go with the full longer md5 hash in order to keep things easier to maintain

815634
webserver	security
if security is a concern put them in a location that is not accessible by the webserver and write a script that handles security and serves up the files

in a view code like this will generate the right url to jump to controller s action methods based on the routes in your global.asax.cs file

815845
controller	routes
some controller actions need to redirect the browser and i want to redirect to a controller and action without hard-wiring the url into the controller which would break if i changed the way my routes mapped these urls to controllers and actions

815846
abstract-class	subclassing
consider for example an abstract-class shape with concrete subclassing circle square and triangle

815874
contains	set
generally map functions take an input set and a function and returns a set contains the function output for each input element

when ever user click play button on new popup windows i have to play the all audio songs selected by user one by one

815911
constructor	object
such as toolbar object needs to know about the mainframe and main menu needs to know about both frame and toolbar so i end up passing references to lots of objects through constructor

815932
implements	extends
but if you have a hierarchy like yy extends xx and xy implements yy the compiler can infer the correct methods to call

815945
any	set
you must set the uithreadid in a atomic manner and must do so before any background code runs

815961
wait	hang
but if i do the browser hang while trying to wait for more data

815966
transfer-encoding	chunked
or use chunked transfer-encoding

815971
transfer-encoding	chunked

816008
strtol	atoi
for the secondary question look for atoi atof strtol 0 strtof functions

816011
bash	zsh

816013
arrays	loops
first i would like to loops through all the values in the arrays foreach loops then i would like to limit this while loops is this a correct method for doing this

816018
constructor	object
this toy example is easily converted to using dependency injection by passing an instance of an otherclass object as a parameter to the constructor but that s not always the case

816028
swing	swt
consolidated and java usually don t go together but aside from that there is pivot thinlet swing and swt

816030

816036
decrement	increment
when the web service is called it will increment or decrement the vote count

816036
selected	button
you use a client side ajax library such as jquery or use the buser-interfacelt in support for web-service client code in asp.net - this code runs in the browser - you need to hook up this code so that when the user selected a vote button in your user-interface the client side code calls your web service to increment or decrement the vote

816038
worksheet	excel
i am writing a perl tk script which displays excel worksheet using the ss2tk example script from the spreadsheet read module

base-class	inherited
in order to do inherited you have to use the base-class to create a new class which can then be used to produce derived instances

816075
required	checked
in the newer versioning you had the ability to checked some kinds of correctness at the compiler that would otherwise have required testing

816075
deep-copy	object

command-prompt	cmd
cmd from my cmd-prompt and this is what i m getting

816157
external	host
in fact sometimes if the host machine is on the weaker side having the vm on an external drive increases performance

816164
twitter	tweets
i m currently working on an app that works with twitter but while developing testing especially those parts that don t rely heavily on real twitter data i d like to avoid constantly hitting the api or publishing junk tweets

816170
icollection	ienumerator
icollection ilist or ienumerator

816185
arguments	default
the mode arguments default to the midpoint between the bounds giving a symmetric distribution

816210
order	add
in order to add new controls to the form the code might look something like this

816212
python	ruby
what would be the reasoning behind a mobile os being written in python ruby or any other dynamic language

816212
python	c++
i understand that at a low level they would not cut it but c or c++ would be fine for that and python for example could be the layer on top to interact with it

816234
postgresql	mysql
i am aware that mysql and postgresql 1 do not have that concept so i am interested in finding out of there is an open-source sql database that does have the concept

816266
python	java
keeping development simple a platform that supports say python and ruby and java out of the box

816278
content-management	publishing

816301
xargs	cut
killall is a wrapper around kill that is basically the equivalent of ps -aux | grep | cut -f2 -d | xargs kill or the like if you re a shell junky

816312
moss	wss
real world sharepoint 2007 indispensable experiences from 16 moss and wss mvps

816317
owasp	xss
xss is only one of many exploits and every web dev should learn the top 10 owasp by heart imho

816325
safari	opera
kaleidoscope opera others maybe safari not shows lots of pieces moving around and i found inspirational

816329
droppable	draggable
for example i used it to bind draggable and droppable to some dom elements which will be added through ajax

816339
keyboard	mouse
i am able to reproduce keyboard and mouse interaction from the browser to the remote machine

816342
output	cat
in any other terminal including those in screen sessions you can now cat files or redirect output of programs into tmp pbcopy.pipe and the text will appear in the clipboard

816350
.when	ready
for example .when i attempt to receive the 220 gateway ready reply it arrives like this

816365
value	field
or should i update some value in the date field for those rows..

816371
quirks-mode	doctype
to remove quirks-mode add a doctype definition to the top like so

816372
account	api
the newest app engine sdk 1.2.1 has an api call to compute an id for a user account based on his email address

816372
constructor	object
user_id works for logged-in users from users.get_current_user but it returns none for object created by the users.user constructor

816386
typedef	struct
i suspect that it s impossible without the struct because c requires types to be defined before they are used and there s no opaque syntax for typedef

816432
freebsd	netbsd
you could try to do something nuts like perhaps trying to get the openbsd userland to run on a netbsd kernel with freebsd ports but you d be on your own and it certainly wouldn t be hardened

816484
virtual-functions	base-class
the base-class must have virtual-functions to get you what you want making these pure will result in an abstract base-class -- something you cannot instantiate

816499
exception-handling	try-catch
try wrapping the stream insertion character in a try-catch block and tell us what if any exception-handling it throws

816500
contains	elements
contains all of the elements in the

816500
contains	elements
elements that are not contains in the

816500
duplicates	elements
i would not have made an assumption with regard to number of duplicates elements after a call to retainall

816500
contains	elements
result contains 1 of each elements that has at least one copy in both a and b

816500
duplicates	contains
result contains each element including duplicates that was in a except those that are not in b

816500
contains	elements
or even result contains somewhere between 1 and the number of copies found in a of each elements in a except those not in b

816511
perl	php
i d like to access this info through php ruby perl etc to work with in a script

816512
jquery	.post
i am trying to use the tinymce text editor but am not being able to get the contents of the editor using jquery and also if i use the simple .post method to get the value i get the text but am not getting the image

816523
revision	svn
what is the maximum revision number supported by svn

816575
itemtemplate	treeview
i m trying to get the sl tookit march 2009 accordion control to populate the itemtemplate of a treeview control but it doesn t render properly just a 1x1 pixel square

816576
ruby-on-rails	camping
i would like to use a lighter framework than ruby-on-rails sinatra ramaze camping but am concerned that by doing so i will not be able to use a lot of shared libraries that have been tailored to ruby-on-rails in the form of plugins

816580
order	add
the only thing i ll add is you probably want to use order by date desc at the end of most of these queries

816580
order	add
and if you have multiple matching dates you ll want to add additional column order to get the correct values deleted

816612
decimal	hex
it is not the shortest solution but it handles named entities as well as hex and decimal codes

816651
implements	extends
just extends windowadapter rather than implements windowlistener

816656
switching	router
i assume that the iphone wi-fi hardware is able to switching between channels since my wlan router show me channel 1 to 13

816658
textbox	button
i want to make it like if i click the button once arr 0 goes to the textbox and if i click button again arr 1 goes to textbox

816663
sql-server	mysql
i don t know mysql but in sql-server i d use the xml datatype and pass all of the ids into a statement using that

816672
display	width
when you create a column as bigint 44 the 44 is the display width - it does not affect the range of values you can store or the speed at which they are retrieved

816672
unsigned	bigint
for an auto-incrementing id you want to use an unsigned number bigint 44 unsigned

816672
unsigned	bigint
an unsigned bigint will store up to 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 - you re not going to fill that any time soon

816676
windows-xp	windows
one windows desktop with windows-xp and windows vista installed dual boot

816676
keyboard	mouse
both machines run synergy sharing the keyboard and mouse across machines so i can easily switch between the two

816701
audio	ogg
i am looking to use ogg vorbis instead of mp3s to stream audio

816710
any	set
i am a delphi programmer and in delphi i would use the listview control set its ownerdata property to true and then use the ondata event to make a given item with a specified index display any piece of data from an arrays item having the same index

816710
contains	set
i set the listbox.datasource property to myarraylist contains keyvaluepairs

816732
configuration	environment
maybe it is wrong approach - to store all this environment dependent information in the repository - in that case we can break everything by commiting a modified configuration for example

816743
grouping	sorting
you are sorting the grouping instead of sorting the invaders and you are using take with a random number that can be zero so that it may return an empty result

816743
grouping	sorting
this works for grouping the invaders by x coordinate sorting them by y coordinate picking a group by random and getting the invader with the highest y coordinate

816744
getter	setter
to address what bevan suggested in vb.net you can declare a property as having a public getter and a protected setter as follows

816795
multiplication	division
you need integer division and multiplication

816799
httpverbs	put
both are strongly typed so there s no real difference there and the httpverbs enum include delete head and put which aren t in the asp.net-mvc contrib versioning

816807
updating	updates
br basically when you want to updates the picture in the listbox you are updating the picture property of your narudzba class and since your narudzba class does not implement the inotifypropertychanged interface the listbox can t updates the picture

816843
attributes	properties
both these will slow down any attributes access to your class however so in general using properties is probably best

816864
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this implementation has to take place using webforms although it looks like using asp.net-mvc would be the ideal approach considering the above

816868
base-class	inherited
we had this for several years and there was nothing we could put in our base-class that was generic enough that it applied to all inherited classes

816879
zipfile	archive
maybe better to give them the option to collect the files into an archive a zipfile and have your server unpack them when received

816883
attributes	properties
castle activerecord is one alternative - it s a layer on top of nhibernate which among other things lets you declare your relationships using attributes on your classes and properties

816901
directory	folder
in this folder we have components directory such as

816943
value	field
if you are using access 2007 you can declare your field as a lookup field accepting multiple value

816943
value	field
multiple value field are not compatible with most other databases meaning that if you decide one day to upsize to sql-server you ll have to redesign your tables to use a junction table as remou mentioned

816943
value	field
these multi-value field are difficult to use from vba the value they return is in fact another recordset that you must iterate through to get all the values

816945
execute	prepare
prepare an insert statement and execute it multiple times

816945
insert-into	prepare
prepare insert-into t col1 col2 col3 value

816961
tcpdf	fpdf
on we use tcpdf which is based on fpdf

817010
png	gif
side note you will want to change your image to a png jpg or gif as bmp is not a fully supported web browser image format

817021
document	element
the only solution i can think of is to base64 encode the image and pass it through as an element of the xml document

817023
base-class	inherited
i haven t done an enterprise asp.net-mvc app yet but i figure i would probably make a base-class that inherited controllers and defines those extra properties

817031
contains	elements
at the least you should use an xsi type attributes on the elements contains your encoded content

817044
arrays	loops
then you can implement your loops looking at the actual data you have in whichever way your jagged arrays are formed

817046
any	set
in visual web developer 2008 express edition at least the scripting folder does not contain any of the globalization scripting the 205 files af-za.js that define and set up __cultureinfo for that culture

817050
methods	extend
jquery s extend methods does perform a deep-copy when a true value is passed as the initial argument

817060
execute	declare
failing that is there a way to declare that all files created in a particular directory should have execute permissions

817061
environment	building
furthermore we d really like to chain the release building at the end of all of these but our integration-testing aren t stable enough for this flaky back-end environment with bad slas in development - i hate it

817062
cygwin	gnu
mingw minimalist gnu for windows is one option but i always steer people towards cygwin since other than a build environment it offers a slew of other things which come in really handy

817063
.when	ready
this ready function show .when people will see your page building up

817096
codeigniter	cakephp
someone told me about cakephp and codeigniter

817114
dialog	pop-up
using wmi you can get the eject drive dialog to pop-up using

817115
cakephp	symfony
lastly the other danger with frameworks is that they can be so invasive that you re no longer doing php you re doing cakephp symfony or whatever

817118
cakephp	symfony
the popular php frameworks like cakephp codeigniter zend framework symfony follow model view controller asp.net-mvc design pattern which separates business logic from user interface also making the code cleaner and extensible

817121
hash	md5
you will not come across an accidental md5 sha1 sha2xxx hash ever

817121
hash	md5
every path name on every machine in the entire planet has a different md5 sha1 sha2xxx hash

817122
contains	any
however the next code deletes as well digits contains in any word and obviously i don t want that

817135
testng	junit
i m using junit 4 i can t use testng

817136
memcached	apc
i m not sure memcached would really help you out so much but its worth adding as is apc for your php cahcing and i would at least architect it to be able to be load balanced - check out ultramonkey for some good documentation on how to get that going transparently you ll need to ensure that any user session that comes in doesn t store its session data in a per-host way

817139
unmanaged	c++-cli
my user-controls references a c++-cli wrapper to an unmanaged c++ dll

817139
unmanaged	c++-cli
from what i ve been able to determine the problem stems from visual-studio not copying the c++-cli wrapper assembly s unmanaged dependencies

817154
oscommerce	cart
oscommerce one of the most successful shopping cart ever is mostly unmaintable

817155
.when	ready
all my li elements under the sort class function properly .when the dom is ready

817162
any	set
a class is used to set styles which might be used in more than one place in your html file - any element can have multiple classes set

817163
vb.net	vb6
i am coming from vb6 and i am starting to convert an existing vb6 code to vb.net

817167
ruby	php
a web application php ruby on rails ...

817173
put	get
this should get the .dll into your output directory so that your application can run and just including the file in the project should put it in the project directory so that the designer can find it

817175
entity-framework	nhibernate
i would probably look into using an or m like nhibernate linq to sql entity-framework subsonic etc

817180
value	field
now i want to have some automatic auditing of my tables so that whenever a linqedtable record is inserted or deleted or a field value changes i will insert a record into an audit table detailing the change type the field name and its value pre- and post-save

817183
exponentiation	mod
the part that takes all the time is the 10 n-1 mod y but we can do that with fast o log n modular exponentiation

817183
32-bit	64bit
if y requires 32-bit then you need to do 32x32 multiply and then 64bit 32-bit modulus or you need an algorithm that circumvents this limitation

817188
.net	wcf
now since it s a wcf service that is being used by outside sources you shouldn t just throw an exception - that s a .net specific thing - but rather throw a soap fault

817188
.net	wcf
you can do this easily in .net wcf by throwing a faultexception or a more specific faultexception a generic variant in which you can specify the exakt type of fault

817196
.when	ready
else the output is not ready .when you try to read it

817225
internet-explorer	google-chrome
according to mdn outerhtml is supported in firefox 11 google-chrome 0.2 internet-explorer 4.0 opera 7 safari 1.3 android firefox mobile 11 ie mobile opera mobile and safari mobile

817230
internet-explorer	google-chrome
according to mdn outerhtml is supported in firefox 11 google-chrome 0.2 internet-explorer 4.0 opera 7 safari 1.3 android firefox mobile 11 ie mobile opera mobile and safari mobile

817234
python	java
i know there is a python clone of haml not sure about java

817246
direct3d	directx
there is a set of direct3d bindings for java available at but it seems that developement stopped in 2006 with directx 9

817267
traffic	packets
the traffic need not be huge if you use an http head request you ll get a small packets with the date of the last modification conveniently named last-modified

817278
inherited	subclass
this approach is a lot more brittle since the junit4 internal runners are unstable and can be changed from release to release but it has the advantage of being able to be inherited down a class hierarchy and be overridden in a subclass

817282
subclass	accessor
then i could subclass the networkmanager override the buildconnection methods and add an instance variables plus an accessor for the created connection

817284
value	field
my intentions are to have a form submit many value for 3 field to then create an object for each combination of those field and to save each of those objects

817285
malloc	free
to me the current level of concurrency language support is roughly equivalent to the memory-management support in c not integrated but some things can be delegated to the os malloc free

817285
malloc	free
i wish some language would come up with a suitable abstraction that either makes the threads + synchronization model easier or that simply completely hides it for us just as automatic memory-management make good old malloc free obsolete in java

817295
for-loop	arrays
a traditional for-loop is most appropriate when you already have an arrays or list of things you want to process

817325
webforms	asp.net
we re moving an existing webforms site over to asp.net mvc

817327
xquery	xslt
i use and recommend xquery over xslt

817344
32-bit	16-bit
in the old days on 16-bit machines like the original ibm pc ints were 16-bit and longs were 32-bit

817344
ubuntu	linux
on my linux box also with a core 2 duo and ubuntu int is 32 bits and long is 64 bits

817344
32-bit	16-bit
the interviewer pressed me and i said it would depend on the architecture since at that time windows used 16-bit ints but since i was doing unix programming i was more used to 32-bit ints

817348
32-bit	64bit
every 64bit platform i ve worked with has had long fit the natural word size so 32-bit on a 32-bit architecture and 64 bits on a 64bit architecture

817351
integer	short
short is the smallest integer type

817352
16-bit	8bit
historically there have been 8bit and 16-bit as well as the more familiar 32 bit and 64 bit architectures

817354
selected	textbox
i have a problem i am using the method in listview listview.selecteditems 0 to return the currently selected listviewitem into an argument in a function that displays the text of the item into a textbox when selected

817355
bazaar	git
finally an option that doesn t have a huge drawback use version control particularly one of the distributed ones where you don t have to send your changes to a remote server - git mercurial darcs bazaar etc all have textmate integration also

817359
any	set
i have set show_sql to true and it does not print out any statement

817363
select	union
the union approach is a hack that allows mysql to utilize indexes for all the selects and will most likely be faster than the corresponding query using a single select and several or statements

817408
json.net	wcf
one approach is to use the wcf raw programing model described by carlos figueria in combination with json.net

817408
json.net	wcf
i ve found json.net to be far more flexible and configurable than the wcf json serializers

817430
document	element
you could then also do something akin to what jquery does now with its hidden selector instead of looking at the css property by itself which is what a webmaster is most likely to try you can just see whether the element itself or its parents take up any spaces in the document

817434
tostring	equals
and this would create a bean private fields default accessors tostring hashcode equals etc

817439
gethashcode	equals
the tag class implements equals and gethashcode and uses the name property as the only signature property

817463
any	set
i have rechecked the c++ standard 3.9.1 char size shall be large enough to store any member of the implementation s basic character set

817465
interactive	chaco
enthought s chaco is designed for interactive updating plots

817481
cursor	row
all open does effectively to selected the matching rows into temporary memory so you can advance the cursor row by row

817484
background-color	transparency
you need to set the frame of the uiview in your uiviewcontroller appropriately and i guess you might have to set the background-color transparency

817492
nsinteger	int
if you want to create a c arrays of primitive nsinteger int values you can use the built-in qsort â function of c

817506
python	perl
there are packages available for ubuntu debian and bindings in a bunch of languages including perl python ruby.

817520
input-field	selected
the alternative is to dynamically add multiple input-field to the form using javascript but that still requires the user to individually selected files

817521
directory	folder
when users upload the image i save it to the image folder in htdocs directory

817524
stream	send
i would like to record the user s integration in my java applet as a video to send potentially stream to my server with the intention of uploading to youtube or similar

817552
sql-server	oracle
one of the differences between oracle and sql-server is that the latter returns result sets naturally

817610
keydown	keyup
one of those user-controls has focusable true and keydown keyup handler and i want it to have the focus as soon as my windows opens

817612
python	ruby
symbian s60 officially supports python and javascript for widgets and there s a ruby port although it s still fairly experimental

817616
entity-framework	ado.net
i m using ado.net entity-framework and c# to retreive the languages of a destination using this

817634
web-services	webserver
it doesn t interact with the webserver per se to provide application level access to data but rather interacts with web-services through ajax

817651
freebsd	linux
if you re on unix linux mac os x freebsd windows under cygwin etc. i recommend the gnu compiler collection gcc

817654
order	add
but in your own classes with your own events you should define your own realisation of add remove methods for event in order to solve your problem

817683
inlining	inline
if the compiler isn t inlining both operations then either poke it until it does or find the implementation for your architecture and inline it yourself

817690
selected	cells
i want to be able to not only selected rows and columns but also selected cells in a diagonal direction

817690
selected	cells
more than that i need the overall ability to be able to specify which cells can be selected when in another cell

817690
selected	cell
for example if i have a 10x10 table and i m in cell 4 3 row column i want to be able to say okay you can selected the following intervals from here

817694
toolchain	autotools
editing makefiles by hand can be tedious and will get in the way of your learning so i d suggest skipping right over that and go for the autotools toolchain

817695
compatibility	platform
the latest versioning was renamed and dropped many features platform compatibility

817702
python	ruby
try ruby or python for oo repls

817728
updating	updates
so in an example with multiple threads updating and reading a you won t ever be able to guarantee that the a you re reading is the same value as what you updates from some other thread may have changed the value

817747
salt	md5
fingerprint is some md5 encrypted string with a salt ex

817757
profiling	trace
that proc will run fine without any errors however if you have a profiling trace running you ll see one or two instances of error 208

817760
directory	folder
you can verify you have done this correctly by looking in your install directory for a folder named include

817760
command-line	cmd
open up a command-line as administrator right click on the cmd shortcut and then run as administrator

817761
keyboard	mouse
all keyboard mouse event processing needs to be delegated to the parent jpanel

817761
selection	cells
the jmatrix should call the selection model on selection events registered on matrix cells delegated to handler on the parent jmatrix

817770
contains	set
these dto classes would be simple poco -style classes that just contains property get set accessors no methods

817772
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if your company policy says don t use an orm then maybe classic webforms are better suited to your scenario than the asp.net-mvc pattern

817776
constructor	object
when i create a new company object a companysettings object is created in company s constructor for its settings property and then

817781
sendmessage	message
i do encode the message with utf8 and i create an instance of the copydatastruct in my app populate it then call sendmessage with the copydatastruct pointers in lparam

817813
device-driver	hardware
this include library level bufering os cashing device-driver caching hardware level cashing device block size file size hardware block sector remapping and other factors

817815
instances	self
just enrich you instancemethodwrapper class with a __get__ which can perfectly well just return self -- that is make that class into a descriptor type so that its instances are descriptor objects

817819
command-line	cmd
to be modular the dispatcher should be configured with an abstracted mapping eg a hashtable to associate each cmd token usually the first word of the cmd-line string to the cmd object that handles it

817819
exception-handling	error-handling
regarding error-handling the execute methods might just throw an exception-handling to communicate errors.

817838
action-filter	controller
now i could use tempdata to pass this value from the action-filter to any controller action methods then distribute this value over to all models that get passed to returned views

817840
contains	elements
wrapper will contains a single choice of the elements

817840
contains	elements
then make idtype contains a sequence of wrapper elements with minoccurs 1 and maxoccurs 2

817858
constructor	private
why do we need constructor and private members in the abstract class

817861
xsd	xml
wcf packages up its wsdl and xsd xml schema to describe the data being sent around into various pieces as you ve already noticed

817861
command-line	cmd
or even better you can run the svcutil -metadata cmd on the cmd-line against the dll or exe which contains your service implementation - this will create all the needed files typically several wsdl and several xsd in the directory where you run the svcutil cmd

817863
constructor	private
those derived classes will still need to call constructor and can still call members of the abstract class - which may in turn use private members

817863
constructor	private
i can t say i write abstract classes that often generally preferring composition to inheritance but when i do create them i certainly use constructor and private members

817865
stream	send
just serialization and send the stream of user-interface events with timestamps and reconstruct what the user should be seeing on your server later some visual details may depend on the user s machine setup but your applet ain t gonna be able to get to them decently anyway

817887
google-chrome	firefox
it works well in google-chrome firefox ie8 an opera.

817887
hide	show
the problems show when i click on a different link that s supposed to hide the first div and show another

817919
spring	guice
finally consider using a dependency injection framework like spring or guice

817932
abstract-class	subclassing
in addition to jon s answer i d like to mention that abstract-class still go well with composition if you keep the subclassing tree shallow

817932
subclassing	base-class
it is great for providing a common base-class for a few closely related objects but not for creating a gigantic tree of subclassing

817957
jquery	.post
in my sistuation they add data to a list via jquery .post but like i say they see nothing until a refresh and once you do a refresh it goes to the parent div as the #fragment has been lost

xsd	xml
after triple-checking that xml schema xsd regexes really don t support any of the features that would make this task easy particularly lookaheads and anchors i ve come up with an approach that seems to work

817994
mersenne-twister	generator
a better scheme altogether for c++ might be to use the boost.random library which has support for all kinds of pluggable random generator including mersenne-twister which does not have this flaw

817998
value	field
i have a lucene index where every document has several field which contains numeric value

818006
semantics	keyword
you could use the name any to name an element type but it wouldn t have the semantics of the any keyword when used in a content model

818011
webservice-client	wsdl.exe
use the wsdl.exe command utility in .net to create webservice-client proxy externally

818021
droppable	draggable
if set to invalid revert will only occur if the draggable has not been dropped on a droppable

818021
droppable	draggable
used to grouping sets of draggable and droppable items in addition to droppable s accept option

818021
droppable	draggable
a draggable with the same scope value as a droppable will be accepted by the droppable

818028
derived-class	base-class
make sure you are using the base keyword to call the appropriate overridden base-class members from within your derived-class

818049
mbunit	nunit
testing mbunit or nunit

818060
firefox	opera
note code needs to be compatible across different browsers...ie ie firefox opera etc

818073
radio-button	selected
what i d really like is something like the tabcontrol where i can selected the pages programmatically based on which radio-button is checked but without the display of the actual tabs

818092
keydown	keyup
this wasn t a problem at first but after i added some button to the form the keydown event of the form ignores the arrow keys and moves the focus from one button to the next. the keyup event works is there a way to stop this and make them do something else when i hold the arrow keys

818093
reflection	runtime
the java runtime will use reflection to figure out how to marshal and unmarshal your objects

818099
contains	set
there are three tables....dates foods activities and i need to find the sum of a result set which contains the minimum number between two values from two different tables as long as a certain statement is true

818099
contains	set
with this ex and query from my original post one that doesn t work i would be looking for a result set contains one value..8.0

818120
any	set
you need to be very careful about cleaning up any threadlocal s you get or set by using the threadlocal s remove methods

818131
rollback	commit
other dbms make statements atomicity effectively autocommit by default but start an explicit transaction with a statement such as begin work cancelling autocommit until the next commit or rollback ibm informix dynamic server is one such - when the database is not mode ansi

818131
rollback	commit
but if your program exits without doing a commit the dbms should do a rollback on your incomplete transaction - certainly if it modified the database and for simplicity even if you only selected data

818168
postgresql	mysql
if you chose sqlite or mysql or postgresql does not really matter in the column index point though

818180
postback	ajax
i use the same approach with ajax as with a regular asp.net postback

818188
any	set
http 1.1 uses us-ascii as basic character set for the request line in requests the status line in responses except the reason phrase and the field names but allows any octet in the field values and the message body

818200
rollback	commit
setrollbackonly puts a marker on the current transaction which is read when it s time to decide whether to commit or rollback

818223
sharing	share
purist views aside this can lead to practical problems with users copy-pasting and sharing urls which contains session information inadvertently exposing their sessions to friends or anyone else they share the url with

818235
radio-button	selected
to get around this we ve also tried creating an invisible radio-button and have that set as selected but couldn t find a way to make an invisible radio-button either

818255
stderr	stdout
in a unix shell if i want to combine stderr and stdout into the stdout stream for further manipulation i can append the following on the end of my command

818263
wikipedia	scrape
does anyone out there know of a collection of document i can search or websites from which i can easily scrape together a bunch of russian document aside from wikipedia

818265
file-descriptor	stdin
is the syntax to redirect a stream to another file-descriptor - 0 is stdin

818265
stderr	stdout
you can redirect stdout to stderr by doing

818265
stderr	stdout
redirects stderr to an unspecified file append redirects stderr to stdout

818274
solaris	linux
the solaris and linux 64-bit platforms

818281
32-bit	64bit
the current beta only has binaries for some 64bit versions but if you re keen on starting to beta test right now you should be able to compile from the sources on a 32-bit systems

818281
32-bit	64bit
it is a beta of course so unreliability is to be expected -- don t run it in production whether on 32-bit or 64bit systems

818284
stderr	stdout
here is one way to remember this construct although it is not entirely accurate at first may look like a good way to redirect stderr to stdout

818299
implements	extends
how would i extends or alter the above entity class and implements the acesslevels enumerator replacing the accesslevel property

818301
numerical	matrix
is there an accepted way of storing and accessing sparse numerical data such as a search engine s inverted index term by document matrix

818312
stderr	stdout
to answer your question it takes any error output normally sent to stderr and writes it to standard output stdout

818312
stderr	stdout
2 1 simply points everything sent to stderr to stdout instead

818314
windows-server	windows
yes must support windows including latest 64-bit versions like windows-server 2008

818320
methods	extend
you can t extend linq-to-sql entity types in this way via inheritance - you should instead use a partial class to add extra methods to the existing generated entity

818320
subclassing	inherited
because linq-to-sql supports inherited for discriminated tables etc it expects an exact match to a known entity type - not unexpected subclassing

818326
required	checked
i trying to understand if a isset is required during form processing when i checked _request input_name if no value is passed it doesn t cry about it and php doesn t throw out an error if you are trying to access a arrays item which doesn t exist....i can use if _request input_name .

818346
webserver	nginx
this means they can be served by your front-end webserver apache nginx etc. faster than if they were to go through mongrel thin or phusion passenger

818346
version-control	git
finally and probably most importantly you can easily version-control your posts using git or your favorite scm

818360
frame	width
my app reads frame from video using pyglet extracts a stripes region - full width by 1 to 6 video lines then pastes each stripes append it into an image that can later be written out an .png file

818368
stderr	stdout
that construct sends the standard error stream stderr to the current location of standard output stdout - this currency issue appears to have been neglected by the other answers

818368
stderr	stdout
you can redirect any output handle to another by using this methods but it s most often used to channel stdout and stderr streams into a single stream for processing

818368
stderr	stdout
note that that last one will not direct stderr to outfile2 - it redirects it to what stdout was when the arguments was encountered outfile1 and then redirects stdout to outfile2

818376
arrays	loops
in order to increment the internal row counter only when a match is made i have made another while loops that fetches a new arrays for the result

818397
authentication	impersonation
if it is an identity problem you could try setting your iis 5.1 application to use integrated windows authentication and then add the following to you web.config on your iis5.1 web site under system.web to enable impersonation

818420
webforms	asp.net
say what you like about asp.net webforms but it s very easy to get going and coupled with something like linq-to-sql or ado.net entities it s a cinch to get a bog standard crud application set up and running

818424
activerecord	datamapper
i d recommend datamapper for orm not only it s way faster than activerecord but it s also very modularly built and plugins are actual gems that you can easily install

818465
punctuation	comma
find punctuation since a spaces always follows a comma you can find the substitution rule for spacess

818501
pipe	tail
as you figured out so rapidly the best way to work with yahoo pipe is to think much like you would when making up a unix pipeline -- here the obvious unix pipeline would be to take the tail of the head and the yahoo pipe approach is perfectly analogous except that by calling head by the name of truncate they re putting a little obstacle in your way

818512
windows-server	windows
a windows service running as localsystem on a windows-server 2003 box

818520
digits	zero
can you tell me an adaptation to this so i get my month and date in 2 digits format with the leading zero if necessary

818545
.when	ready
how will we know .when our code is ready for release

818546
panels	grid
everything below the grid disappears and there is no scroll bars on the content panels

818546
panels	grid
and the grid expands the cell expands but the holding content panels is not aware

818548
httpwebrequest	webrequest
i set a break point at the first line above but for some reason i lose it after webrequest httpwebrequest webrequest.create server

818581
webforms	asp.net
the reason that i m looking at mvp pattern is because i ve noticed in all my asp.net webforms projects there are a lot of code in the code behind just for event handling along if i have a lot of server control on the web form so i was looking at the way to reduce that and come across the mvp pattern

818594
required	checked
setting a breakpoints on a comment line required the debugger and language service jump through a few more hoops and increases the chance of a problem it should still work but it s a good diagnostic checked

818595
asp.net-mvc	webforms
but if you just want to refactor an existing project as you just said then mvp is the option because there is no easy way to convert those webforms codes to asp.net-mvc

818609
click	mouse
move mouse to top left of screen and click on the orange button or click here and then click here a multi-step response is needed

818628
notepad++	emacs
edit-1 for example editors like emacs notepad2 notepad++ visual-studio - do you perchance know what mechanism they use for syn

818634
keyboard	mouse
could this be achieved by setting up a fake keyboard or mouse driver for a fake keyboard or mouse that when queried as to the current state of a key would reply giving an answer of your choice or by any other means

818644
visual-studio	release-mode
the first thing to check is that you have visual-studio set to build in debug mode not release-mode

818645
logout	login
when i logged in after positioning the modules even i logout and clear my cache if i login again the modules still the same not back to original position

818666
.net	wcf
2.0 webservice or some sort of .net rest service or wcf service

818667
tcp-ip	udp
i think c# does provide a raw socket class but if you try to emulate tcp-ip and udp and spoof addresses not belong to you re host it actually drops you re packets

818667
traffic	packets
i have done some simple tests of capturing traffic at 300mbps but that hasn t including any protocols analysis or any injection of the packets back onto the network

818667
virtual-machine	vmware
i think it will if you use the one type of network interface in vmware but i have not tried it and have no idea about the other virtual-machine providers

818674
json	xml
i have an object that fetches xml or json over a network

818683
json	xml
and return results in json xml etc

818684
asp.net-mvc	wcf
if you want to provide xml or json then you could do either wcf or asp.net-mvc

818684
json	xml
if there is a possibility of having to support other platforms from the service then i d look at using json or xml

818684
asp.net-mvc	wcf
my preference would probably be json xml and asp.net-mvc at this point just because the setup of wcf seems like overkill for a simple web service

818684
.net	wcf
older style web services in .net are being phased out in favor of wcf so i probably wouldn t go that route

818694
json	csv
probably you d be best off to modify the cobol to generate some simpler representation down to and including just a csv file although yaml or json might be a little easier to use

818699
highlight	cell
it means that you don t have to manually handle the complicated highlight cell tracking and inserting behaviours that tables require

818704
buffering	streaming
if i could even get access to the unmanaged unencrypted buffering i imagine i could do byte-by-byte streaming writing on the network streaming and hope that that keeps the password secure the whole way

818713
order	add
you will have to add an index attributes to the target of the to-many relation and maintain this index manually or maintain a mapping from object id to index in the entity that has the order to-many relationship

818722
python	c++
you can do the work in compiled c++ code in the cint interpreter or using the python bindings

818729
spawn	exit
if an updates is available the app spawn an executable that does the downloading in my case it unzips as well then re-launches the main entry point to the app and exit the updatesr

818731
expression	evaluation
expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable lazy evaluation when that is appropriate -- eigen takes care of this automatically and handles aliasing too in most cases

818735
logging	trace
this can be very powerful but usually requires that symbols are available at some point in time - either at logging or trace post processing time on the target system

818744
linux	unix
as soon as you re trying to deal with both windows and a unix system like linux life gets more complicated

818751
shared-libraries	cross-compiling
in windows dlls are the direct equivalent to shared-libraries so in linux and if you compile both in a common environment either cross-compiling or using mingw in windows then the linker will just do it the same way

818770
bindingsource	datarow
i have a datatable i was trying to use a datarow but it was having none of that and a bindingnavigator which seemed to be the magic ingredient with a bindingsource and i m programmatically binding controls to it

818786
solaris	linux
i had the opportunity to work on a product that was shipped to 5 platforms win2k winxp linux solaris tru64-unix and believe me maintaining shared libraries or dlls with large codebase is a hell of a task

818804
buffering	streaming
if i were coming at this problem i would probably use a buffering streaming memory streaming and marshal the streaming into the appdomain that consumes the object to reduce marshaling or serializing many object graphs that were created in a different appdomain

818822
implements	extends
i am working on extends a small application that uses the dot tool to draw uml class and state diagrams to implements component diagrams i am running into a lot of problems accommodating the uml 2.x notation for the same

818943
where-clause	sql
however the sql engine can now compute the count for each word_id without waiting until the end of the table it can dispatch the row and the count for that value of word_id if it passes your where-clause or discard the row if it doesn t

818994
http	ssl
just have the ssl virtual server on the load balancer add an http header to the request and check for that

819007
any	set
if you create your texture as a rendertarget that is specify d3dusage_rendertarget as its usage argument you could then set it as the destination of the pipeline before making any draw calls and write a shader perhaps passing parameters to paint your pixels

819011
selected	listbox
if you selected an item from the artist listbox the album listbox will show the albums for that artist and the song listbox will show all the songs from that album im sure you guys can grasp what i am talking about here

819024
versioning	migrate
if you don t have any backups try re-installing everything you can probably migrate the database you have to the latest versioning and go through your own php code if any

819029
jquery	dojo
i recommend dojo -- i realize it s not quite as popular as jquery number of hits on google dojo 13 millions jquery 13.4 -- but it is better architected and designed

819031
directory	folder
apart from the normal project bin debugging folder output is also copied to an external directory to set up the main loader program

819034
scriptaculous	jquery
you can use the drag and drop functionality offered by jquery ui and scriptaculous instead of using multiple listboxes

819049
jquery	dojo
yes it is relatively straightforward to roll your own key handling javascript but it is definitely better to use a free public framework like jquery prototype or dojo

819053
web-config	app-config
if that is the case there should be a section in you app-config or web-config if it is a web client where the address to the web service is specified

819161
margins	padding
i understand why but i m wondering what the default padding and or margins should be on a p element

819161
margins	padding
i m guessing this isn t consistent across browsers and often needs to be tweaked for each site but is there a set of most common margins and or padding value

819161
margins	padding
short version is it for example 5px margins and padding on top and bottom...or something else

819184
httphandler	httpmodule
create httpmodule or httphandler to handle any url request and 302 redirect them to the maintenance page

819188
margins	padding
css reset will reset p tags margins and padding to 0px

819188
margins	padding
common margins and padding depends on your layout and type of content

819188
margins	padding
still you can use 5px as your own default margins and padding

819190
firefox	safari
an example firefox and safari webkit seem to use margin 1em 0px for p elements

819200
keyword	term
if the given keyword is elephant walks the keyword density would be how often the term elephant walks appears on any given web page in relation to other text

expression-blend	wpf
so you should be able to create and design the page in expression-blend try wpf application option

819304
lookup	any
now since any lookup of a prototype templates has no chance of returning a conducted survey since n o conducted survey joins to survey_prototype your getmaster looks conceptually presumably you use an orm like this

819304
base-class	subclass
since you have to do the deep-copy anyway in the deep-copy you can instead of coying the base-class that prototype uses make a subclass copy

819304
children	tree
since you ll be dealing with a tree rooted at survey with children questions and grandchild answers i.e composite pattern i suggest you use the visitor pattern in your copy transformer

819304
visitor-pattern	visitor
and it allows you to have multiple different concrete visitor one for each type of transformation and when it comes time to display or score a survey you can write a visitor for that too -- so you ll get that functionality almost for free once you set up visitor-pattern

819313
order	join
naturally i implemented this as a many-to-one join in my database but this meant that in order to attach a date the event had to exist first

819314
markup	mathml
you could write your mathematical comments using mathml then knock up a plugins that parsing the markup and displays it like a proper equation

819530
forwarding	port
it tells you the svn http path in the management tool - of course you ll need to ensure you have line-of-sight dns between the devices which might mean some more configuration firewall rules port forwarding etc

maybe something with any or contains on the end

819554
show	next
next sometimes when the euro sign cannot be parsing the item either the title or description is show empty

819558
value	field
i do not want to selected all value because blob field can be quite heavy and i don t want to send it all the time

819688
boost	stl
so you couldn t use the stl boost etc

why not have a dictionary when you want to look them up by name a list or an arrays of catclass and iterate on them to see which one is the one you need

819759
dictionary	arrays
in both cases you can also put your arrays into another data structure a dictionary for example if you want to include other items such as a file format number in your data file

819796
ironpython	ironruby
i like the type-safety i get in my production code with a statically-typed language like c# but for my tests i would be happy to use a dynamically-typed language ironpython or ironruby to avoid all the explicit casting

819803
stax	sax
i am thinking maybe i can use a java application which can do sax or stax parsing for me and provide me with all necessary operations search

the thing is this problem started happening when i switched from wshttpbinding which was working fine to wsdualhttpbinding because i needed callback

819879
.net	wcf
although wcf is a simple way to get a rest service up particularly if you are consuming it with a .net client i prefer rolling my own services using asp mvc

819879
http-headers	content-type
you can watch http-headers for authentication information content-type etc or return custom http status codes depending on the result of the action

819893
spring	jsf
i ve used cgi php jsp struts spring asp.net-mvc 1.2 bea workshop jsf jboss seam spring asp.net-mvc 2.5 and wicket in that order

819893
wicket	spring
i prefer wicket with a twist of spring quartz etc. over all of the others

819893
seam	jsf
you need another framework on top of both of them to really solve the problems as seen with seam framework which makes jsf usable

819893
exception-handling	error-handling
the error-handling is very tricky and the exception-handling are not straitforward helpful

819905

it turns out that to achieve what i wanted the easiest way is to set focus to something in my pop-up dialog and to set the tabnavigation property to keyboardnavigationmode.cycle

820077
postgresql	mysql
it may additionally support other databases mysql postgresql etc since our development environment often requires switching between different databases

820081
children	nodes
your approach for representing hierarchical data is very inefficient when it comes to traversing the children of a nodes

820081
children	nodes
if you use this approach you can traverse the children of a nodes using one query regardless of the depth of the tree or the number of children

820082
selected	textbox
i am selected values to my textbox from a popup windows and i hav used

820107
any	set
i ve given up and just want to set c-w to cancel any previous minibuffer before opening a new one like doing c-g c-w

820121
execution	exit
this lets your worker threads finish what they re doing you want instead of just having every worker thread be a daemon and exit in the middle of execution

820126
variables	boolean
instead of setting a boolean variables you could also call a method directly in both cases.

820130
postgresql	oracle
we re using a hybrid model sp approach against both oracle and postgresql databases

820141
jndi	jdbc
the web app would have to do a jndi lookup for the datasource to get the database connection rather than doing a direct jdbc url and then you will have pooling

820173
arrays	loops
speed constraints mean i can t loops through the arrays to find the highest match

820176
memcached	apc
you could also use objects that have been loaded in session or in cache apc memcached before

820182
linux	bsd
if you re on linux bsd mac you can set some environment variables like path right in the crontab and with that you re generally good to go

820210

820268
arrays	loops
this will loops over all elements and assign every element its nummerical index in the arrays of elements jquery has found as id attribute

820292
sql-server	ms-access
i suppose you could query other dbs from it as well for instance i have used it to query some legacy ms-access dbs and so i believe you could query sql-server as well

820316
lookup	any
in any case lookup the asp.net-mvc futures project download here in which you can find newer stuff that didn t make it into the first release but may make it into the future release

820325
codedom	.net
in short no the .net codedom relies upon code being compiled into cil and .net bytecode and will not work for win32 compiled delphi programs

820334
put	get
the problem was that i ve put my class into sun.java.awt package to get access to package protected members without putting it into rt.jar and exception-handling was thrown hen calling imagefetcher.class

820343
proxy-server	apache
this prevents apache from acting as a forward proxy-server which is where the concern about an open proxy comes in but does not affect its use as a reverse proxy using proxypass

820345
scala	java
scala s parametric polymorphism aka generics work much more like ml haskell java and c#

820345
scala	java
the not-so-typesafe way uses reflection and a feature in scala called manifests which are a way to get around a java constraint regarding type erasure

820351
rhino-mocks	moq

during a while for-loop that parsing a result set generated from a sql selected statement what is the best way to prevent the next line from being outputted if the line before it contains the same field data whether it be the 1st field or the xth field

820458
value	field
you could post these value inside a form field

820458
json	xml
your other option is to use some sort of ajax and pass json or xml in the body of the post

820466
rollback	commit
i could just make regular database backups and then rollback if they commit an error and adding this field would add some complexity to all the queries

820473
font-size	width
the javascript animation effects tend to want to change a couple predefined values like width or font-size

820473
text-align	width
in order to transfer from picture 1 to picture 2 using the float or text-align methods i must remove the floating text-align then set the width of the bar color but that doesn t work if i want to keep the javascript overhead minimal for such a simple task

820493
contains	lookup
i could still use the id alone to quickly lookup the details but the url itself contains keywords that will display in that detail

820504
compile-time	hardcode
the constant is hardcode in at compile-time to all assemblies that use it

820507
triggers	insert
another thing that made things easy was the use of update insert delete triggers that handled all the flag changing inside the db and thus kept the complex stuff out of the application for the most part

820522
value	field
like most value in ssrs the parameters can be set to expression which use the field in the table

820526
boost	stl
optimally this map should use only stl and or boost constructs

820547
expression-blend	wpf
now i ve gotten up to speed with expression-blend so that i can click together wpf applications quickly just using the gui which is very nice much more control of the layout than fiddling around with all the xaml elements 80 of your time

820548
keyword	term
when i m working in vs 2008 and i want to get context-sensitive help i highlight the term keyword windows that i want help on and i push f1

google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome etc

820589
webserver	upload
in particular i m looking for the ability to upload to a directory on another server not where my webserver or app server is running

820592
any	set
do you believe it makes any sense to provide get set members for those

820609
annotations	mapping
alternatively don t forget you can always specify column names directly in your mapping files or in your annotations if you use them i guess

820621
document	element
use event-bubbling add event listeners for the bubbling mouse events to a high-level containers possibly even document and use a variables to track which element should be the capturing one

820629
versioning	upgrade
they will be forced to upgrade or maintain parrallel versioning of the project file

820630
rhino-mocks	typemock
the most common references seem to be rhino-mocks nmock and typemock

820634

entity in the sql above should be replaced by a real table customer project or any other table that contains some data in the sync table

820637
sql-server	oracle
i would stay on varcharish types varchar2 for oracle or nvarchar for sql-server unless you re dealing with clobs

820644
profiling	debugging
the provisioning profiling contains a list of devices that are allowed to run or debugging your code

820649

upgrade to 1.7.1 or follow these instructions to fix your 1.7.0 installation

820670
persian	culture
i need a multi culture datetimepicker that support geregorian and persian and hijri cultures

820678
profiling	trace
not sure exactly what you are trying to trace but if you re trying to track time between long running methods perhaps you d be better off hooking into the .net profiling api

820680
debugging	trace
read about how to compile conditionally with trace and debugging in .net assuming you are using .net

820680
debugging	trace
the trace and debugging classes will provide you with all the run-time output you need for development purposes

820680
debugging	trace
then you can remove all your debugging trace code and the associated run-time overhead in your deployed application simply by removing the trace compiler directives

820692
web-config	app-config
it basically involves creating a custom servicehost that will read the configuration from a different file which you can specify rather than from web-config or app-config

820694
put	get
we have some feature branches that can get put on ice for a few weeks at a time

820694
revision	svn
it seems like another way would be for svn to realize that a file in the branch was never touched and therefore update the revision number it points to rather than blindly applying the diff

820698
append	input
actually i just want to append the class fieldwitherrors to the error input

820702
callback	methods
if the data is valid and expected use the clientscriptmanager.registerforeventvalidation methods in order to register the postback or callback data for validation. event validation is enabled using in configuration or in a page

820711
.when	ready
it takes a lot more to make software production ready than it did .when mmm was written

here is what you need to do do not define a class-variables called m and initialize the instance-variables m in the __init__ methods

820730
contains	elements
in general to define a tuples contains the elements 1 use 1 or 1 and not 1

820731
value	field
when you search for a value in a non-clustered index and your query needs more field than are part of the index leaf node all the index field plus any possible include columns then sql-server needs to go retrieve the actual data page s - that s what s called a bookmark lookup

820731
contains	lookup
in that case the leaf-level node of the non-clustered index would contains all fields needed to satisfy your query a covering index and thus a bookmark lookup wouldn t be necessary anymore

820738
xhtml	tidy
tidy reads html xhtml and xml files

820744
openmpi	mpich
you mention that you are using openmp - you shouldn t actually need to use mpirun or mpiexec as you would with mpich or openmpi programs

820744
openmpi	mpich
openmp works in a fairly different way than message-passing libraries openmp uses multiple threads within the same process but mpich and openmpi use multiple-processes

820749
sql-server	oracle
run it on sql-server or oracle

820752
any	set
the fields are strongly typed so you cannot set it equal to dbnull.value and i did not find any methods to set a field to dbnull

820752
value	field
this does not set the field to null but instead sets it to the default date value which is not a valid date value in sql-server

820765
value	field
set the field value to null

820767
methods	extend
you need all of string s methods so extend string and add your extra details

820900
value	field
given that the compositioncontainers uses fancy reflection tactics to set imported private fields of composable parts even in unit tests i will need to use the containers to set those field value

820923
methodology	waterfall
anything that requires everything solidified during the requirements phase would not support an agile methodology waterfall model capability maturity model cmmi cowboy coding and even use case-driven development

820924
sysadmin	root
in my early sysadmin days i did an rm -rf on a system while logged with full privileges root

820928
keydown	keyup
on keydown you can use this to enable the translucency and on keyup you can disable the effect again

820936
spring	grails
it might be possible to have them extend existing java classes but i wouldn t bet on it - and all the spring and hibernate parts of your existing app would have to be discarded or at least you d have to spend a lot of effort to make them work in grails

820948
callback	methods
you could do what process.mainwindowshandle appears to do use p invoke to call the enumwindowss function which invokes a callback methods for every top-level windows in the system

821014
least-squares	regression
i m looking for something like least-squares linear regression to find a best fit for this system note i known there will not be a single unique solution but all i want is one of the best solutions

821014
least-squares	regression
note that if b is trimmed to b11 and b21 only and the unknown row 4 chomped out then this is almost a standard least-squares linear regression problem

activation	account
when registering their user account an activation email should be sent contains a link with an activation code which must be followed for the account to be activated

821029
persistence	hibernate
if they are separated which form of hibernate inheritance persistence would you use

821054
binary	hex
let s think about half of task for a moment - converting from a string-ized base n to unsigned long where n is a power of 2 base 2 for binary and base 16 for hex

821057
constructor	private
you could inherit a class from stream that takes the underlying stream in the constructor and keeps track of the position of that instance of private view

821065
buffering	streaming
i think you ll need to create your own custom tssstream which handles the buffering from the source stream to multiple streaming

821070
triggers	insert
is the triggers as defined going to update just the just insert row or every row in the database

821072
keyboard	mouse
most of the time when you re doing data entry modification you don t want to drop your hands off the keyboard to move the mouse to the submit update button especially with large volumes of data to work with

821074
key-value	key
you could also bind the infolabel s value to some key using say cocoa bindings or just raw key-value observing

821078
having	select
i am using application builder and setting up select boxes to populate a query that spits out into a report below i m having a problem with one populating though and i can t immediatly see why

821079
any	set
is there any practical difference between a set and collection in java besides the fact that a collection can include the same element twice

821079
duplicates	contains
the only reasons for me to use collection is if i get back a collection from someone else s code or if i have to handle a collection that contains duplicates

821080
contains	set
for cases #2 and #3 set the title attributes of the td tag to contains the full non-truncated text

821109
any	set
so any function that accepts a collection will accept a set but a function that accepts a set cannot take a collection unless you cast it to a set

821111
any	set
in any case if you are databinding in every postback anyways you should probably set the enableviewstate of your listview to false to reduce page size

821167
required	checked
using the same table for activated and non-activated users required you to checked the status of the user as well as that of the offices and companies everywhere in the application

821169
erlang	scala
at the same time if there s a mod_ erlang or scala for apache it would be similarly easy for those languages

activation	account
i also added a senton attributes to the activation class used to cleanup inactivated account after a certain time was missing in your uml diagram

821228
children	nodes
i don t really know the book module but i d assume that it s relatively easy to find the children of a book nodes

821290
sql-server	oracle
another programmer suggested using decode in oracle or case statements in sql-server but this is a more general solution

821304
value	field
methods uses certain local variablesiables the clr creates a new class with field set to these value with the new anon methods inside it so that the methods can access the local variables value

821321

temporary	copy
i then use the strncpy_s function to copy endofpath number of characters from args 0 to our temporary buffer

821483
hashmap	arrays
time and memory because sets are usually backed by a hashmap or a tree which adds overhead over a list or an arrays

821483
duplicates	contains
i usually use sets when i need a fast implementation of contains and use collection or list otherwise even if the collection shouldn t have duplicates

821486
duplicates	sorted
collection just means it may or may not be sorted order or allow duplicates

specifications	w3c
some browsers support it regardless but just be aware that it is not required to implements the w3c specifications

821698
deployment	install
the nice thing about atl mfc is that you don t need the .net only the vc mfc runtimes to be install for deployment

821702
unit-testing	assertions
note not unit-testing assertions i mean debug.assert

821714
button	popup
the ideal function of the feature is that a button is clicked and what would have been sent straight to the printer is instead instantly previewed as a pdf that popup with no further interaction with the user other than the user s initial pressing of a button

821714
dialog	pop-up
must be completely transparent to end user user must not have to change their printer settings and then change them back or deal with a save as dialog and then open the file they saved - it needs to just pop-up

821731
document	element
2 instead of directly inserting a reffered xml dom element you should first import that node into your html dom document

821736
value	field
if you don t have a percent field but only say a value field so the needs to be dynamically computed as 100 times the fraction of an item s value to the grand total you can get the grand total from yet another nested selected but at some point it may be worth switching to procedural approaches as other respondents hint

821740
for-loop	loops
a touch more info i m open to all sorts of answers array_sum a for-loops a foreach loops

821742
click	mouse
the issue is indeed that a left button click on the windows caption starts a drag and thus mouse capture which prevents wm_nclbuttonup from arriving

821742
click	mouse
this can be irritating since it s normal to capture the mouse during interaction with such custom button so that you can cancel the click highlight if the mouse leaves the windows

821743
while-loop	loops
you can use a while-loops and a flag variable that initially has the value true and which you can set to false to stop the loops

821760
arrays	loops
if someone doesn t understand the concept of a loops or how to iterate through an arrays they re not qualified as programmers

821765
unit-testing	assertions
if you re doing exhaustive unit-testing which covers all the odd edge cases you might encounter then i don t think you are going to find assertions very useful

821773
python	java
better use something strict like java instead of trying to write java in python

821782
ip-address	hostname
try connect to the site from a different machine or by specifying the actual ip-address rather than the hostname and see if you get a different result

821796
attributes	properties
assuming you don t want to serialization the interface properties place the following attributes

821800
selected	textbox
the textbox is just for showing the selected date

821807
callback	methods
when you want to call the callback there s nothing special about them simplequery s methods will just call

821815
solaris	aix
nevertheless acls not necessarily posix.1e acls are supported at least optionally in all the main variants of unix linux bsd macos x acl hp-ux aix p107ff solaris

821816
google-chrome	firefox
also this works in google-chrome in addition to firefox

821820
web-applications	webserver
i am setting up an apache2 webserver running multiple ruby on ruby-on-rails web-applications with phusion passenger

821830
hash	md5
did you remember to base64 encode the md5 hash in php

821837
command-line	cmd
on sunos there is pargs cmd that prints the cmd-line arguments passed to the running process

821839
decrement	increment
the spin control alters the edit box but the up button decrement the value and the down button increment the value

821846
hash	md5
the issue is php s md5 function by default returns the hex variation of the hash where c# is returning the raw byte output that must then be made text safe with base64 encoding

821862
hide	show
on my control i want to show or hide some rows of a table

821862
hide	show
the text of both labels are show on the page lbltohide does not hide

821864
ref	out
instead it will use an index ref access on t1.value and just filtering out the wrong value

821864
oracle	mysql
analytic functions optimizing lag lead first_value last_value - how to emulate oracle s analytic functions in mysql

821864
order	join
you can control the join order and index es being chosen by using straight_join and force index clauses but they will not force a certain access path on an index or forbid the impossible where

821864
order	join
that means that if you build right join order or choose right indexes mysql will probably benefit from all impossible where s

821865
web-services	api
they have a pretty decent web-services api

821868
constructor	object
in the constructor for classa your are setting an local variables ib not the object s ib object

821870
authentication	login
i want to only allow one authentication session at a time for an individual login in my django application

821870
logout	login
so if a user is logged into the webpage on a given ip address and those same user credentials are used to login from a different ip address i want to do something either logout the first user or deny access to the second user.

821881
environment	building
my building pc simply has the following folder directly copy-paste on to it you may need want to add the bin path to your path environment variables

821920
lgpl	gpl
trolltech has release a tool called visual-studio add-in for their lgpl and gpl release of qt

821942
element	dynamic
i had been using a dynamic arrays of fairly structured data with a tstringlist to find an element based on a string id

821980
hash	md5
if you are trying to make restful urls for some set of unique data why wouldn t you use a hash such as md5

822028
value	field
i m having issues reading column value that have html markup tags specifically mulitple lines of text field type

822032
g++	gcc
it is also not present on alternative stl implementations like gcc s libstdc++ for mingw -w64 as of version g++ 4.8.x

822038
document	editing
i m trying to find all the pains people have with mediawiki today mainly it s poor handling of external document and less-than-perfect editing capabilities - compared to word

822079
firefox	safari
another thing might be that firefox ignores the windows proxy whereas ie and safari likely use the default windows proxy settings - control panel - internet - connections - lan settings

822079
hosts-file	hosts
if your proxy doesn t have the hosts this would explain it

822083
command-line	cmd
just get to a break point then go to the console tab and type your cmd into the command-line at the bottom where there s the

822104
double-quotes	single-quotes
i have tried single-quotes and double-quotes i have tried adding the wix namespace to the call with no prefix

822121
unit-testing	assertions
i m using both unit-testing and assertions for different purposes

822122
attributes	properties
maybe you should explicitely mark each properties that needs to be serialization with a data-members attributes and leave out those that should not be

822133
unit-testing	assertions
i think the idea behind unit-testing in this case is to move those assertions over to the test cases to ensure that instead of having debug.assert ... your code under test handles it without throwing up or ensures that it s throwing up correctly

822148
uiscrollview	subviews
i m doing something very similar in my app- an nxn grid with an image underneath and another subviews on top to draw the lines all owned by a uiscrollview

822156
order	add
probably not but the only way i can think of getting more information is to convert it to an .ajax call in order to add an error hook and see which error type it think is happening

822156
parsing	comma
if the error type is parsing ie may be complaining because the data coming back has extra comma at the end of comma separated arrays lists

822179
csv	xml
other than this the easiest way to accomplish this without a binary-level interop is to just use a plain text format such as a csv or xml

822180
button	popup
the url will open in a popup windows when an asp.net button control is clicked by the user

822191
decrement	increment
every time you hit a backspace increment a counter and every time you hit a normal character skip it if your counter is non-zero and decrement the counter

822202
google-chrome	opera
it s available in ff3+ ie safari opera google-chrome

822228
internet-explorer	firefox
this works in firefox 3 but does not work in internet-explorer 8

822236
.net	wcf
the answer is yes you can use .net 3.5 sp1 under windows 2000 if you re not going to use .net 3.0 libraries wcf wf wpf cardspace

822242
any	set
you re not forced to use xe for development oracle also allows a development license so you could run any edition or feature set even enterprise or rac if you only use it for development and don t use it in production they say on the otn downloads page

822244
vba	vb6
this is to put us on notice that vba vb6 for that matter will at some point be a thing of the past

822245
wordpress	phpbb
from keeping applications wordpress phpbb etc up to date and patched to actual attacks like sql injection and cross-site scripting

822262
windows-xp	windows
at work we have migrated from windows-xp to windows vista

822262
exception-handling	try-catch
when i surround this with a try-catch block and breakpoint on the catch if the exception-handling was thrown the file would already be deleted from the disk

822289
lgpl	gpl
if you want it to be more restrictive than that consider gpl or lgpl

822319
selected	button
i m trying to retrieve the selected node if any of a treepanel when the user clicks a button

822328
attributes	properties
each of the properties has the data-members attributes and i have added a couple of data annotation attributess required and stringlength to a couple of the properties

822329
button	popup
typically you d bind your popup button to an arrays controller that contains custom model objects through the content binding and use the content values binding to specify a keypath on those object with the string you want to use as the title

822333
32-bit	16-bit
the difference between rand and random is that random returns a much more usable 32-bit random number and rand typically returns a 16-bit number

822333
manpage	bsd
the bsd manpage show that the lower bits of rand are cyclic and predictable so rand is potentially useless for small numbers

822334
qmail	exim
the default mtas will work fine sendmail qmail postfix exim etc.

822339
rar	zip
i am trying to batch extract some rar s that are in some zip in some directory

822375
setinterval	settimeout
the eval function and its relatives function settimeout and setinterval provide access to the javascript compiler

822392
json	xml
i need to do some rest service testing from firefox where i set the content-type http header to a specific value to retrieve xml or json

822407
nstextfield	nstableview
assuming your nstableview s columns are bound to an nsarrayscontrollers you can bind the value of the nstextfield label to your arrays controllers s with controllers key arrangedobjects and with a key path of count

822421
rewrite	rule
here is my rewrite rule

822423
attributes	properties
the new attributes that you have created in esentially meta data that is associated with the properties and therfore the type in which the properties belongs to

822446
onsubmit	onclick
if so i d recommend dropping the submit mechanism and using a button type with an onclick handler and not submit button w a onsubmit handler.

822454
google-chrome	firefox
this works in every browser firefox safari google-chrome except ie7 and ie8 with example input text like this

822454
google-chrome	firefox
however surprisingly to me at least this does not work in firefox and google-chrome

822454
google-chrome	firefox
the same tests passed 100 on firefox and google-chrome

822456
strong-typing	types
i know it s probably not as compact as you would like but what s needed to reduce this down effectively yet still retain the strong-typing is higher order generic types called type classes in haskell a way of indicating that type parameters are themselves generic and can take type parameters

822469
unix	bsd
i was wondering if there are any small bsd or unix releases

822470
selenium-ide	selenium
i ve had a lot of success using selenium rc and selenium-ide

822488
value	field
the other reason you might care is for some kind of validation rule in which case you need to figure out what determines whether or not a field value is valid or not

822490
any	set
are there any way to access or set iphone s alarm

822503
private-members	data-members
reportdef is decorated with the datacontract attribute and has private-members decorated with data-members

822506
administration	integrated
basically i m looking for something maybe a scripting that would allow me to do the stuff i described above in a way i could integrated into my own website without needing a special administration area

822521
value	field
do you mean that you want it to behave like a text field that autocomplete against previously entered value

822532
internet-explorer	doctype
here s a good post about how different doctype etc affect ie8 s rendering mode understanding compatibility modes in internet-explorer 8

822538
populate	row
populate the table s rows by returning the nsarray s objectatindex for the specified row value

822547
any	set
is there any way to set the mimetype of the new windows so the xml displays properly

822547
any	set
is there any way to specify the title so when the user hits save the file name is set correctly

822547
google-chrome	firefox
note needs to be compatible with most brosers ie6 ie7 firefox google-chrome

822570
google-chrome	firefox
probably the best way would be to detect the user s browser user-agent string and redirect them to a page asking them to upgrade or download a different browser such as firefox or google-chrome if they are using an old version of ie

822575
multiplication	modulo
it s fast too since it doesnt involve multiplication or modulo

822597
lazy-evaluation	maybe
maybe i should make it lazy-evaluation property

822607
c-preprocessor	macros
i know of one programmer who uses perl to augment c-preprocessor when it comes to macros latest version of that project

822607
getter	setter
the basic idea is you would decide on some convention to tell your perl scripting when to generate a getter or setter

822607
getter	setter
given code like this i could write a scripting to look for comment lines consisting of the comment get or set on the line s before a member variables declaration and then replace them with simple setter getter

822637
lazy-evaluation	maybe
maybe i should make it lazy-evaluation property

822637
order	add
it s better using a class that does an atomic add like atomicinteger in java in order to avoid locks take a look here

822646
accessor	ivar
if you use the underscore.js prefix for your ivars which is nothing more than a common convention but a useful one then you need to do 1 extra thing so the auto-generated accessor for the property knows which ivar to use

822656
private-members	private
child classes can not access private-members which is the whole point of private access control

822666
capacity	storage
in v6 the capacity was added to connect to non-openedge databases and in v8 to create openedge databases of more than one storage area

822669
protected	public
basically you want public or protected variables to be declared in foo since these are the variabless that subclasses inherited from their parent and therefore seen in baz

822676
getter	setter
if you want to be able to somehow tag your member variables and have getter and or setter skeletons automatically generated for you than a ide macros seems more appropriate

822685
authentication	login
this backend when triggered and successfully authentication a user just call super would wipe out the user s last login ip in the profiling model

822688
constructor	private
6.6.8 example private fields methods and constructor

822693
installation	environment
i m a developer that has been using c# since .net 1.0 days on a daily basis i usually likes to keep to the bare bones of an installation so that if my dev environment is somehow destroyed i can be back and running as fast as possible

822704
credentials	account
i was setting the credentials property of the httpwebrequest with a sevice account instead of my ad account which was causing the issue

822750
any	set
hey i was wondering if there are any good tutorial out there on how to set this up

822752
haskell	ocaml
i am wondering if i should continue to learn ocaml or switch to f# or haskell

822768
python	java
so java for a noob coming from php and python what are the cheatcodes

822786
32-bit	64bit
java has always made a distinction between the scalar types which are not classes boolean true false char unsigned 16-bit short signed 16-bit int signed 32-bit and long signed 64bit

822821
exception-handling	try-catch
also you will want to wrap your update in a try-catch and rollback the transaction if an exception-handling occurs

822828
malloc	free
this will work if you and the user agree to use the same allocation like malloc free

822830
linux	unix
there is nothing actively listening on that port before we run my service so i m thinking that it s some sort of new permissions issue in sp3 that stops processes listening on ports 1024 unless they have certain permissions similar to the linux unix way of doing things

822833
protected	public
in java there is the same public protected and private scopes that exist in other places like c++

822833
protected	public
note however that if you don t specify whether something is public protected or private it s none of those things

822845
haskell	ocaml
haskell and ocaml are both mature languages with strong implementations

822845
haskell	ocaml
both ocaml and haskell are being used to write lots of different kinds of programs not just compilers and ai or whatever

822871
delphi	c++
of course you can restrict access to the source code of a compiled language like c++ java or delphi

822871
postgresql	mysql
i don t know if the null-out-the-source-blob trick is possible in mysql or postgresql

822879
show	next
i intend on creating a control that show the user and their images right next to their name

822884
debian	linux
if it matters i m primarily interested in this under debian or ubuntu linux

822890
contains	elements
modify the aspx to toggle the visibility property of the div elements that contains the list box

822893
firefox	safari
there are plenty of new browsers out there that don t support javascript or don t support it well and they can be just as important as the latest safari or firefox

822907
xsd	xml
as a part of my development i d like to be able to validate an entire folder s worth of xml files against a single xsd file

822907
xsd	xml
i ve considered porting c# code from the validating an xml against referenced xsd in c# question but i don t know how to add handlers in powershell

822915
windows-vista	windows
starting with windows-vista you can use the winapi function weraddexcludedapplication to disable windows error reporting for a specific application

822918
document-management	dms
if cost is no issue and you can use a standard dms pretty much out of the box only minor custom development microsoft office sharepoint server is great for document-management and document-based team collaboration

822929
vmware	esx
we run sharepoint and sql-server on separate vms on vmware esx in our datacenter

822937
sql-server	mysql
because i work with sql-server mysql ms access and propel nhibernate etc

822937
value	field
edit 2 inserting the identity field value doesn t seem to work

822937
value	field
because when you populate a table via orm you can t specify the identity field value at least propel won t allow that

822941
object-reference	instances
--- object-reference not set to an instances of an object followed by a stack-trace

822968
httpwebrequest	webclient
the credentials property is not available on the webclient or httpwebrequest

822998
identity-column	sql-server
you ll have to add a surrogate primary key such as an identity-column in sql-server to map this table

822999
ostringstream	std
this string of course can be built up by printf or std ostringstream or what have you

823011
contains	set
not related to the timeout but you need to fd_zero set before fd_set sock set otherwise the fd_set will be uninitialized and likely contains many set bits

823021
passenger	webrick
the reason for all of the server restarts isn t necessarily because your webserver webrick mongrel phusion passenger is flaky but because when your ruby-on-rails app has started up there are certain things loaded into memory load paths initializers environment data

823028
addsubview	dealloc
the code is incorrect you shouldn t be releasing it in the init methods just when dealloc is called that s if you want to keep it as an ivar you don t need to unless you need a pointers to it elsewhere since addsubview will retain the view for you

823028
addsubview	dealloc
i believe the reason it s not actually crashing is because it s still being retained by the superclass from the call to addsubview so when it s release in dealloc that s actually balanced out

823051
haskell	ocaml
ocaml and haskell have been surving well for a number of years which bodes well for their future

823051
haskell	ocaml
perf i don t have enough first-hand experience with haskell but based on second-hand and third-hand info i think ocaml or f# are more pragmatic in the sense that i think it is unlikely you ll be able to get the same run-time perf in haskell that you do in ocaml of f#

823051
haskell	ocaml
tooling i don t have enough personal experience to compare but i think the vs integration with f# is superior to anything you ll find for ocaml haskell today and f# will continue to improve a bit here over the next year

823051
haskell	ocaml
if you know a big long-term project you want to use it for one may stand out but i think many of the skills will be transferable more easily between f# and ocaml than to from haskell but also more easily among any of these three than with say java

823097
debugging	trace
i use both and have gotten them mixed up which results in my running when i think i am debugging which of course leads to know trace outputs in the console

823115
mouseenter	mouseout
i was using jquery and ended up hooking into mouseenter and mouseout instead of the events you are using

823119
arrays	loops
that is in your while loops row is an arrays which corresponds to the data from your mysql query

823119
contains	elements
so each elements of resultarrays actually contains an arrays rather than a string

823124
forwarding	port
this is done through port forwarding

823124
forwarding	port
for the linksys router i have i enter enter my username password applications gaming tab port range forwarding

823124
forwarding	port
enter the application name whatever you want to call it start port 80 end port 80 protocol tcp-ip address using the above example you would enter 192.168.1.102 which is the static ip you assigned your server and be sure to check to enable the forwarding

823131
host	root
i got a blog on the root directory of my host then i hosted some app on a subfolder named fsgallery

823136
attributes	properties
look for the visible at launch properties in the attributes inspector for the windows in interface builder

823166
children	nodes
this means that the second child arrays you have in children of the parent nodes is not the same arrays that you add grandchild to but a copy of it

823168
return-type	arguments
think of func as your basic common delegate where you specify the arguments type and return-type for the generic type parameters

823174
mousemove	mousedown
i could not add mousemove event after mousedown with

823178
getter	setter
ie the getter is the setter as you only want to cache it when it is used once.

823186
m2eclipse	maven
i m trying to share multi-module maven project using m2eclipse plug-in from springsource tool suite 2.0.0 to subversion server subversive plug-in for eclipse

823200
repository	entity
i have considered just writing a simple repository that loads a record from every entity and make sure no exception-handling is raised but most of the tables have no data in them yet

823209
keydown	keyup
when the mouse pointers enters the button it sends keydown when it moves off the button it sends keyup

823226
python	c++
several languages such as python can be embedded into c c++ so that may be an option

823229
put	get
maybe i should just put a go button so i have something to get the focus away from the textfield

823238
put	get
it is suitable for performing basic http requests and interacting with rest-based services get post put delete

823241
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
for the most common framework exception-handling such as argumentexception and invalidoperationexception

823242
perl	ruby
this feature is available in higher-level languages like python lisp ruby and perl usually with some variation of an eval function

823246
google-chrome	firefox
in safari google-chrome i imagine firefox 2+ and konquerer and probably others you can do it in css by using border-radius

823255
google-chrome	firefox
in safari google-chrome firefox 2 ie 8 and konquerer and probably others you can do it in css by using the border-radius property

823274
pointers	stack
save the frame pointers on stack according to convention

823274
pointers	stack
make room for stuff at the old end of the frame and round stack pointers down to a multiple of 4 why this is needed i don t know

823274
pointers	stack
restore the frame and stack pointers

823274
debian	linux
here s what happens when i compile the very same source code with gcc 4.3 on debian linux

823274
convention	standards
save frame pointers using standards convention

823274
pointers	stack
restore the frame pointers and stack pointers

823276
mocking	stubs
i m using rhinomocks as my mocking framework so i can t mock stubs concrete classes and i would like to stick to it because i really think that mocking concrete classes is not very elegant

823291
value	field
what i can t get to work is display the value of the field in a details view and showing thing c12 as the text instead of 2

823293
driver	kernel
2 make sure your actual driver or kernel code that is sending on the netlink socket is actually writing sending data to it

823293
driver	kernel
this way should be able to tell if your kernel driver is actually sending data up to userspace properly

823293
driver	kernel
then you may also have a problem in your kernel driver

823302
g++	gcc
the files will be compiled with the objective-c++ compiler so things will behave more like g++ than gcc but since that s what you want it probably doesn t count as a surprise

823303
constructor	object
if you want to initialize global variables you ll need to explicitly do so during your program s initialization routine or you could do it in the constructor of a global object not recommended

823338
haskell	ocaml
haskell and ocaml both have very consistent stories about operator overloading

823339
attributes	properties
so tabcontrol overrides the text properties and adds attributes to its override saying by the way don t show my text properties in the properties grid or in intellisense. the properties still exists but since you never see it it doesn t get in your way

823339
attributes	properties
if you add an editorbrowsable editorbrowsablestate.never attributes to a member properties or methods then intellisense will no longer show that member in its code-completion lists

823342
annotations	mapping
can you post the code for the entity class and if you re not using annotations the segment of your hbm mapping file

823355
pointers	stack
you can t return a pointers to a stack variables

823361
formview	ascx
you could give them the same names page1.aspx uses page1.ascx or set up a naming convention like page1-content.ascx so that your formview ascx would figure out what it s filler control is named use page.loadcontrol to load the control by path and plug that content in during the init phase

823362
perl	ruby
if you ever wanted to have a perl python ruby etc

823374
fadeout	show
for example the scripting should check is hidden and show and if not then fadeout 800 or similiar

823380
required	checked
sure this would be possible with a php scripting but it would required more parsing of the various configuration variables as well as doing if then checked whereas using the parse_ini_file does all of this for you automatically

823381
delphi	c++
with delphi you ll get an excellent rad arguably better than anything you ll find in c++...unless you use c++ builder

823381
delphi	c++
however if you know c++ you ll feel at home in delphi in no time

823387
dependency-injection	strategy-pattern
are these terms equal or are there any important differences between dependency-injection and the strategy-pattern

823401

note if you need to support ie6 then you ll be using javascript for that browser anyway as it doesn t support the hover pseudo-element on anything other than anchor

823452
pointers	stack
the ebp register is stack frame base pointers hence the bp

823452
pointers	stack
it stores a pointers to the beginning of the current stack

823452
pointers	stack
the esp register is stack pointers

823452
pointers	stack
in step 1 we save the pointers to the old stack frame on stack by calling

823452
pointers	stack
therefore we must set a new stack frame base pointers

823452

that is the part of the function which returns stack pointers esp and ebp to the state they were in before this function was called

823452
pointers	stack
stack pointers esp to the base

if you don t have a second machine then you could download vmware and an ubuntu appliance or grab virtualbox and build a vm of whatever you like and use that to act as your second machine

823636
c++	lua
you can dabble with its operators interactively with the imlab tool call it directly from c or c++ or use its really decent lua binding to drive it from lua

823649
getter	setter
generally it s a good idea to keep the actions of setter or getter for that matter to a relatively small set of actions

823681
profiling	trace
it takes a trace from the profiling and makes some sometimes highly useful suggestions

in order to test orm mapping one strategy i ve used that has saved hours of work involves using a row test approach in unit tests like the rowtest attributes in mbunit or nunit

823984
optional-parameters	named
another way to handle this is to not use overloads optional-parameters and instead named the methods according to what they are ment to do - it might seem like a bad tradeoff but your code will probably get easier to read

823987
vmware	esx
in vmware esx i how can i use the vmware virtual infrastructure remote cli to find unused machines disks

823992
silverlight	wpf
we are looking at both wpf and silverlight

or is there a way i can block that line of code firing in the designer i don t actually need the output of this code whilst in design-view as it s just generating a disabled versioning of an image from a provided image

824000
contains	elements
because i don t want to update the contents of the elements with html code and the text may contains special characters such as or which should be parsing by textnode s dom methods

824004
hidden-field	checkbox
this is very similar if not equal to the checkbox issue the html.checkbox helper method generates a hidden-field with a false value

merely opening the ofstream in binary mode does not change the way that the operators work - they will always perfform formatted output

824054
windows	ms-dos
the bios functions are only available if you are using ms-dos or very old versions of windows and are specific to turbo c

824060
contains	any
since a text node by it s very definition cannot contains any markup there is no innerhtml property

824084
margins	padding
if you are not a layout expert no offence seriously stay away from the padding margins overflow magic and the one true layout technique

824084
javascript	dom
the latter is elegant but it can cause unwanted side-effects if you are to do heavy javascript dom manipulations and all see the problems listing

824084
margins	padding
unfortunately the padding negative margins hack will be visible

824091
integrated-security	connection-string
for microsoft sql-server you either encrypt the database connection-string in the configuration or you use integrated-security where you connect to the database using the identity of the application you re connecting from

824107
convention	standards
there is a many-to-many relationship in the database client table is mapped to the user table through the cliet_contact table not the standards client_user convention

824120
boost-variant	boost-any
you might want to look at boost-variant rather than boost-any so you can be sure all the types you are using are comparable

824127
data-structures	tree
i can probably solve a bit more complex algorithily problems too and most likley know my way around simple tree and data-structures

824139
sql-server	oracle
the question is - is it possible to authenticate domain group in oracle as it is possible with sql-server integrated security so that there would be no need to create separate database user for each domain member

824145
authentication	login
2 how should i handle the login sign up navigation no tabbar should be shown on start but will need it after authentication the user

824145
contains	set
set up a view for login i would use a uitableview with one section contains two rows for username and password but that s my own preference

824160
profiling	debugging
that is necessary for the profilingr to profiling my code while in debugging mode the result

824170
rfc	iri
the iri rfc allows unicode

824173

i have not upgrade from 2.1 to the newer versioning so i can only talk about the relatively old 2.1 from 2001. â

824204
logout	login
this will enable you to use your login function and logout to do stuff

824214
persistence	hibernate
sample chapter of java persistence with hibernate

824233
compiler-flags	icc
icc and vc may have similar compiler-flags

824241
cvs	git
the main difference is that as it was already said in other responses cvs is old centralized version control system while git is distributed

824241
cvs	git
but even if you use version control for single developer on single machine single account there are a few differences between git and cvs

824241
version-control	cvs
cvs require setting up cvsroot a central place for storing version-control info for different projects modules

824241
version-control	git
the consequence of that design for user is that importing existing sources into version-control is as simple as git init git add

824241
cvs	git
git commit in git while it is more complicated in cvs

824241
version-control	cvs
because cvs at beginning was a set of scripts around per-file rcs version-control system commits and other operations are not atomic in cvs

824241
cvs	git
changes in cvs are per file while changes commits in git they always refer to the whole project

824241
cvs	git
other consequence is that in cvs is easy to do partial checkouts while it is currently next to impossible in git

824241
cvs	git
git blame the better equivalent of cvs annotate a tool to show line-wise history of a file contents can follow code movement also across renames

824241
cvs	git
git offers a very very limited set of keywords as compared to cvs by default

824241
cvs	git
git offers much more tools than cvs

824241
cvs	git
if you are collaboration with at least one other developer you would find also the following differences between git and cvs

824241
cvs	git
commit before merge git uses commit-before-merge rather than like cvs merge-before-commit or update-then-commit

824241
revision	updates
if while you were editing files preparing for creating new commit new revision somebody other created new commit on the same branch and it is now in repository cvs forces you to first updates your working directory and resolve conflicts before allowing you to commit

824241
cvs	git
if you prefer to have linear history and avoid merges you can always use commit-merge-recommit workflow via git rebase and git pull --rebase which is similar to cvs in that you replay your changes on top of updated state

824241
cvs	git
below there are differences between cvs in git for different stages of interest and position in a project under version control using cvs or git

824241
version-control	cvs
this is solution specific to distributed version-control systems so of course cvs doesn t support such way of collaboration

824241
version-control	cvs
with cvs there is a choice between custom unencrypted plain text pserver protocol or using remote shell where you really should use ssh to publish your changes which for centralized version-control system means committing your changes creating commits

824241
version-control	git
in general distributed version-control systems such as git provide much wider selection of possible workflows

824241
version-control	cvs
with centralized version-control systems such as cvs by necessity you have to distinguish between people with commit access to repository and those without.

824245
callback	methods
a callback is a function you specify to an existing function methods to be invoked when an action is completed requires additional processing etc

824250
value	field
transaction isolation and different read levels dirty reads will most likely get you into trouble when you don t use locking on that id field in your masterdata table that holds the current or next id value

824251
persistence	hibernate
however in my opinion java persistence with hibernate definitely worths the money and time to read it

824255
ubuntu	linux
i have configured a vmware 2.0 server with a guest os ubuntu linux and my host os is windows xp

824256
radio-button	textbox
i have two radio-button and two textbox in which i displayed the date using jquery

824256
selected	textbox
when i click on radio1 then in both the textbox i should be able to selected date but when i click on radio2 then i shouldn t be able to selected the date in text2 field

824296
contains	elements
the specified file contains the same kind of settings that are specified in the appsettings add clear and remove attributes and uses the same key value pair format as those elements

824296
contains	elements
this behaves differently to the configsource attributes because you don t have to replace the entire section with the external file it can just contains elements that you want to have in addition or to override the values

824367
versioning	upgrade
when a new versioning of a framework or language appears .net 3.5 sql2008 what approach do people take to when to adopt upgrade

824383
internet-explorer	firefox
works in firefox and safari is there any method available for internet-explorer

824386
collabnet	sharpsvn
i use sharpsvn library from collabnet

824390
subtract	add
add all the numbers you are given up using your favourite big integer library and subtract that total from the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 2 32-1 as obtained from the sum of arithmetic progression formula

824397
checkbox	button
in vista most of the shell s yes to all dialogs actually work this way - there s no additional button saying yes no to all - there s a perform chosen action on all items checkbox instead

824397
windows-xp	windows
this function is available through microsoft windows-xp and windows server 2003

824401
windows-mobile	symbian
i am trying not to put constraints on cellphone platform symbian windows-mobile etc from the beginning so i am leaving that sort of constraints out on purpose

824407
assign	add
i would add the private property and assign it a default-value - finished

824409
google-chrome	firefox
i went to options- connections and unchecked all checkboxes disabled file- capture trafirefoxic went to ie and disabled fiddler addin went to connections and removed all proxies and still all my pages on ie and google-chrome firefox is fine go through fiddler

824411
python	java
you can write this application in any supported language java for j2me python symbian .net windows mobile

824432
versioning	upgrade
i think the killer question is whether your app will survive long term if you never upgrade the platform language versioning

824448
silverlight	wpf
it s for wpf and silverlight also

824449
callback	methods
it would be better however to acknowledge that the post is asynchronous and build your code so that the action performed by the callback is independent of the methods that invokes the post

824449
callback	methods
if we knew what the purpose was then it might be possible to recommend how to accomplish that in the callback so that the methods could be refactored

824455
progress-bar	progress
after weeks of pulling the routine apart it turns out it was the line that updated the progress-bar that caused the issue for every itteration we were checking the record count using table1.recordcount in delphi 1 this worked fine but it seems in later versions of delphi calling table.recordcount on a dbase table takes a copy of the table counts the records and returns the amount calling this on every itteration of our progress was causing the table to be downloaded from the network with every ittteration and counted

824477
directory	folder
then at the directory where your jar is located there should be a lib folder with the required jars

824480
value	field
we have found that sometimes for some odd reason the value of the field in previously filled steps is lost when postbacking to another step

824480
value	field
sometimes some of the field value are retained and others are lost

824516
persistence	hibernate
java persistence with hibernate is the second edition of hibernate in action

824516
persistence	hibernate
high-performance java persistence is also worth reading since it explains which hibernate features are efficient and which you should stay out of

824518
windows-xp	windows
i like the office 2007 windows border how it looks in windowss-xp

824539
interpreter	runtime
is this a limitation of blend or do i need to change my code in some way so that blend can interpreter what data will be coming out at runtime

824567
any	set
is your c# project set to build for any cpu - if it is and you re on a 64-bit os then the load will fail

824567
32-bit	64bit
the vc++ dll will be 32-bit only and 64bit app can t run it

824582
arguments	default
it s much like the arguments do you want your computer open to the outside world by default or would you rather configure it for internet access yourself

824586
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this way your sole focus is getting to know asp.net-mvc and when you move logic into the asp.net-mvc pattern you ll discover things that you implemented in webforms and never gave much thought to but now need to solved in another way

824596
response	timeout
a request-response for the http adapter at receive location foanite btshttpreceive.dll has timeout before a response could be delivered

824603
set	bag
regarding set bag semantics

824603
duplicates	contains
that is nhibernate will make sure that while reconstituting an instance the collection will not contains duplicates

824603
set	bag
a bag is a generalization of a set

824618
methods	extend
it sounds like you might want to extend the tree class and override some of the methods to implement your special functionality

824630
callback	methods
i m not very sure if i got it right from what you said but you could use the .post methods that would return whatever you need through its callback

824647
ftp	ssh
ssh is enabled and i can login with transmit ftp client on port 22

824661
javascript	dom
setting it as not visible when the dom has loaded using javascript on the client

824662
windows-xp	windows
according to the microsoft documentation on side-by-side registration-free com it s supposed to work on windows-xp and later and windows server 2003 and later

824662
delphi	c++
in case it matters i don t think it should but you never know the dll is written in delphi 2007 while the client is written in visual c++

824676
value	field
i have a function that accepts any object then it gets value from the properties or field that it has as input

824685
addsubview	dealloc
the basic answer is there should only be one in the example code whether it s after addsubview or in dealloc

824685
addsubview	dealloc
however i would remove from dealloc and leave it after addsubview

824685
addsubview	dealloc
in this example if the given block of code is volatile and has a chance to be execute again whether because of memory or an unloaded view i would remove from dealloc and leave it after addsubview

824689
contains	any
this will selected rows where the labels field contains any of the words in the criteria search string

824730
perl	php
for hobby purposes i have a shared space on a hosting server that is providing as many of them are both php and perl cgi

824730
perl	php
i have read on several places that cgi scripts are obsolete now i think mainly for performance issues like is php or vanilla perl cgi faster

824730
perl	php
but since i just started studying perl i wouldn t want to waste time on implementing solutions in php that are way easier or only possible in perl

824742
document	element
i need to insert an html string into the tag of the current document dom one way is you create a div element fill its innerhtml copy over item-by-item into your element

824766
rendering	redraw
i would need to be able to time how long the actual rendering time is for the form but since i m not the one that s kicking off the redraw i don t know how to capture the start time

824782
any	set
but are there any best practices in the maven community for how i should name this library s coordinates in my pom since a standard is not already set in public repositories for it

824785
value	field
the dropdownlist sometimes ignores the selected value of your selectlist it s annoying but what it does is try to get the selected value from the modelstate viewdata and model by using the field name as a key

824791
perl	php
i use both perl and php for websites - for historical reasons mainly perl at work and php at home

824791
perl	php
i find php a more disciplined and therefore sometimes more limiting language than perl

824803
perl	php
i decided to learn perl as a hobby after looking into php and not liking the fact that i could not read most of the php out there and being daunted by the list of builtin functions

824804
attributes	properties
i m using the datacontractserializationr to serialization an objects properties and fields marked with data-members attributes to xml

824815
mouseover	mouseout
the first function of hover is a mouseover and second function is mouseout

824819
selected	button
let s say you wanted to apply a function to that button s click handler to get the selected node

824828
getter	setter
by default these two methods return only public getter and setter risking a nullreferenceexception in a case like this but passing true as above makes them also return private ones

824834
callback	methods
php functions such as array_map take a callback which can be a simple function or a class or object methods

824861
hsqldb	mysql
then i tried hsqldb and thought the speed is good but i cannot find a good management tool for hsqldb such as phpmyadmin for mysql or sqlite manager for sqlite

824863
switching	screens
however i find that if i perform a lot of activities and then switching between views i end up with a blank screens and my view is not drawn

824870
cruisecontrol.net	mbunit
that said if you are using only visual-studio and will be doing codeigniter builds using cruisecontrol.net or teamcodeigniterty i d recommend using mbunit or nunit.net

32-bit	64bit
how do i find out if my processor is 32-bit or 64bit in your language of choice

824883
interpreter	runtime
declare your own -style attributes s and interpreter them at runtime in your own serialization code

824888
constructor	object
he prefers to set object values in the constructor rather than in setters as it will give you a clear statement of what it means to create a valid object in an obvious place while it also allows you to clearly hide any fields that are immutable by simply not providing a setter

824889
scripting	shebang
modify your backup scripting and add this line after shebang

824900
order	join
typically when query cost gets order of magnitude more expensive it is because a loop or merge join is being used where a hash join is more appropriate

824905
contains	any
i ve considered rolling my own simple search maybe having my classes implement a contains function so that i can ask each object if it contains any of the user s search terms and then build in some sort of simple rank based on how many words were matched

824908
administration	account
to see whether this is a problem attempt to run the client application on an account with unrestricted administration privileges

824908
windows-xp	windows
when windows-xp or windows server 2003

824912
serialization	marshalling
when marshalling objects between appdomains in .net the clr will either serialize the object if it has the serialization attribute or it will generate a proxy if it inherits from marshalbyref

824927
windows-server	windows
when you develop for microsoft based platforms like a windows forms app for windows or asp.net webapp for windows-server the nice time to migrate is for every two major versions of os.for example if your app has been developed for windows 2000 you ought to migrate to vista though xp can be neglected

824931
oracle	mysql
the target database could be oracle or mysql

824939
convention	standards
i ve been using maven for about a year and have never run across a standards naming convention

824956
unmanaged	c++-cli
if you create a c++ test project using c++-cli you can then make calls to an unmanaged

824975
attributes	properties
you could even examine the objects via reflection and may be just add some user attributes to the properties to give the search engine some hints which properties to include in the search

824990
configuration	environment
i reckon the pre-receive hook is the correct hook to place this but i m unable to find the real user name and email address which gitosis enters into the repository the ones set by git configuration user.name and git configuration user.email from environment variables

824996
any	set
any help with creating an interactive sortable nested set in ruby-on-rails would be appreciated

825023
configuration	environment
this is just for testing configuration not a production environment to actually serve a user workload

825024
foundation	cocoa
some time studying the basic of cocoa would be useful as well because the coding style here indicates that you may not have a solid foundation

825042
sql-server	oracle
whereas everywhere else in the known universe oracle sql-server access sybase...

825046
selected	checkbox
each grid itself i am using checkbox as a templatefield.when i am selected the first grid checkbox

having	select
the problem i m having is that if i select a tuesday in my calendar the textbox will display the next sunday but the selected date in the calendar is still tuesday

825057
beautifulsoup	lxml
is this possible using beautifulsoup or lxml

825061
llvm	gcc
note that llvm and gcc are not related

825061
llvm	gcc
gcc s c c++ objective-c frontend is used for llvm-gcc which emits llvm machine code and after a ton of optimizations in llvm a final executable comes out

825062
getter	setter
you might also want to look into targetnullvalue which make a certain value equivalent to null if you set targetnullvalue 5 and your user enters 5 your setter will get null and if your getter supplies null the binding will display 5

825085
development-environment	platform
seriously though just getting your development-environment and deployment platform up to .net 3.51 is a big step in and of itself

825100
specifications	w3c
i ve looked at the w3c s html specifications and while they are very precise with what attributes can be used with elements and also some behavioural stuff such as exactly what gets include with form submission there s nothing about the behaviour of elements

825100
onsubmit	onclick
this might end up requiring the button s onclick set some state that the form s onsubmit inspects but if i can just return false then that s great

825100
onsubmit	onclick
even if not it would then be critical what order the onsubmit and onclick handler get fired does the button dispatch the submit before running its click handler

825103
perl	php
both php and perl have their moments but this is truly subjective

825103
perl	php
perl has massive frameworks available on cpan which can make it work as well or better than php even in a purely cgi environment

825103
perl	php
i personally prefer to use perl than to muck about with trying to find all of the functional ways to do things in php

825105
out-of-browser	ria
some gotchas i ran into are that assembly caching isn t supported for out-of-browser apps and ado.net data services doesn t work out-of-browser use .net ria services instead

825147
xsd	xml
in xsd soap and other xml conventions you ll often see things like

825157
profiling	debugging
that is why it is a good idea to profiling in both debugging and release modes

825157
profiling	debugging
if release mode only shows function foo using 80 of the program time you can use the debugging profiling to see that function bar which was inlined into foo is using 60 of foo s time

825179
contains	elements
each of those elements contains a really long string of characters.

825180
build-server	teamcity
those tests never run successfully on our build-server using teamcity

825189
button	popup
for any links with a particular css class i d like to control whether the links open in the same windows a new windows or a popup using onclick based on the user s selection from a grouping of radio button -- and then save that choice in a cookie all using jquery

825190
contains	elements
i tend to use attributes for metadata about the data contains in the elements

825190
callback	methods
if you re using a sax processor then this format will result in one methods callback with the atteribute structure populated

825199
integer	zero
the compiler emits code in the shared library that calculates the address of the integer to be initialized to be a certain offset probably zero in this case because it s the only member from the pointer to the a object it knows to be this

825199
data-members	constructor
by pimpl ing you can safely add and remove data-members to the inner class as the memory allocation and constructor call happen in the shared library

825199
data-members	constructor
edit i should maybe add that the only reason i m talking about the constructor here is that i didn t want to provide more code - the same argumentation applies to all functions that access data-members

825200
checkbox	button
for checkbox radio button dynamic content i would expect these to be dynamic yet predictable

825203
32-bit	64bit
this is somewhat crude but basically tells you whether the clr is running as 32-bit or 64bit which is more likely what you would need to know

825203
32-bit	64bit
the clr can run as 32-bit on a 64bit processor for example

825216
click	mouse
is there a way to retrieve the map coordinates with a mouse click on the map

825218
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox and webkit based browsers although beware google-chrome has bugs in this area use their css border-radius based styles for native rounded corners

825243
spring	grails
we are a java + spring shop and took the opportunity to try out grails

825248
unique	words
i would add all unique words to a list and then used this regex

the methods which required fdlibm semantics are sin cos tan asin acos atan exp log log10 cbrt atan2 pow sinh cosh tanh hypot expm1 and log1p

825256
formatting	import
languages â c# â formatting style â namespace import â add using directive to the deepest scope

825263

or is there some way i can change the working directory to the user s root backup folder so i can simply specify relative file paths

825266
bug-tracking	workitem
we create a new workitem or check-in note that is a simple link to our legacy bug-tracking system

825271
library-project	libs
the sample has a project dependency on the class libs and the setup project is configured to deploy the class libs the output from the .net class libs-project and the sources of the vb app

825274
filtering	grouping
you can then use the filtering property to filtering by grouping user etc.

825278
checkbox	textbox
the getvalue function not included here is a clumsy solution it checks for various types textbox dropdownlist checkbox etc. and gets the string value from the appropriate property textbox.text dropdownlist.selectedvalue checkbox.checked etc.

825298
build-server	teamcity
try and run the teamcity service with a local build-server user instead of the system account

825313
keyboard	mouse
you can alleviate this problem a little by removing the mouse keyboard and the screen and only access the build-server through rdp or something similar

825326
value	field
if you have two fields with the same name to get the value of any field you have to read from

825326
radio-button	selected
and if you want to get value of selected radio-button you have to check which one is selected

825340
32-bit	64bit
so i think my options are to force excel to run in 32-bit mode or declare the dll iâ m using as a 32-bit dll even though my environment is 64bit

825345
versioning	upgrade
if that s not the answer you can always try to upgrade your ruby-on-rails versioning to 2.3 and see if the problem persists

825356
populate	row
the multipoint geometry data type would work well for this but my question is is there a way to populate a two column table with the x y values in a multipoint where each point is a row in the table and the x and y point values go in column1 and column2 respectively

825357
selected	cell
that said if your goal is simply to enable disable certain button when a cell is selected

825357
selected	cell
this will occur after they selected the cell and before it s deselecteded

825357
selected	cell
the only reason i can think you would want to use deselected is maybe the aesthetic value of ensuring your event only occurs after the selected cell is no no longer highlighted

825361
32-bit	64bit
the tricky bit here is you might have a 64bit cpu but a 32-bit os

825367
handler	service
for your tests you can basically inject a handler in that httpclient instance to return a mocked response to the test before the real service is called in the last handler transport stage

825373
form-for	destroy
when you create a messagewindows or a form-for that matter on a thread when that thread exits the windows form is destroy

825391
windows-xp	windows
the service and the clients both are running on windows server 2003 because i found that windows-xp has a known problem with multiple tcp connections related to 10053

825402
numerical	nan
i m performing numerical operations on a text input field and am checking if the field is null or nan

825406
exception-handling	try-catch
unchecked exception-handling are a good way to notify your clients about exceptional situations including illegal pre-conditions and yet not burdening them with the need to wrap calls to your api with try-catch blocks which most of the time basically serve no purpose other than debugging tracing etc

825410
value	field
the dropdown tries to override the selected value if some of these objects has a property or key with the same name as your field

825413
gridview	listview
now things have changed and the datagrid has been replaced by the gridview and or listview

825444
zipfile	archive
you could of course symlink the stuff you want to archive in the location where you ll create the zipfile i assume you can actually cd to that directory

825444
symlink	archive
with the proper options zip will not archive the symlinks themselves but the symlinked files instead using the names of the symlink

825445
gridview	listview
i d say that you should investigate the gridview listview to see what they can do but ultimately if you and your customers are happy with your own code and it works for you does everything you need it to then there s no need to change just because there is something else out there

825454
contains	any
if a string has a numerical syntax which can contains any number of white-space characters it can be converted to number type

825470
void	main
as you can see i have written the line public void main ... to take care of this but eveidently it does not work

825470
void	main
replacing public void main with public static void main string arguments still returns the error no main classes found.

825478
any	set
i ve found that it can easily be set if you use tortoisegit but it seems to handle diff by itself and no settings from tortoisegit give any indication on how to set up araxis as a merge tool when diff is invoked from the command-line

825481
udp	tcp
i am trying to write rules to drop any packet irrespective if it is outgoing incoming or being forwareded which has a specific sub string in the tcp or udp payload how am i suppose to do that

825483
action-filter	controller
the one in controller action the one in action-filter or maybe both

825505
subtraction	division
there are similar operator for subtraction multiplication division power and others

825505

i am in the process of trying to user md5 hash of the urls instead but in the meantime i was just wondering if there was a way i could check on the length of a string stored in a variables

825586
installation	uninstall
you will need to first properly uninstall your old msi-based installation using msiexec x product-code or msi file name and then you can install the new stuff using innosetup

825602
contains	set
set the svn ignore property on directory that contains files directory you want to ignore

825612
buildpath	libs
in eclipse you need to add libs to the project buildpath

825616
selected	textbox
update unfortunately our report pages the pages these grids appear on are not using restful urls - for example we have what we call an advanced search page which takes a rather large number of potential parameters nearly 30 that come from a form containing selected lists textbox etc

825624
mouseleave	mouseenter
or two manually setup mouseenter mouseleave events to handle your hover style

825629
callback	methods
create your component there using a callback and the main form s invokerequired invoke methods

825636
rhino-mocks	moq
frameworks like moq and rhino-mocks don t specifically need an interface

825636
any	set
the one thing to note with at least those two frameworks is that to set any expectations on methods or properties they must be virtual or abstract

825639
composite	visitor
i would probably use the composite pattern to represent the tree of report elements and visitor as harald said to turn the report object into a specific concrete representation

825645
compact-framework	.net
how do you find the number of rows in a datagrid using .net compact-framework

825658
lookup	any
i want to be able to do a user lookup with any of the following parameters but at least one is required while keeping the default error-handling php provides if no parameter is passed .

825665
digits	zero
a double only has like 52 bits of signficand so i think that only gives you around 15 base 10 digits which would explain why you have 5 zero when you ask for 20 digits

825675
any	set
are there any standardised set of diagrams or mathematical symbols used in the design of functional programs or are such programs best designed in short functional-pseudo code given that functions will be much shorter than imperative counterparts

825697
equals	getter
it s not a solution rather workaround - but you might try generate equals then use encapsulate field refactoring to replace all field acceses to use getter setters it works inside class also

825699
formatting	printing
i skipped installing rdoc and ri because it printing out a bunch of formatting warnings making it more difficult to paste the results in here.

825704
constructor	private
i had to add an empty private constructor in personform to get the designer to not throw an error

825707
void	main
also make sure that everything compiles correctly and then retry using a public static void main string arguments .

825710
selected	textbox
how can i selected all textbox and textareas e.g

825734
keyboard	mouse
there are a couple of things you can do to improve your keyboard mouse usage ratio with eclipse

825742
positioning	fluid
wrap them around your content and use negative margin s and background positioning to get the right effect that spans the height of the fluid content

825746
cos	sin
ieee doesn t specify the output of math functions sin cos exp ...

825752
double-quotes	spaces
as several posters have mentioned to pass a parameter contains spaces you must surround the actual parameter value with double-quotes

825777
buffering	streaming
one way would be to write initial contents to a memory buffering first then headers into real output streaming followed by flush of bufferinged contents and from thereon just write to the non-bufferinged streaming

825777
buffering	streaming
as to implementing it you can use bytearrayoutputstreaming for buffering and then have your outputstreaming class take real output streaming as argument

825787
versioning	upgrade
i don t need to have the compatibility with older versioning once it is upgrade

825793
installation	upgrade
upgrade don t exist for installscript projects but there are no windows installer restrictions to keep you from running multiple installation simultaneously

825798
.when	ready
but .when i am ready to run the app and use that user-controls inside a datatemplate for say a list box i need it to just look like this

825798
.when	ready
how can i use the nifty binding to design in belnd but not have to touch search replace all these bindings .when i am ready to run the project

825823
authentication	impersonation
you have turned off anonymous access set the authentication mode to windows and set impersonation to true etc

825823

825832
arguments	default
arguments with default were arg1 default_1 arg2 default_2

825832
arguments	default
arguments with default were arg1 x arg2 y

825851
quicksort	in-place
quicksort full in-place sort of sequence using quick sort and pick middle value

825851
contains	elements
the phase one stops as soon as one sequence is full which means it contains 14 elements including the median value

825859
webforms	asp.net
what is the easiest way to monitor how long it is taking to render my asp.net pages i m using webforms still if it matters

825879
mime	rfc
the initial problem involved the presence of whitespace within a quoted printable base64 encoded mime header - which as i read the rfc 2047 specification - isn t allowed

825925
base-class	subclass
i have written several simulations with a human base-class that have a male and female subclass

825941
execute	prepare
in the past i ve used the sqlite3_exec function to execute sql statements instead of the harder prepare statement api

825946
order	add
loop thru your records at each order add the

825946
sorted	lookup
there are no lookup necessary since both lists are sorted the same they can be walked top to bottom taking action only when necessary

825961
getter	setter
to use your example the iaccount interface you describe exposes getter and setter on the account object

825969
gnome	kde
my intention is to find out if the switching user under kde gnome has a similar api call i can monitor with freepascal

825990
transparency	frame
next frame was drawn over the previous one so elements i wanted to become transparency in the middle of the animation just didn t do it properly they still have the color of the previous frame

825997
checkbox	textbox
the togglecontrols function to disable enable all the controls inside the table this means all textbox buttons checkbox radio buttons and dropdowns looks like this

826003
difference	zero
if you use boost.bind you can perform currying on the functors to account for difference between the number of arguments the functor expects and the number of arguments the run methods expects zero

826013
administration	account
to access a network share the above user will need to be a domain account setup by a network administration

826039
unsafe	out
paul did point out however that if you go out of your way to write unsafe sql that subsonic will allow you to

826045
getter	setter
adding interfaces is really useful for design-patterns like strategy and visitor but in those cases i don t carbon copy the getter and setter of the domain classes

826050
32-bit	64bit
i got this error when i was running the 64bit version of the clr and trying to load an assembly that was marked 32-bit only

826052
mocking	stubs
before mocking frameworks people rolled their own mocks stubs fakes - maybe it s not as quick and easy but you still can

826065
oracle	mysql
i suggest zend framework db backage it has adapters for most database connectivity pdo mysql sql server oracle sqlite is object oriented and uses row gateway and table gateway patterns prevents sql injections works with stored procedures has a builtin profiler etc

826077
swing	awt
of course their might be some libraries that are specifically designed for java gui stuff like swing or awt

826093
value	field
either modify all your varchar2 field to be not null default - or any other arbitrary value or use indicatores in all your queries that return varchar2 field or always use nvl

826103
directory	folder
based on this directory structure and what you ve shown so far the service class would go in a myproject.services.service folder under the myproject.services directory

826103
directory	folder
the customerservice class would go in a myproject.services.service.support folder under the myproject.services directory

826107
required	checked
if not do whatever user auth you required kerberos checked forms auth openid etc. to generate a unique token

826125
iteration	elements
you cannot know which node that is but by continuing the iteration swapping some elements twice you arrive at the head of the list again

826126
value	field
if your goal is to always have the value in uppercase then you should override save in the model field

826146
nonblocking	epoll
experimenting i ve found that epollhup only happens in conjunction with epollerr the reason for this may be the way python interfaces with epoll and low-level io normally recv would return a -1 and set errno to eagain when nothing is available on a nonblocking recv however python uses nothing returned to signals eof

826146
having	select
it seems that epollin and a recv that returns an empty string is indicative of the other end having closed the connection however using an older version of python before epoll were introduced and plain select on a pipe i ve experienced that a read that returned did not indicate eof just a lack of available data

826156
duplicates	contains
unfortunately the form contains a duplicates key elemkey

826156
concatenation	comma
i tried creating a namevaluecollection from the httpcontext.current.request.form variables and adding the multiple elemkeys but it again just concatenation them together with comma

826173
return-value	arguments
can you just type-cast your functor to an appropriate class that supports the function with the necessary arguments and return-value

826222
web-services	webserver
a the webserver that comes with asp.net the one you run your web-services on in debug mode

826222
web-services	webserver
what s bothering me to the hilt now is the broken asp.net webserver won t allow me to debug my web-services or even have another project in the same solution create a web reference to it

826231
value	field
i know that i can just check if the dataset.state dsinsert before comparing the values as if the state dsinsert every oldvalue is null but i want to understand why the oldvalue tries to convert the value instead of just returning null in all field when the state dsinsert

826243
silverlight	wpf
the patterns and practices group also published the composite application guideance for wpf and silverlight which includes a full library that can be used

learn lisp or scheme

826280
sniffing	traffic
sniffing the traffic on the server and preferably on the client as well should give you more insight as to what s going on

826309
put	get
here the requirement is to get the sum total of all the digits in the cells in column c and put the value in the corresponding cell in column b in my example - 1 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 1 2.5

826323
installation	environment
installation testing environment

826336
key-value	key
you could load the resx file then loop over the key-value pairs and then store them reversed in a hashtable the key in the hashtable is actually the value of the resource and the value in the hashtable is the key of the resource

826354
packets	ping
for example i have ping transmitting on a socket that is associated with a physical connection a and i want to rebind that socket to physical connection b and have the ping packets continue being sent and received on connection b after a short delay during switch-over

826390
zipinputstream	inputstream
should i perhaps subclass zipinputstream and try to find out how many bytes it s reading from it s wrapped inputstream

826403
fireworks	photoshop
fireworks is my preferred tool but photoshop s also more than up to it

826435
codedom	.net
the best solution in c# all static .net languages is to use the codedom for such things

826437
attributes	properties
every intrinsicpropertydescriptor should have a category attributes intrinsic properties and every inferedintrinsicpropertydescriptor should have a category attributes inferred intrinsic properties

826444
design-time	designer
however the road you re going down isn t one that will play nicely with the designer as you aren t going to be able to get it to initializer your form at design-time with those parameters you ll have to provide a parameterless constructor for it to work

826459
callback	methods
then you have a endxxx methods which takes the iasyncresult returned by the beginxxx operation plus any ref and out arguments which is invoked when the call is to be completed either after callback waiting on event in the iasyncresult or by blocking

826463
push	pull
git allows you to push pull aka commit update to from an svn server too but gives you more leeway on the side

826480
double	int
the property tag is always outputting an int even when the evaluated value is a double

826507
blackberry-simulator	blackberry
since you need the blackberry jre and will be testing with the blackberry-simulator using eclipse will be the most hassle free

826509
value	field
finally update each of the 3 field with the day s value and repeat the process tomorrow

826510
double	int
you re doing integer arithmetic because your inputs are int not double two divided by four is zero for int

826521
svg	vml
however this guy did it using vml for ie and svg for other browsers see scaled circles section

826551
sql-server	mysql
going through the same exercise with another dbms selected in the new project screen worked just fine and i have been able to hack through things to get my project switched over from mysql to sql-server by installing the ms jdbc driver and getting the ado.rb file copied into my ruby install ala this post

826567
for-loop	loops
so most of the time in the for-loops is spent creating strings assigning them to a variable and then overwriting them the next time through the loops

826571
put	get
you take something from get and put it right into the sql query

826588
javascript	dom
unless you want to get really friendly with the dom and browser compatibility i d learn javascript through the mask of one of the nice frameworks like jquery or prototype

826590
user-interface	drawing
the second piece of code makes your drawing functions run in the main user-interface thread

826614
versioning	upgrade
after your database can track what versioning # it is on - it can do sql upgrade automatically

826616
implements	abstract
if you add a single new methods to the interface in the future all existing client-supplied classes that implements the interface now become abstract meaning you won t be able to compile or instantiate the client-supplied class at runtime

826617
perl	ruby
a solution in perl or ruby would be ideal

826624
instances	private
so private allows access to any instances of that class

826628
contains	set
i want to set it to a new string that contains javascript

826629
javascript	dom
the biggest web based javascript projects are going to deal with the dom

826633
environment	execution
these can be used to manipulate the execution environment

826633
callback	methods
if hook or callback methods throw exception-handling internal worker threads may in turn fail and abruptly terminate

826652
object-reference	instances
the error we get is a nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

826653
postback	ajax
you can also achieve the same idea using ajax techniques so that you avoid a full postback

826660
any	set
i also called this function in any product detail pages to set the appropriate dynamic title

826671
attributes	properties
couldnâ t they be handled similarly to listitem objects which donâ t require runat attributes but are instead accessed via parent_control.item properties

826673
value	field
i want to use the following interface as an interface proxy to extract the name value out of the field dictionary

826694
cos	sin
as noted by steve schnepp the output of math functions such as sin cos exp etc

826713
value	field
reading from the request.form collection doesn t cause an exception-handling neither if the value is an emptry string which happens if the input-field is blank nor if the field doesn t even exist

826717
parentheses	operators
basically the expressions will only contain variables logical operators or and implication equivalence negation and parentheses

826733
assign	add
until now this submenu is static but often there is a need to add a new place to the menu and assign a new shortcut

826739
google-chrome	firefox
if this is your users choice leave it to their browsers most mature browsers us a zoom that magnifies their page rendering ie 7 8 opera firefox google-chrome 2.0 safari

826745
user-controls	ascx
if this is a user-controls you have an ascx file

826751
xml-serialization	xml
try something like simple xml-serialization it comes with support for generic types in xml elements with a number of annotations such as element and elementlist

826755
malloc	free
background we have overloads for malloc calloc free and the various variants of operator new and delete and the linker happily makes stl use these for us

826774
authentication	login
we have traditionally done our own login password access level authentication authentication but as long as we have to rewrite to meet standards why not become more flexible

826782
highlight	selected
at the top of the stack overflow page or tabs is there a css standard way to disable the highlight effect if the user accidentally selected the text

826790
bison	yacc
if you use a tool such as bison yacc for c or antlr generates a number of languages but uses java you won t have to worry much about parsing

826807
bison	yacc
use yacc or bison or the equivalent for writing the descendent recursive parsing

826807
order	add
later add attributes to the grammar in order to get the evaluation of the expression you want to evaluate in a descendent recursive way

826818
set	bag
have you specified the collection as a list type rather than a bag or a set

826822
attributes	properties
create the file in app_code and fill out the following or use google for other attributes properties possibilities

826825
value	field
you might also have a table where the identity definition is missing and thus it can t insert becasue it is a required field and the value is missing

826829
export	csv
for example you could import both files into mysql then create a join then export it to csv

826831
contains	any
the whole process will fall flat if any of the data contains commas

826848
temporary	copy
you sort each file into a temporary copy based on the common key

826849
google-chrome	firefox
you can do so in firefox and safari google-chrome also

826861
user-controls	ascx
i ve made the user-controls in its ascx file and dragged it into my aspx page

826876
object-reference	instances
just dragging a radtextbox into a view and running the page generates a run-time error of the good old favorite object-reference nto set to an instances of an object

826887
cvs	git
this is the primary advantage of switching from svn or cvs to a distributed system like git

826888
convention	standards
it may be specified by another standards or it may be just a convention

826901
protected	public
you mean you would like to map private or protected members to the database rather than having them all public

826905
constructor	private
now i can solve this by creating a dummy private constructor to these classes as the first constructor but i m more curious about what causes this

826908
hide	show
i then developed some javascript to hide show div tags

826919
export	report
if you want to break up a report in tabs when export use mutiple tables with page breaks

826921
any	set
i have checked and it doesn t offer me any help because my lib and include environment variables are not set either in the user variables or the system variables

826923
hash	md5
the previous suggestion to use an md5 hash is a good one although you have to prevent that from becoming a performance problem in and of itself

826929
administration	account
the application-pool is running under an account with administration permissions

826966
onmousedown	onmouseup
as others have said you can use mouse.cursorpos or the getcursorpos function but you can also just handle the onmousedown or onmouseup event instead of onclick

826971
any	set
i need an event handler that gets triggers each time any one of a set of registry values is changed

826978
perl	ruby
are escaping are required as opposed to say regexes in perl or ruby

826983
transparency	frame
for each frame of an animation you d probably need to grab a copy of the image that represents your main screen and then blend in your glyphs with this at the appropriate transparency level

826987
getter	setter
you can define the access modifier per property and independently for the getter and the setter

827042
freebsd	aix
my guess is that they don t have an aix or freebsd also not there machine around to do it

827045
http-status-code-400	bad-request
http-status-code-400 bad-request for an unsuccessful

827049
any	set
have the autocomplete set up to force selection from the list -- which will disallow any non-matching text in the field

827051
contains	elements
that is a productinfo elements contains a sequence of two informationset children the first having and the second having

827052
lookup	any
again no matter what your project is you urls.py should be configured so that any view can be reached with a reverse lookup

827062
constructor	object
rather than creating them all the time create a cache manager that allows you to pass in the parameters that you would use in the constructor for those objects and keep that object around

827065
markup	xhtml
we intend to simply use plain old css and xhtml markup

827080
python	java
this should work pretty well as jythonc translate python code to java and then java is compiled to bytecode

827085
pointers	stack
this pushes ebp the frame pointers onto stack

827092
32-bit	64bit
i d expect a theoretical limit on the number of elements of 2 31-1 on 32-bit platforms and 2 63-1 on 64bit platforms

827110
postgresql	oracle
but i m trying to migrate to postgresql because of the partitioning feature which is not available in oracle xe

827111
any	set
in any case what i would do is to set up properties for your uitabviewcontroller in your uiapplicationdelegate so that you can access it from the delegate you can get the app delegate by calling

827137
rollback	commit
the means that transactionalmethos is completely seperate from the other transaction that it was called from and it will commit rollback completely seperately as well

827147
webforms	asp.net
i have a jquery autocomplete field on an asp.net webforms and everything has been working great until now

827149
value	field
a better approach to this is to keep a bookmark consisting of the value of the field you re order on for the last entity you retrieved and the entity s key

827149
value	field
then when you want to continue from where you left off you can add the field s value as the lower bound of an inequality query and skip records until you match or exceed the last one you saw

827175
selected	textbox
there s a dropdown displaying 1-10 from where the user selected the number of textbox he wants - if he chooses unlimited it shows him a textbox wherein he enters the exact number of textbox he d like

827178
emacs	vim
if you plan you configurationure anything in a unix based system likelihood is you going to be editing a fair few configuration files therefore you ll want to learn a terminal based editor of which vim is one of the best sorry emacs

827178
textmate	vim
no need to post i need a textmate alternative for insert os you ll have vim instead

827178
komodo	vim
also on a side note if you find you like the vim key bindings there are also ides which include vim bindings in their editors for simple commands for example komodo edit

827182
constructor	object
2 for each of these non-trivially-constructed object generate the entire potential-function-tree called by their constructor

827190
value	field
you want to make sure the unchecked value is blank and that the field is required

827196
base-class	inherited
i ve got a large set of inherited classes criteria which inherit from a base-class criterion

827201
data-structures	tree
in practical terms this means that simple data-structures such as tree are generally more effective when you don t have to store a lot of data

827203
defined	declare
derived classes do not need to declare or defined their own destructor unless they need something other than default destructor behavior

827210
perl	tcl
that which applies to perl does not necessarily apply to python nor does what applies in tcl apply in java or lisp or .

827224
firefox	opera
i have a flash movie that runs fine in firefox opera safari but not in ie

827249
arrays	loops
if you empty your arrays a lot within say a large loops there s no point creating lots of temporary objects

827252
32-bit	64bit
is there a function in c# that takes two 32-bit integers int and returns a single 64bit one long

827275
python	php
maybe php or even python

827278
contains	elements
then using request.querystring will give you a name-value collection of the querystring values - remember that some querystring elements can contains multiple comma-seperated values which is why the example in the docs has an inner loop

827288
required	checked
also you could move the images to be served off a webserver and have the client cache the image locally and then have a way of the client checked for an updates image periodically that way only the required images would have to be downloaded

827289
entity-framework	ado.net
however i think you may be looking for something like the ado.net entity-framework

827290
entity-framework	nhibernate
subsonic nhibernate don t forget to look at fluent nhibernate typed datasets yuck ms entity-framework and ibatis all come to mind

827294
for-loop	arrays
and then use a for-loop to put the id attributes into another arrays

827302
perl	php
we have written the frontend web in php mysql and the parser in perl also using mysql of course

827318
xsd	xml
this overcomes the problem above because although that element name can appear many times in the xml it only appears once in the xsd

827318
xsd	xml
here is example xsd and xml - tested with xerces this time

827322
required	checked
if your source control doesn t required a special action to checked in from an old versioning get a different source control

827350
linux	unix
if on linux unix

827353
firefox	opera
firefox safari opera etc

827358
perl	awk
ideally this would take the form of a windows batch file but perl or awk solutions would be okay too

827362
contains	elements
specifically i assume that you re thinking of each list having a car the first elements and a cdr the sublist contains all following elementss

827372
compact-framework	.net
i have a need to use a colormap object in .net compact-framework but from what i can tell it is not available

827383
web-services	api
the w3c have a experimental api that can accept code fragments that might be of use and there are other 3rd party web-services though i m not sure if they can accept fragments as well

827386
chown	chmod
your users will also need to chmod and chown the files appropriately

827406
haskell	ocaml
haskell currently list 144 jobs on indeed ocaml list 12 and c# list 26 000

827406
haskell	ocaml
these numbers are not perfect but i bet you that once f# ships it won t be long before it blows past haskell and ocaml in the number of job listings

827421
constructor	object
each business object in the business layer has a constructor that accepts a idatareader

827431
dictionary	arrays
every other language has a collections containers part of its standard library containing implementations of dynamic arrays known as arraylists in java list in c# and vectors in c++ linked lists dictionary and other common data structures

827431
dictionary	arrays
arrays arraylist dictionary set linkedlist and so on

827431
linked-list	arrays
they can be plain pointers into an arrays linked-list iterators or any other valid iterator type

827431
member-functions	inline
and member-functions such as operator can be inline

827443
void	main
it is special because it has the static void main function that is the entry point for the program

827444
execute	declare
the first declare an instances of the program class and then calls the ismin methods on this instances whereas the second simply calls the ismin methods without referring to any instances you can think that the methods always belongs to the class as a whole and is execute within this general context

827449
unicode-string	utf8-decode
in this example two.name is an utf8-decode string not unicode since it did not import unicode_literals and one.name is an unicode-string

827465
select	union
sqlarrays arrays drop or 1 1 union select select from select host create table from users users where

827465
salt	md5
put a salt md5 with the user s agent + remoteip + your salt in the user s session and make it verify on every page load that the correct md5 is in their cookie

827486
contains	any
i m looking into developing a used cars web app but i ve searched and i cannot find any available database for download paid or free that contains all the makers and models of automobiles

827495
google-chrome	firefox
now the pure css one works well in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

827495
google-chrome	firefox
it is my understanding and the behaviour of firefox and google-chrome that this should not be the case because the left divs are block level elements that floats should basically ignore

827496
updating	updates
that would keep any other iup controls that are display in the dialog updates as well as the canvas which can be useful if you have controls that don t do all their own updating internally

827499
integer	digits
how do i create a string so that it formats floating point numbers to have no trailing decimal point or digits when it is an integer but to not switch to scientific notation for larger numbers

827502
value	field
i ve obfuscated the field names and value but really it doesn t get much more trivial than that

827503
selected	button
then you selected highlight the button in ib and change the font size on the fonts panel you just opened

827512
double	int
write a little helper function which takes the double float and returns an int precision by multiplying by 1000 and then doing modulo 10 100 1000

827527
hash	md5
i am trying to copy a file get a md5 hash then delete the copy

827536
llvm	gcc
llvm is an optimizing ir for compilers that is often faster than even gcc

827539
subtract	time
assume that the time reported by the remote machine was true at half the round-trip time ago this assumes symmetric delays on average - not always true but you can t really do better without digging deep into the network layout and subtract it from the current machine s time

827563
push	pull
i initially would like to push and pull with a subversion server

827567
inherited	subclass
described here jaxb inherited unmarshal to subclass of marshaled class

827574
updating	updates
i have considered either looking up each object and updating it directly or constructing a tree of data objects that will be updates in a background thread - once all the updates have been applied in the background the display objects would be recreated based upon data in the tree

827581
one-to-many	entity
this will bring back the properties and if the relationship between entity and properties is a one-to-many but not a many to many you will find that each resulting anonymous type has the same values in

827590
value	field
i would like to edit this query it so that the folio_topics.topic_poster field is unique so i don t get 6 records with the same topic_poster but rather 6 records all of which have a unique topic_poster value

827591
multiplication	transpose
m is the transpose of m and multiplication is implicit

827593
constructor	object
it is not legal to call a constructor on an already-existing object

827594
haskell	ocaml
should you learn f# or haskell if you know ocaml

827594
haskell	ocaml
in contrast both ocaml and haskell are being developed in extremely unproductive directions

827594
haskell	ocaml
this has been killing ocaml for several years now and i expect haskell to follow suit over the next few years

827594
scala	ocaml
most former professional ocaml and haskell programmers already moved on to f# credit suisse flying frog consultancy and most of the rest will doubtless migrate to more practical alternatives such as clojure and scala in the near future

827594
haskell	ocaml
haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction

827594
haskell	ocaml
nobody has ever succeeded selling libraries to ocaml and haskell programmers and i am one of the few people to have tried but f# libraries already sell in significant quantities

827594
haskell	ocaml
ocaml is specifically designed for writing theorem provers and haskell is specifically designed for researching haskell

827594
haskell	ocaml
f# was designed to address all of the most serious practical problems with ocaml and haskell such as poor interoperability lack of concurrent garbage collection and lack of mature modern libraries like wpf in order to bring a productive modern language to a large audience

827598
any	set
a simple kludge would be to set your view controllers as the text field s delegate then just block any edit that involves non-uppercase or makes the length longer than 4

827600
contains	elements
when using an xslt stylesheet to transform an xml file which contains embedded xhtml using namespaces into pure xhtml i m left with redundant namespace definitions on the elements which were originally xhtml

827603
moss	wss
if you use the moss approval workflow or simply content approval available in wss and moss there will be an extra column in the list library for the approval

827613
innodb	myisam
note also by default windows installation use innodb tables while ubuntu installation use myisam tables

827623
put	get
all the url variabless get variabless are put into the php variables as an arrays

827629
base-class	inherited
if the type inherits the same base-class more than once the conversion function or operator must use scope resolution to specify which of the inherited classes to use in the conversion

827629
base-class	inherited
so imagine you have base-class and base-classa and base-classb both inherit base-class and then derivedclass inherited both base-classa and base-classb

827629
copy-constructor	constructor
if you are doing a conversion or operator overload to convert derivedclass to a baseclassa or baseclassb you will need to identify which constructor i m thinking something like a copy-constructor iirc to use in the conversion

827630
linux	unix
table names using myisam at least on windows are case-insensitive whereas it s case-sensitive on unix linux

827647
binary-tree	nodes
in binary-tree every nodes would store some value and have 2 children for example left and right

827647
children	nodes
for breadth first traversal you would start from root look at nodes s value and then push it s children if they exist into a queue

827647
children	nodes
then loop while there s a nodes in the queue get nodes from the front of the queue and repeat look at it s value if it has children then push them at the end of queue

827654
derived-class	base-class
in c++ the base-class is guarenteed to be fully constructed before the derived-class constructor starts

827670
repository	entity
is it ok for an entity to access a repository via some irepository interface to get a value at runtime

827673
linked-list	arrays
i personally chose to use a stack but you could do it with a simple arrays or even a linked-list which you said you already have experience with

827683
show	next
i am looking for a way to create a of items that i can put within a and have them show up side-by-side and wrap to the next line as the browser windows is resized

827686
put	get
when i start the application without debugging i get an exception-handling i put the info that i get from the exception-handling here

827711
hide	show
do you toggle comments or slabs of code to quickly show or hide content

827711
hide	show
php - defining something like hide works well other variabless could be production or dev - large slabs can then be hidden and show together with one simple variables change

827722
codeigniter	kohana
has anyone transferred code from codeigniter to kohana before

827722
codeigniter	kohana
i guess we re gonna keep this project as a codeigniter one and move to kohana as soon as our next project comes

827724
display	width
now since you ve changed the display mode from block implied to inline any padding margin width or height styles you applied to li elements will not work

827726
subclass	nsobject
subclass of nsobject named mad

827729
element	dynamic
also - if i have a dynamic arrays with 5 elements and i insert a new element at position 6 the operation is o n whereas if i use the function to append to the end of the arrays it is o 1

827729
element	dynamic
or does append to the dynamic arrays really insert the new element somewhere besides position 6

827743
linked-list	arrays
the example that you give would be that reflect by a dynamic arrays achieved by employing a linked-list

827743
linked-list	nodes
inserting regardless of the index would require traversing the linked-list meaning one operation per nodes up until the desired index

827750
integer	digits
mike s approach is reasonable but you can compute the number of digits directly using the log10 function and use either floor or ceil to verify that you in fact have an integer value

827750
integer	digits
unpacking that chain of function calls we first take the absolute value to make sure the argument is non-negative add 0.5 to the known integer value to take care of any possible roundoff errors in computing log10 of an exact power of 10 combine log10 and floor to get the exponent of the largest power of 10 less than fabs x +0.5 and finally add 1 to get the number of digits needed to represent x

827770
selected	button
now on simulator on mac i assume if it works the same way you may be able to set time out on your capture tool for a couple of seconds and then selected the row and hold the mouse button down until the time out takes the snapshot

827779
rollback	commit
however if you attempt an insert from session 2 using the primary key of 7 then it will block behind session 1 as it has to wait and see if session 1 will commit or rollback

827786
worksheet	excel
the following somewhat verbose example connects to an open excel worksheet and gets the comment text from cell b2

827787
switching	screens
for example open preview and choose file grab timed screens then switching back to the iphone simulator and hold the mouse button down on the row in the table view until the screens flashes

827808
codeigniter	kohana
see kohana s documentation - migrating from codeigniter

827808
codeigniter	kohana
kohana has changed substantially since forking from codeigniter

827812
decrement	increment
then you just need to keep track of the start and end indices that define the head and tail elements of the buffering and make sure to compute mod n when increment decrement the indices

827826
constructor	object
the object s state is not copied so implicitly calling the copy constructor makes no sense

827830
webforms	asp.net
or skip asp.net webforms and skip to asp.net mvc which gives you complete control of the html markup that is generated

827845
any	set
deadlocks can happen in any transaction isolation level because innodb will set locks on updates even on read uncommitted

827847
exception-handling	try-catch
one thing i haven t tried is wrapping every methods in a try-catch exception-handling e which would probably help a lot

827859
scala	ocaml
sml ocaml haskell and f# use type inference algorithms based upon hindley-milner whereas scala has only local type inference like c# 3 and requires many more annotations to compile

827859
ocaml	sml
sml ocaml f#

827859
haskell	scheme
haskell mathematica and scheme

827859
haskell	sml
sml ocaml f# and haskell allow closed sealed algebraic types to be defined to strengthen static typing by conveying more specific constraints implicitly

827859
haskell	sml
ocaml and f# also allow open sum types whereas sml does not and haskell requires an elaborate workaround described by oleg kiselyov

827859
ocaml	sml
pattern matching is very fast in sml and vanilla ocaml but has unknown performance in f# due to active patterns and even unknown asymptotic complexity in mathematica

827859
scheme	lisp
f# lisp and scheme allow code

827859
ocaml	lisp
ocaml mathematica lisp and

827859
haskell	scheme
sml haskell 2010 common lisp and scheme are standardized languages whereas ocaml erlang f# and mathematica are proprietary

827865
spaces	output
and people go nuts trying to find that one extra spaces that s causing output header problems

827887
value	field
the record get inserted but with null value of the articletitle field

827913
text-editor	editor
i prefer using a text-editor that understands the structure of the source text i m editing and that can do code folding on the basis of structure as parsing by the editor

827913
emacs	vim
either of vim or emacs folding meets this need for me

827926
driver	kernel
go read the linux kernel driver interface

827929
authentication	login
for authentication you won t have a problem as long as the domains are all trusted - basically if the windows-server will accept a login from that domain sharepoint will work with it also

827930
contains	sorted
each of these files contains chronologically sorted lines that begin with timestamps like

827945
configuration	logging
dion olsthoorn blogged about setting the connection string in code but i d prefer to do it in a configuration file that is dedicated to logging as it will be using a different database to the rest of the application

827950
arrays	loops
originally the program just loops through the list of compatibility objects searching for the one that belongs to these three people since each compatibility object contains an arrays of people objects

827960
bison	yacc
i ve not used bison but yacc allows you to override the error-handling and i would hope the equivalent gnu tool was at least as powerful as our old unix clunkers

827961
gethashcode	equals
the dictionary will use gethashcode to determine if two lists are possibly equals and the equalss methods to determine if they actually are in other words the hash code is fast but could give a false positive but never a false negative

827961
gethashcode	equals
use your existing hashing algorithm the xor for gethashcode then just comare the two lists explicitly in the equals methods

827966
hashtable	set
then set a value in a hashtable using the three personids as the key separated with a hyphen or some other character that won t occur in a personid value

827969
nested	order
assuming your object ids are sortable and order doesn t matter you can accomplish this with nested dictionary

827981
perl	awk
you can write this in awk perl python even cobol if you must but the logic is always the same

827982
any	set
after a certain time i don t want the end-user to be able to click on any of the checkbox within the listview so i have a set number of items to backup but i do want them to be able to scroll the list while the backup is being performed

2 sorting a list of base-class pointers where some of the objects may be derived subclassing you only have access to the base-class fields

828266
subtraction	division
believe it or not client side languages are actually quite capable of doing subtraction and division etc

828282
cosine	sine
also hard coding a lookup table for say sine cosine value would probably be a lot more efficient than loading it from a file. but hard coding data purely for the sake of convenience is not a smart idea

828301
library-project	libs
so what you would do is create a libs-project which has the load draw logic of the component in a class and in your other projects create a control class and a component class which are wrappers for the libs code in their respective environments

828307
constructor	object
the major quirk of objective-c++ is that if you don t pass -fobjective-c-call-cxx-cdtors to g++ it won t call the constructor and destructor of c++ instance variables in of objective-c object

828330
google-chrome	firefox
this would work in ie firefox and google-chrome can somebody test the others please

value	field
i want the user-interface to contains the field name read only and current field value which will be editable

828556
value	field
im using the webservice component to retrieve the field value and then asssigning it to an object with the field name hardcoded

828558

828609
value	field
i m assuming this is a lookup field for configuration value of some kind so you could probably go with the composite key if this is the case

828611

828684
set-difference	sequences
this produces the set-difference of two sequences

828686
webserver	upload
to configure against case 1 on a un x system you need to ensure that your upload directory and files therein are owned by the webserver user and only readable by that user

the other option is to configure your webserver to not allow script processing of files in the upload directory

828686
webserver	upload
allowoverride none is important as it stops anyone uploading a .htaccess file to your upload directory and re-configuring the webserver permissions for that directory

then either the various radio button checkbox etc for your configuration settings

829019
quirks-mode	doctype
adding a doctype so the test page is rendered in standards mode instead of quirks-mode fixes that for me

asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you re running iis7 then for both webforms and asp.net-mvc the url rewriting module is worth looking at

829032
administration	account
if you running vista than this probably happens because visual-web-developer runs under priveleged account administration to allow you to develop and debugging your apps

829047
lan	wan
the the server software can - if able to do so - use it s hardware as it will in the final setting where clients will run in a lan or wan

829057
order	join
then again if you know you re going to be navigating that relationship in the course of your use of the object if you ve retrieved a user in order to list their posts or something then you probably want to instruct your orm to load the related objects at the same time which will usually tip it off to perform a single query with a join rather than looping through and performing multiple queries later

829059

adding styles horizontalcontentalignment stretch to the items of the list makes the comboboxes stretch and the textblocks clickable but also column resize slow

829243
communication	messages
additionally processes communication via message-passing with either cloning immutability ensuring that p1 and p2 never logically share the messages that pass between them

829243
communication	messages
it has services erlang processes it mandates asynchronous messages passing with full cloning by default as the only form of inter-service communication and the only handle the outside world has to a service is its uri erlang pid

however if you allow nulls in any of these three field becasue one or more of the value is not known at the time of the insert there can be difficulty and a unique index might be better

829503
temporary	copy
or if you re worried about the file appearing between the test and the copy then you could write to a temporary file and then rename it to the destination file

829550
any	set
i mean you could create a hash set in whatever platform you re using and iterate through the characters failing if the character is already in the set and adding it to the set otherwise - but that s only likely to provide any benefit when the strings are longer

829555
any	set
if it s relevant i m using a 32-bit os and the target-platform is set to any cpu

829560
click	mouse
to get the positioning of the mouse at the time the mouse button was click use getmessagepos

have you looked at the logging suggestions from logging asp.net application shutdown events

829574
javascript	dom
say you in javascript are handed a single dom element or document for example window.document how would you turn that into valid xml

profiling	debugging
i know javascript debugging and profiling are part of it

829638
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql

cvs	git
in my opinion besides the endless git is better than subversion is better than cvs -discussion i don t think the differences between them is what matters

829786
click	mouse
for example when there s a box in the screen and the user click on it to selected it it needs to get handles at the corners and in the center so that the user can move the mouse over such a handle and drag it to enlarge or move the box

829801
any	set

829937
constructor	object
but if you explicitly call a constructor on an object that has already been constructed you re well into undefined behavior-land

829938

you wouldn t actually save any memory at all by storing a short in 16-bit as it would still be part of an associated 32-bit word

833592
triggers	insert
if you are inside the insert triggers you can query the inserted pseudo-table

833600
order	join
for example rather than join on the whole order table join on

833601
arguments	default
you call with the default text as the first arguments and the text that display in an empty field as the second

833601
value	field
the next snippet shows how to retrieve the value in the name field

833615

show	next
sometimes it gets an a add next to it under the scm column but still the next time i commit changes or commit entire project it still doesn t upload and show up on the server

833669
debugging	trace
i would expect console.out to be used when writing or debugging your tests whereas trace would be used to display trace output from the code under test

833713
javascript	dom
use something like jquery or another javascript abstraction library to normalize the dom model

833733
environment	building
i want to setup a codeigniter server hudson here at my place and already set up a test environment where i can building some of our projects

833740
highlight	selected
i can see that when user selected different value i mean the index gets change for combobox from user-interface then the particular text gets highlight but it doesn t happen when we change the index through progammatically c# code

833763
getter	setter
the packing problem i worked around by having getter and setter for the fields storing them in the arrays of byte of the class

833763
getter	setter
if setter getter are inlinable then not an option for me d6 it could be fairly cheap even

833774
directory	folder
easiest way perhaps not the best is to determine the root folder of the directory tree you are after then upon each file take the path relative to that folder and store it as another column path in the db table

833792
arrays	loops
and thus all the elements of all the arrayss are populated without me having to set up a fornext loops for each individual arrays name

833801
constructor	private
i m taking a few arguments in a class constructor to initialize some private variables

833805
contains	set
find the line contains implicit_flush and set it as follows

833825
ubuntu	linux
check to see if you have multiple jvms present in linux you almost certainly do since ubuntu probably comes with a non-sun version and be 110 sure that you re using the expected version to compile

833825
command-line	cmd
from a cmd-line might help too since all of these could feasibly be used to locate a jdk as well as the settings you use in your compile cmd tool

833838
textmate	vim
i m now switching to vim from textmate

833865
python	ruby
admin application requires django.contrib.auth - you might try to monkeypatch it but it s a bad habit django is not ror python is not ruby

833868
arrays	loops
you should create a multidimensional arrays instead of 4 arrayss that would allow you to loops genericly through the arrayss

833869
environment	execution
the code is designed to avoid any side effects and works equally well in any execution environment gui or chui webspeed appserver batch and so on

833871
direct3d	directx
with direct3d 10 they ve split many of the functions that were in idirect3d9 relating to for example adapters into the directx graphics infrastructure dxgi

833873
arrays	loops
as i read your code example i don t think that you need to use 2 seperate loops as if i m right you are assigning the same value to the ith position of your arrays

833873
arrays	loops
i think that this is clearer than trying to write a loops for the variable names especially for the number of arrays you are maintaining

833884
selected	textbox
when the user clicks on it a calendar is displayed and the user selected the date which inputs into the read-only textbox

833885
widget	button
cells can display text numbers and simple widget like push button toggles option menus progress bars etc

833895
attributes	properties
there is a little bit of strangeness when it comes to the asp.net readonly properties and the readonly attributes of an html input element

833895
attributes	properties
rather than setting the readonly properties of the web control try simply adding the html attributes to the control like this

833910
textmate	vim
vim is very different from a number of other editors including textmate in this way

833911
expression	evaluation
even if you don t work with infinite lists writing functions like this will yield better performance on long lists or avoid the stack overflow that occurs when evaluation expression like

833927
dictionary	map
how do i write in yaml a dictionary map where one key has the empty string as its value

833929
expression	evaluation
argument expression evaluation take

so i want a listbox to be shown below the textbox

833965
ghostscript	imagemagick
then convert pdf or ps to an image using imagemagick s convert command or ghostscript

834007
environment	building
hence you need to use a supported building environment to be certain that the result is 100 correct

834008
nested	order
if the functions you re using in the same expression are somehow related one affects the results of the other so different order of calls give different results then refrain of using nested functions in expressions

834020
value	field
in case anyone else has the same problem i inserted the value empty_clob then used the isequentialstream interface to stream the text into the empty field

834032
gnome	kde
ubuntu depending on the variant comes with network managers for kde its the knetworkmanager and gnome is gnome-netstatus-applet

834053
firefox	gecko
the versions of gecko used in firefox 3 and 3.5 support json natively which may be useful if your project is limited to a recent gecko-based application

834069
internet-explorer	firefox
and this works across in both firefox and internet-explorer but if we want certain column headers to show the sorting direction we decorate the th with the class sorted and the direction

834069
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie8 do not have this problem so it s a ie6 7 bug i suspect

834069
background-color	transparency
i thought about using a background-color transparency on the thead th.sorted but ie6 7 just paints the body background it looks like it cuts a hole in the other layers between the body and the th

834074
value	field
i have a table with several fields and one field having 3 comma separated value

834095
constructor	object
note that this is misleading null is not an object but a primitive value of type null which has the consequence that you can t return null from constructor functions - you have to throw an error instead to denote failure

834095
linked-list	nodes
use null to mark the absence of a meaningful value eg the forward reference of the last nodes of a linked-list or if you want to clear a variable as a hint to the garbage collector

834104
glassfish	weblogic
according to oss fast infoset tools implementations are already available on several platforms including microsoft .net and .net cf sun glassfish bea weblogic

834139
show	next
in my game i create alertdialog to show the user next level challenges when one is succeeded

834152
perl	php
does anyone have any idea why this is happening or some library where i can just abstract this away php python or perl

834161
ado	jet
if more than one table the view trick doesn t extend beyond two tables afaik so you may just have to live with the poor performance or change technology dao is reported faster than ado sql-server may be faster than ace jet etc

834171
any	set
i don t think there s any option to set these values in .net gc

834184
.when	ready
you can use the latter one to set your default browser .when you re ready to switching to ie

834198
any	set
the pattern consists of three layers from top down view usually gui but really any external interface viewmodel containing business logic and working set of data and model domain objects etc

834215
ruby	php
you can build telephony applications in groovy javascript php python and ruby

834217
contains	any
the system databases don t seem to contains any user tables

834243
directory	folder
look for app_data folder inside your application root directory

834247
value	field
so the field leftid and rightid can contains nulls or an nvarhcar value even though they are listed as numbers above

834267
children	nodes
when a nodes that has children is selected i want the first child of that nodes to be selected instead of the one that is clicked

the reason i need this is when my application is being shown in design mode in expression-blend i want the viewmodel to instead use a design customer class which has mock data in it that the designer can view in design mode

834284
directory	folder
if none of the targetdir or other macros point to the right place use the .. directory to go backwards up the folder hierarchy

834290
specifications	w3c
yes it s painful to use it is modeled after w3c specifications that were clearly designed by committee

834290
dom4j	jdom
however it is available anywhere and if you settle on it you don t run into the i like dom4j i like jdom i like stringbuffer arguments that come from third-party libraries

834314
virtual-functions	base-class
when i declare a base-class should i declare all the functions in it as virtual or should i have a set of virtual-functions and a set of non-virtual-functions which i am sure are not going to be inherited

834321
arrays	map
and nouns is not an arrays it s map hash table associative arrays object one of those whatever name you prefer

834328
profiling	trace
run a trace in the profiling pick the blank templates select the deadlock graph event and on the new tab that appears events extraction settings save each check save deadlock xml events separately in its own file

834352
contains	any
is there any such publicly available data base contains possibly approximate geo positioning of surveillance cameras

834358
button	popup
i m not using any ajax control toolkit and in the popup there is no text field as i ve mentioned there is only a image and a button below it which i need to click in order to apply that image as theme

834378
primitive	int
interestingly enough i do not have linkage errors when i try to use tree functions when type t is a primitive type like an int

834395
networkx	igraph
i saw networkx and igraph but didn t see a way to output to ascii

834408
profiling	trace
i would suggest that you turn on the deadlock detection trace flags in the first instance rather than running a profiling trace indefinitely

834427
restart	reload
if one of them isn t or doesn t meet the serialization requirements you will lose your session on web app reload or tomcat restart

834459
postback	ajax
the only way is to use your own hidden field to serialise client side additions and read them on postback or ajax the additions serverside

834462
arrays	loops
if there are more than one -- eg a series of radio buttons named submit for some reason -- then .elements submit should be an element collection which is like an arrays which you can loops over to do the same thing

834473
hide	show
could you show the windows off screen do a print and then hide it again

834512
panels	grid
the grid s are added to the panels but the data inside is not displayed

834513
version-control	git
version-control system git

834513
ubuntu	linux
server os a linux distribution ubuntu is probably the most popular

834513
ubuntu	linux
most of the remainder use linux again often ubuntu and a variety of text editors

834516
xsd	xml
we have a schema xsd that defines the structure of this xml

834516
xsd	xml
the first client for whom we originally developed the xml version just wanted an xsd

834565
mapping	unique
how to create a multi-column index and or unique constraint using nhibernate mapping or fluent nhibernate

834581
32-bit	64bit
tried with 64bit jvm and 32-bit neither work

834596
aggregate	grouping
you can use grouping by if you re only interested in an aggregate of the transactions

834605
arrays	loops
so i read a byte at a time in a loops resizing arrays each time

834611
value	field
the idea i have is to add an auto-incrementing field to generate these value so i would have the following data instead

834634
identity-column	unique-key
in this case you can leave the identity-column in there--it won t hurt anything but might help later if you want a single unique-key

834642
revision	updates
when storing the files tfs uses a combination of zip compression as well as storing the deltas between file revision using the same delta engine that is used by windows to handle windows updates etc

834677
button	popup
the user clicks an export button on one of our pages which opens a popup with a form

834677
dialog	pop-up
we can t use a timeout to close the pop-up because there s typically a dialog asking the user how to handle the file before downloading it and there s no way of knowing how long it will take the user to handle this dialog

834677
iframe	popup
so then i tried putting a hidden iframe in the parent windows and having the popup set the iframe s src to the download url before calling self.close

834677
button	popup
on the click of the form button the popup calls a function on window.opener passing in the form and its action url

834677
content-disposition	content-type
in the response to the form url the request headers include content-type application octetstream and content-disposition attachment

834680
layoutsubviews	drawrect
you may not want to call layoutsubviews all the time from drawrect due to the performance hit involved in completely recreating a complex view hierarchy but you could at least figure out specifically which of the subviews need to be resized redrawn based on the passed cgrect and modify just those

834686
any	set
couldn t a new email be set up developmentcodechanges company.com and that mailbox is shared so any developer can look in on that mailbox but it doesn t clog up each developer s personal mailbox

834697
xsd	xml
the magic is called xs3p and it s a fairly substantial xslt file to convert your xsd which is just another xml after all into nicely structured very useful documentation html

834702
order	add
i ve noticed that i have to add another order by 2 desc clause just after ... from atable for my query to work

834707
.net	wcf
create a .net web service using wcf of course to return whether a user is authenticated

834710
windows-server	windows
there is a codeplex project that you can check out that is likely going to be your best best for creating a windows-server on a windows mobile device

834722
arrays	map
my problem is that i now need to map an entire table to just an arrays attribute in memory and am struggling to find out if this is possible and if it is how to do it with sqlalchemy

834725
linux	unix
unixutils are a set of commands of unix ported to windows so i only have to add a directory to the windows path and then i m able to use most of the common linux command in the shell of a windows machine making my job easier

834740
backslash	regex
i haven t used regexcoach but some regex engines require you to specify a backreference with a backslash like this

834755
background-image	background-color
because the background-image is on the table it may extend beyond the header row so you may also want to set the background-color of the tbody or its tr s

834759
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
portableapps provides portable versions of a number of significant tools you might need that will run completely from a thumb drive including firefox browser thunderbird email filezilla ftp and openoffice.org word processing spreadsheet database etc. 7-zip zip file management etc

834779
windows-xp	windows
for example use the windows classic theme in windows-xp in order to save 8 pixels over the default theme

834829
associations	model
how would you set the associations in the model classes of apple lemon and relation

834842
value	field
helpers are supposed to pick up the posted value when rendering and i m noticing that my text field only do so if i include them in the parameter list of the postback action which shouldn t be required seeing as some forms have way too many field to want to list them all as parameters

834842
value	field
for some reason that will force the field value to be preserved

834842
value	field
this seems stupid to me because my form has way more value than just that and i shouldn t have to add a parameter for just that field

834843
unique	words
to solve this i should make the words field unique and then the second instance will fail on commit retransmitting the message which will work but may be problematic

834855
google-chrome	firefox
note i m certainly interested in super-powerful edit-your-whole-workspace-at-once ide features but i m also interested in simple but elegant ui s like firefox s find bar or google-chrome s find tab

834856
dbd	dbi
however iirc the selectrow_array methods is provided by dbi rather than dbd informix so dbi builds it from low-level primitive

834865
protected	public
of course the easy solution to this is to always call the protected virtual-functions rather than their public variants replace b with bimp in the above snippet

834887
svnadmin	dump
you can use svnadmin dump which will dump the repository along with history to a file

834887
svnadmin	dump
you can then use svnadmin load to load the dump file into the trunk folder

834902
32-bit	64bit
not sure if this is what you were getting at but if you are running a 32-bit process on a 64bit operating systems there is an emulation or thunking layer which allows them to run

834908
unique	words
it ll be dreadfully slow to update the db with every words in every document if you re expecting 50 million unique

834927
silverlight	wpf
as a wpf silverlight developer i would add kaxaml and ms blend

834930
exception-handling	error-handling
if at all possible i would recommend using powershell which is a far richer language and includes exception-handling based error-handling

834937
profiling	trace
you can run a profiling trace on your dev box for the queries and see exactly what locks are taken

834955
uiscrollview	subviews
the delegate object itself needs a reference to it s parent the customized uiscrollview so that it has access to the subviews of that scroll view

835021
button	popup
click on the ... button and then format item in the resulting popup box can be used

835022
actionscript	mxml
first the mxml files are compiled into the equivalent actionscript classes

835024
treeview	listview
i have been using objectlistview for quite sometime for almost all of my listview and treeview needs

835054
any	set
in your case you want to insure you set the notifyfilter property to include the notifyfilters.security flag which tells is to watch any permissions changes

835083
restart	daemon
many applications do not depend on syslog 3 and it is usually possible to stop and restart the syslogd daemon without detrimental effects on the system s operation much unlike csrss.exe

835092
dictionary	for-loop
if you do not alter the dictionary between calling keys and calling values is it wrong to assume the above for-loop will always print true

835101
hide	show
trace is easy to show hide and include quite a lot of extra information but doesn t appear to have any kind of persistence backing it

835106
32-bit	64bit
a reference is 4 bytes when running the 32-bit clr and 8 bytes when running the 64bit clr

835113
buffering	streaming
a windows manager gnome for example fetches stuff from the buffering to create a streaming of keyboard interrupts

835121
contains	sorted
this will help mysql to quickly locate the rows you want because the index contains the id in sorted order

835143
contains	elements
suppose you have two lists l and r each of which contains elements from some underlying alphabet s

835161
put	get
i put trace logs and the code does seem to get executed i even replaced self dosomething with a sleep 2 but the intermediate loading view is never displayed

835164
callback	methods
in php you can use specify a methods callback using an arrays as a callback variables see here for example

835172
button	slide
my initial thought is when there are more than lets say 8 button i programmatically make the first and last button and button that will slide the button down by removing and adding button to my toolbar items

835177
any	set
i redid the code according to your suggestion without changing any mapping and now the query returns just one race - the first out of three paging is set to 3 races page matched by the query

835180
python	perl
please don t just recommend that using perl python whatever would be much easier

835184
response	timeout
i currently am taking care of errors assuming that i m receiving response from the web service but also need to handle the edge cases of a service timeout or unavailability

835190
installation	building
don t put building under version-control rebuilding it as part of installation

835201
javascript	dom
i need all features typical browser has http client cookies support dom style html parser javascript engine except rendering

835213
linux	unix
the following code is linux maybe unix only but it works in a real project

835224
export	csv
you still have to deal with rows as if from csv or the a1 type addressing but you don t have to do the export step

835241
javascript-engine	spidermonkey
on second thought since rendering is such a big part of what browsers do you might be better off using a stand-alone javascript-engine like spidermonkey and a stand-alone xml-parsing like xerces-c plus maybe tidy to make your html into xml

835246
activation	account
moderated account activation

835259
value	field
i am trying to show and hide a few form field depending on the value of one of my selected field

835273
groovy	java
also there s likely a lot of other places in your project where you could use groovy instead of java to improve your code particularly now that groovy is owned by spring

835273
groovy	java
examples include writing test cases or replacing java beans with groovy beans

835285
any	set
assuming you are not doing any operations where the entire set of tasks must be known in advance ordering i would expect that plinq would only consume as many tasks as it could process at once

835293
constructor	object
actually when you move grouping of objects using copy there is constructor and destructor call for every object instance

835293
constructor	object
but with c++0x using unique_ptr will allow to do massive moves of object yes practically object because pointer will be smart without massive constructor destructor calls and without risk of using pointers

835318
credentials	integrated
the problem is that most of our data sources use integrated security and for this data source i am using credentials are not required since they are listed in the connection string

835331
javascript-engine	spidermonkey
you may not need the entire engine but you may find some its components useful like spidermonkey which is a javascript-engine written in c

835337
value	field
i m already binding to the change keyup event but these don t handle the case-when the user starts typing in a value and uses the browser s native autocomplete to fill in the rest of the field and staying in the focus of the field.

835353
hash-collision	key
when hash-collision occur the hashtable dictionary calls equals to find the key you re looking for

835362
firefox	safari
while it works great on firefox i couldn t get it working smoothly on ie or safari

835366
controller	routes
i now wonder if i could handle this more cleanly with two routes and controller functions

835377
32-bit	16-bit
however if the current assembler is 16-bit code you re going to have a lot of work porting it to 32-bit assembler anyway.

835382
hide	show
then in jquery dependent on the select-menu s value you can show hide these fieldsets

835382
hide	show
alternatively you can prefix each fields name with a meaningful prefix and then hide show according to that attributes

835390
value	field
the date value from the text field can be fetched by jquery s .val methods like

835398
perl	c++
i m a c++ developer and am just learning perl so am trying to find the cleanest perl way to accomplish this

835407
constructor	object
you can set the viewdata on the controller so why not just make a constructor for customviewdata that takes a viewdata object and do

835422
msbuild	nant
i thought it might be possible to use some sort of build event use a clever msbuild or nant trick or something along those lines but i haven t got a clue

835436
contains	set
i have a user-controls containing textbox and comboboxes and this user-controls is contains in a panels with autoscroll set to true

835436
selected	textbox
when a textbox has the focus and i scroll with the mouse wheel then the panel scrolls when a combobox has the focus and i scroll with the mouse wheel then the selected item in the combobox changes

835448
create-table	alter-table
and i d like to get rid of alter-table statements and make them part of create-table

835453
ostream	std
if no such library exists is it possible to wrap the icu up using the standard c++ classes so i can for example create a ustring which has identical usage to std string and std wstring and also implement versions of the streams optimally with them being fully compatible with the existing ones ie i could pass it to a function expecting an std ostream and it will perform conversion between its internal format and ascii or utf-8 on the fly

835469
derived-class	inherited
for inherited methods that don t require any new functionality such as derived.lower is there a simple pythonic way to return an object of type derived-class instead of str

835479
oracle	mysql
i would like to point out that oracle has recently purchased mysql and that the mysql future is now a little bit up in the air

835479
oracle-xe	oracle
if you are very familiar with oracle-xe you may want to use it but i would like to point out the following reasons for not using oracle

835479
sql-server	oracle
oracle licenses are the most expensive in the business sql express might be better as sql-server is cheaper

835479
postgresql	mysql
hosting providers will provide sqlserver mysql and postgresql sql but i can t even think of one that has oracle hosting

835502
sendmessage	message
you could use the win32 sendmessage function to forwarding the contents of your message m to parent.handle

835509
account	api
so i would like to code my own association via php and rest but can t find the call in the api docs - can someone send me a link or example code on how to create an external bucket in account x

835554
exception-handling	try-catch
we put a try-catch block round our code and just catch and log exception-handling

835561
versioning	staging
as of versioning 1.7.7 you can use git stash --include-untracked or git stash save -u to stash untracked files without staging them

835606
buffering	streaming
the exact details including buffering streaming etc will entirely depend on the provider

835623
stream	send
i have had servers which will send you a stream of empty bytes as long as you request them

835626
filtering	sorting
this query will use the index on actif to avoid sorting and the index on profil_perso to find and filtering out the non-visible parrain s

835652
any	set
in addition it is usually preferable to have defined indecies for any field you filtering order on - so again make sure these are set appropriately

835658
redmine	trac
on top of version-control which has been mentioned a few times already you should also look into a project management tool such as redmine or trac

835670
msbuild	nant
use a msbuild or nant scripting for different builds

835676
ruby	php
in the future i will be working with mvc with java j2ee hibernate and more but for now i have asp.net php python ruby etc

835711
selected	listbox
so thinking about this you want the behaviour of a listbox but the look of an itemscontrol so why don t you style the listboxitems to not show the difference between selected and non-selected

835714
pessimistic-locking	optimistic-locking
to counter this as a rule of thumb i use pessimistic-locking when the chances of a collision are high or transactional are short lived and optimistic-locking when the chances of a collision are low or transactional are long lived or your business rules encompass multiple transactional

835722
msbuild	nant
for larger projects you will need something like nant or msbuild and cruisecontrol or teambuild

835727
any	set
you can change the type of the set tbyteset to nearly any set type and this function should still work

835727
for-loop	loops
to get the lowest value change the i for-loops to 0 to sizeof tbyteset - 1 and the if test in the j loops to if b shl j and 80 0

835729
put	get
the weird thing is that i ve been able to get the exact above code to display the texture in a program of its own yet when i put it into my main program it fails

835734
integer	digits
it deliberately doesn t limit the number of digits that it matches because if the string is an integer which overflows int32 i think i d rather see an exception-handling than just a large integer

835740
stateless	stateful
for instances in seam the framework relies heavily on your knowledge of scope and stateless and stateful session beans where in symfony there is no such concept sort of

835751
.when	ready
first create all your labels change their properties and .when they are all ready add them to the panels

835755
mootools	extjs
when looking at extjs javascript i don t get the feeling that it s meant for the same things as jquery and mootools

835755
mootools	extjs
whilst jquery and mootools help with the general workings of a site extjs javascript seems to be focussed on tables and storing data plus manipulating it

835755
mootools	extjs
so is this observation correct or is extjs javascript fit for the same work as jquery and mootools

835769
ubuntu-server	linux
i just installed oracle on my amazon s virtual ec2 linux ubuntu-server

835794
javascript	dom
ext js is a full-fledged widget library while jquery not jquery ui and mootools are javascript frameworks that help with dom manipulation etc

835803
output	mode
i ve noticed that i can interact with the build tab dialog and when i change the configuration dropdown list box to active debugging or just debugging then the output path changes to bin debugging as one would expect but i cannot seem to get it to compile in release mode

835808
getter	setter
if you have some nice instance-variables in your class such as an uiscrollview scrollview2 for example then why should you bypass the getter and setter by relinquishing a

835809
entity-framework	ado.net
note if you are using the ado.net entity-framework ef l2e in .net 3.5 be aware that it will not do the same translation as linq-to-sql

835817
background-image	background-color
since the content part of the box is inside the left border div and the border background-image is done sprite style with multiple images put together in a larger image the only css only solution to this is to apply a background-color to the content area to cover the left background-image like the left background div is doing to the right background div

835852
delphi	c++
i read that delphi is so fast that it implements isense by recompiling the project on each token and thats the reason c++ builder didn t have isense as its compiling very slow

835860
put	get
you put the neat stuff like a bubble dialogue box saying what it is and how to get directions to there

835861
implements	abstract
you d also need an interface or abstract base-class that all id d types implements

835865
shell	bash
running under windows cygwin - specifically in the git bash shell

835878
keydown	keyup
the previewkeyup previewkeydown keyup and keydown events all fire on the textbox but alas no text show up in the textbox

835898
integer	digits
read the integer starting just beyond the end of the course name ie the last digits we find scanning backwards

835913
methods	extend
you re both close but checking for each doesn t extend well to overriding many methods

835914
qtreeview	qaction
or even better yet adapting the qaction triggers signals and attaching it to the qtreeview hidecolumn slot which takes the column index as an arguments

835918
getter	setter
if you bypass the getter or setter objects watching the value won t get the message

835921
order	add
if you are extending uicomponent and you add a label component to your custom component it seems you have to use setactualsize in order for your label to appear

835954
value	field
i want to check if the value of a field is null and if it is not null then format the data to make sure it has one decimal place and add a sign etc

835960
ubuntu	linux
i need to get it working on linux rhel and ubuntu

835996
postback	ajax
you could also implement a keep-alive for long forms by renewing the lease on any postback of the page or even with an ajax timer

836003
firefox	safari
it works in firefox safari but it does not work in ie for some reason

836006
children	nodes
take an extreme case - say you have a dual core machine and you have a tree where each parent nodes has 4 children

836025
design-time	designer
so i need to generate the same typed dataset at runtime which is generally created while design-time using typed dataset designer of the visual-studio

836026
malloc	free
obviously memory that malloc allocates with mmap is free with munmap

836051
fclose	fopen
i m thinking specifically about calling fopen and fclose in different dlls but i d also like to know that it s safe for other resources memory pointers handles etc...

836065
worksheet	excel
i want to write the following function which should be used in an excel worksheet

836069
stderr	stdout
you can then watch for both stdout and stderr with channel.recv_ready and channel.recv_stderr_ready or use select.select

836071
display	width
the error label display till the width of the table

836078
reflection	runtime
if on the other hand you just want to be able to get structured data aka a datatable from a database at runtime you could use reflection to create a tableadapter from an arbitrary data result

836101
triggers	insert
on this table i have a triggers that runs after update or insert

836101
triggers	insert
the user is able to insert and update the table on which the triggers is attached but not on other tables that the triggers targets

836103
callback	methods
an approach that can be contained within the web application is to add some dummy object to the cache that has a specified expiry period does not allow arbitary deletion by the cache s own algorithms and has a callback methods setup when the item is dropped

836104
exception-handling	try-catch
however small sub-routines such as email notifications will be wrapped in a try-catch to prevent an exception-handling occurring from breaking the entire application flow

836106
selected	textbox
i have a form with a list box and a few textbox when the user selected an item from the list box i need the approptiate information to show up in the txt boxes and allow the user to edit it

836114
linux	unix
kscope is a very nice gui tool on unix to analysis of sorce code i am using it for a while on my linux box

836137
google-chrome	firefox
in the meanwhile i still stick with firefox over google-chrome for the simple reason that firefox is i non-profit and has a ii huge addon community

836142
directory	folder
i would like to also create a folder in the layouts directory of the 12 hive and place a couple files in there

836144
selected	textbox
you re not actually binding the newly selected value to the textbox

836159
background-image	width
i tried a background-image but if it gave me problems if i gave it one with a large width

836160
repr	eval
so it worked only when i used repr and eval together

836164
derived-class	base-class
when a destructor for a derived-class runs after it completes its normal body it recasts the memory as the base type basically writing the base-class vtable pointers into the object and then calls the base-class destructor

836169
push	pull
instead i need to keep one item at a time from each stream in memory and at each step compare the current item from each stream push the minimum onto the final stream and pull the next item from the appropriate source stream

836169
order	add
the closest i ve come is to use system.stringcompaison.ordinal with the results of the database strings converted to varbinary with the standard varbinary order which works but i d rather just add an order by name collate x clause to my sql queries where x is some collation that works exactly like the varbinary order rather than converting all strings to varbinary as they leave the database and then back to strings as they come in memory

836176
lookup	any
but it is a known fact that it makes a lot of sense to index all the columns that are part of any foreign-key-relationship because through a fk-relationship you ll often need to lookup a relating table and extract certain rows based on a single value or a range of value

836184
background-image	background-color
try attaching a background-image to class c of a repeating underline then add a background-color to the h3 to match the background of the container

836189
malloc	free
ms-dos heap managers often allowed using free memory until the next call to malloc

836189
malloc	free
new and delete in that era called malloc and free

836190
account	api
in mac os x there is an easy way to get the me card the owner of the mac account from the built-in address book api

836212
binary-tree	nodes
i am trying to write a remove nodes croot object o function for a sorted binary-tree

836216
png	gif
the only solution i ve imagined so far is to make a png or gif image with 1px height and a very large width depends on your project could be like 1x2000px and do something like this

836220
attributes	properties
if you go to the directory in your solution and view the properties of that directory you will see the attributes namespace provider true

836251
getter	setter
a common jquery convention is to have .foo or .foo selector act as a getter and .foo value or .foo selector value act as a setter

836254
vba	vb6
i ve verified in vb6 that the code will in fact save some text to a file so if outlook actually runs the vba script it should be able to do the same

836258
contains	elements
each index contains either the title or the notype elements when it should be both.

836259
children	nodes
basically what you are doing is bubbling nodess up the tree each time the maximum of the children nodes in each nodes so that in the end you stay with a sorted tree and only one nodes missing at the end of the full path you went

836278
implements	super
super simple to implements

836278
updating	updates
i m not directly updating the table from the class rather i m calling a stored procedure to do the updates

836282
static-code-analysis	pmd
take a look at all of the rules that static-code-analysis tools like pmd and findbugs use

836284
attributes	properties
resharper users you have the option to view the properties of your dbml s subdirectory and set the namespace attributes there

836287
background-color	height
use a small 1px height couple px wide image as your underline and occlude it with a background-color on your h3

836342
toolchain	gnu
i use the gnu toolchain eclipse cdt if that matters

836357
.when	ready
the user-interface tests i run .when i m getting ready to submit a change or .when i write more user-interface tests obviously

836366
multicast	packets
as far as i understand with multicast you d always know which interface the packets are received on since you always bind to a specific interface when joining a multicast grouping especially with ip4 where you bind to the interface via one of it s ip addresses

836412
continuous-integration	build-server
you can even go as far as a continuous-integration build-server as several others have mentioned

836424
base-class	inherited
if there s some general functionality that can be factored out you can make this a base-class and inherited from it but in the end windows with different functionalities should be different classes

836425
webforms	asp.net
i m in the process of converting parts of an application to use asp.net mvc from webforms

836439
session-cookies	cookies
none of the standard oracle sso plugins have an anonymous access option so we wrote a custom java sso plugin to check for portal sso session-cookiess and do the base oracle ssoserverauth and otherwise if they don t have an sso cookies anonymous access - return the oracle public user

836443
textbox	button
it consists of a button and two multiline textbox

836465
dictionary	map
another approach could be to have an application variable that contained a map or dictionary of locked items

836465
dictionary	map
so when one user hits edit add an entry to the appvariable map or dictionary with the key set to the primary id of the field being edited

836465
value	field
or as a slightly greater user-interface allow the users to edit while waiting for the lock to release the map item to be removed then when it is removed compare the field they have been working on with the updated database value and allow them to overwrite merge their changes

836465
dictionary	map
the only real downside is 1 you would need to create one application level dictionary or map for each table that you want to lock unlock

836473
haskell	scheme
i m tired of seeing functional-programming advocates show how quicksort can be implemented in one line in haskell ocaml f# scheme etc

836473
quicksort	in-place
the quicksort that they show is not really quicksort because it is not swapping elements in-place and is doing all sorts of list construction and garbage-collection

836485
solaris	unix
also a basic understanding of unix is not hard to achieve i have found my way around solaris ubuntu and os x coming from a windows background - a few simple tutorials should get you up and running

836485
g++	gcc
for writing small school projects there is not much you need to know cd ls mkdir make gcc be sure to use g++ for c++ projects - that has bitten me on my mac before...

836490
scons	cmake
as for a linux ide - at some point plan to jump in and use linux tools - you ll need a different build system unless you use a cross platform solution like cmake or scons there will be different ides if you use ides etc

836494
value	field
the topmost will have a value of zero in its parent field

836497
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu especially isn t really that hard to use but the lack of a real ide for development usually throws folks off

836510
void	main
as for the return code you can change the signature of your main function to return an int rather than void

836518
32-bit	64bit
btw it is a 32-bit control so you won t be able to use it for an 64bit application

836543
contains	elements
now contains the topmost elements

836559
spaces	output
if a newline occurring in an attributes value in the tree were output as a newline character rather than as character reference then the attributes value in the tree created by reparsing the xml would contains a spaces not a newline which would mean that the tree had not been output correctly

836575
internet-explorer	firefox
and save as type web page complete in firefox doing it in internet-explorer may be slightly different to a local folder

836586
stderr	stdout
error messages should be written to stderr aka console.error and normal output to stdout aka console.out

836591
attributes	properties
you can override all the properties and put a browsable attributes on them

836595
msbuild	nant
i would suggest looking into msbuild or nant

836619
global-variables	call
using function parameters rather than global-variables to call the function and get results reduces the complexity of the function

836624
dictionary	arrays
the nsnull class defines a singleton object you use to represent null values in situations where nil is prohibited as a value typically in a collection object such as an arrays or a dictionary

836636
nsmutablearray	nsarray
you cannot add a nil value to an nsarray or nsmutablearray

836641
pthreads	fork
first install cygwin this provides unix like environment for windows with pthreads api that mingw doesn t provide for example fork

836641
linux	unix
second i d suggest to get used to linux install it knowing linux unix environment would make your life in university and not only there much easier

836689
credentials	account
if you create an ldapconnection to the directory you can use the service account to bind with and then make a subsequent bind to authenticate the credentials

836699
constructor	object
should i pass my db object to my constructor when instancing my object

836710
benchmarking	profiling
it s pretty much the same process as any other optimization profiling experiment benchmarking repeat

836722
favicon	web
similar use cases might be the deployment of a favicon or a robots.txt however this can be done in the production environment through a tomcat server with a default root web application

836730
margins	padding
there are padding and margins properties but their descriptions say they affect the list control itself not the items

836730
margins	padding
if i add padding that affects the inside of the button not the spaces between them and the button control doesn t have margins properties

836736
gzip	zip
i now realize that a .zip file is not the same as a .gz file and that gzip is not the same as zip

836743
benchmarking	profiling
benchmarking optimization software with performance profiling

836752
stress-testing	jmeter
jmeter is an excellent tool for stress-testing web-applications

836756
compact-framework	.net
dotnetzip works on pcs with the full .net and also runs on mobile devices that use the .net compact-framework

836756
compression	streaming
these streaming support compression levels and deliver much better performance than the built-in classes

836761
zipfile	archive
you ll need a bit more information about the zipfile archive format as microsoft only provides the compression algorithm

836773
dsa	rsa
imagine some one breaking in to the database and stealing those private keys gifs or rsa dsa keys

836790
kerberos	ldap
they could for instance be authentication against kerberos ldap nis or any other number of sources

836805
xstream	gson
i attempted to use the gson library but it cannot deserialize concrete objects when i only have it expect generic super classes xstream and jettison handles this because type information is baked into the serialization

836805
jackson	xstream
i looked at the jackson java json processor but when you were reading in objects from a stream you had to specify what type of object it was unlike xstream where it will read in any object because the serialization xstream json contains class name information

836814
photoshop	layer
looking for a way to add a background layer to existing photoshop files with c# code

836824
configuration	environment
typically i define my database connections in a configuration file which can easily be changed between environment development stage production

836845
webforms	asp.net
br it explains how the path style is important to visual studio asp.net webforms and asp.net mvc

836846
sql-server	oracle
you might want to checkout the hierarchyid datatype in sql-server 2008 or its equivalent in oracle

836847
postgresql	firebird
dblinq supports many other databases mysql postgresql firebird

836856
addition	division
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division

836856
multiplication	addition
so with all of that in mind you should be able to simplify the most inner loop using primarily addition and multiplication of integers

836875
versioning	upgrade
in versioning 1.35 boost foo was upgrade and new member was added so boost foo from 1.33 and 1.35 are

836875
linux	unix
note i m talking about unix linux os with elf where dynamic linking is similar to static linking so you can t link with two different versions of libraries because symbols would interfere

836880
value	field
calls to getobject can fail with partial returned value so that an object with field foo bar val created with value 1 2 3 could conceivably return 1 0 3 0 0 3 etc

836898
margins	padding
you probably just have to adjust your margins and padding to make the borders show the way you want to

836898
margins	padding
my tip is to remove all padding and margins and add

836898
margins	padding
then adjust all padding and margins widths and heights to make it look like you feel

836911
standard-library	boost
boost almost fits into the standard-library category but its abi changes so much that that your interface shouldn t use it

836934
value	field
i m looking for the simplest way of popping a modal search windows on top of an asp.net 3.5 application to look up value for a field

836938
conditional	operators
there are too many nested ifs and conditional operators for me to effectively reduce this with macros

836947
user-interface	look-and-feel
fwiw in the interim you could use the mfc feature pack available with vs2008 sp1 to give your app an office 2007 look-and-feel pretty quser-interfaceckly you can even add a ribbon if it s something your users would like though this would be more involved. i revamped the user-interface for an old mfc app using these new classes in a single day and now to be fair it looks fantastic and my users are very pleased you can support a whole host of looks and colour schemes. ms opted for the bcg toolkit but there are others available if you want to pay a small amount of money codejock for example.

836958
httpd.conf	.htaccess
you can do it by adding a .htaccess on the index or doing the configuration in the httpd.conf

836976
myeclipse	maven
sorry to hear you are fighting myeclipse and maven in the past the most common problem i ve seen causing people pain in this area is when they don t have the web root java source dirs or resource dirs set correctly

836976
m2eclipse	maven
you can execute the maven targets off the right-click run as or debug as menu and even manage custom goal execution using the maven build... shortcut -- this is all similar to m2eclipse

836976
myeclipse	m2e
if you decide you want to use m2e complete you can navigate to windows preferences myeclipse maven4myeclipse and check the enable all m2e features checkbox

836976
myeclipse	maven
out of the box we only hide the bits that can make maven confusing for first-time folks if you enable all the m2 bits you can do whatever you want with maven and myeclipse

836980
conditional	operators
in c# the syntax you are using are the conditional logic operators and thier docemented bahviour can be found on msdn

836980
multiplication	addition
for me it s the same as when you do not use parentheses for when doing multiplication and addition in the same statement because the language document that the multiplication operations will get carried out first

837000
s#arp-architecture	nhibernate
if you d like to have a look at a good real world implementation of asp.net-mvc with an orm have a look at s#arp-architecture which is based on ms asp.net-asp.net-mvc nhibernate and the repository pattern

837009
directory	folder
we have a folder where our app will be potentially reading writing and creating deleting files on and while we can default to a safe location we allow the user to selected a different directory

837009
required	checked
we d like to not required admin elevation at runtime and this path will be used for subsequent launches of the app so it is not enough that we checked whether our process is currently able to write to that location because it could be that the app is launched with admin privileges the first time actually it does when launched by the install because the install runs elevated and if they selected a protected location the next time they try to run the app they won t have access to the directory

837029
rollback	commit
the classic way to manage a sql transaction was by calling the begintransaction commit and rollback methods of the sqlconnection object

837039
any	set
since any folder can have permissions set however the administrator sees fit the only real way to find out is to know what user it will be running as currently logged in user

837061
directory	folder
i m not sure how to solve it but the reason is becaus iis is treating it as a directory which it is and doesn t have any knowledge about how to pass the folder to the asp.net isapi filtering and triggers the .net handler

837070
toolchain	platform
also on the toolchain for this target platform there is an auto-bulk-build tool

837073
visual-studio	release-mode
i have a project that i m building in c++ in release-mode in visual-studio 2008 sp1 on windows 7 and when i build it i keep getting

837093
system-tray	trayicon
in conjunction with the system-tray and trayicon the behavior is nearly as that of outlook

837097
assign	add
why don t you add to a string variables or perhaps even use stringbuilder then assign the value to the .text property when you re done parsing

837099
order	add
you can then add custom field handling pages sort order most things you d want

837111
latex	tex
tex plain or with a macros package like latex or context would be a good solution if

837134
protected	public
a similar question could be asked for widening access parameters - eg overriding a protected internal methods with a public methods something which java supports iirc

837135
positioning	slider
to locate a specific line in the text you would have to move the slider to the closest positioning that it could specify then scroll a line at a time for minutes.

837140
c++	lua
if you want to solve the same problem on the c++ side have your c++ code allocate a private table and put it in the lua registry

837158
default-value	default
in other words i want to tell within the stored procedure if the default-value was used because it was not specified from i explicitly called this procedure passing the value that happens to be the same as default one

837158
value	field
edit passing reserved value does not work for field with small range types such as bit

837158
implements	extends
creating user-defined type that extends null paradigm with additional notavalue value might be an answer but i need some more guidance on how to implements it

837164
parsing	comma
if a user pastes 1 000 000 and then adds a plus symbol making the full equation 1 000 000+intpow 3 2 the parsing fails because it does not work with numbers that contain comma

837165
default-value	arguments
my suggestion is to use a default-value that you would never pass in as an arguments

837194
stream	send
this one send a csv to a stream using a mysql result

837208
authentication	login
i was making tests in all the computers accessing the site however yesterday when i accessed the site from a pc the login page is presented but when i press the button to authentication i stay in the same login page

837209
lookup	any
now it shouldn t take up that much memory to pre-generate each column name for every index and store them in a single huge arrays so you shouldn t need to lookup the name for any column twice

837213
data-structures	tree
... judy can replace many common data-structures such as arrays sparse arrays hash tables b-tree binary tree linear lists skiplists other sort and search algorithms and counting functions.

837214
ubuntu	linux
i agree with others that if you install something like ubuntu linux it s not that hard to learn

837221
getter	setter
course as soon as you want to do something like validation in the setter this doesn t work and you have to go back to writing setter and getter and declaring a backing variables

837224
web-services	api
there are a lot of out-of-the-box web-services that come with sharepoint that allow integration with other systems and some people might call programming against that api sharepoint development

837237
for-loop	loops
i have a basic question in the django template language how can you tell if you are at the last loops iteration for a for-loops

837256
python	ruby
does a easy to use ruby to python bridge exist

837265
bitwise-xor	xor
bitwise-xor is not always the same thing as logical xor

837266
startup	launch
if you do have a heuristic-based detection program just try some obvious virus behavior like modifying settings that control which programs launch at startup checking processes for common antivirus program names etc

837277
filtering	sorting
you probably want to improve filtering or sorting capabilities of your application

837283
firefox	safari
a quick test on firefox 3 and safari 3.2 shows that an input field that is missing the name attribute but has an id attribute is not submitted

837285
64bit	x86
visual-studio is x86 until at least the 2010 release comes around update this is still an issue in vs2010 there is no native 64bit cassini support

32-bit	64bit
in iis the application-pool runs as 64bit uses the oracle drivers as intended however since webdev.webserver.exe is 32-bit you ll get a badimageformatexception because it s trying to load 64bit driver dlls in a 32-bit environment

837285
32-bit	64bit
the first solution was to load oracle x86 in 32-bit more x64 in 64bit mode we did this by replacing the assembly reference when running under 64bit via the web.config like this

837285
32-bit	64bit
in addition to the configuration we loaded the 32-bit and 64bit versions of oracle.dataaccess into the gac

837285
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit versions are 10.xxx for oracle 10g the 64bit versions are 2.1xxx so just swapping the binding using works

837296
python	ruby
i don t think there s any way to invoke python from ruby without forking a process via system or something

837308
methods	extend
the second one allows you to extend the number of preferred suppliers over time and you can still internally implement these as two seperate methods

837325
python	ruby
you could try masaki fukushima s library for embedding python in ruby although it doesn t appear to be maintained

837325
python	ruby
with this library ruby scripts can directly call arbitrary python modules

837325
python	ruby
compile ruby to python bytecode

837325
python	ruby
requires ruby 1.9 and python 2.5

837326
uiscrollview	subviews
uiscrollview does not have a notion of a â œcurrent zoom levelâ because each subviews it contains may have its own current zoom level

837333
abstract-class	subclassing
i would define an abstract-class called moviedatabase with an abstract methods called getrating and then provide subclassing that implement the getrating methods for various providers like imdb metacritic

837337
implements	extends
write it yourself extends implements

837358
order	add
in order to do this i need to create a new sql login for the tenant and then add it to a predefined sql role

837387
silverlight	wpf
either i m missing something or the patterns practices composite application guidance for wpf and silverlight doesn t come with any templates or guidance packages to generate code

837396
exception-handling	try-catch
note that you generally want to stay away from copious amounts of extra try-catch finally blocks as exception-handling handler including try..finally are expensive depending on the language implementation

837414
silverlight	wpf
composite application guidance for wpf and silverlight - february 2009

837423
selected	listbox
in the winforms application i can add segments by selected the segment i want from a listbox which is populated from the arrays of possible segments

837423
display	height
is there anyway of using the rectangle information .x .y .width height to display only the section of the image in a picturebox or to blit the section to a bitmap and display that

837429
data-access	nhibernate
a quick way to check if this project is clean of data-access is to check if you require references to data-access dlls like nhibernate in this project or not

837441
python	php
the only downside is there are tons of source for php and python scripts etc publicly available source for yuma is practically non-existent because it is so new

837446
expression	evaluation
by contrast an operator would always force evaluation of both arms of the expression so there s no efficiency gain

837458
contains	elements
one was to make the contains elements a focus scope

837458
contains	elements
1 make the contains elements a focus scope

837460
exception-handling	try-catch
to prevent an exception-handling in a handler from propagating to the event generator the answer is to manually invoke each item in the multicast delegate the event handler inside of a try-catch

837469
prolog	lisp
this may be an impossible task but i m trying to stay away from lisp or prolog and i m looking for examples that would be directly applicable to game development

837485
canvas	scale
the above xaml will scale everything inside the canvas in this case just the listbox

837486
uiscrollview	subviews
uiscrollview does not have a notion of a â œcurrent zoom levelâ because each subviews it contains may have its own current zoom level

837490
cgpoint	cgrect
why not just an id based on the tag and the coordinates cgpoint or cgrect

837502
32-bit	64bit
vmware does not allow you to run a 64bit guest on a 32-bit host

837505
look-and-feel	substance
using the new version of the substance look-and-feel for java the connecting lines in a typical jtree are not drawn parent - child lines

837518
python	perl
should i avoid sending perform in a loop similar to the admonishment given to perl python programmers to avoid calling eval ... compiler evaluate in smalltalk in a loop

837532
http	ssl
as chochos has suggested what s wrong with simply using the existing ssl infrastructure in java and your server to set up a secure http connection and then simply pass the user password from client to the server

837540
spaces	output
also you might need to change the output declaration to accommodate string which has same length as the arg + number of spaces it might need

837542
value	field
the number of different value in a given field may exceed the number which can be summarised in a pivot table 1 048 576 in excel 2007

837545
datagridview	richtextbox
if i do not create an edit- copy menu item and assign it the shortcut keys ctrl+c then i can select a control richtextbox datagridview etc.. and hit ctrl+c and the control itself will handle the copy

837566
xapian	sphinx
you will either need to do this manually in php manually search for the keywords in the returned database row and display a relevant snippet or use a search-engine that can do this for you such as xapian sphinx or apache lucene

837572
itemtemplate	textblock
within your treeview itemtemplate just bind the textblock in such a way that it is collapsed whenever the iseditable property is true and bind the textbox in such a way that it is collapesed when iseditable property is false and vice versa

837572
itemtemplate	treeview
override your itemtemplate for your treeview

837577
jquery	dojo
does one of the mainstream javascript libraries yui jquery dojo provide a way to serialize a javascript object to xml as text

837582
carbon	cocoa
also should i do it in cocoa carbon java or objective-c

837602
textarea	textbox
discovered in the comments on the tredosoft site that installing ie8 breaks textbox textarea in the multiple ie browser

837609
pipe	tail
alternatively this post pipe together ls and tail to delete the oldest file in a directory

837616
where-clause	sql
it works on sql 2000 and 2005 change sysobjects to sys.objects for 2005. uncomment the where-clause if you want to restrict it to just this databse and just the exclusive locks

837639
code-coverage	lcov
i recently started using lcov to visualize my code-coverage

837646
dialog	pop-up
a very simple approach would be to add javascript to your page to pop-up a new browser windows dialog something like this

837649
arrays	loops
2 - my implementation is to fetch all the rows in one sql query then use a recursive function to build a multi-dimensional arrays then i loops through it using multi level foreach to build a menu or whatever

837673
selected	cells
to selected multiple cells range cells 1 1 cells 4 6 nb would need some kind of object qualifier if not using the active worksheet rather than range a1 f4

837682
treeview	listview
i m the author of a visual-studio addin that needs to paint controls within visual-studio and in order to make the fonts look the same as the standard controls in visual-studio listview treeview etc. i have to bypass winforms and paint the text using the win32 api

837687
output	mode
if you want output progress indicators run the shell in verbose mode

837694
background-image	height
i know you can do element.height to get an element s height without px append parseint also works so i was wondering if there was a similiar methods for jquery to get the actual background-image minus the url meta data

837695
text-rendering	gdi
the latter uses gdi which is more modern in terms of text-rendering

837717
oracle	mysql
whether you use mysql access sql server oracle or whatever a dataset is a dataset and therefore okay to return from a root level data layer

837748
http	ssl
do i just need an ssl certificate installed into our webserver and simply access the wcf service via http and possibly be able to just use basichttpbinding

837749
sql-server	oracle
for nothing because nobody will change sql-server or oracle just for changing

837761
versioning	upgrade
this has a great sections on side by side versioning and leveraging msis for upgrade

837762
firefox	safari
they work fine in ie8 firefox safari etc but not ie7 and ie6

837764
required	checked
the way i see it each developer would have a copy of the repository on his or her local pc would each person be required to have iis install on their pc as well to test their copies before checked out

837772
c++	lua
i m working with c++ and lua using lunar to glue them together

837772
c++	lua
i m trying to do something that i think should be pretty simple i have an c++ object in lua bots in the code below and i call a methods on it that finditems which causes c++ to search the area around the robots and return a list of objects it finds testitems and others not shown here

837772
c++	lua
my question is simply how do i assemble and return the list of found items in c++ and then iterate over them in lua

837775
business-objects	data-access
if you are going to use datasets at all keep the datasets buried right down in the data-access layer and expose a conceptual set of business-objects to the presentation layer

837789
getter	setter
i d like the model to write and fetch the resource from the filesystems so i naturally want to override the getter and setter to do this

837812
private	self
in a top-level function still a methods really you re in a slightly strange place a global main spaces see the prompt when you run irb or try looking at self inside such a function but also these functions are defined as private methodss inside the object class

837829
windows-xp	windows
note that i originally wrote this for windows-xp and now with windows 8 and the on-screen keyboard it is really slow and seems to crash the taskbar however it does work

837831
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the way i see it asp.net-mvc can be achieved in webforms by not including the runat in the form tag

837831
asp.net-mvc	webforms
can someone persuade me on why i should use asp.net-mvc and not webforms

837843
ref	out
i must be going out of my mind because my unit tests are failing because the following code is throwing a null ref exception-handling

837848
contains	any
this works without adding any extra divs though admittedly there is an extra span .errormsg to contains the error-message

837854
asp.net-mvc	webforms
don t plump for the asp.net-mvc framework just because it s the new kid on the block and everyone s singing its praises especially not if you re comfortable with doing things using webforms

837855
windows-nt	win64
one source of complexity is that the win32 and now win64 api is a subsystem that lays on top of the windows-nt native system

837859
children	nodes
i want to have a tree in memory where each nodes can have multiple children

837865
order	add
in order to achieve this functionality i also add

837866
hash	md5
i m not saying ignore the issue and like i said this doesn t really have much bearing on whether or not you should use md5 sha1 or whatever to hash your passwords but i do get tickled slightly pink every time i read someone getting a bit too upset about plain text passwords in a database

837871
data-structures	tree
it uses references to build a tree data-structures arrays by means of a flat one arrays

837879
binary-tree	tree
if you have a defined number of children for each tree for instance a binary-tree then it s not too difficult although you potentially waste a lot of space

837879
children	nodes
if it has a variables number of children you d probably have to come up with some convoluted manner of storing the index of a nodes s first child

837882
user-input	output
the page life cycle of the web form is too complex and has the tightly coupling between all things in the asp.net framework and a single class is used both to display output and handles user-input

837892
contains	set
that same dll could also do the sendmessage call above to set the horizontal text extent perhaps also it could measure the width of the contains list items

837912
visual-studio	release-mode
if you re in release-mode the line that your ide is pointing to and the line the problem is actually on may be different i know this is the case in c++ when using visual-studio

837913
oracle	mysql
it s used in the same as if you were to say store it in the sql when you don t care whether it s mysql or oracle or sql server

837915
spaces	output
the query output fails and doesn t produce anything if there are spaces in the value of manufacturer

837929
jquery	.post
so what i want to do instead of embedding an tag under the radio button i d like to fire a jquery event and do a regular .post back to the server

837931
mouseover	mouseout
i tried unbinding on mouseout and rebinding on each mouseover

837931
hide	show
i eventually needed to add a tools row to each item and show hide on mouse over out

837936
itemscontrol	grid
since the itemscontrol s height is being constrained by the grid row s height i can t figure out which element i should be binding and to what element s property i should be binding it to

837936
itemscontrol	grid
it would make sense to bind the grid row s height to the desired height of the itemscontrol

837940
integer	digits
also while admittedly sloppy the maximum length of the the arrays voltemp is 9 bytes digits which is well within the limits of a 32-bit integer

837942
python	c++
builds a database of everything in your project...java c++ python ruby javascript anything in a file called tags

837943
children	nodes
anyhow one solution is to store the number of children in each nodes like so

837975
asp.net-mvc	webforms
for people coming from a webforms background this may not seem to be an advantage until you embrace it and design for it instead of trying to write webforms-like applications in asp.net-mvc

837975
webforms	asp.net
fortunately i had explored ruby on rails some before using asp.net mvc and had already started to write my webforms apps in a more restful way

837976
subtract	add
no matter what every ace should be counted to sum value as 11 then when the total sum has reached over 21 subtract 10 from hand but the thing is you must make sure you keep a count of how many times you subtract 10 and how many times you add 11 an ace

837976
subtract	add
add 11 subtract 10 - must always be satisfied

837988
contains	elements
the buildplugins elements contains all the links in the left hand menu

837993
selected	listbox
i found this code which replaces the default selected style with a custom style for the selected listboxitem in a listbox

837993
margins	padding
however there is still a little blue line on the left from the default style which i can t remove with any padding or margins changes

837993
listboxitem	selected
how can i remove that blue line and completely determine the style of the selected listboxitem

838009
binary-search-tree	tree
the oft-cited arrays implementation of a tree is a binary-search-tree because for a node n the parent is n-1 2 the left child is 2n+1 and the right child is 2n+2

838020
selected	listbox
basically if you want to restyle the listbox so that selected items have a different background colour it s easier to simply change the highlightbrush colour so that the selected item uses the colour you want

838023
binary-tree	tree
but a flat arrays can be addressed as a binary-tree by calculating the tree level as a power and then adding the offset

838032
hash	md5
hence i do recommend that you use a stronger hash function than md5 here

838042
amazon-ec2	vps
you may need to look into a vps shared hosting service or you may wish to consider looking into ms azure or amazon-ec2

838043
arrays	loops
thus the while loops iterates over all of the elements in the arrays pointed to by lineptr each element is a and prints them out

838050
compatibility	deprecated
i don t know why there are so many answers that you are using xpath because xpath was deprecated a long time ago and jquery no longer supports it without the xpath compatibility plugins

838054
bazaar	git
source code management software such as bazaar git mercurial or subversion might be useful

838071
g++	gcc
you can have multiple versions of gcc on your box to selected the one you want to use call it with full path instead of g++ use full path usr bin g++ on command line depends where your gcc lives

838086
rewrite	rule
assuming this is in .htaccess and not the apache conf file theres no at the front of the first part of a rewrite rule

838098
selection	highlight
in report view in a clistctrl in mfc how do i detect if there is no current highlight selection

838098
highlight	selected
using getfirstselecteditempositioning doesn t work because if an item was previously selected and then click somewhere else on the list control getfirstselecteditempositioning still reports the last positioning selected instead of null however the said positioning is not highlight anymore

838102
syntax-error	syntax
nice try but according to the oracle 10g documentation the syntax for create index and alter table add constraint are not interchangeable in this regard which is why you got that syntax-error

838107
c-preprocessor	macros
in this sense the evaluation methods is similar to that of c-preprocessor macros

838119
implements	extends
another key issue i want to consider is the flexibility ease to extends the platform either sharepoint or connections to implements customize the functions i mentioned above

838122
value	field
it then puts the value of those properties into the text field it generates

838129
couchdb	mnesia
in couchdb one thing will work better while in mnesia something else would be better

838143
lan	wan
clients from a slow lan or wan link

838157
superclass	subclass
in particular problems are likely to appear with instances of a subclass or superclass

838169
ssas	ssis
i m designing the fact and dimension tables for a data warehouse currently using sql-server ssis and ssas

838188
msbuild	nant
there are many tools out there to assist with this e.g msbuild nant

838193
.when	ready
if that is too slow you could presumably use either a commit hook or a scheduling job every few minutes or something to keep a pre-prepared zip handy somewhere that you can just return - using the create as a different name then rename .when ready trick to minimize the amount of time it is locked unavailable

838202
command-prompt	cmd
this allows you via command-prompt to connect to a remote machine and run cmd directly on the remote machine from your machine

838210
fogbugz	trac
then you also need an issue tracking system like jira fogbugz bugzilla trac which can be used with subversion or something else

838211
required	checked
is it possible to checked if a char has been passed into a methods that required an int

838212
exception-handling	try-catch
in general a try-catch is used to catch exception-handling as illustrated in the following code

838243
put	get
if you take the square root of both sides you get x 2 but now you must put in the plus or minus sign to make sure you aren t missing any possible solutions

838258
emacs	vim
i am looking for an equivalent of the bufdo vim command in emacs

838263
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think part of the problem is that many people don t realise that asp.net-mvc isn t an m invention nor is it a replacement for webforms

838265
perl	php
do you know how i can do that in perl php ruby or python

838298
jprofiler	yourkit
use one of the many good commercial profiling jprofiler yourkit ...

838300
hashmap	trie
a ternary trie may be faster than a hashmap for a smaller number of elements

838301
decrement	increment
increment decrement an iterator takes o log n time

838317
solaris	linux
the target hosts are linux 2.4 and solaris 8 to 10

838317
perl	c++
if possible a solution in perl but am willing to do c c++

838330
instance-variables	accessor
now when inside the implementation if you want to access the instance-variables directly you could just use _label but to go through the property accessor methods which take care of retain releases and a bunch of other book-keeping tasks you would use self.label

838340
32-bit	16-bit
the fact that you use the type char instead of the type int is because you want a number that is 16-bit instead of 32-bit

838341
unix	aix
suggestions for unix aix platform + gcc are also invited

838345
derived-class	base-class
2.in reality each derived-class has about 5 members they all afford the foo methods and are derived from the same base-class

838352
.net	wcf
wcf is not a strict .net implementation and thus has to deal with interop issues

838379
numeric	zero
hold down the alt key and type 0126 zero one two six on the numeric keypad

838413
linked-list	arrays
generally you create an arrays called buckets that contain the key and value with an optional pointer to create a linked-list

838413
linked-list	tree
note some implementations use a binary tree instead of linked-list for collisions

838416
lan	wan
svn is faster because it was meant for wan as opposed to vss which is for lan

838424
hash	md5
collisions in the compression function do not imply that collisions in the hash function exist but we can t find collisions for md5 unless we can find collisions for its compression function

838433
solaris	linux
on linux i don t know about solaris

838441
shell	bash
the downside is that git requires a bash shell and it is not very windows friendly

838463
quadtree	r-tree
you want to use a structure like a quadtree or an r-tree

838470
controller	routes
i fixed it by adding an .aspx at the end of all my routes in the route table controller action id .aspx

838492
httpwebrequest	webclient
.net certainly has proxy handling for things like webclient and httpwebrequest but you ll need to give more information about the situation

838500
webrequest	webclient
you can assign the proxy property of your webrequest or webclient object to a webproxy object that has the required settings applied

838504
post-increment	pre-increment
note as a rule of thumb that when pre- and post-increment are equivalent in their action the pre-increment is preferable for performance reasons

838547
buffering	streaming
assuming the zip format is partial to streaming your problem is that your response is being buffering by default

838584
webserver	upload
i click on browse select a file to upload and when i click upload button it should save it directly to the folder on another webserver located at somewhere else other then the server that is being used to upload

838599
webserver	upload
the file upload control will provide you with the file on your webserver

838608
ftpwebrequest	ftp
however you can upload it to your asp.net application and then upload it to the ftp from there using ftpwebrequest

838616
tostring	equals
it could be done via reflection as some libraries already create the tostring or equals methods

838617
revision	svn
with svnant i m even capable of accessing the latest revision number and build date from svn within my build.xml

838623
passenger	thin
app server mongrel thin passenger for dynamic requests

838626
margins	padding
if you are using ie8 there s a new very powerful developer toolbar built in which include a layout panels that shows effective offset margins border and padding value on all sides of an element

838628
visitor-pattern	visitor
there is no language where adding a visitor attributes suddenly makes all the glue to implements the visitor-pattern

838633
webserver	upload
as i understand your question you want to upload the file to another remote server so it s not another server sitting on the same network as your webserver

838643
enumerator	any
the enumerator is not a string any more than a constant is a string

838648
boolean	int
the main difference with c++ is that c++ allows you to mix int and boolean whereas java doesn t

838648
boolean	int
but i think it s bad practice to use int as boolean anyway

838657
sequences	unique
first create a sequences table of unique integers being a standard sql trick every database should have one imo

838660
return-value	arguments
as to the meaning of its arguments its return-value and its general behavior well you re usually left to figure that out on your own

838660
return-value	arguments
i m sick and tired of having to guess which exception-handling a function may throw which return-value denotes success which arguments i have to pass to make the function do what i need it to do or whether a function class is thread-safe or not

838669
any	set
in any case there is no correct way for a compiler to handle this situation once one variables reaches a certain value that is where the most significant bit is set

838673
deep-copy	object
deepcopy creates deep copies for built in types with various exceptions and that you can add custom copy operations to your user-defined object to get deep-copy support for them as well

838677
selected	checkbox
now i have to validate that at least one checkbox should be selected

838677
message	alert
it s not giving any alert message

838683
32-bit	x86
and define the x86 symbol in your 32-bit builds there isn t anything built in

838714
attributes	properties
what do i have to override or what properties attributes would i have to set to achieve this effect

838727
arrays	loops
in a loops make an arrays of the classes have the classes dtor throw an exception and throw a catch an exception at the end of the loops causing the stack to unwind and call the dtors of the arrays of classes and watch it to see your vm usage go through the roof which i m pretty sure it will

838734
long-integer	integer
one important factors to consider is whether one of the types is a long-integer or not because that will affect integer promotions

838752
arguments	default
it s the error default help message display when the prompt command is used without arguments or erroneous arguments

838811
display	height
update i have to adjust the height of the treeview to display a fixed number of rows

838828
background-color	width
what do i have to do so that the background-color of the listboxitem fill the width of the listbox

838840
value	field
then you can assign the value of your converted olistitem productimage field to the pictureurl field

838845
jquery	.post
i am trying to .post a group of arrays using the jquery .post method but i am having trouble getting the value of the arrays

838854
where-clause	sql
it s important to include the call to asenumerable which means the query is executed on the client-side else i m pretty sure the where-clause won t get converted into sql succesfully

838861
python	java
work on many platforms both unix-based and windows has vary stable interfaces to any laguage environment i worked windows linux delphi java perl python

838877
e-commerce	product
you can use the product listing features in drupal e-commerce or ubercart without having to enable the reste of the features

838887
drupal-themes	themes
aside from the commercial themes makers like rooplethemes or topnotchthemess you have at least two places to browse for drupal-themess

838890
groovy	java
i m researching the development of enterprise applications in java .net and groovy

838890
persistence	hibernate
in this regard when using hibernate for persistence would it better reflect the real world to use the new jpa java persistence api or the hibernate custom api that existed before jpa came around

838922
postgresql	mysql
late answer but there is a new open source software for asynchronous master-master replication of postgresql also works for mysql

838925
getter	setter
if i want to read this xml into a java object i would be creating a java bean called personbean with getter setter for the attributes as

839042
invoices	product
the model should cope with changing product prices sales invoices with several product and so on

839048
temporary	copy
a similar structure might be used per line temporary when editing that line so you don t perform a copy on each key-press

839059
order	join
generally orders contains of the order and details lines of the order so you should do a join with the master table instead

839072
aggregate	grouping
if you selected a non-aggregate column in this case orderid and an aggregate column sum xxx then you ll have to grouping by on the non-aggregate columns.

839083
constructor	private
in the latter the setter is private to the class itself and so can only be called from within entity it s own constructor initializer

839096
contains	set
i have a sqlite database that contains a huge set of log messages

839096
triggers	insert
i have one triggers for each so the model is notified whenever an insert update delete happens

839098
attributes	properties
so you could bind that properties to a locale attributes in your code

839113
getter	setter
the problem is that the property is public - because of the public getter - and it is writeable - because of the private setter

839116
subtract	add
if you need to compare add and or subtract time only values think about the possibility to use a int to store the time value and then to convert it to char when displaying the result

839118
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
suppose i have a ui-ready model for example implements inotifypropertychanged i use the presenter to bind this model to a view presenter knows an interface of the view keeping my code-behind as small as possible handling only bindings model and commands properties or methods or events for controls that don t have icommand and in this case immediately being delegated to the presenter

839145
samba	svn
am having this issue with tortoise svn going to a samba share

839158

839168
.net	wcf
i have a .net wcf service which exposes an object that uses polymorphism

839169
any	set
in order to stop any words wrapping i have to set letter spacing to 1px for example but this then causes the larger words to have a much bigger movie than they need and as the nav is horizontal this pushes the next item too far over to the right

839180
protected	public
the following will return non-zero if there is at least one property with a protected or public setter

839180
protected	public
note the check for getsetmethod returning null no setter and the test for isprivate not public or protected rather than ispublic public only

839198
linux	unix
i wrote a article about dumping the stack in c c++ with windows and unix linux at ddj some years ago

839199
implements	extends
if it seems feasible at all you can implements what you need for your plugins and then hand the result over to the eclipse community to extends

839211
uisearchbar	uitableview
i have a uitableview with a uisearchbar at the top of it

839219
keyboard	mouse
in mac os x you can look in system preferences keyboard mouse modifier keys

839229

look at birt or jasper-reports

839239
xsd	xml
a valid xml document fulfills the requirements of a dtd or xsd or other standards

839244
buffering	streaming
you again forgot to flush the buffering which means that the data streaming is incomplete

839265
configuration	environment
i just use rsync -a to copy everything from the directory holding the production environment to the mirror directory and apply a patch to update a few configuration files

839270
fgets	puts
you shouldn t use fgets and puts for dealing with binary data

839270
fwrite	fread
use fread and fwrite instead

839285
return-value	undefined
if you won t return anything there the callee will perhaps do the wrong thing afterwards because the return-value will be undefined and perhaps gets one of the valid return codes

839310
memory-management	heap-corruption
of memory-management heap-corruption and c++

839310
alloca	malloc
new on stack instead of heap like alloca vs malloc

839324
fgets	puts
the functions fgets and puts aren t intended to be used with binary data like image files

839324
fwrite	fread
if i were you i d research the fread and fwrite functions and use them instead

839349
environment	building
then when building i want to create separate versioning of the file with the patter replaced with the correct value for each environment

839357
textchanged	textbox
i can t use the textchanged event since i am not typing in the textbox

839359
contains	any
a faã ade pattern does not contains any business logic but merely centralizes access to multiple objects

839369
configuration	environment
create one environment and copy it over for each new employee with minimal configuration needed

839381
autotools	gnu
this is the approach taken by the gnu build system autotools etc. or by maven

839381
environment	building
this is even more elegant because you can theoretically generate infrastructure for any supported building environment thus you are not bound to one specific ide and settings in the helper infrastructure paths etc. don t need to duplicates the main project settings

839387
debian	linux
if you re using a linux flavor you ve probably got a package management system thinks .rpm for fedora redhat or .deb for ubuntu debian

839387
ubuntu	debian
you could roll your own packages for company specific software create a repository perhaps only available on the local network and then your setup could be reduced to a single bash script which would add the company repo to etc apt sources.list debian ubuntu and then call a command like

839428
postback	ajax
you can add to that event to have it trigger an ajax call or a postback depending on your application to get the result of the calculation

839428
postback	ajax
alternatively you can use the onchange client-side event to trigger a postback or ajax call

839441
contains	any
a facade is a thin wrapper that shouldn t contains any logic except the logic used to translate between the two systems

839465
show	next
what i am after is a datagrid that show a scrollbar for the whole amount of data but only loads the data for the first say 50 rows then after you scroll it loads the next 50 or so

839469
configuration	installation
automated installation tools for automating installation and configuration of a workstation s various services tools and config files

839469
virtualization	vmware
virtualization is another option for example making copies of a xen virtualpc or vmware image to create new hosts

839502
virtual-memory	paging
it s important in performance-critical contexts to not be paging out to virtual-memory if it can be avoided

839509
worksheet	excel
edit with this approach you can read in the existing excel sheet copy the relevant cells between worksheet including the formatting

839521
passthru	exec
you can capture the output of a system command by using the exec function or passthru function

839540
json	xml
generally today the data is represented in either xml or json which have been battle tested and can easily support the large complex models you are referring to

839544
addition	modulo
the answer is that for modulo addition of 1-bit value 0+0 1+1 0 and 0+1 1+0 1

839545
webforms	asp.net
this will be developed in asp.net webforms c# .net 3.5

839545
updating	updates
price updates will be arriving at the server continuously and i d like to push any updates to the clients browsers - ideally only updating what has changed

839553
environment	building
well for a start it would be useful to have a repeatable building from a known environment

839554
versioning	migrate
you can migrate from any versioning of oracle forms 2.3 3.0 4.0 4.5 5.0 6i or 9i to 10g

839556
difference	count
one approach if you have notepad++ open all of the files no problem opening 100 files search for and search - find - find in all open documents note the difference in count should be 1

839556
difference	count
randomly close 10 files and see if the difference in count is still 1 if so continue else the problem is in one of those files

839565
configuration	environment
in c how to configure the initial settings for some program using key-value pairs with any or all of a plain text configuration file environment variables and options on the command line

839571
continuous-integration	build-process
now you don t need unit tests fro continuous-integration but they are sure a major improvement of your build-process and you should definitely consider to read up and make use of them

839578
nsmutablearray	nsarray
i want to avoid an nsmutablearray since some people told me that s a very big overhead and performance-brake compared to nsarray

839595
configuration	environment
if the command line arguments might affect the interpretation of configuration files or environment variables but you still want the command line to overrule the other mechanisms a good idea you may need three passes

839595
any	set
parsing the command-line and set any variables which affect further settings say which configuration file to read

839595
configuration	environment
handle configuration files and environment variables what order

839595
configuration	environment
you can simplify you configuration file problem by making them shell scripts that set environment variables but this locks you into a unix model

839595
environment	building
using a standard format and a library puts requirements on your user s building environment but should save on bugs and confusion

839595
configuration	environment
if your configuration environment is complicated it is very helpful to encapsulate the configuration state in a structure which can be passed around as needed

839597
environment	building
the key advantage of having a dedicated build machine putting codeigniter unit tests and even automated building aside is to ensure you have a clean predictable reproducodeigniterble build environment

839597
environment	building
as you develop a building environment it can be extended to provide more support to the development team - especially once the team starts to grow

839604
inherited	subclass
the definition of subclass is that it extends another class and inherited the state and behaviors from that class

839615
nsmutablearray	nsarray
you ll need to use an nsmutablearray for that because adding is mutation and nsarray is immutable

839615
nsmutablearray	nsarray
you could make a populated nsmutablearray into an nsarray afterwards see here for a discussion but you won t be adding items to a regular old nsarray anytime soon

839617
button	slide
is it possible to move the slide from left to right.when the user click the button

839620
json	xml
you may want to consider json as the data protocol as the jquery library is far more accessible to developers and the time to productivity with the framework is far less than with xslt embedded javascript in tags awful syntax and all the other minutia that come with xml xpath xslt on the front end

839621
braces	macros
of course it won t catch unmatched braces in macros so if you use much in the way of macros you may have to resort to running the preprocessor over your source file and examining the result by hand and ide

839634
superclass	subclass
in oop theory class cannot be its subclass or superclass

839641
contains	elements
an inline elements cannot contains a block elements

839645
handler	service
on the server side if you don t want to add try catch blocks in every service implementation methods then you are going to have to replace the standard error handler that system.servicemodel.web provides

839658
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc gives you a lot more control over your markup than plain-old webforms so it should be ideal for this

839661
google-chrome	firefox
tested this in google-chrome 1.0 firefox 3.0.10 and ie7

839664
nsmutablearray	nsarray
nsarray arr nsmutablearray alloc init

839664
nsmutablearray	nsarray
but why can i tell the compiler hey my variables is just an nsarray you just need to reserve spaces so that this fits in there and then in reality there comes a big fat nsmutablearray into that place that has way more methods way more instance variablesiables and just needs way more spaces

839664
nsmutablearray	nsarray
i would understand the other way big fat nsmutablearray on left side and tiny nsarray und the right

839664
superclass	subclass
for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclass

839665
arrays	loops
to configure your program using command line arguments declare your main function like int main int argc const char const argv and use a loops to go over the arguments in the argv arrays

839665
configuration	environment
which settings source should override each other depends on the application but in my opinion generally commandline argument environment variables configuration file makes most sense

839665
configuration	environment
here is an example of getting configuration from environment and commandline with commandline overriding environment

839668
put	get
and to get the start address it will work thought the whole virtual memory space to find a hole which could put the chuck of mem to be allocated

839672
jquery	.post
iweasel mentioned ajax and i want point you to dave ward s .post on jquery ajax and pagemethods in asp.net

839680
cryptography	key-pair
if the problem you re trying to solve is just sending some encrypted data to a known server then you can always generate an rsa key-pair stick the public key in a file in the jar and use the boring old cryptography api to send and interpret your data

839690
contains	elements
no anchor elements cannot contains h1 elements

839692
base-class	subclass
in more strongly typed languages it s perfectly normal to store a pointers to a subclass object in a variables that has been declared as a pointers to the base-class

839700
contains	any
unfortunately the c++ standard does not specify that thrown exception-handling contains any error message so you are in implementation specific territory here

839703
any	set
long answer you can call ios exception-handling ios_base iostate to request that ios_base ios_failure exception-handling be thrown when a corresponding bit badbit failbit eofbit is set but this at least on gnu and microsoft c++ libraries doesn t get you any more information than manually checking the bits and ends up being largely pointless imho

839712
profiling	trace
try running the run a trace in the profiling pick the blank templates select the deadlock graph event and on the new tab that appears events extraction settings save each check save deadlock xml events separately in its own file

839731
specifications	w3c
there is nothing in any w3c specifications that says object references should be established in the global scripting scope for elements with id attributes

839731
quirks-mode	firefox
firefox establishes the references when running in quirks-mode for the purposes of ie compatibility

839734
selection	highlight
highlight of selection pattern matches in the file

839738
scriptaculous	jquery
most commonly this can be accomplished using any popular javascript library such as jquery or prototype scriptaculous

839741
subclassing	superclass
one of the benefits of object oriented programming is that subclassing can be used in place of their superclass

839758
myeclipse	maven
think the issue is that the project has already been created outside of myeclipse and worked thru maven using the command line

839758
m2eclipse	maven
why not import your existing project using file import and turn on all the m2eclipse features and continue to develop it as you did before using maven commandline tools

839758
myeclipse	maven
but for new work we use the myeclipse web projects then just enable maven support on them

839758
myeclipse	maven
the benefit is that you get all the maven support and it s super easy to use and manage but no more commandline although that still works too and all the myeclipse tools work perfectly on them as well

839766
pixels	line
i m pretty sure and return the top left corner of the windows but you should still see a red line 5 pixels wide at the top of the windows

839770
qpainter	qwidget
also it s unnecessary to call qpainter begin and qpainter end when you construct it using a qwidget parameter

839770
pixels	line
this should draw a red horizontal line 100 pixels long starting from the middle-left of the widget

839774
superclass	subclass
in your example the size of the subclass doesnâ t matter because you are allocating memory for the big fat subclass on the heap then you store the pointers to it in a pointers to a superclass

839776
webforms	asp.net
the use of the cache functionality of asp.net webforms is a bit problematic

839794
base-class	inherited
all my aspx pages inherited from a base-class called basepage

839797
spring	guice
going a long way towards enabling deployment time modularity are dependency injection frameworks like guice spring framefork and others

839797
configuration	installation
runtime modularity the way i see this is something akin to the modularity provided by eclipse and netbeans plugins or mozilla extensions where you can change the configuration and set of your application modules after the deployment installation

839802
arrays	map
create a hash map of the list r with the key being the element and the value being the original index into the arrays

839808
iteration	elements
maybe rather than echoing qwerty echo out the contents of on each iteration to be sure you re successfully getting through all elements in

839812
arrays	loops
at a guess you re dying on an error inside the loops because one of your s isn t an arrays like you expect and the error is being hidden

839823
user-interface	drawing
does take a bit of getting used to though - not because its user-interface is bad just because drawing with vectors is very different from freehand and the likes of gimp and paint.net

839824
base-class	inherited
a base-class should only contains code that is relevant for all classes that will inherited it and how do you know that every page you write in the future will have this control

839832
interpreter	runtime
asp.net is compiled and uses a pretty effective runtime with a state of the art jit and garbage collector while php is an interpreter scripting language

839832
sql-server	mysql
plus sql-server 2005+ is way better than mysql for serious db stuff

839836
any	set
think of any class as comprising two separate things an interface which is the set of methods and members that it exposes and an implementation which determines what accesses to those methods and member will actually do

839836
nsmutablearray	nsarray
because nsmutablearray is a subclass of nsarray instances of nsmutablearray will always support nsarray s interface

839836
nsmutablearray	nsarray
therefore you cannot assign a pointers to an nsarray instance to that variables because nsarray doesn t support the full interface of nsmutablearray

839841
web-applications	scalability
it is also probably safe to say that most of the highly scalability web-applications sacrifice consistency to achieve availability

839844
index-error	typeerror
some exception-handling like programming errors index-error typeerror

839846
cisco	pbx
i have a c++ program that uses the microsoft tapi interface to collect call events from a cisco call manager pbx

839848
put	get
i have seen reports that show mysql to be faster for some simple scenarios put to single table get from single table

839864
linux	unix
on linux unix you can do this with flock or fcntl

839878
unit-testing	assertions
conceptually unit-testing is important because an ideal set of unit tests will submit multiple conceivable comprehensive parameter set assertions covering both pass and fail conditions into a code segment at compile time and this will detail oversights short-comings in submitted source-code modifications

839911
buildpath	libs
project - properties - java buildpath - libs

839939
firefox	safari
i have checked this in firefox and safari only

839944
sql-server	oracle
when i go to run the report i simply specify the actual datatable that i get from sql-server oracle etc by doing the following

839944
put	get
like you in the preview pane i get bogus values even though my xml file may contain actual data along with the schema but when i actually run the crystal report i get the expected out put

839956
flotr	flot
if you don t need or care about support for older versioning of internet-explorer when you should find flot flotr is quite capable of handling large datasets

839960
revision	svn
see this question roll back or revert entire svn repository to an older revision

839971
value	field
i m trying to insert a value from a form field into a sql-server money field using coldfusion

839973
mac-address	packets
seems reasonable that the webserver has access to data such as mac-address etc since it gets the tcp packets and all

839984
derived-class	base-class
here is the question is it possible for the base-class to discover at runtime if the derived-class has taken the liberty of overriding one of these virtual methodss before invoking the virtual methods

839988
contains	set
this ensures that you retrieve only the rows from sql-server than contains the letters abc regardless of whether they re a word-boundary match or not and use regex on the client-side to further restrict the result set so that only matches that are on word boundaries are include

839995
shell	bash
replace bash with whatever shell you please

840002
value	field
for example if we have a second pizzeria sign up on their admin page to define field it might say that similar businesses chose to ask the following questions and present a list of sample value

840011
selected	cell
i know this is the case because if i selected the cell i go to its detail view and the data is updated

840023
arrays	loops
i was considering storing the integers in an arrays and performing the permutations using pointers within a loops

840042
combinations	permutation
take a look at this excellent post coding the wheel exhaustively enumerating combinations and permutation in code

840056
.when	ready
to counter the unfavorable user experience of having to wait for the web service before the download starts i would like to display a loading... feedback dialog .when a link is click and have the dialog go away .when the file is ready

840056
.when	ready
what i m specifically looking for is a way to determine .when the file is ready for download

840061
sql-server	mysql
i m the php guy that also does .net that is going to say all things being equal programmer skill with the chosen platform hardware bandwith etc. asp.net with sql-server is going to be faster than php with mysql at runtime

840061
interpreter	runtime
there is no way in hell an interpreter language can beat a compiled language at runtime speed

840067
configuration	environment
it discusses the prioritization of command line arguments over environment variables and configuration files and so on

840070
hide	show
i am using jquery to hide and show my forms but this should not be an issue

840086
decrement	increment
increment and or decrement it

840100
viewwillappear	viewdidload
do whatever you re doing in viewdidload in the viewwillappear methods instead - your image property will be set when pushviewcontroller animated calls viewwillappear

840122
switching	router
if you do this for an ip across the internet you re probably going to get the inside interface of the closest router or switching

840123
appdata	denied
my application vb.net sometimes throws an access denied exception-handling when attempting to delete files in the appdata folder and i m not sure why

840135
callback	methods
you have a couple options the two most obvious are either the client calls a methods that starts the job and polls the server for status or setup a callback

840137
textbox	button
i want to add additional screens that have no back-end functionality but that would display a description of the data the user needs to input such as the path to the jre a textbox + browse button to input it and a next button

840138
put	get
i need to get a part of the text that is stored in that column and put it into a different column on the same row

840142
python	c++
of course c c++ for interfacing with the low-level bits of your robot but also higher level-languages into which c c++ can be easily embedded like python

840160
authentication	login
i believe you need to setup sessions on the service and then turn on authentication it should enable a login once scenario

840163
communication	messages
what i mean by that is that systems tied in this way can communication through a set of mutually agreed messages types

840170
vb.net	vba
i prefer to use vb.net or java and try to avoid to use vba

840182
consistency	rdbms
besides the logical consistency issues most rdbms engines will benefit from including these fields in a unique index

840205
predict	party
the file will be uploaded to the ftp folder at some point from some other party and i can t predict when the file will be uploaded

840208
any	set
because we have set the keypreview to true the form s handler gets to see each key press before any other control that it contains and can decide to deal with the key press itself or else allow it to be handled in the same way as if the form had never previewed it

840214
dockpanel	listbox
however now on one of these pages i want to have a listbox with a list of customers in it and each customer has an edit button and when that edit button is clicked i want to fill the dockpanel with the editsinglecustomer usercontrol and pass it the customer that it needs to edit

840224
constructor	object
that s because it can create mock object that have private constructor or are sealed like most sharepoint object are

840261
constructor	object
i m trying to create a new object of type t via its constructor when adding to the list

840280
virtualization	vmware
i would suggest using a virtualization technology like vmware to clone one instance into multiple

840282
while-loop	loops
let s start with a do while-loops written in traditional f# imperative style then look at functional variations which provide both the same type of loops as well as different semantics like while do repeat until test in the middle and even break continue without monads

840282
arrays	loops
for example a bubble sort continually loops over an entire arrays swapping values that are out of place as it finds them

840292
host	root
root exception-handling is java.rmi.unknownhostexception-handling unknown host sql-server

840292
host	dns
additionall the spelling of sql-server is interesting as this is how the windows host reports it s hostname not how it s stored in dns

840305
order	add
in your case you need to change project.views.shared.view based on your namespace and classname and in order to access the control in the code-behind you have to manually add declaration in code-behind

840306
administration	account
i assume you are installing from an administration account

840310
worksheet	excel
i have a bunch of excel workbooks that contain multiple worksheet

840352
double	int
the issue was related to casting converting double to int

840360
multiplication	transpose
the obligatory requirements are all the basic operations multiplication transpose inversion as well as finding eigenvalues eigenvectors

840360
numerical	matrix
implementation of a numerical rather than as well as analytical methods for discovery of eigenvalues particularly the lanczos algorithm for sparse matrix would be highly preferable since the matrix i m going to be dealing with are very large lengths of 10 000 upwards as well as square and also reasonably sparse

840361
linux	unix
on unix linux platforms including cygwin you can use

840362
rewrite	rule
at the moment i only have the following rewrite rule in web-config

840362
rewrite	rule
or is it just my rewrite rule that s wrong

840370
stress-testing	jmeter
jmeter is also extremely useful for stress-testing web-services which is particularity important for those services doing database lookups

840371
code-collaborator	review-board
lightweight code review techniques include just looking over someone s shoulder automatically sending email after code is checked into version-control pair programming and using one of the tool specifically made for code review including my company s code-collaborator atlassian s crucible and the open source codestriker and review-board

840373
version-control	git
git is a free open source distributed version-control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency

840373
cvs	git
git is used for version control of files much like tools such as mercurial bazaar subversion cvs perforce and visual sourcesafe

840378
any	set
below will re-direct any calls to the old version to the new version you can also set this to work the other way round

exception-handling	try-catch
make sure you are not calling server.transfer within an exception-handling handler try-catch finally

840411
order	add
it seems that you have to actually go in and manually edit the .git configuration file in order to add an svn branch to an existing git repo

840433
atoi	atof
you could use atoi or atof and then check if the value returned by this function is not 0

840437
slimdx	xna
that has since been wrapped into microsoft xna which is probably not a good fit for you but the mdx wikipedia article recommends something called slimdx that might be okay

840440
click	mouse
i have a flash clip that moves a movieclip when the mouse is click on the movieclip

840473
triggers	insert
i make sure to add multiple records to my temp tables because every triggers must be able to correctly handle multiple record insert updates or deletes

840495
worksheet	excel
within excel this would be accomplished by copying the worksheet to a new workbook not by creating a new workbook then adding the worksheet to it

840511
webforms	asp.net
it is well written however and uses asp.net webforms

840537
authentication	login
in order to not have to prompt the user for a username and password every time they launch the application we will expose a login service that validates their username and password on initial launch and returns an authentication token that can be used for future web service requests for real data

840540
profiling	debugging
the development environment requires a mac but you can get the entire ide + tool chain + excellent debugging and profiling tools for free

840546
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox 3 google-chrome ie6

840568
emacs	vim
its windows style user-interface is probably quser-interfacete quser-interfaceck to learn for most people compared to vim or emacs anyway

840571
rtsp	rtp
it currently supports a v capture and playback in a wide variety of data types as well as streaming via rtp and rtsp

840572
sigaction	signals
if you register a signals handler using sigaction and you set sa_siginfo it may be possible to have your program examine the faulting memory address and handle only memory mapped file errors

840583
positioning	sidebar
piggybacking on nickallen you want to use absolute positioning so that the width of the sidebar isn t include in the centering on the primary container

840584
margins	padding
if that element has vertical padding or margins itâ s added to the height of the block according to the css specification see the visual formatting model for absolutely positioning non-replaced elements

840590
margins	padding
which should remove all padding and margins from the page as well

840596
xapian	whoosh
check out haystack search - a new model based search abstraction layer that currently supports xapian solr and whoosh

840603
any	set
you can set the visual of a visualbrush to a control and the visualbrush will recreate a visual representation of a control without any of the actual functionality

840603
duplicates	elements
the last 2 rectangle elements with the visualbrush and solidcolorbrush are how i create the duplicates control and then shade it out

840607

so first click your button that throws up the popup and .waituntilexists for the button inside the popup

840607
button	popup
this may not work in the case the button on the popup exists but is hidden from view

840629
export	report
the report is rendered fairly quickly from reporting services to the report viewer but when we export to pdf is when it takes a while to load

840634
json	xml
we will most likely use xml or json to transfer the data

840638
checkbox	button
this is produced by an html page which i have created the one with checkbox and a create button

840668
ip-address	proxy
currently we use the application security to restrict access to specific resources by ip-address but this has caused some issues when we moved to running behind a reverse proxy

840668
ip-address	proxy
are there any gotchas like what we ve encountered by doing application restriction and adding a reverse proxy where all the requests come from the proxy forcing us to use a header to find the real ip-address

840678
linked-list	nodes
if you have the reference of the nodes to insert after the operation is o 1 for a linked-list

840695
tuples	sorted
params.items returns the keys and values of the dictionary as a list tuples sorted sorts the list and urllib.urlencode concatenates them into a single string while escaping

840703
instances	self
one thing that can be noticed is that there is no concept of an instances of an object and having methods that are actually a part of an object so a self object must be passed in on each invocation

840703
superclass	inherited
the use of a function pointers can achieve inherited of a methods from a superclass

840713
json	xml
rest essentially requires http and is format-agnostic meaning you can use xml json html whatever

840730
svn2git	git-svn
using svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.

840761
postback	ajax
if you are using asp.net ajax you might want to look at using postback ritalin

840763
linux	unix
i am currently running this on linux and unix using java 1.6

840765
youtube	vimeo
our website lets people add videos by submitting a url - usually one from youtube or vimeo

840781
arrays	loops
i know i can loops through the arrays and check all the other values for a match but it seems like there should be an easier way

840788
.when	ready
have ajax poll that service every few seconds and remove the loading... message .when it replied that the file is ready

840798
32-bit	64bit
most likely your code runs in a 64bit process but shockwave is only installed for 32-bit

840802
stderr	stdout
stderr and not on stdout as i would expect

840802
stderr	stdout
i would prefer to have the errors emitted on stdout rather than stderr

840847
sqlcmd	ssms
while sqlcmd.exe is the best way ssms also has a sqlcmd mode where you can execute a sqlcmd script

840857
triggers	insert
add a triggers when the inserted changed data matches your condition do your notification insert into log table etc.

840879
updating	updates
if i updates the sunhours field how do i know which sunday s hours i m updating

840923
ruby	php
in addition to radius ldap etc we have a very simple api called wauth and packages available in php python ruby java and c#

840929
web-services	security
since we use .net s built-in session state management mechanism i m a bit ignorant of what security risks exist with the web-services

840933
xsd	xml
we created a class from each xsd and are using xmlserializer to convert the different xml messages to objects

840985
strtol	atoi
instead of using functions like strtol atoi atof

840989
boolean	int
so the best approach here is either to use a wider type than int number or pass some flag boolean value to function as well as int to indicate actual value absence

840989
numerical	nan
int has only numerical values and nan will get coerced to 0

840993
document	element
just for fun i examined the document being validated and found that the element defined in the schema of this type is not located in the document

841024
nsapplication	nstextview
given an nsapp object aka nsapplication sharedapplication how can i get the currently active nstextview where the insertion point is blinking right now if there is one

841026
execute	declare
when you call exec i believe it executes outside the context where your temp table was declare i believe if you append your strings together and execute as one call to exec it would succeed

841051
pointers	stack
allocating a buffer on stack is very fast -- all it is is decrementing stack pointers by a value

841059
attributes	properties
i see attributes selectors available in the jquery documentation however i am interested in css properties not attributess

841062
display	height
is there a way to determine the display height of a windows forms listbox

841062
any	set
i need to automatically resize the form to remove the any extra space at the bottom which the listbox does not use due to listbox.integralheight being set to true

841064
compact-framework	.net
the .net compact-framework tabcontrol doesn t have a selectedtab property like its .net counterpart

841068
python	php
i am new to python i am getting out of php because of how increasingly broken it is and i am racing through porting my old code

841079
xsd	xml
i ve got an xml response from another system but no xsd so i used the create schema option to generate one

841079
xsd	xml
i then added the xsd to my biztalk 2006 r2 project and set its input instance filename property to the original xml message

841079
xsd	xml
how the heck can the xml fail that was used to generate the xsd

841083
emacs	vim
it can be integrated with visual-studio emacs vim and others and can format just the selected lines or with git svn to format some diff

841084
hide	show
one idea would be to apply the floating style via css then you could selected on the class name and do a show hide as necessary

841096
qabstractitemmodel	qtreeview
i have a qtreeview hooked up to a qabstractitemmodel which typically has thousands of nodes in it

841101
32-bit	64bit
you can apparently still develop under 32-bit and then move it to the 64bit server

841105
webforms	asp.net
i really like the mvc way and have actually enjoyed learning asp.net mvc i never liked asp.net webforms but i didn t know why until now

841105
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the problem is i m about to inherit a bunch of webforms code and wondered if i ll be able to add new things to the codebase with asp.net-mvc instead off using webforms

841105
asp.net-mvc	webforms
should i just stop messing with asp.net-mvc and get working on webforms or can i make it work together so that if i need to modify something from the webforms codebase i can just remake it the asp.net-mvc way as i move along

841106
cursor	row
if you really don t want to create the function object you could use a cursor to loop over the rows in the table execute the function in a pl sql statement and update each row as you go

841133
webforms	asp.net
i think it probably depends on how big the asp.net webforms app is

841150
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i would recommend attempting to only add new stuff using asp.net-mvc and convert over the legacy webforms code as you can

841160
xhtml	tidy
going along with unknown s html tidy idea you could then serialization the dom back into a valid xhtml file

841179
button	popup
the user presses the button and a web browser popup the web site that the client app needs to access data from

841187
callback	methods
you can use dana s suggestion of proxing the request or look into a methods called jsonp which essentially wraps the returned json object in a custom callback requested by a script-tag you inject into your dom

841218
for-loop	loops
so the for-loops inside getcompanies won t loops over anything since total is still set to 0

841223
32-bit	64bit
note that in my case i was working on a 32-bit windows 2003 vm but hosted on a 64bit virtual server

841226
toupper	tolower
i ve read that it s unwise to use toupper and tolower to perform case-insensitive string comparisons but i see no alternative when it comes to linq-to-sql

841226
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
the ignore-case and compareoptions arguments of string.compare are ignored by linq-to-sql if you re using a case-sensitive database you get a case-sensitive comparison even if you ask for a case-insensitive comparison

841226
toupper	tolower
is tolower or toupper the best option here

841247
managed-code	native-code
you could try to use mono aot or ms native image generator to compile the managed-code to native-code but i cannot tell if this will result in a native dll using c calling convention

841247
managed-code	native-code
you have to write a wrapper - c-language functions states that the dll must include a magic block that will not be availiable if you compile managed-code to native-code

841265
xsd	xml
i want to convert an xml schema xsd document into a tree like structure

841272
build-process	ant
the yui compressor is a tool i use it compresses both javascript and css well and it is written in java so you can work it into a build-process via ant

841277
.when	ready
the callback handler gets called .when the data is ready

841288
sql-server	mysql
i don t know the operational differences between mysql and sql-server but another thing that seemed to be happening in our case was that the execution cache was filled up and that was slowing execution on all uncached execution plans way down

841292
javascript	dom
first the javascript language and second the html dom that allows you to manipulate the page using the javascript language

841303
fogbugz	svn
assuming i am using svn tortoisesvn for all repositories i may have different issue trackers trac and fogbugz

841303
fogbugz	trac
i am considering writing the plugin for fogbugz but also need to use one for trac

841319
google-chrome	firefox
i now support firefox and ie but google-chrome fell out because of it

841342
toupper	tolower
as you say there are some important difference between toupper and tolower and only one is dependably accurate when you re trying to do case insensitive equality checks

841342
toupper	tolower
he says string.toupper â use toupper rather than tolower and specify invariantculture in order to pick up os casing rules

841352
perl	ruby
if you think this approach would work well you could try xlloop - this allows you to easily write excel functions in java python ruby perl r lisp erlang

841364
nsbezierpath	appkit
unfortunately there s no way to just ask for each element like there is with appkit s nsbezierpath

841366
value	field
also i don t see how i can put in an arbitrary value for a field like birthdate

841371
logout	login
i need to automate an im client to update a status every few hours basically login update status logout

841372
contains	elements
that way chosenroles will always contains the elements on the right side of the picklist while elements on the left side are not in the arrays

841418
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am adding asp.net-mvc to a project that has many legacy webforms pages

841418
asp.net-mvc	webforms
however i currently have a separate masterpage for asp.net-mvc and for the webforms

841418
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i d really like to kill the webforms one and just use the asp.net-mvc master page with all my pages and stay dry

841418
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i tried doing the obvious way and just pointing the webforms content page s masterpage attribute at the asp.net-mvc masterpage

841418
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this seems like it would be a pretty common problem with mixed asp.net-mvc and webforms projects

841418
asp.net-mvc	webforms
my asp.net-mvc master isn t doing anything with viewdata so i don t see any reason the webforms couldn t use them

841427
asp.net-mvc	webforms
your asp.net-mvc master page must simply point to the webforms masterpage via its masterpagefile attribute

841427
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this applies your webforms masterpage styles to your asp.net-mvc masterpage

841427
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the declaration on my asp.net-mvc master page pointing at the webforms master page

841429
button	popup
after providing the path user clicks on save button on the popup

841439
revision	svn
our original codebase integrates the svn revision number into the code using svnversion -n to query for the wc s current revision

841440
account	api
also think about getting your application account white-listed it will allow you to have a 20 000 api request limit per hour vs the measly 100 which is made for a user not an application

841469
pointers	stack
because stack pointers could be anything when the function starts there is no way to align the arrays without allocating a lot more than you need and adjusting it

841512
vbscript	vb.net
just kicking this out in vb.net which is extremely well documented will probably take less time and energy than all of the crazy debugging you will end up doing in vbscript

841531
button	popup
a windows for program b popup and user presses a few button to confirm something

841535
pie-chart	charts
i am having an issue where the charts labels on my flex pie-charts don t go away when the data is refreshed

841542
implements	extends
third my threads should implements runnable instead of extends thread see so question below

841552
htmlpurifier	xss
for filtering out xss attacks when you need to preserve html markup htmlpurifier

841561
traversal	parent
since the click handler is happening to the you could also traversal up to the parent div then search down for the second div

841566
children	tree
traversing-- tree traversal -- children

841569
webserver	security
same as the soap solution but with server side xsl for security and rendering so the webserver needs only drop in the text

841573
cakephp	symfony
the main ones i ve heard of are zend cakephp symfony code igniter and one or two other ones i can t recall the names of right off the bat

841588
iteration	set
all of the functions you re creating with lambda have a reference to the same i variables which is set to 9 on the last iteration of the loop

841602
listbox	textbox
wpf application consisting of a textbox on top and a listbox below

841602
listbox	textbox
users type a string in the textbox to find employees and search results are displayed in the listbox

841603
hide	show
or perhaps use collapsiblepanels from the ajaxtoolkit to hide and show the upload form

841611
python	perl
edit i have not decided not choice of any specific language yet but i am comfortable with both perl and python

841611
switching	router
the files are something along router switching configuration-files with different functional sections

841624
webforms	asp.net
i m trying to use url routing within my existing asp.net webforms site

841624
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have seen examples of using the sitemap with asp.net-mvc but this makes assumptions about having controllers and such none of which exist with a standard webforms

841625
revision	svn
i m quite new to tfs actually i only use it because i have some projects on codeplex and did not want to go through svnbridge and i m looking for something equivalent to the revision parameter in svn

841625
revision	updates
essentially on checkout i want to updates a file to contain the newest revision number to be displayed as version number just like at the bottom of so

841628
decrement	increment
if you don t want to get to grips with another tool you can try something like increment a static member every time a class is created and decrement it every time an instance is disposed

841628
instances	destroy
this will help you track down instances that are not be destroy properly

841640
springboard	simulator
when creating iphone apps in simulator i sometimes see messages like springboard failed to launch application etc

841642
gnome	xfce
ed also istr many desktop environment like gnome kde xfce and even cde supporting some sort of save session on logout thing

841648
numerical	matrix
if you are running a computation that requires more precision that the traditional ieee-single-precision real which if you re taking a numerical analysis class is very probable but declare your variables as real myvar you ll be fine if the compiler is set to default all real values to double-precision but changing the compiler options or moving your code to a different machine with different default sizes for real and integer variabless will lead to some possibly nasty surprises your iterative matrix solver blows up

841658
spaces	output
yes gcc is inserting extra spaces verify by checking the stdout output of gcc -e westley.c

841669
python	ruby
candidates that i thought of are python || ruby powershell

841676
base-class	inherited
then iterate through the types in that assembly until you find one that inherited from some base-class you ve defined or interface

841677
value	field
try filtering out data with 0 values or using a custom label function to not display the label if the field value is 0

841706
python	java
runtime environments permit parsing with antlr in c++ c c# java python and ruby applications

841721
administration	host
i use it along with 1and1.com host just install it like any other website and then you should be able to do alot of administration features similar to ssms

841722
append	input
i need to append some text to an input field.

841740
udp	tcp
the raw data can be found at proc .net tcp proc .net udp etc

841752
integration	bpm
if the process requires any human integration decision making and is long running or there are lots of similar business processes then a workflow bpm product like k2 or processmaker might be appropriate

841756
.mov	m4a
mpeg-4 part 3 the mp4 m4v m4a 3gp and .mov multimedia containers

841756
constructor	object
third we create a netstream object passing the previously made netconnection object to it s constructor

841778
duplicates	contains
the list class actually works quite well for key value collections contains duplicates where you would like to iterate over the collection

841790
export	report
fyireports allows you to export the report as pdf excel and mht static web page just to mention a few

841817
typedef	struct
you do not need typedef for struct or classes the typename will automatically be available in the namespace

841833
required	checked
the second checked just required finding the four distance

841833
required	checked
the third checked just required finding the distance from circle-center to closest-box-latitude circle-center-longitude

841833
required	checked
the fourth checked required finding the longitude line of the bounding-box that is closest to the circle-center

841840
contains	any
however in any class that contains a field of any type there may be a bug that sets the field to null

841901
directory	folder
when i drag a folder onto the nstableview it calls adddirectorytolist - which recursively loops over all files contained in this directory calling addfiletolist on each

841914
value	field
i have a completely working field that takes its value from a jquery datepicker and i can selected the theme ok so i must have something right

841963
contains	elements
a descendant is any elements that appears below the contains elements at any point in the dom tree a child grand-child type relationship

841963
contains	elements
a child is an elements that is directly below the contains elements in the dom

841973
any	set
most browsers will obey that and make sure any word-specific characters are converted to the appropriate character set before it gets to your website

841973
any	set
once invalid text gets to your website there s very little you can do to fix it reliably so it s best to simply check all input for being valid in whatever character set you use and discard any requests that have invalid text

841985
postdata	request
__dopostback will raise the postback explicitly regardless of what postdata comes through in the request

841991
any	set
the information set for any well-formed xml document will contain at least a document information item and several others.

841991
xsd	xml
just because an xml document is an infoset does not mean it conforms to an xsd and is a valid xml document

841997
driver	kernel
note that if you end up trying to really debugging a driver you might need to track a call from the user mode code through the kernel and into the relevant bits of the driver

842021
forwarding	port
is it possible to set up an ssh tunnel with dynamic port forwarding like this

842021
forwarding	port
that s to say i want to initiate the connection on my local machine and have the dynamic port forwarding happen there and have my friend connect his browser to the other end of the tunnel

842023
attributeerror	nameerror
the last except acts as a catch-all here and is only execute if an exception-handling different than an attributeerror or nameerror occurs

842046
ruby	php
its possible in that time frame depending on how good you are with ruby on rails and php

842048
contains	elements
the document naturally contains a html head title elements

842054
children	nodes
sub-files must retain all attributes and children nodes

842054
python	ruby
if you aren t good at xslt but can tell me how to do it in ruby or even python please feel free to contribute an answer in those languages

842056
document	element
the document root isn t the element

842072
wordpress	mediawiki
wordpress and mediawiki have years of coding behind them

842074
value	field
if you want aggregation on a particular field in the model you can use the value methods

842074
value	field
order_by is needed because field that are in the default order are automatically selected even if they are not explicitly passed to value

842075
python	java
i am thinking about cross-platform with nice programming language bindings java ruby and python

842080
triggers	insert
you may also want to add a triggers on insert to set an initial value of my_column_updated_at

842089
superclass	subclass
creating a subclass should mean more than just a convenient way to call superclass methods

842089
superclass	subclass
you should use inheritance when subclass is-a superclass both structurally and functionally when it can be used as superclass and you are going to use that

842095
groovy	scala
similar to how groovy scala etc compilers generate bytecode for the jvm

842103
python	java
there are bindings for java ruby and python

842139
stderr	stdout
it allows you to redirect stdout and stderr to files

842154
sharing	share
i have some persistent classes not inherited from eachother but sharing many functions that all share an interfaces categorizableentity

842175
lisp	tcl
if you have any lisp in your background you can probably learn tcl in a morning

842175
perl	tcl
another benefit to tk is the fact it works with tcl perl python and ruby and others so you aren t stuck with a particular language

842175
python	tcl
tk comes out of the box with tcl and python so for those languages there is nothing else to install

842175
python	tcl
i will say though after writing several hundred lines of python tkinter code the past few weeks i much much prefer coding in tcl when it comes to guis but that s more of a personal thing than anything else

842175
perl	tcl
for more on tk with tcl ruby and perl see

842188
groovy	java
if java is your preferred language consider groovy

842188
groovy	java
if it wasn t for the fact i m highly productive in tcl tk i think groovy would be my personal second choice even though i m not a big fan of java or swing per se

842192
hide	show
i need to programatically show hide a menuitem what would be the best way to do this

842251
bubble-sort	quicksort
for most objects with simple comparisons a quicksort on 10 items will not be noticiably faster than a bubble-sort a linear search on 100 items will probably be faster than a binary-tree and so on

842255
pseudo-class	anchor
the only real cross-browser way to handle this is with javascript as unfortunately many older browsers did not support hover pseudo-class on anything other than anchor elements

842291
javascript	dom
in firefox any javascript that uses document.write will destroy the dom

842298
contains	any
i have a hash table which can contains any number of objects

842308
attributes	properties
as such a nonatomic properties attributes is available

842313
selected	button
i d either like to pipe diff output to a program that will copy it to the clipboard with formatting p4 diff file.cpp | rtfpatch or have a plugin for outlook that lets me selected some text click a button and it gets colorized

842322
hash	md5
the code i used for generating the necessary md5 hash is up on my github repository in the commoncrypto subfolder

842332
any	set
if i set specific version to true it won t make any difference as the reference allready is set to an older version

accumulate	aggregate
later on you can create a stored procedure that aggregate historical data and thus purges huge amounts of data that you have accumulate - thus creating reports on the level of granularity that you care about

842349
ruby-on-rails	django
if the site is best done in ruby-on-rails or django then that should be obvious

842358
sqrt	pow
math.sqrt is probably just the c implementation of sqrt which is probably related to pow

methods	extend
i would like to extend this methods to allow it to take a block so that you can do something like the following where people is an arrays of person objects which have the name attribute

842360
perl	lua
there is a very good reason to use regular expressions in scripting languages such as ruby python perl javascript and lua parsing a string with carefully optimized regular expression executes faster than the equivalent custom while loop which scans the string character-by-character

842367
selected	button
whenever a person clicks on a drop-down button - the values for the drop-down should be dynamically generated using the values selected in the other two drop-downs

842399
firefox	opera
however when i use ... datatype json ... the browser opera and firefox so far but i ll bet it s universal asks to save open the results of the request

842401
command-line	cmd
say i have a directory with hi.txt and blah.txt and i execute the following cmd on a linux-ish cmd-line

842413
ruby	php
an important point to make here is that with rails typically meaning ruby on rails although it could be groovy etc you re comparing a framework to a language php

842413
ruby	php
there are many php frameworks so a lot of the issues of speed of coding diminish if not disappear altogether if you compare ruby on rails to php + some framework or frameworks with which you re equally familiar

842413
ruby	php
ruby is slanted twoards prototype being integrated and the like whereas php is more open to any javascript framework which has advantages and disadvantages and both can do whatever in html and css

842419
multiplication	addition
no if you have ever taken a parsing or compiler course you would understand that this is like saying addition and multiplication is overhyped for math problems

842422
bubble-sort	in-place
use bubble-sort on the list in-place this should be fast enough if the list is small

842422
quicksort	heapsort
copy the list to an arrays and use heapsort or quicksort then copy it back

842440
required	checked
however the last time i checked you needed to be running as root to get access to the raw bsd socket required for sending icmp trace

842446
stderr	stdout
if you want them to instead echo to stderr you can pipe stderr to stdout with the construct

842450
order	add
if for example i need to add a where-clause in some case and an order by in other cases

842472
algebra	formula
this means that you can calculate with programs in much the same way that you calculuate with formula in high-school algebra

842476
getter	setter
whenever i try to write tests i only end up testing basic stuff that i probably shouldn t be testing in the first place getter setter but it doesn t look like the objects have anything else

842483
wamp	php
i m using wamp on windows which installs php apache and mysql

842492
keyboard	mouse
you could easily set up a few bodies with initial masses positions and velocities and use the keyboard or mouse to adjust the properties then start simulating

842512
perl	awk
and of course this splitting can be done with any of the standard text processing tools in unix perl python awk head tail combo

842535
perl	c++
if you re comfortable with the win32 api as a c c++ programmer perl may be the easier way to go

842535
perl	c++
it has modules for accessing the win32 api and perl is quite easy for c c++ programmers to get up to speed in

842554
buffering	streaming
if you take a look at the streaming reader implementation it uses a buffering so it can implement textreader.peek even if the streaming is not seekable

842558
tab-completion	zsh
initial problem which files does the tab-completion run when i press tab for one word in searching manuals by zsh

842559

so now we have something that actually output to both stdout and stderr so we

842589
callback	methods
i d recommend adding a callback in your first animation to a delegate methods using code like the following

842589
callback	methods
then you need to define the callback methods within your class in this case

842598
python	ruby
i would like to do the same thing but using a python or ruby class instead of a text editor

842598
python	ruby
that way this same kind of brain-dead simple operation can be run from a script on any platform that supports ruby or python

842598
python	ruby
question i don t feel like writing this myself so does anyone know of a ruby or python script that accepts the same or similar easy input args and does what you d expect

842600
configuration	environment
for everything else be sure to have a configuration file or command-line parameter or environment variables

842610
interpolation	splines
one can look at this as primarily a smoothing problem using a filtering tool to smooth the data only afterwards to interpolate using some variety of interpolant perhaps an interpolation splines

842610
interpolation	splines
finding a local maximum of an interpolation splines is an easy enough thing

842610
spline	smooth
here one uses a least-squares spline model to both smooth the data and to produce an approximant instead of an interpolant

842610
spline	smooth
another related option is to use a smooth spline

842619
system.out	system.in
long answer in java all console operations are handled through input and output streamsâ system.in is an input stream and system.out and system.err are output streams

842665
implements	extends
if i create a base-class and it extends an interface there is an explicit contract defined for every methods in the interface the base-class must implements said methods

842665
implements	extends
let s say i create a base-class which extends vbox and implements the interface

842665
abstract-class	base-class
as matthew pointed out abstract-class helps solve some of this i could create a base abstract class which inherits from the displayobject or in my case the vbox since it is a child of displayobject and have the base-class implement the interface

842665
implements	extends
thus any class which extends the abstract-class would then be required to implements the methods therein

842665
base-class	inherited
so i could create a base-class which implements interface and extends the vbox and inherited from it and i could insert code in those methods which need to be extended

842680
filtering	sorting
sorting filtering highlighting for tables trees and lists

842680
authentication	login
login authentication framework

842715

842876
value	field
value player_type - for inclusion only player_type field into grouping by clause

842891
manual	sweave
also the manual for sweave says that emacs speaks statistics can handle sweave files so since statweave seems to be similar perhaps you could hack ess to handle those files as well

842907
logout	login
i am writing some small program in c--some login logout create account send-message-to-another-account deal--that i can build on and change and innovate and polish up to refine my skills in c

you can have a basichttpbinding and still assign transport-level security http with ssl to it

842951
viewwillappear	viewdidload
take the code that sets the button up in the viewdidload methods and move it into viewwillappear

842969
hash	md5
md5 sha1 and many other hash functions are also using this davis-meyer construction and hence they are in principle based on a block cipher

842969
block-cipher	md5
just in case of md5 or sha1 that block-cipher does not have a name and i m not aware of much research on how suitable these constructs are

842984
set	bag
if you remove the id column but don t wipe out duplicates you end up with a bag of rows not a set

842988
order	join
now since you re doing a straight join without conditions grouping or order it probably won t need any temporary tables except for aggregating the final result

842988
innodb	myisam
one thing to remember is that while innodb concatenation the primary key of the table to each index myisam does not

843003
python	perl
you can do this search and replace manually using a hex editor or using a 3-line python perl script

843010
rollback	commit
thatâ s it â you can now begin commit and rollback transactions

843029
groovy	java
if you are also going to be developing in java and are not tied to eclipse or whatever else i think netbeans is a pretty good all-round ide considering they have support for groovy php ruby and python if that tickles your fancy

843031
triggers	insert
i have created two triggers tr1 after insert on t1 and tr2 after update on t2

843035
freebsd	linux
this happens only on windows not linux or freebsd

843041
arrays	loops
this seems pretty clear if you have any programming experience at all but just in case the for statements are loops like split is some function which takes a string and splits it into an arrays of words -- this is not completely trivial but there s probably a library function to do this len gives the length of the arrays join puts them back together with spaces in between and the syntax means all of the elements from i to j inclusive in python this would actually be

843046
unicode-string	utf8-decode
this will cause a problem since you are passing a str object a string of bytes that contains the utf8-decode versioning of a and when the string.format is trying to embed that in your unicode-string it will try to convert it back to a unicode object using hte default encoding ascii

843047
triggers	insert
if you want to modify the data that is being updated or inserted you should use a before update and or before insert triggers and then make use of new alias it references the row that is being inserted or the row as it will look after the update is applied - you can actually modify the fields that are being inserted

843068
csv	xml
here is a link to the python-twitter interface outputting from there into other formats xml spreadsheet csv is quite trivial

843071
python	java
java python etc

843073
python	java
i ve written and still do write tools in c and python and have previously maintained webobjects java code

843076
communication	messages
the new javascript worker threads might be an exception-handling here but they re not meant to access document at all just to communication by messages passing

843077
hide	show
then in your code where the property value is changed you ll to find the menu item you wish to show hide using the linkage i described above

843097
order	add
in order to execute those post build actions you will need to put them in a batch file and then add the appropiate command to invoke the batch file in the post build event dialog

843102
google-chrome	opera
each browser let us not forget google-chrome safari opera ... has its own plugin extensions mechanism

843115
darcs	svn
however as i was familiar with darcs and svn but not git i assumed that a clone was the normal way to create a branch i now know that git branch would have been more appropriate.

843116
punctuation	comma
then you process one sequences at a time after removing all punctuation comma semi-colons colons and so on

843116
punctuation	words
the separation into sequences separation into words removal of punctuation and so on will be the hardest bit but i ve already show you some simple initial rules to follow

843130
exception-handling	try-catch
this solution is to 1 put a top-level try-catch in your program to catch all exception-handling 2 put a breakpoint in the catch block that runs your macros and 3 have the macros look at the exception to figure out where it came from and put a breakpoint there

843133
python	c++
fann fast artifical neural network library is a great general-purpose neural-network library written in c but has bindings for just about any language you might want c++ .net python mathematica among others

try using the userid and password keywords instead of database account and database password

843154
linux	bsd
is there a hacky way to do this which is also used by for instance bsd linux kernel or berkeley db. may be by using bitwise operations

843155
delta	diff
generic data-structure with automatic diff delta handling get my job done better for me an average database application developer

843176
version-control	git
git is a distributed version-control system

843181
local-variables	eval
if it were a global-variables x i could check if its name exists in the global_variabless arrays and in the worst case use eval but how could i do so for a local-variables if possible at all

843204
subclassing	nsobject
repurposing the code from seismic xml provides a very good api that creates nsobject subclassing from xml

843216
configuration	environment
it would be nice with different configuration for different environment

843224
jquery	dojo
i recommend you to start using jquery or dojo javascript frameworks

843225
versioning	upgrade
there is a project called push up the web which advises all users to upgrade to newer versioning of their browsers

843250
selected	button
even though the user experience may not be quite as nice the selected with a button degrades more gracefully both when the user does not have javascript and when the user is using accessibility technology

843262
configuration	environment
you create your machine configuration in a ruby dsl where everything is organized into environment and roles

843265
lightbox	jquery
why not use a jquery lightbox

843268
switching	screens
i want to write a small program that given a time in minutes as input sleeps in the background for that time and then forces a return to the switching user screens equivalent to the winkey+l combinations or logs off a user may be another user logged in on the same machine

843268
switching	screens
i prefer just a return to the switching user screens rather than actually logging off

843308
contains	any
this happens before i added any folder contains class files

843313
getter	setter
that is the purpose of your getter and setter

843322
aggregate	grouping
you also have to grouping by every column that is not an aggregate in the selected list

843332
mouseleave	mouseenter
with jquery events if you want the event to apply to new elements you would use the .live methods however jquery 1.3 doesn t support blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change or submit events as live events and it s change that you will want to use

843333
json	csv
it can output in several formats yaml json csv tsv and of course regular text

843333
instances	private
regarding the private keys there are no ec2 tools that allow to create private keys for with a password for booting a public instances because the api doesn t support it

843338
any	set
when running this hej gets called with different senders when pressing any of the button - even though one of them has exclusivetouch set to yes

843345
accessor	ivar
if you have synthesized the accessor for your property with the synthesize directive they will take care of releasing the ivar that is backing the property when the property gets reassigned

843359
command-line	cmd
the part of the cmd is the cmd-line arguments to your application

843378
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
first you never want to subclass uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller

843397
google-chrome	firefox
firefox seems to support -moz versions of some of the properties and safari google-chrome -webkit versions

843400
checkbox	button
get an outlet to your button you want to toggle and then create an action method that your checkbox points to that toggles the hidden property of the original button based on the checkbox status

843410
python	java
of the many available toolkits i suggest to take a look at orange scipy both python or weka java

843416
configuration	environment
added bonus is that the user can execute groovy code to compute their configuration options much better over using properties files as well as being able to do different environment with ease

843419
defined	declare
i have for example an xml reader class fully declare in a .h file which has a pimpl to a realxmlreader class which is declare defined in non-public .h and .cpp files

843419
contains	any
there are a few pimpl fabnatics who insist that any project contains more than three files will be uncompilable unless you use pimpls throughout

843436
.when	ready
.when you are done provide a single character input and you are ready to go

843445
firefox	opera
within the game there are many cells internally just normal table cells with a non breaking space to stop them collapsing in firefox i could stop the collapsing in ie safari and opera with css but for some reason it didn t work in firefox so i resorted to non breaking spaces with either a solid background colour or a background image

843445
highlight	cells
as the player drags a selection across them the game highlight the cells by changing the background colour

843445
highlight	cell
however the browser also highlight the non breaking spaces leaving grey rectangles across some of the cell

843445
highlight	selected
in a 5 x 5 square if the user selected 1 1 to 3 3 the game highlight the following selection

843445
google-chrome	firefox
at the very least in firefox and google-chrome but preferably cross browser

843452
constructor	object
for the rest you have to understand the main difference class object are always used through a reference and are created by calling a constructor

843452
double	int
the memory-management and allocation for records is the same as for the basic types ie int double

843454
google-chrome	safari
for google-chrome and safari couldn t find a reliable source yet

843455
contains	set
implementing preferences-style grouping tables three20 extracted from facebook iphone app has a set of ready-made cells that contains various controls

843465
restart	exit
you have to close and restart firefox after each change file exit

843484
difference	count
there s a difference between count lines and count line separators

843484
buffering	streaming
if you re reading the raw bytes into a buffering with your streaming in binary mode and scanning them you ll come up with a count of 0 on these files

843485
contains	set
three20 extracted from facebook iphone app has a set of ready-made cells that contains various controls

843490
javascript	dom
i should stress i need all features of web browser engine except rendering http client cookie handling dom style http parser javascript engine

843493
transactional-memory	message-passing
my two candidates right now are nonblocking software transactional-memory on one side and copying message-passing semantics without sharing a la erlang

843504
device-manager	driver
i m curious how the windows device-manager obtains the hardware ids for a device even though no device driver may be loaded for the device yet

843525
ironpython	cpython
again garbage collecting is specific to the implementations so cpython jython and ironpython will have different behaviours most of these being documented on the respective sites manuals code etc

843547
firefox	gecko
i don t agree with all those answers as there is some misinformation there such as firefox being the dictator of what happens in gecko it certainly influences but is not the deciding factor

843561
mayavi	vtk
once you have mayavi vtk ets etc

843561
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu has all of it packaged but they re the only linux distribution i know that does

843593
python	java
lastly if you want to solve your problem in python but can t find a parser use a java engine to add comments to the code which you can then search for in python to instrument the code

843601
attributes	properties
depending on the other possible attributess of that properties that function would either use instead of if the copy attributes was specified or it would all be wrapped in an synchronized self block if the nonatomic attributes was not supplied

843604
children	nodes
the purpose of the query is to get all the immediate children of a given parent nodes

843632
instance-variables	accessor
i think that an property is an instance-variables that has accessor methods but i might think wrong

843650
turbogears	django
if you want to get a quick glance at a nice web based orm framework i suggest django or turbogears

843650
python	php
they are based on python which will be a nice change after using php

843650
turbogears	django
i usually prefer turbogears but django seems to be more smooth at the moment

843657
.when	ready
.when you are ready delete the whole buffering

843701
scripting	shebang
you can also add a shebang to the beginning of your scripting first line

843706
spring	guice
i ve read martin fowler s article and looked through other di frameworks phemto spring google guice xyster etc. but i want to know what you think

843707
attributes	properties
a properties on the other hand is an attributes of your object that can be accessed it sounds vague and it s supposed to

843715
ubuntu	osx
there is a fixed list of oses xp vista win7 osx and ubuntu

843715
contains	elements
the elements can contains 0 or more of the operating systems listed

843715
contains	set
my questions is what is the best way to go about validating that the element only contains child elements where the name is from the given set and that each name element does not appear more than once

843717
uiresponder	uiview
my most recent attempt derives from uiresponder and has a uiview member that stores a pointer to the current view

843723
contains	set
finally it occurred to me that the transform property of the panelview was left set after the b animation...and perhaps that impacted further animation of a superview contains panelview

843727
spring	guice
you ve already done a pretty good job of investigating this for yourself if you ve written code with spring and guice

843730
button	popup
my application pushes out a pdf file to a popup no menu toolbar browser windows in response to the user clicking a button

843737
32-bit	64bit
i need solution which will work well for both architectures 32-bit and 64bit

843739
getter	setter
when you assign to or read from myobject.propertyname you are really calling setter getter methods on the object

843739
getter	setter
the synthesize line tells the compiler to generate these getter setter for you using the member variables with the same name of the property to store the value or othervarname if you use the syntax in comments

843739
getter	setter
along with synthesize you can still override one of the getter setter by defining your own

843739
convention	standards
the naming convention for these methods is setpropertyname for the setter and propertyname or getpropertyname not standards for the getter

843739
attributes	properties
in your properties line you can define a number of attributes in parens for the properties that can automate things like thread-safety and memory-management

843739
attributes	properties
you can specify the nonatomic attributes to disable this for example on the iphone you want to default most properties to nonatomic

843739
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it is good practice to use copy for nsstring because a caller could pass in an nsmutablestring and change it out from under you

843739
attributes	properties
lastly you can also use the readonly attributes to disable the setter for the properties

843740
convenience-methods	initializer
but if you re set on saving some keystrokes i d suggest adding a static convenience-methods to the class instead of messing with the initializer

843746
boost	stl
go for stl boost www.boost.org

843763
any	set
i d like to do the same but i don t want to let any users to set it up so i am looking for a way to determine if the application has been set up or no

843769
json	xml
it s a more common practice to start with a contract and express it in terms of an xml schema json or rest and let clients and servers map that data into whatever objects they see fit

843786
boolean	int
instead boolean values are stored as int 0 false and 1 true

843787
contains	set
trying to use a datagridview like the old vb6 flexgrid and add the coloumns manually via addrow built a row contains textcells and my coloums are all added and display ok but as soon as i try to add a row i get the message rows cannot be programmatically added to the datagridview s rows collection when the control is data-bound. but for love nore god can i see a way of setting it as a unbound control i ve not set the datasourc to anything

843788
expression	evaluation
expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable lazy evaluation when that is appropriate -- eigen takes care of this automatically and handles aliasing too in most cases

843809
python	ruby
i am particularly interested in the features such as ruby python and emacs-tags

843811
exception-handling	try-catch
trying to catch the exception-handling by a try-catch around runfastcgi will not work

843811
exception-handling	try-catch
if you want to catch the exception-handling you need to wrap any of the statements listed by the trace in a try-catch like this

843821
python	ruby
if you re interested in scripting either in vimscript or python ruby .

843821
python	ruby
of course you still need to have python ruby .

843826
hide	show
show and hide sql errors

843845
32-bit	64bit
i am working on migrating a 32-bit isapi dll to 64bit

843857
icollection	ienumerable
but once you start doing this it s probably best just to use an ordinary for-loop anyway unless you can t because the collection only implements ienumerable and not ilist icollection of course

843863
click	mouse
click a link with middle mouse button and it will open in a new tab depends on your tabs settings in tools- options but by default would work

843863
widget	button
i just tried the middle button in ie 7 and seems to work just like it does in firefox except for the back -button and search widget

843869
keyboard	mouse
a programmer who is typing into a code windows can generally use a keyboard accelerator much faster than taking his hand over to the mouse to right click

843874
contains	elements
document that contains only the vertices that correspond to minimal elements of the partial order

843885
junction-table	jointable
once you ve built a table it really doesn t have a type of junction-table associative table jointable -- it s just a table

843885
sql-server	oracle
so sql-server oracle or your code has no reason to know why a table was created...just that it s a table

843894
selected	button
to do this i had to put the iphone in dfu mode and shift click windows in itunes on the restore button and selected the 2.2.1 .ipsw

843894
selected	button
once the iphone was restored i updated the phone to the 3.0 os by shift clicking on the check updates button in itunes and selected the 3.0 os from the file browser

843910
parsing	comma
personally i never authorize the use of comma delimited values in a relational database because it is actually faster to build a new table than it is to build a parsing routine to create update and manage multiple values in a column and deal with all the anomalies introduced because sometimes that data has embedded comma too

843911
rdbms	acid
none of the mega scale web2.0 applications can rely on rdbms for realtime messaging given the limits that is encountered due to the acid guarantees of a rdmbs and its scaling characteristics

843912
ip-address	hostname
since you ve bound them to separate ip-addresses you ll need to either supply the ip-address or if the ip-address resolves to a different hostname use the hostname that goes with that ip-address

843915
authentication	login
the dotnetopenauth library has a sample that shows how a wcf client can get authorized to call a wcf service via oauth where at the service-side the user uses openid to login as part of the authentication process

843929
xml-serialization	xml
xml in general can be brittle if you use an xml databinding technology that depends on xsd as does xml-serialization

843957
long-integer	zero
now i suppose i m being a bit sloppy since many of these examples are actually o n 2 since in python you have to examine the whole number at once time so with a python long-integer of say 100 bytes a + or an or a operation will look at each byte at least once and that will happen over and over until the number is reduced to zero in the scheme outlined above so these again are really o n 2 operations

843963
parentheses	operators
the map expression is in list context so the m operators returns the list of things it matched in any parentheses

843977
external	host
in addition to ekeko s answer if you would like to use an external mail server you must specify the host in the smtpclient constructor

843978
tomahawk	icefaces
for a more independent use have a look at tomahawk and icefaces

843978
tomahawk	icefaces
icefaces allows to integrate tomahawk components although the skinning is not really compatible

843990
hash	md5
if the number of images is not huge then a cryptography hash like md5 should be sufficient

843995
hash	md5
md5 hash wouldn t work if the images were different formats png jpeg etc had different sizes or had different metadata

843999
selected	button
while clicking first finger touch on code you ve selected a number of button appear on the left or right edge of the screen

843999
selected	button
the button that appear should be big enough for easy tapping and only those that are common and applicable to selected code should appear

844000
content-disposition	content-type
maybe you need to set the content-type as text plain or remove a content-disposition header

844004
google-chrome	firefox
the code works perfect in firefox google-chrome safari

844006
firefox	opera
unfortunately all browsers i tested ie8 firefox 3.0.10 opera 9.64 switch based on my local language settings to

844006
textmate	jedit
the same happens if i manually generate the html file using utf-8 tested with textmate respective jedit although both editors display the content correctly

844039
updating	updates
if the code that updates the interface is too slow make sure it is only doing the updating of the interface it should have data already ready

844075
uiresponder	uiview
your solution sounds weird because uiview is itself a uiresponder

844075
uiresponder	uiview
if you have common event handling code why not declare a category on uiview or uiresponder which you will then be able to access from all of your uiview or uiresponder subclasses including uiapplication uiwindow and uicontrol

844086
contains	lookup
your isp s info could show up during this lookup instead of the return address info that your email message contains and thus could be getting blocked

844087
thunderbird	mutt
then do the same with your favorite mail client recommended mutt because thunderbird is slow in strace

844099
contains	elements
i have a wpf windowss where i want a section of at the top of the windows to be just the height of all the elements contains in it

844099
contains	elements
the top section should be the adjustable height section and the bottom section should be just the height needed to display all the elements contains in it

844099
contains	set
the outer grid has two row definitions where the top row is set to auto so that the height is just enough to contains all the elements containsed in it

844099
contains	elements
inside the second row of the outer grid is another grid that should allow for the first row to be flexible for height and the second row to be just tall enough for all the elements contains in it

844101
sendmessage	message
so by calling sendmessage during wm_create i m sending a message to a windows that hasn t been created yet

844101
sendmessage	message
the solution for now is to call sendmessage during the wm_showwindow message

844130
solaris	linux
on solaris and linux it is possible to dynamically load libraries with arbitrary tls requirements using the general dynamic tls model

844133
sql-server	mysql
here s my 6mb compiled game...oh and 68mb mysql installation. or even worse since i m using xna maybe i d need to find a way to bundle sql-server

844139
librsvg	cairo
you can do this with using cairo librsvg python bindings

844147
wordpress	mediawiki
simple press forum is a robust full-featured forum plugin for wordpress and it s fairly easy to integrate mediawiki

844159
json	xml
xml is also okay if you do almost all reading and very little writing although a simpler format such as json might be more efficient depending on what you re doing

844164
execution	exit
another thought while your synchronized block is a good idea it will only hold off other threads from execution those statements until the first thread exit the block

844166
value	field
also it has the advantage of making it easier to distinguish field you assign non-default value to

844188
nsmutablearray	nsarray
if you initialize an nsmutablearray with nsarray s convenience methods as above do you get an nsarray or an nsmutablearray

844201
subclassing	inherited
one great feature of objective-c is that class methods are inherited by subclassing

844201
nsmutablearray	nsarray
and self will be referencing to the class object where the code is executing nsarray or nsmutablearray

844202
selected	textbox
edit i found something a bit like it but there are a couple things that bug me it doesn t selected the whole string we clicking in the textbox and the dropbox doesn t show all options when clicking on the triangle

844223
oracle	mysql
i want to know if all of the major database providers oracle db2 sql server mysql have an api to use for c

844225
webserver	host
now if i could just host a webserver that runs on my windows-mobile device and that webserver could be capable of running a simple dynamic page generation language and some-how writing and reading from a txt file or database of some sort i could access modifiy my tiddlywiki s without having to pay to host them somewhere even if i have to write the backend myself it d be worth it

844229
webserver	upload
my application allows user to upload pdf files and store them on the webserver for later viewing

844241
temporary	rvalue
one of the cool new features of the upcoming c++ standard c++0x are rvalue references. an rvalue reference is similar to an lvalue normal reference except that it can be bound to a temporary value normally a temporary can only be bound to a const reference

844256
temporary	copy
now if you have some rvalue and pass it to toupper the rvalue can directly be modified because we know the temporary is a throw-away thing anyway so we can aswell just change it and don t need to copy it

844256
temporary	rvalue
if you were to say that rvalue can bind to non-const lvalue references then you would have no way to figure out whether that references an lvalue named object or an rvalue temporary in the end

844270
mstest	nunit
ideally i could use nunit or mstest which everone is familiar with

844270
mstest	nunit
what is the simplest way to feed msbuild information to mstest or nunit

844282
one-to-many	entity
assuming that there is a one-to-many inverse relationship between the actor and the movie entities you can just get the entity for chuck norris the same way you would get any specific entity and then access the arrays of movie entities attached to the relationship on the actor entity

844285
32-bit	64bit
if you are using sun s hotspot for x86_64 64bit compiled note that the current implementation only works in server mode that is it precompiles every class it loads with full optimization whereas the 32-bit version also supports client mode which generally postpones optimization and optimizes the most cpu-intensive parts only but has faster start-up times

844285
32-bit	64bit
that being said at least on my machine linux x86_64 with 64bit kernel the 32-bit hotspot version supports both client and server mode via the -client and -server flags but defaults to server mode while the 64bit version only supports server mode

844286
defined	declare
i think you can just declare but not defined the source structures

844286
typedef	struct
typedef struct mytype1 mytype1handle

844297
text-mining	extraction
you must surely check such methods as text categorization auto tagging text-mining automatic keyword extraction

844300
methods	extend
there is and i speak here of the iphone sdk since that s where i have experience a class uitableview that does all the little niceties of creating a table for interaction with the user and it s much more efficient to define a data source for an instance of uitableview than it is to completely subclass uitableview and redefine or extend its methods to customize its behavior

844311
ghostscript	pdfbox
ghostscript and pdftotext can do this the pdfbox is another option

844314
uibutton	uiview
for instance in cocoa-touch the inheritance tree of uibutton is uicontrol uiview uiresponder nsobject

844314
superclass	subclass
also proper use of inheritance requires that the implementer of the subclass has a deep knowledge of the superclass

844314
superclass	subclass
in addition implementation details of the superclass often leak through to the subclass which is a big pain in the for framework builders

844314
python	java
i frequently see application programmers draw lessons from framework designs and trying to apply them to their application code this is common in java c++ and python worlds as well as objective-c

844316
contains	elements
the clientid always contains the id that you can use to access the elements from javascript so the last code always works regardless if the control is in a naming container or not

844345
unique	words
scan the file for words creating a list of unique words

844345
unique	words
after that you ve got a unique list of words for the file and you can build your index off of that

844346
unique	words
the index consists of all unique words that occur in your dataset called a corpus

844348
for-loop	arrays
use a standard c for-loop and start and work backwards through the arrays

844355
webforms	asp.net
in the asp.net webforms environment i might implements this as a lightweight ashx file but for the purposes of simplicity here s an aspx example

844359
value	field
should i always ever never initialize object field to default value

844419
versioning	upgrade
one for an upgrade from versioning .-1 etc

844421
difference	factors
whichever is faster is so negligible in difference that it should never be a factors even if you could reliably determine which is faster which i m not sure you could to any statistically significant level

844423
directory	folder
is there any way to set the initial directory of a folder browser dialog to a non-special folder

844447
struts-1.x	struts
while i ve used struts-1.x a lot i think for a new application you should look at struts 2 spring asp.net-mvc or some other newer framework that leverage new java features such as annotations

844453
contains	any
personally i would simply reject outright any message contains links or email addresses

844454
spring	jsf
to me jsf or spring sound like better options than struts these days

844506
driver	kernel
my reason for wanting to use copyfileex is that i assume it s implemented in the o s kernel with the data being copy from one file to another within the filesystems driver without using user memory let alone managed memory

844519
tapestry	wicket
beyond ones already suggested i would recommend checking out tapestry and wicket many developers like them

844520
groovy	java
i ve been learning groovy grails recently and in terms of developer productivity it seems to be light years ahead of other java solutions spring struts ejb jsf

844526
groovy	java
grails and in particular groovy are very close to java

844526
groovy	java
a few quick lessons in groovy and a java developer and quickly feel at home

844526
groovy	java
i would say that you will see more groovy grails postings in the future as more java shops adopt these technologies

844536
haskell	lisp
i ve recently been learning about functional programming specifically haskell but i ve gone through tutorials on lisp and erlang as well

844563
sql-server	mysql
i like dreamhost but am pretty sure they just provide mysql not sql-server

844569
haskell	sml
you will be gobs more productive especially if you pick a functional language that also has algebraic data types and pattern matching caml sml haskell

844591
value	field
i have a list of objects how can i run a query to give the max value of a field

844623
superclass	inherited
how do i inherited signals defined in superclass

844623
inherited	subclass
which leads me to my question - since moc and signals slots don t seem to know about inherited etc how can i subclass a widget defined somewhere else and get access to the widget s signals

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
then inside touchesbegan touchesmoved etc it checks if it s interested in the event and either handles or passes it on to the inner components

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you won t be able to send touchesbegan to uiscrollview later because you cannot store the touches arguments it contains objects that will be mutated before the next touchesmoved event and you cannot reproduce the old state

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
so you have to pass touchesbegan to uiscrollview immediately but you will hide any further touchesmoved events from it until you decide to scroll horizontally

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
no touchesmoved means no scrolling so this initial touchesbegan will do no harm

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
if that does not work either or results in sloppy visuals you have to override touchesbegan touchesmoved etc and not forwarding diagonal movement events to uiscrollview

844627
any	bag
if you get any of these working and feel like sharing please email me the relevant code at andreyvit gmail.com i d happily include it into my scrollingmadness bag of tricks

844629
32-bit	64bit
tiopf also incudes a number of id generators guids 32-bit and 64bit integers etc

844635
conditional	operators
or nested conditional operators

844637
order	join
i also tried with correlated subquery but it was much slower order of magnitude so i m sticking with the join

844640
jms	jta
really i m most interested in ws-security and jms support possibly jta

844640
glassfish	weblogic
would it be a wise decision to go with lightweight tomcat which i m experienced with or would i be better off with a server that implements the full java ee stack such as jboss weblogic or even glassfish

844641
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu does have this option so many linux distributions probably do

844645
protected	public
i believe that will work if the plot3d rotationchanged signals is public or protected

844649
triggers	insert
create a triggers that fires on insert that checks if a pair already exists with order reversed

844656
click	mouse
the user will use the mouse to click on the screen and the program should make the shape with center where the user click and use previously inputted height and length to draw it

844670
instances	private
it s a visibility modifier â it means that instance-variables declared as private can only be accessed by instances of the same class

844673
if-statement	loops
particularly you d have to write the loops itself and have your own explicit if-statement and those kinds of things

844673
if-statement	loops
like in the code snippet above that s saying take the factors sequence filter it then map it. it s a very high level of thinking which you don t get in an imperative programming language because you re so busy writing the loops and if-statement

844678
subclassing	superclass
i ve seen this format used instead of writing a concrete superclass that subclassing extends

844701
order	add
my issue is enforcing the constraint that you cannot add an artist_grouping entry where the grouping of artists that it contains are the same as an existing grouping ignoring order

844703
protected	public
additionally are the signals public or protected and have you include the appropriate header-files

844719
google-chrome	safari
if i could do that it would allow the code to possibly be ported over to other browsers safari and google-chrome in particular

844723
attributes	properties
oh - is it two much to ask for it to read attributes off a class properties as in .net configuration classes

844735
windows-server	windows
a search for .net 3.5 sdk yields displaylang en which is the download link for windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5

844747
command-line	cmd
using the consolefx cmd-line parsing you can declaratively specify a whole host of conditions for specifying cmd line arguments

844747
boolean	int
run custom validations on switch parameters and non-switch arguments including tests for regular expressions file masks int boolean enums etc

844760
put	get
i think that using that would have certainly cleared up the java.util.stack problem but it can also lead to very deep class hierarchies in order to put ensure that classes get only the methods they are supposed to have

844766
spring	jsf
there are lots of good frameworks out there and you may want to consider instead jsf gwt or spring for example

844784
linked-list	tree
when iterating over the hash table and then over each linked-list contained therein keep a self balancing binary tree std set as a result list

844785
getter	setter
property is just saying there will be a getter and or setter methods for that property name

844797
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
just be sure that 1 the events you send to content view don t bubble back to uiscrollview through the responder chain make sure to handle them all 2 respect the usual flow of touch events touchesbegan than some number of touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended finished with touchesended or touchescancelled especially when dealing with uiscrollview

844811
any	set
to ensure good performance scrolling it s important to avoid transparency in any element if possible - so if you are creating custom cells make them all opaque and set the backgrounds correctly

844829
display	height
and having a single index in the arrays one line of text take up multiple lines on the screen raises some problems for example i had to implement my own movable cursor and when you move the cursor it needs to be able to turn a display line found by dividing touch.x by the line height into a text line an index in the arrays

844832
base-class	inherited
it s that the compiler will forbid you from casting a pointers to a derived class to a pointers to its base-class if the inherited is not public based on the declaration of the class

844834
simpledateformat	date-format
see simpledate-format for quickly constructing a date-format for a certain string representation

844834
parsing	comma
if you want to just capture as a float then float.parsingfloat will do the trick just use string.replace to remove all and comma before you parsing it

844845
assign	add
in word 97-2003 you can add a custom property by going to file properties choosing the custom tab and assign a name and value there

844852
linux	unix
for example on unix linux the normal mechanism will return a line of data - probably the one character you were after and a newline

844862
shell	bash
any chance to get the cursor position by default at the end of the line in bash vi-mode when browsing through the shell history

844882
required	checked
verifying the class required a lot of dependency checked and validation all which cost time and many cpu instructions to be execute

844884
listobject	worksheet
since you already have named ranges you could use a querytable listobject that actually points back to another worksheet in the same workbook

844908
hash	md5
if the data itself is irrelevant you can create a md5 sha1 hash from these values besides the pageid of course

844911
directory	folder
each directory or folder is a namespace

844915
perl	ruby
as for perl ruby too has access to all win32 api and wmi functions

844926
sendmessage	message
use insendmessage or insendmessageex to determine if you are processing a message that was sent by a call to the sendmessage function

844932
unique	words
then any attempt to insert a duplicates word will fail the abort keyword is optional as it s the default for unique -- isn t that what you want given that you say the words must be unique it s an error if they aren t

844943
value	field
i used this approach in wpf to enable binding to a type that stored its value in field as binding to field is not possible

844948
debugging	trace
to check if this is the case put some debugging trace output around the places that manipulate the list and see if it ever and in particular just before the exception runs the manipulation code at the same time as your console output

844953
double-quotes	single-quotes
the markup rules refer to a limited subset of csharp syntax rules declared in codegrammar.cs - those are a subset because spark only needs to recognize enough csharp to adjust single-quotes around strings to double-quotes match curley braces etc

844989
temporary	copy
after lots of refactoring we found the ideal way to insert the data was to load it into a temporary table with the mysql load data infile command do the transformations there and copy the result with multiple insert queries into the actual table insert into .

844999
installation	packaging
good java installation packaging

845010
required	checked
if your application required a queue to be checked every 10 seconds a better strategy might be to have a single long-running scripting that does that checking and uses sleep occasionally to stop itself from hogging systemd resources

845010
daemons	systemd
on a unix systemd such a scripting should really run as a daemons - have a look at the pear systemd_daemons package to see how that can be accomplished simply

845011
priority-queue	heap
nonetheless the efficient way to get the ten highest frequency nodes is to insert each into a priority-queue heap such as the fibonacci heap which has o 1 insertion time and o n deletion time

845045
iteration	elements
on each iteration you insert the next frequency into the heap and if the heap now contains k +1 elements you remove the smallest

845045
contains	elements
this way the heap is maintained at a size of k elements throughout contains at any time the k highest-frequency elements seen so far

845066
ironpython	cpython
i am however no cpython guru and can get so much more out of ironpython than cpython as i can easily leverage the .net platform on which i am far more at home

845076
base-class	inherited
the standard states in 5.4.7 that c-style casts can actually do more than any sequences of new-style casts can do -- specifically including casting from a pointer-to-derived to pointer-to-base even when the base-class is inaccessible which is precisely what happens here with private inherited

845082
conditional	operators
when you use any of the six comparison operators and to compare a node-set the expression will return true if any node in the node-set satisfies the conditional

845096
row	col
i mean the row and col variablesiables which you declared as global missing variables statement

845110
deep-copy	object
i guess the most general way is to clone the object in question either with its own clone mechanism or with deep-copy

845115
row	col
you can optimize this by caching the calculated classes in the as property of jsc.data.cells row col

845116
arrays	loops
you could create a function that gets the size of the arrays loops through it and creating a return arrays which it returns

845138
32-bit	64bit
i m 64bit multiplication here because they are fast enough on modern cpus and i m using the upper 32-bit of hash0 rather than the lower 32 bit because the lower 32-bit are somewhat biased

845144
children	nodes
for the root nodes and element nodess it s to just keep processing children

845144
document	element
so these expression are looking for a document element and a document element respectively

845146
children	nodes
are matching immediate children of the document root rather than descendent nodes

845169
ostringstream	std
alternatively you could use templates and std ostringstream or boost lexical_cast for a very flexible version

845184
order	add
also on the subject of dependencies it is probably best to drop tables first add a decode in your cursor that assigns a lower numeric value to this object type and order the cursor selected by this value

845186
library-project	libs
you can always create a dll dynamic libs-project which calls directly into your static libs and then you can use jna with the new created dll

845228
version-control	sync
from the most loosely coupled just pull a bit of content from sharepoint to full bidirectional sync version-control workflow etc

845229
arrays	loops
this approach would give you the choice to add as much arrayss of lat long as you like to the enclosing arrays and at the same time you can process the inner arrayss no matter what size the outer arrays is with an javascript loops

845237
version-control	bazaar
i believe any modern version-control system subversion and bazaar are the ones i would typically recommend being centralised and distributed respectively can utilise an external diff merge tool

845251
contains	any
is there any database contains us city state zip latitude longitude information

845254
any	set
i have unsorted set of line segments without any binding to each other

845256
contains	elements
on line #11 after the thread.join call the controller.list 0 elements already contains a released com object

845259
revision	svn
prior to and including xp you can find svn revision in the detail view of explorer if you have tortoisesvn installed remember to reboot

845260
visio	dia
edit2 for non-uml diagram sounds like dia is a good open source alternative to visio

845269
gridview	listview
i have a listview wpf control with a gridview

845283
unsigned	integer
it s documented that integer.tohexstring returns a string representation of the integer as an unsigned value - while integer.parseint takes a signed int

845287
any	set
you can enable scrolling by nesting the swfloader in any container based component canvas for example its horizontalscrollpolicy verticalscrollpolicy is set to auto by default

845300
javascript	dom
the first way is scripting the applet with javascript like margus suggests all public methods of the applet object are exposed via the applet s dom object

845350
contains	any
but a lot of the test are not only language specific they also contains some features from the webserver handling postdata etc. are there any other tests to test php as a language

845359
knapsack-problem	np-complete
looks similar to the knapsack-problem which is np-complete so there is not a definitive algorithm

845360
sql-server	oracle
if so what s the best way to test your code to ensure it will work across the main three dbms s sql-server oracle db2

845367
delegation	dealloc
all the nsurlconnection methodss return immediately then work in the background with the idea sending delegation messages to your network controllers as things happenâ but immediately after you finish setting everything up you release the network controllers in turn leaking the connection since you didn t release it in your dealloc methods then exit

845367
delegation	dealloc
don t forget to release that too in your dealloc methods and release it and set it to nil in both of the delegation methodss that indicate the connection is over

845382
subroutine	scoping
just to round it out local-variables are dynamically scoping differing from my variables in that they are also accessible from subroutine called within the same block

845390
highlight	selected
after highlight text i would like to obtain the paragraph in which the selected text resides

845395
detect	move
i think he s asking if the will move backwards one spaces if vim can detect that it s an operator thereby hanging the to the left of the some_class

845407
command-line	cmd
i was wondering whether an alternative might be to invoke the .net share cmd-line cmd however looking at .net help share i don t see how to use it to create a share on a remote computer

845423
stream	send
if it did it would be really slow since the client would send the entire stream get the message from the server that it wasn t authentication then it would have to resend the entire stream with credentials

845427
postgresql	mysql
regardless of whether you use sequences like in postgresql and oracle or if you use another mechanism like auto-increment of mysql

845455
export	report
it would allow you to code the report once but export it to the various formats you need

845456
llvm	gcc
almost all compilers have some sort of internal representation llvm-gcc use llvm and iirc gcc uses something called gimple

845459
ruby-on-rails	django
equally i think it d be negligent of me not to at least look at ruby-on-rails and django

845467
constructor	object
the key is to wrapping c++ interfaces for c is to expose the oo concepts through free functions where the caller explicitly passes the object pointer this to the function and to explicitly expose the constructor and destructor in the same manner

845470
for-loop	loops
since you defined d as always having 1 column then the for-loops is unnecessary since it will only loops once

845476
contains	set
this is the shortest superstring problem find the shortest string that contains a set of given strings as substrings

845484
order	add
you will need to add a reference to the system.management assembly in order to access the wmi classes

845491
arrays	loops
if you have a more generic list of names you can use each which just loops through you arrays

845492
export	report
i want the code to export tables report to excel and word using poi

845494
selected	cell
the offset part says to start at cell a1 move 0 columns across and zero columns down and then selected a range which is b1 columns tall and one column wide

845497
export	csv
if your spreadsheet is very simple then export as csv is acceptable

845562
order	add
in order to get the answers that you probably want you need to add a lot more information to the knowledge base

845570
32-bit	64bit
my java program needs lots of memory to run the 32-bit version of java max out at 1.5 gb my system has 4 gb of ram so i decided to run it under the 64bit version of java and yet the jdic won t work which affects my program so i wonder if anyone knows when the 64bit jdic will be available

845571
oracle	mysql
is there a sql command that will list all the tables in a database and which is provider independent works on mssqlserver oracle mysql

845577
silverlight	wpf
i found a solution for wpf xaml but silverlight apparently doesn t support the syntax and the solution i found required that the definitions be in the c# file

845581

firebird	oracle
some brands of database oracle ibm db2 firebird derby etc

845583
hide	show
i have the code below that hide and show the navigation bar

845614
symlink	archive
if like me you are using an older tar and you are certain that the archive does not contains a directory or file named wordpress wordpress you could always just make a symlink from wordpress to

845637
diagonal	weight
if you want a more sensible path you need to tell the algorithm that some paths are more desirable than others effectively weight horizontal vertical as better than diagonal

845656
json	xml
json is just a nice way to transmit data esp when sending to a webpage as it can be more compact than xml and javascript can parse json faster than xml since json is made for javascript

845663
tripledes	aes
tripledes is a very good option but you can also consider aescryptoserviceprovider aes which is a modern symmetric cipher

845701
alt	src

845706
subproject	libs
i have several active projects and each has subproject libs which gets compiled when the main project compiles

845713
binary	hex
maybe you are looking for functions that display integers as a string - using hex binary or decimal representations

845716
put	get
if you want to get the ascii value of a character in your code just put the character in quotes

845719
binary	hex
there are manipulators for hex and decimal dec but unfortunately not for binary

845720
binary	hex
as far as hex binary - those are just representations of integers

845720
decimal	hex
what you probably want is something like printf d n and printf x n - the first prints the decimal the second the hex version of the same number

845721
required	checked
callvirt on the other hand checked for not null and throws a nullreferenceexception if required

845733

845760
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
look closely at using icommand inotifypropertychanged the observablecollection

845794
scrollbar	margin
you could work around this issue by doing what brianpeiris suggests add margin for the scrollbar and adding an overflow-x hidden

845799
contains	sorted
i realize that given the coordinates of the square and a sorted list of plot points the contains plot points are easy to compute

845816
deep-copy	object
imagine for example what would happen if your deep-copy duplicated object which held handles to os-managed resources like sql connections sockets custom gdi brushes and so on

845821
perl	php
i can t for python ruby perl php

845827
jxtreetable	swingx
other than that swingx has a filtering api which ll work on jxtable jxtreetable jxtree and jxlist

845833
firefox	safari
i would suggest getting it to work on firefox 3 and safari first then once it is working go back and add in the code to get it to work on ie8 and if you want ie7 since ms is pushing ie8 out as a critical update now

845841
put	get
you could either put your server process into the grouping so that the whole system with all its users fall under the limits or get the server to put each new session into a new grouping

845848
firefox	opera
of course it works in firefox and opera

845911
xsd	xml
for example the transformation of the memory representation is in xml then one can say that you are casting to the type defined by the corresponding xsd grammar of that xml file

845933
exp	pow
while pow base exp is a great suggestion be aware that it typically works in floating-point

845955
jar	war
if what you are deploying are packaged components dll jar war ... it is wise to organize the code library as a collection of packaged set of files

845955
jar	war
that way you will develop directly with the -- dll jar war .

845973
credentials	security
i wonder if user credentials are passed for every single service method call or if some kind of security token is being used for subsequent service method calls

845975
ruby	php
javascript doesn t parse string literals looking for replacement markers like ruby or php does

845979
double	int
with n being an int because it doesn t know which of float double or long double version it should take and you would get an ambiguity error

845998
cosine	sine
in opengl-es there s no built-in way to draw a circle so use sine and cosine to build your circles out of line segments

846001
licensing	eula
assuming you are talking about licensing not a eula you can put the license outside

846006
google-webmaster-tools	sitemap
i ve tried uploading a sitemap and other things to google-webmaster-tools but with no luck

846012
perl	ruby
so sure ruby python perl vbscript etc can do the job why not choose the tool best for the job

846018
assembly	lua
there are also a large family of languages such as smalltalk java and lua which compile to bytecode not assembly code but whose implementations may later translate that bytecode directly to machine code without benefit of an assembler

846027
silverlight	wpf
lots of great stuff on flex silverlight wpf surface and ux design

846033
libcurl	openssl
this needs to be linked against openssl -lssl but doesn t need libcurl at all

846036
vbscript	jscript
i ve been hunting for a modern replacement for jscript vbscript

846063
unsigned	integer
usually you d pack such an integer into a full 32-bit a c unsigned long and use but skip the step

846079
google-chrome	opera
then again opera safari google-chrome all have limited or no support for event handlers on options too

846086
adplus	dump
aside from this i d guess i d take a look at using adplus to get a crash dump of the apppool process and then run through it in windbg to see what comes up

846087
constructor	object
q2 - one constructor overload of principalpermission object also specifies a isauthenticated flag that tells demand to verify if user is authenticated

846095
python	c++
there are no efficiency guarantees on python res any more than on any other part of the language c++ s standard library is the only widespread language standard i know that tries to establish such standards -- but there are no standards even in c++ specifying that say multiplying two ints must take constant time or anything like that

846095
interpreter	runtime
lundh originally responsible for implementing python current re module etc presenting unladen swallow at pycon italia mentioned that one of the avenues they ll be exploring is to compile regular expressions directly to llvm intermediate code rather than their own bytecode flavor to be interpreter by an ad-hoc runtime -- since ordinary python code is also getting compiled to llvm in a soon-forthcoming release of unladen swallow a re and its surrounding python code could then be optimized together even in quite aggressive ways sometimes

846111
compile-time	hardcode
basically if your compiler can work out what you mean or what a value is at compile-time it can hardcode this into the runtime code

846116
jasper-reports	itext
i think that itext is still better for report creation it is more straightforward i had some less than enough experience with jasper-reports and it seemed clumsy

846144
textbox	button
i could add a bunch of textbox and have a button that does for each but this feels like reinventing the wheel

846151
python	java
your experience in ruby will make it easy to pick up python dynamic concepts which might be harder to get used to for say a java programmer

846154
python	ruby
i suggest just diving into python it s similar to ruby so you should have no problems

846168
python	ruby
after running through some tutorials on-line the ones posted so far look pretty good find a current ruby project you ve done or are working on and re-write it in python

846174
value	field
then look at the xml of the actual document you re working with and trace the content to make sure you re not accidentally editing hexadecimal value aaa and eee could be hex value in other field

846175
buffering	streaming
streaming buffering 1 abc.........stack

846175
buffering	streaming
streaming buffering 2 overflow.......xyz

846175
buffering	streaming
how can i modify this code so that it correctly finds the given search string across the boundary of the buffering but without loading the entire streaming into memory

846193
arrays	loops
i think any solution involving arrays in a loops will consume memory on the heap and require gc

846194
order	add
in order to link to an archive library sometimes also called static library just add it to the link line

846201
postgresql	mysql
my application works on sqllite mysql and postgresql so i need fairly standard sql

846204
hierarchical-data	nested-set-model
i used the nested-set-model of representing hierarchical-data in a relational-database

846231
ruby-on-rails	django
most of the companies require ruby-on-rails or django experience

846231
ruby-on-rails	django
the number of organizations working with ruby-on-rails is greater than django

846249
positioning	slider
the reverse function would with the same definitions for minp maxp minv maxv and scale calculate a slider positioning from a value like this

846250
declarative	imperative
and here s the bad news you may still need to perform a declarative or imperative access check -- just having the entries in the web-config files may not work

846250
contains	elements
you do not need to add an httphandler elements to your web.config because the machine level web.config already contains this entry

846261
display	height
i found that listbox.height returns the display height of the listbox even if it is docked

846266
ruby-on-rails	django
once you re thoroughly familiar with ruby on ruby-on-rails and have been working for a bit continue learning django

846266
ruby-on-rails	django
django s inner guts are supposedly easier to dissect than that of ruby-on-rails

846266
ruby-on-rails	django
verdict django first do the tutorial then ruby-on-rails then django again

846271
contains	elements
i need someone to explain to me where this extra padding is coming from on divs that contains img elements

846271
firefox	opera
safari firefox and opera render roughly 6 pixels of unwanted bottom padding on the container div

846271
pixels	line
if i format my code so that each image is on it s own line in my html file an additional 6 pixels of right padding are added to each image

846271
firefox	opera
obviously safari firefox and opera are rendering my carriage return between span tags as whitespace

846275
zend-framework	codeigniter
you might however feel more in control with a framework such as the zend-framework cakephp or codeigniter

846304
oracle	mysql
hierarchical queries in mysql - emulating oracle s connect by

846304
postgresql	mysql
if you want this to be portable betwen postgresql and mysql you can use postgresql s contrib for connect by and wrap the query into a stored procedure with same name for both systems

846326
constructor	object
the factory approach has the advantage of separating construction from usage and more easily allowing alternative implementations but you then need to expose setters or pass in a whole bunch of object to the constructor that constitute it s state

846329
any	set
since the 2008xxxx versions of fitnesse any page that starts or ends with test is automatically set to be a test page and any page starting or ending in suite is set to be a suite

846355
managed-code	unmanaged
i further assume that some or all of those managed-code capabilities are unavailable to unmanaged applications

846356
innodb	myisam
if you re using innodb tables for acid or just because at more than 30 million rows myisam tables tend to get crappy yes a straight one-table selected is probably faster than in postgresql

846356
postgresql	mysql
as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysql s bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysql for any even slightly complicated query

846360
contains	any
c++ does not contains any built-in

846360
environment	execution
execution environment

846365
populate	row
when a row is selected in nstableview1 nstableview2 is populate and the first row in it is selected

having	select
i would like it so that i can select a row in nstableview1 and populate nstableview2 without having a row automatically selected in nstableview2

846370
cakephp	symfony
what i have personally found is that the zend framework is primarily being used to build internal websites much like cakephp and symfony

846395
value	field
i have considered using a checkbox to control the enabling of this field but there is still the issue of display an initial value

846409
configuration	installation
we would also not like to have to provide installation configuration documentation for every application server and version that we support so it would be nice if we could accomplish this in-code

846417
mouseover	mouseout
i am trying to create a simple mouseover effect using a combination of mouseover mouseout addclass and removeclass

846423
any	set
generally we don t have signeridentity in any of the app store applications we build so checking for nil then performing set instructions should make it more difficult for crackers and pirates

846427
google-chrome	firefox
it does however work for me in google-chrome firefox safari and opera

846433
tripledes	des
what i have read about tripledes is that since des is easily crackable tripledes is still not substantial

846443
firebird	bde
still wouldn t work as paris so i found a jason comment in the sources that revealed that the aliasname property of tconnection was for the bde alias not the firebird alias so i set the property to blank

846463
attr	src
this attr src src.replace .jpg i .flv

846487
rfc	iri
the documentation also states that activating this iri mode and thus the rfc 3986 behavior means adding a uri section element to machine.config and this to your app web-config file

846493
margins	padding
css isn t that complicated everything is basically a box with a width height padding margins

846520
perl	awk
there is also an intermediate case in which the program is compiled to bytecode and run immediately as in awk or perl

846550
radio-button	button
use each radio-button s onclick event to call a function that calls submit on the submit button

846553
jquery	dojo
firstly it s probably worth perusing which javascript framework jquery vs dojo vs â

846557
jquery	dojo
here are benchmarks of mootools jquery prototype yui and dojo on different browsers

846561
widget	button
primarily it s a user-interface library meaning it exists to provide you with functional user-interface widget button tree panels dialog etc

846589
contains	any
turns out that the object files contains the static initializers were not include by the linker because nothing referenced any functions in them

846604
dictionary	arrays
if when i passed a variable obj from the controller to the view it was an object that i can ask questions to duck- quack rather than having it be an arrays dictionary duck duck quack true this would be easy

846608
emacs	vim
so far i was using plain vim only as a text editor and a bunch of shell scripts and one day i decided i would try emacs

846625
boost-graph	graphviz
boost-graph also has a binary component that is only needed if you intend to parsing graphviz files

846627
python	php
if you are using php to do this job switch the parsing to python since it is way faster than php on this matters this exchange should speed up the process by 75 or even more

846640
histogram	plot
gle supports various graph types function plot histogram bar graphs scatter plot contour lines color maps surface plot ... .

846649
shared-objects	.so
dlls shared-objects .so .dll

846669
fieldset	labels
you can then add your layout using css to the fieldset labels and input elements specifically

846682
selected	cells
i know there is trick to show the whole arrays in the spreadsheet by selected a range of cells with the formula + f2 + ctrl+shift+enter but i would prefer vba to handle it all

846725
contains	set
set cul - highlights the line contains the cursor

846728
dfa	nfa
the nfa you want is just the dfa for the string preceded with a state that nondeterministically either drops a character or tries to consume the current character

846729
exception-handling	try-catch
you need to loop through all the methodss in the multicast delegate using delegatename.getinvocationlist and use a try-catch block inside the loop to catch the exception-handling and continue with the next methods invocation

846775
credentials	account
consider a scenario that user working on page20 with his account credentials

846791
firefox	safari
transparency supported in firefox safari ie7+

846798
required	checked
note that the double null checked aren t required because of the way null comparisons are handled in c#

846805
selected	checkbox
i have created a table in my application i want to selected change background color whole row on click of a checkbox same as gmail is doing when we click checkbox in gmail the whole row becomes yellow

846823
any	set
if your intercept is called while the flag is set only call the back-end heapalloc code without doing any of the other stuff including calling dbghelp which is what s causing your infinite recursion

846842
copy-constructor	constructor
the move constructor acts like the copy-constructor but it is defined to take an r-value reference rather than an l-value const reference

846842
temporary	copy
it is allowed to use r-value semantics to move the data out of the temporary created in create_vector and push them into the argument to consume_vector without doing an expensive copy of all of the data in the vector

846851
contains	set
next perform a data dump for the set of tables that contains configuration required for your application to operate should probably skip user data etc like form defaults and other data non-user modifiable data

846852
required	checked
it checked the new value of the checkbox and adds or removes the class as required

846860
oracle	mysql
it looks like they added support for oracle using sys_guid a while back but the documentation still says they only support sql server and mysql

846869
contains	any
what i mean by this is transform every string like bla bla bla + to something like string that is deterministic and does not contains any characters that may confuse my parsing because i don t care about the value of the strings

846869
any	set
is the assumption of double-occurrence or any set of two characters to escape enough

846886
perl	ruby
when you are building your regexp make sure to match comments so your regexp substitution won t touch strings inside comments and regular expression literals in perl ruby and javascript and pay attention you match backslashes and newlines properly in perl and ruby a string can contain a newline

846917
digits	zero
you can specify the behavior if it s exactly equidistant between two possibilities such as rounding so that the final digits is even round 2.5 midpointrounding.toeven becoming 2 or so that it s further away from zero round 2.5 midpointrounding.awayfromzero becoming 3

846928
digits	zero
if digits is zero this kind of rounding is sometimes called rounding toward zero

swing	swt
mixing swing and swt isn t the best thing to do but if you have no options it s not a terribly difficult beast to slay

846968
swing	swt
keep all dialogs in swing don t use a mix of both if there is no reason to use naming conventions to differentiate between swing and swt components etc

846968
swing	swt
make sure you re well aware of the way that swing and swt components are handled by the os jvm before you start tackling any complex ui issues

846968
swing	swt
one thing to watch out for is drag and drop between swing and swt components

846974
value	field
however if i am passing blank value of the field mysql seems to insert them

846982
value	field
the only value you shouldn t be able to put in a not null field is hang on trying to remember .

847230
ironpython	cpython
now in cpython the signals module is a built-in as far as i can remember it could possibly be that ironpython has not implemented it in fact a quick google and look on ironpython s site leads to this ironpython and cpython difference read it in particular the extension modules part

if i selected the same file more than once no new button appears this is correct

847289
scheme	let
i like your second scheme a little better - catch a known set of exception-handling ideally because they are the only ones your code will throw and let the rest through - allowing the app to crash is possibly the best thing to do since you have invoked unknown behaviour it is best to crash responsibly

without more detail i can t suggest where to put it or what other properties to set to get the desired effect eg floats float down around following content so put it at the beginning of a paragraph

847655
enumerator	any
not use it any more you can implement a clone function that takes the original enumerator and uses it as the source for one or more enumerators

847660
selected	cells
if you then selected two adjacent cells in your worksheet enter and press control+shift+enter to apply as an arrays formula then you should see your desired output

required	checked
at best detecting a sink required you to either identify the node and checked that it has no outgoing edges or inspect every other node and see that none of them have connections coming from it

847688
python	c++
a big plus for boost python is that it allows for tab completion in the ipython shell you import a c++ class exposed by boost directly or you subclass it and from then on it really behaves like a pure python class

847698
contains	elements
does anyone have any ideas how to get the accordion control in the asp.net ajax control toolkit to automatically resize so that it fills the div elements it is contains in and will react to that elements being resized

847808
multiplication	addition
in essence matlab implicitly expands the scalar into an arrays of the same size as its partner in the addition or multiplication and then performs the operation

847811
json	xml
unfortunately most people seem to punt on the media type decision and choose generic application json or application xml and then use downloaded javascript in the browser to interpret the format. 1 that works as long as the only client you have is a browser and you don t want anyone else to re-use your interface

847811
json	xml
to further explain what i mean by this consider the case where you deliver application json or application xml to a client application

847841
variables	boolean
there is no need to manage your own variables either an incrementing counter or a boolean

847851

environment	building
the official release that i provide to the testing team and eventually to the customer is always taken from the building machine not from the developer s environment

847943
assign	add
that s why you can assign a to a but not the other way around it s clearly safe to add const -ness to a simple pointers but it would be dangerous to take it away

847956

847956
arguments	default
a tuples of four things is returned arguments vararguments varkw default

right click and format each column as a number with 3 digits and leading zero

847989
getter	setter
the most elegant way of doing this is to use implicit getter and setter

848005
json	xml
you just need to decorate your classes or methods with the attribute and they will automatically be exposed as json or xml depending on the client

848013
children	nodes
this is admittedly a rudimentary methods for obtaining the list of distinct nodes names for the book nodes s children but you didn t specify much else in the way of your environment if you have 3.5 you could use linq to xml to make this a little prettier for example but this should get the job done regardless of your environment

848027
debian-based	linux
it s standard for debian-based linux distributions but according to this page it can be added really easily to any other

848039
for-loop	loops
the scope of the variable in the test of the while loops is wider than the scope of variables declared in the header of the for-loops

848045

its part of my url re-writing for an asp.net webforms site

848068
perl	php

848073
.when	ready
use a thread and send a signals to the main thread .when the content is ready

848082

bizarrely the stack collection seems to be missing the rather basic shift and unshift methods and i m working in 2.0 so i can t just extend them

848088
jquery	.post
tried the idea of using an anonymous function for scoping from another jquery .post

848091
debian	linux
edit server is a debian linux box running php5 through suphp

848091
ip-address	proxy
it doesn t matter if we pick up the proxy address once we can get some ip-address for the access

848093
order	add
you could create an extra temp column in a wrapped selected around all your sql to allow you to add an artificial order

848121
.when	ready
.when changes are ready and tested run your scripting in qa this will validate your scripting and install procedure

848121
.when	ready
.when ready run your scripting and install procedure on production

848121
contains	any
dev contains any work in progress changes extra debugging junk etc

848131
pixels	line
the gap between the line may be due to the 2nd line failing a depth test on pixels that have been alpha blended with the background

848149
for-loop	loops
compilers that optimize using loops unrolling will probably only do so in the for-loops case

848150
sql-server	mysql
different databases such as sql-server and mysql have different methods of handling paging which is basically what you are wanting to accomplish

848156
sql-server	oracle
in a weird case that you want to return a specific row that would change depending on the database you are using you can use a combination of rownumber in oracle or top in sql-server

848158

848161
subtract	add
a crc is simply division just like you learn long-hand division in grade school except that add and subtract are replaced with xor

848165
inherited	subclass
this being said my impression of adc s emphasis against subclassing is not putting forth a case for designing an application s class hierarchy without inherited but instead to point out that in the new way of doing things ie osx there are in most cases more appropriate means to go about customizing standard behavior without needing to subclass

848172
command-line	cmd
...the other methods is a dsquery from the cmd-line using the following cmd you should be able to retrieve most attributes which remain in the tombstone everything in one line just keep in mind that this query will not necessarily return all attributes which are preserved in a tombstone - some critical objects and changes of the list are hardcoded and will remain in the tombstone no matter what the searchflags state

848177
myeclipse	rad
simply put if you re using maven should you treat the maven layout as the gold standard or should you convert your layout to fit your tooling wasd myeclipse rad etc.

848182
triggers	insert
as an alternative you could create an update triggers that copies the identity field to the doc_order field after an insert

848191
expression-blend	wpf
expression-blend may suffer a bit depending on your hardware and drivers as wpf is a little more demanding of visual goo than most other development tools for windows forms

848229
contains	set
my indexed documents have a field contains a pipe-delimited set of ids

848230
textbox	onblur
however using onblur won t necessarily tell you about changes in the textbox and onchange s browser coverage is spotty at best

848233
triggers	insert
one solution would be to have two columns once call initialorder that is an auto-increment identity-column and then a second column called doc_order that initially is set to the same value as the initialorder field perhaps even as part of the insert triggers or a stored procedure if you are doing inserts that way but give the user the ability to edit that column

848233
sequences	unique
also i am not sure if your doc_order needs to be unique or not but if not you can then sort return value by doc_order and initialorder to ensure a consistent return sequences

848234
macros	let
don t let the macros are evil mantra hide this fact from you macros are designed to generate repetitive code

848246
python	java
however it is only available in javascript python java and c++ not vba

848246
vb.net	vba
one option i considered was to compile the javascript or java source using the .net compilers jscript.net or j# use reflector to output as vb.net then finally downgrade the vb.net code manually to vba giving me a pure vba solution

848246
delta	diff
here s the code that interpreter the diff and formats the delta cell

848267
fixnum	hash
you re well off the mark but it appears to be doing something because hash is a builtin function which returns a fixnum hashcode for the object

848269
boost	stl
are there any bridges to make mixing qt with stl and boost as seamless and easy as possible

848270
javascript	dom

848364
openbsd	linux
edit whilst this seems to be true for openbsd according to the man page the linux man page differs considerably and so getsockname after accept on linux is almost certainly unuseful

848375
execute	declare
the reson is that sql statements are execute by a different engine which can only see publicly declare functions

848390
nested	order
one set for the column to order by and nested set for whethers it s asc or desc

848400
ubuntu	linux

848508
m2crypto	openssl
though m2crypto is built again python setup.py install i still see that it points to old version of openssl

848513
imagemagick	pdftk
i have stumbled across pdftk which seems to have a better quality after the merging but i need to use imagemagick if possible because i need to get the script to run on another server which does not have pdftk and it would be a pain to get it on there

848524
key-value	key
the trick is that the value for with is a javascript expression that should return a key-value pair in the url format like key value

848565
font-size	width
where 0.32 is an estimated width of a typical character using my current font-size

848568
lookup	any
if i had a bean for websitesettings i d like to have some lookup process where the application could ask for the bean and be given an instances of it and any updates to the bean s properties value are also available to any other machines in the cluster websitesettings.getgreeting would return the same value on all n machines whenever it was updates

848584
arguments	default
this allows you to set up default for binary flags and name value arguments and give them descriptions so that a formatted help message can be display

848586
children	tree
draw the tree in the obvious way with items at each level at the same horizontal level and their ancestors children below above them respectively

848600
contains	any
i am not sure because i do not use any explicit seialization myself i m just putting a dataset contains a datatable with no rows into session which is saved restored out-of-process

848606
value	field
i ve never done this but based on reading a bit of the relevant code i d start by looking into creating an instance of django.core.files.base.contentfile and assigning that as the value of the field

848613
standard-library	boost
the best guide to some of the boost libraries is the book beyond the c++ standard-library

848613
tuples	any
also unless you have lots of experience with c++ i d start with the simpler libraries smart_ptr tuples conversion tokenize regex date_time test before trying the more complicated ones bind variant any or the really advanced ones concepts mpl fusion

848634
worksheet	excel
excelmapper is an open source tool that can be used to read excel worksheet as strongly typed objects

848634
xlsx	xls
it supports both xls and xlsx formats

848649
nsmutablearray	nsarray
cocoa provides several arrays classes nsarray nsmutablearray a subclass of nsarray and nspointerarrays

848655
selected	button
i have several rows and i need to trigger an action when user selected a row and click a button

848663
value	field
it uses a list comprehension over the class-level fields attributes looking up the instance value for each field by name and then left-justifying it s output according to the columns

848669
attributes	properties
i m tying to collect all custom attributes placed over a properties

848669
attributes	properties
there are more than one attributess of the same type assigned to the properties but when collecting them the resulting collection only contains the first attributes of the specific type

848669
attributes	properties
so does allowmultiple not work for properties attributes

848684
droppable	draggable
this uses both draggable and droppable

848684
droppable	draggable
when dragging starts the draggable creates a function to specify where to insert the droppable that the item gets dropped on

848699
.when	ready
it should be something like .when it s ready hopefully sometime this week

848702
value	field
some of our columns are going to contains datetime value and we need to properly format these date time field

848714
revision	svn
this has prevented me from porting the repository with all revision in tact from a local network windows-server visualsvn hosting to a public linux svn hosting

848727
any	set
we could take any two infinite sets t p s.t t+u the set of integers and take s t+ -t r u+ -u

848750
antivirus	mcafee
it works properly on dev box which contains similar configuration but without a mcafee antivirus software on it

848752
decrement	increment
when the width decrement to zero swap the image with it s flipped versioning and start increment the width

848769
nvidia	ati
according to the release description here it supports only nvidia and ati cards which means anyone not using those cards may have a problem

848781

and the next call show yellow fade the dom elment with box id

848798
forwarding	port
or access any files at home if i forwarding the port to the visual svn server.

848799
entity-framework	ado.net
is is possible with ado.net entity-framework

848806
put	get
one thing i see is that we don t need representations for every resource and we don t need to support all operations get put post delete on all resources either

848810
http	ssl
i m not an cocoa touch developer but i think http authentication over ssl would be easy to implement and it s probably exactly what you re looking for

848810
http	ssl
all you need to do is setup http authentication on the server side you haven t mentioned what you re using on the server side and create a self-signed ssl cert on your webserver

848830
hosts-file	hosts
another attack you should be aware of is people settings the hosts to a location they control and then installing a root certificate that allows them to provide a signature for that domain

848894
put	get
http provides methods to get post put and delete a resource

848894
json	xml
so you could reuse the same url you use for html output to get xml json in a way that http was meant to be used

848894
json	xml
support object to json xml etc

848896
configuration	logging
on the other hand you could have the centralized logging service that has its own logging configuration and lets you manage this in a single place

848896
jar	war
you can share the library by placing the jar inside each war or inside the ear

848912
web-services	api
then use the interactive shell to experiment with the web-services api

848912
any	set
set it up so that it can deploy under any given folder

848912
directory	folder
parameterised by the server name and directory off the command-line the application can deploy a report and connect its data sources to the one under the data sources folder

848914
perl	awk
i can use awk sed an outdated version of perl on the server

848929
while-loop	loops
the while-loops will loops through the results and assign a row to row until you run out of rows

848939
keyboard	mouse
it allows you to set keyboard and mouse hooks from java on windows

848947
jar	war
is there a way to make maven calculate common dependencies and place them to ear just as he is able to calculate all transitional dependencies when constructing a war or a jar

848963
expectations	assertions
in such cases if you re using a dependency-injection approach you can pass in mocks of those dependencies and use assertions or expectations to make sure that the correct methods are called on the dependencies with the correct parameters

848989
modifiers	final
the other reason seems to be that lazy-loading wonâ t give me the advantage of using the final modifiers to enforce immutability of order fields

848997
visualsvn	collabnet
collabnet works great but it doesn t have the visual interfaces for management that are include in visualsvn

848997
command-line	cmd
if they are not important to you and you re comfortable using standard svn command-line cmd collabnet is a nice option

848998
visualsvn	collabnet
i d say the biggest difference is that you have to configure the collabnet s server package manually while visualsvn comes with a nice user-interface where you can do the configuration

849015
value	field
an event doesn t expose the field and its value - it just exposes a subscription methods and an unsubscription methods in a similar way to how properties just expose a getter and a setter

849035
constructor	object
another suggestion is that maybe instead of instantiating it using the constructor you can clone the object and then modify the fields appropriately for the new object

849039
web-config	app-config
edit i m referring to the service s web-config file not the client web-config app-config

849040
getter	setter
in scenariomaster i would declare a set or list with public getter setter like

849040
updating	updates
this however creates a strage updates statement when updating an already persitant scenariomaster entity using session.saveorupdates scenariomaster

849042
data-structures	tree
i have a project for my data-structures class which is a file compressor that works using binary tree and other stuff

849052
perl	awk
i suggest you a programm written in perl as i am not a sed awk guru and i don t what they are exactly capable of

849053
duplicates	elements
the quickest methods is likely to be reading in the file using an xmlreader and simply replicating each read node to a new stream using xmlwriter when you get to the point at which you encounter the closing tag then you just need to output your additional elements before coninuing the read and duplicates cycle

849053
streamreader	streamwriter
admittedly using streamreader streamwriter would be somewhat faster still but pretty horrible to work with in code

849068
attributes	properties
the name properties - for the value of the attributes foo

849068
attributes	properties
the as_attributes flag of the name properties should indicate that it is an xml attributes

849075
oracle	mysql
the query should be run under mysql and oracle therefore standard sql should be used

849080
superclass	inherited
another way to do this is using oo inherited put functionality that s common to both versions in a superclass and then create separate subclasses which define the specializations of the superclass for each of your versions

849080
superclass	subclass
you can then build your superclass es as a shared library and build each specialized subclass in separate assemblies which reference the common shared library

849082
mocking	stubs
once you have separated the hardware from the software and you are not directly dependent upon the hardware you can use a mocking framework to write mocks or stubs that pretend like iprojector is real hardware

849111
expression	evaluation
expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable lazy evaluation when that is appropriate -- eigen takes care of this automatically and handles aliasing too in most cases

849130
lighttpd	apache
but my friend said that first there was apache + bunch of mongrels and then lighttpd and then nginx and now passenger and it seems endless.

849155
radio-button	selected
all i want to do is require that a checkbox is selected and a radio-button but i don t care which one is required

849179
contains	set
if the caller wants to display a list of order dates total cost and shipment statuses then i d return a set of objects contains that data

849187
javascript	dom
and firebug a firefox extension to debug my javascript and dom

849215
ruby-enterprise-edition	passenger
in all seriousness phusion passenger and ruby-enterprise-edition have taken out pretty much all of the pain of moving a ruby-on-rails app into production

849219
common-lisp	scheme
paredit sounds like it would handle the parenthesis part of your need with the caveat that it was designed for common-lisp and scheme

849226
selected	checkbox
you can use radio and checkbox as a shortcut for selected all radios and checkbox in a form

849233
debugging	trace
debugging is good for logging particular occasions of something while trace is better used for dumping method calls parameters and stuff like this

849238
library-project	libs
when compiling the static libs no error is detected but when i try to use the libs-project file in the main project i get these type of errors

849259
javascript-framework	dojo
dojo file upload progress bar widget is another option using the dojo javascript-framework

849268
updating	updates
for updates nowait statement to lock the rows you will be updating

849280
google-chrome	firefox
firefox opera and google-chrome function properly but ie does not and surprisingly neither does safari

849308
push	pull
what i would like to is for git to always pull from and push to all the computers it can currently connect to so it s easier to jump from one machine to the other and continue working seamlessly

849311
contains	set
i think you want a control that can contains other controls â like tpanel can do â and a control that can display the contents of the windows underneath it â like timage can do when its transparent property is set

849311
put	get
it appears you are under the mistaken impression that if you put one control on top of another you ll get the behavior of both combined

849328
order	add
the first step for me is to figure out how to iterate through all the references in the current project developers using this tool will add their dlls to the project as references and identify the activeinstance classes in order to fill a dropdown full of types to inspect

849330
compact-framework	.net
i am using the .net compact-framework 3.5

json	xml
i agree with other poster in that xstream is not a good fit -- it s an oxm object xml mapper and json is handled as a secondary output format using xml processing path

849495
json	xml
this is why a convention of how to convert hierarchich xml model into object-graph model of json and vice versa is needed

849495
json	xml
that works ok if xml is your primary data format and you just need some rudimentary json -like support

849495
json	xml
also even if you do need to support both xml and json you are imo better off using separate libraries for these tasks -- objects beans to use on server-side need not be different just serialization libs that convert to from xml and json

849500
arrays	loops
this is going to include field in the loops and will encounter problems when it tries to access it as an arrays

849500

849692
cyclomatic-complexity	lines-of-code
i tend to look at the cyclomatic-complexity of each member instead of number of lines-of-code for the entire class

849699
click	mouse
please remember you can disable a breakpoint - it might be easier more efficient cleaner then adding debugging flags to your code and recompiling for example to just disable the second breakpoint wait till the first one breaks and then enable the second one in your breakpoints windows - it takes just two mouse click each time you debugging.

dictionary	map
i d use a dictionary to map between internal development numbers and external release numbers then use the internal development numbers internally and only expose the release numbers when you re ready to release it out of development

850202
value	field
but i think it would be better to make an specific query wich returns in a field the max value you want and bind this query to your gridview

850216
linux	unix
ctrl- is the unix linux equivalent of windows ctrl-break

850216
telnet	ssh
wikipedia also tells me that you can also use ctrl-4 or sysrq on the linux virtual console i guess you d need something weird for a normal terminal emulator to pass representations of those key presses over ssh telnet

i ve solved this problem with sockets using objectinputstream and objectoutputstream for serialization commands

850299
required	checked
a is 100 only going to include only non-virtual members no virtual table required and there is no need for a typeid checked

850341
integer	zero
i just learned the hard way that javascript thinks the leading zero indicates an octal integer and since there is no 8 or 9 in base-8 the function returns zero

850355
arrays	loops
there are 75 arrays functions in php let s try to use them instead of for loops

850362

850423
constructor	object
you can t object are created when the arrays is allocated and in the absence of a trivial constructor your compiler will complain

850434
project-management	project
the other approach could be the use of google email docs and calendar - a free friendly way of team interaction....i would shy away from issue bug tracking tools for project-management - they tend to have differ on focus pm tools on the entire project resource timeline and issue tracking tools for specific entered issues..

850456
button	slide
your user-interface really should only be concerned with user-interface events and pass any processing to another layer the only thing then left to test in your user-interface would be graphical responses such as when you click a button does a panel slide in from the side and the only good way to test interactions like that is to actually do the clicking

850461
selected	button
you can also get to the project properties tab-book by selected the project node in the solution explorer and then clicking on the top-left hand toolbar button in solution explorer windows

850463
calling-convention	extern-c
you have declared your function as extern-c which means it uses cdecl as its calling-convention

850571
integration-testing	automated-tests
a large part of my job involves checking over the state of the project s automated-tests mainly unit integration-testing

850585
any	set
so with that said let me first point out that the workload you re talking about -- 2500 inserts sec rare queries queries likely to have result sets of up to 10 percent of the whole data set -- is just about pessimal for any relational data base system

850603
row	col
i want to use an expression to set the value cell col 2 row 2 of the matrix to have either no border or a double border on the bottom

850603

it stops listening for onkeyup events it still registers onkeydown

850693
hosts-file	hosts
well you best bet is to put two entries in your hosts with your domain name

the revision specification contains a set of positive references starting points and negative references stopping points and additional filtering limit number of revision grep commit text etc.

850696
silverlight	wpf
you could try some complicated mix of silverlight + .net but then it would be silly to use silverlight when the whole .net wpf platform is available

850705
command-line	cmd
if you have cmd-line access you could try the at cmd which is like an ultra-light cron

850777
nyromodal	jquery
this entire form is actually inside a nyromodal jquery plugin model popup window

850777
input-field	textbox
when that validates and works i just hide show some elements within the updatepanel to show the user the next page of the form which is all the price textbox input-field as described above

850777
postback	ajax
by default if you just leave an imagebutton the way it is .net will fire off a postback ajax postback in my case because its all happening inside an updatepanel

850777
any	set
if i enter a number into any one of the price input-field this success option will fire and set my cancelpostback variables to false which in turn means that the form now submits even though it hasn t been validated just because one field was valid

850802
command-line	cmd
the cmd works fine on the cmd-line but i can t seem to get it to work with the process object in c#

850802

i m trying to figure out a way i can from a bash perl python whatever-else program

850905
any	set
any javascript-framework you need to be sure you have set the param evaljavascript to true

850912
multithreading	wait
multithreading is useful in any situation where a single thread has to wait for a resource and you can run another thread in the meantime

850920
python	ruby
however the concept of taking c and making it more dynamic towards the idea of smalltalk python or ruby is really attractive to me

850926
contains	any
i can see three constraints on any answer given what is contains in your question if these aren t actually constraints you need to reword your question

850926
decimal-point	digits
input float must be able to have four digits before and after the decimal-point and still give the correct answer

850926
floating-point-precision	decimal-point
is a total pain because you re going to hit your head on floating-point-precision quite easily if you have to use a number with four digits before and after the decimal-point

850928
selected	cell
selected next empty cell

850942
device-driver	hardware
apart from efficiency and flexibility.the main point of pointers in c++ is that is how the hardware works you could not wite a device-driver memory manager or efficient cache without using pointers somewhere along the line

850944
associations	model
if you have a habtm associations the model is probably not there

850977

the purpose of try-catch blocks to allow you to try to perform and action and then if an exception-handling occurs catch the exception-handling and deal with it gracefully rather than crashing

850987
photoshop	layer
looking at the problem a different way can you export from photoshop to some other format which supports layer like png which is editable by imagemagick

850990
random-seed	generator
another suggestion to do this is to generator random numbers from a random-seed on both the server and the client

850991
fclose	fopen
the cannonical example is the use of fopen creates and initialises the struct and returns a pointers to it fclose cleans up and release it and all other i o functions get their context from the passed in

850995
document	element
i have some iframes on a page and the pages communicate between each other in some complex ways - when i tried this the problem was that it couldn t find the element because it was part of a different document than the code it was executing in

850998
any	set
there s no need and never has been any need to explicitly set references a- b or b- c to null for example

851010
.when	ready
most of the win32 api calls in question just throw an exception-handling .when you try to access a drive that isn t ready

851010
.when	ready
however even .when i catch any and all exception-handling-handling i still get an angry exception-handling dialog box from windows telling me the floppy card reader isn t ready

851022
push	pull
you may find it easier to work with a data push model rather than a data pull model

851023
arrays	loops
ptr is of type and i can t really make assumptions about the state of the arrays at any point because it s pretty deeply embedded in loops and dependent on input and output

851034
json	xml
if you website is already running asp.net-mvc and it s just easier add an extra view and dump xml json instead of html content

851034
put	get
if your wanting to add custom headers like basic http authentication x-http-method-override for support for put delete as browsers pipeline only supports get post its easy to do in the rest starter kit and almost impossible to do currently in wcf 3.5 possible with asp.net modules with attributes set allowing httpcontext

851041
friend-class	base-class
a base-class cbase which need to access the ipimpl member in cdataholder so it is a friend-class of cdataholder

851041
derived-class	friend-class
the derived-class cannot use the ipimpl member although its parent class is a friend-class

851041
derived-class	friend-class
there are plenty of derived-classes so it s not a good way for each derived-class to put a friend-class cderivedxxx line in cdataholder class

851136

gzip	zip
zip it gzip -9 gives you the maximal compression

851221
spaces	output
in particular we can see that when the character is not a spaces there s always at least one element in the output list

851221
spaces	output
the case where the character is a space will still be dependent on the list but that s fine because the only way that case can infinitely recurse is if you pass in an infinite list of spaces in which case not producing any output and going into a loop is the expected behaviour for words what else could it do

851226
directory-structure	subdirectories
at this point it works as it should and makes a directory-structure for each object in public assets foo contains subdirectories for original thumbnail full and feature

851244

project-management	scrum
scrum is the agile process for project-management and so it doesn t have an impact on code quality other than its tight focus on always having a potential deliverable system at the end of each 2-4 week sprint

851338
reflection	runtime
since c++ standard does not cover such concept as metadata there s no portable across different compilers and platforms for that matter methods of runtime reflection other than rtti you already mentioned

wxpython	pyqt
for application development after you think you can handle it start on wxpython or pyqt

851437
scheme	lisp
emacs can do anything any other editor can do you just have to learn scheme lisp to write the macros -

851443
innodb	myisam
myisam will lock the entire table for the duration of the insert whereas innodb under most circumstances will only lock the affected rows allowing selected statements to proceed

851501
vb.net	vb6
i have some vb6 code that instantiates a class which handles events that are being raised from a vb.net component

851501
vb.net	vb6
it may or may not be relevant but the vb.net was converted from a vb6 using the visual-studio code conversion tool and subsequently manually cleaned up

851508
input-field	textarea
i am using a swfuploader and i just added a input-field and a textarea when it preview the images which ready to be uploaded

851524
base-class	inherited

851578
debugging	exit
when i start debugging a console program it immediately exit when its finished

851584
default-value	arguments
apparently the default arguments is not accepted when written this way and the compiler assumes that instead of the second templates arguments a new function arguments is specified for which it then expects a default-value because the stuff arguments has one

851597
subtract	time
now if you have to get the time for gmt-5 you can just subtract the offset from the time instead of adding to it like in the following example where we are getting the time for gmt-4

851635

edit the goal is to use a rich graphic content like wpf or silverlight on older platforms like windows 2000

851712
sftp	ftp
i d like to offer a solution outside the box and rather than inventing an ide that can do a specific thing i use tools that bring the ftp and sftp to me

851744
subtract	add
yes the timestamp 0 means 10am 1 1 70 in australia midnight 1 1 70 in london and 5pm 31 12 69 in la but this doesn t mean you can simply add or subtract values and guarantee accuracy

851753
double-quotes	spaces
some characters appearing in an unquoted uri such as parentheses white spaces characters single quotes and double-quotes must be escaped with a backslash so that the resulting uri value is a uri token

851760
order	add
in order to have this code compile for other versions of compilers you can add a set of parentheses around the default argument

851760
arguments	default
imo these parentheses are necessary as there is an additional requirement that the default arguments can refer to a member of the class that may be declared later in the class body

851760
arguments	default
the compiler therefore can only parsing the default arguments using syntax checking only ie

851760
arguments	default
adding the extra set of parentheses ensures that the default arguments is handled correctly

851760
arguments	default
the following example shows where is used in the default arguments and implies the less than operator

851760
arguments	default
note in member function declarations names in default arguments expression are looked

851760
arguments	default
this bullet here is the part that forces the compiler to delay lookup for the meaning of the default arguments until all of the class members have been declared

851772
double-quotes	spaces
parentheses comma white spaces characters single quotes and double-quotes

851792
jquery	.post

851832
google-chrome	firefox
it works on all browsers ie6+ firefox safari windows but not google-chrome

851845
order	add
add order by 2 desc to your selected

851856
uitextview	nsstring
i can use a loop shortening the string by a character each time and then use nsstring s sizewithfont constrainedtosize linebreakmode to find out the height this shorter string would need and then compare that against the height i have available in my smaller uitextview ending the loop when the string will fit - but that seems slow and awkward

851861
command-line	cmd
it s almost easier to just do svn cmd on the command-line just so it s clear what s going on

851905
required	checked
i am working on a project where it required to checked cookie and tell whether it is 20 minutes old or not

851907

from sorted data sortedlist tkey

851958
malloc	free
where do malloc and free store the allocated addresses and their sizes linux gcc

851958
malloc	free
so in order to still find the current one i want to check if a string i find in the memory is still used by comparing its address against the addresses malloc free know about

851967
silverlight	wpf
im looking for a control like the dataform which is new in silverlight 3 for handling the whole binding and validation logic declarativly with property attributes etc for wpf

there are lots of ways in which malloc free can store the size of the memory area

851987
contains	elements
currently i have a string object that contains xml elements

851989
command-line	findstr
findstr supports regular expressions so you can also do the following to shorten the command-line

852011
datepart	dateadd
i find it easier to pass a value as a temporal data type datetime then use temporal functionality specifically dateadd and datepart to find the start and end dates for the period in this case the month this finds the start date and end date pair for the current month just substitute current_timestamp for you parameter of of type datetime note the 1990-01-01 value is entirely arbitrary

852017
png	gif
however when i did the uploads i found that all of pdf png gif etc can be uploaded

852017
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3 works because of application octet-stream whereas ie works because of application x-zip-compressed google-chrome doesn t work at all

852030
llvm	gcc
if you want to compile to it you can use either gcc front end or clang which is c c++ compiler for llvm which is still work in progress

852036
configuration	environment
using different web.config in development and production environment to learn how you can use different configuration

852042
contains	elements
if at some point you want the source to contains more than just a single string or you don t want to generate the xml wrapper elements manually create a dom document that containss your source and pass it to the transformer using a domsource

852049
jython	pypy
so fast-foward 5-10 years in the future what will pypy have to offer over cpython jython and ironpython

852070
defined	declare
if i declare a global-variables in a header file and include it in two .cpp files the linker gives an error saying the symbols is multiplying defined

852072
malloc	free
therefore i have provided a wrapper for the malloc free calls

852072
malloc	free
in these wrappers i need to increment a current memory count when malloc is called and decrement it when free is called

852078
automapper	bltoolkit
try automapper or bltoolkit mapping

852088
json	xml
from what i can see there are three options for grabbing gcal feeds xml ical or html containing some really whack json

852088
show	next
parsing this is possible but it s a huge pain in the behind because recurring events of which there are several on the calendar only show the first instance of that event and apparently no information on when the next instance is

852111
malloc	free
either you can have access to internal tables used by malloc free see this question where do malloc free store allocated sizes and addresses

852127
json	xml
converting between xml and json by stefan goessner

852132
malloc	free
you could allocate a few extra bytes in your wrapper and put either an id if you want to be able to couple malloc and free or just the size there

852143
python	perl
win32 ole in perl or similar module in python

852162
contains	any
the hash library must not contains any calls to malloc or new but must take a parameter that tells it the location and size of the memory it is permitted to use

852183
microsoft-speech-api	sapi
you might want to checkout the microsoft-speech-api sapi

852215
children	nodes
and i want to find all user nodes with and which are immediate children of role nodes with attributes type equals c and their ancestors with probably by using ancestor-or-self axis

852243
buffering	capture
the trick here is to capture the current image from the plugins as a bitmap and then use this like double buffering

852250
children	nodes
â which are immediate children of role nodes with attributes type equals c â

852256
environment	execution
just to add a bit more jvm is like a containers that provides an execution environment for a java program and a jvm created each time we invoke java from the command-line

852300
hash	md5
at the very least you could take and compare the md5 hash of the combined file contents file name and metadata such as creationtime lastaccesstime and lastwritetime

852308
python	java
it s true that the python method resolution could be slower in python that in java

852310
profiling	debugging
for debugging profiling graphics try nvidia perfhud

852312
hashtable	set
it s trivial to adapt a simple linear probing hashtable to use a block of memory - just set its table s to point at the allocated memory when you create it and don t implement anything to allocate more memory to let the table grow

852315
arguments	default
however you can get some control by creating a constructor with a default arguments

852326
any	set
this has a slightly different effect - it will not take up any space if set to display none whereas setting visibility hidden still takes up space

852327
contains	elements
user agents may interpret this value as the character encoding that was used to transmit the document contains this form elements

852344
interpreter	runtime
methods resolution happens at run time the interpreter simply tries to find the referenced foo methods with the right signature and if it s not there a runtime error occurs

852344
python	java
you ll write much more code to do the same thing in java than you would in python

852371
persistence	hibernate
i ve tried the example as given on page 311 312 from the java persistence with hibernate which resembles my problem but i m just not getting it

852377
operators	keyword
examples default deleted-functions default and delete the new nullptr constant the explicit keyword usable also for conversion operators .

852381
json	csv
that way foo can stay the same if you want to add a way to create it from json csv or whatever data too

852394
struct	unions
you need to use struct and or unions

852400
reference-type	generics
i ve written a simple abstract generics class in c# .net 2.0 and i preferably want to limit it to only reference-type so i can indicate no value by a null

852408
reference-type	generics
this will restrict the generics type parameter to be a reference-type

852419
python	java
my work for the last 3-4 years has mostly been in python and c++ and i have forgotten a lot of in s and out s of java

852432
put	get
it seems obvious and easy to map crud operations on a resource orientated restful service using http to operations such as put get post delete but how should operations that query for multiple resources be mapped - using a new operation called query or still use get that returns a collection of resources

852440
linked-list	queue
create your queue as a linked-list

852448
onsubmit	onclick
for that particular scenario you might want to experiment with different event properties as browsers act differently the onlick is for the button the onsubmit is a form event so naturally if you return false for the onclick that does not mean the on submit is not going to take effect you should handle the onsubmit separately or delegate submission to the submit button by return false onsubmit and let the onclick handler have form.submit also try it with multiple submit button to understand how it works

852450
append	input
but since the rows i m adding aren t there on the document ready they won t get the click event handler append and so i m not able to click them to get input boxes

852464
entity-framework	nhibernate
rather than rolling what is basically your own orm i would recommend switching to one of the established orms such as nhibernate or entity-framework

852466
python	java
one thing you could try is to port one of your python c++ programs that you have developed to java

852496
python	java
that way you will feel safe in the python parts while you still are going to need to work in java

852498
asp.net-mvc	webforms
should i get into asp.net-mvc now or get a good understanding of the trad webforms first

852500
postgresql	mysql
so storing 1 000 000 000 rows in postgresql will require several gib more storage than mysql depending on which storage enginge you use in mysql

852500
postgresql	mysql
but postgresql is also great at handling huge data compared to mysql

852500
postgresql	mysql
but as i always says if you re not really really sure you need a specific mysql feature you should go for postgresql

852500
postgresql	mysql
i m limiting this post to only mysql and postgresql since this question is tagged with only those two databases

852506
firefox	safari
i also got it to work with a vlc plugin in firefox and safari

852515
webforms	asp.net
if you haven t learnt asp.net webforms yet you have to ask yourself whether you really want to learn about web development

852515
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms attempts to hide you from all of this as much as possible

852519
configuration	environment
if you are installing client application software into existing customer environment then perhaps the easiest thing to do is to reverse-engineer their sql .net configuration

852520
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you are just starting with webforms and are thinking of doing asp.net-mvc instead i would just make the leap

852520
asp.net-mvc	webforms
learning webforms at this point won t really help you and may confuse you with respect to asp.net-mvc

852525
asp.net-mvc	webforms
having been using webforms for a while now i would recommend trying out asp.net-mvc its a good framework and simpler to use than it seems at first

852531
value	field
let s follow the example where the user has just typed a value into the address field and then click on the city field

852564
macros	basic
you tried to run a macros or used the docmd object in visual basic to carry out an action

852573
reflection	runtime
personally i wouldn t use reflection if the data-access requirements call for a large number of transactions a highly transactional system - what you gain in flexibility ultimately costs you at runtime more comment on reflection here

852573
entity-framework	nhibernate
there are a number of popular solutions including the entity-framework and linq to sql in ..net 3.5 and both support stored procs but also a great deal of support for a template-driven approach using codesmith templates .net tiers or more complicated solutions using nhibernate or deklarit for example

852578
value	field
there is a xml-xml transformation i need to do which include some 10 field where you i have to take string value from source xml find appropriate numeric codes from appropriate lookup tables provided and put those codes in resulting xml

852581
turbogears	django
most people seem to favour django as a web framework but there are alternatives such as turbogears

852590
output	mode
a better solution is asynchronous input output process about 1000 parallel connections in one single thread by opening the sockets in non-blocking mode and use epoll or selected to process just those connections that have received data

852638
numeric	zero
take our case where we have a geographical identifier that is a zero filled 4-digit numeric value

852640
compact-framework	.net
i also couldn t find a way to host .net in c++ because again the functionality wasn t exposed in the compact-framework

852640
communication	messages
my solution was to create a stubs c# application and communication with the c++ host via messages queue

852648
data-processing	financial
for the first versioning of f# microsoft is targetting engineering mathematical financial and data-processing applications if i remember correctly

852648
python	ruby
i think programming languages thanks to virtual machines are becoming more diversified in general think also ruby python and haskell for example not taking into account all the smaller languages like clojure ioke ...

852670
increment	average
keep a set of the last x progresses that has been reported calculate the speed of each increment and use the average

852680
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the more i dig into asp.net-mvc the more i love it and think how was i working with webforms

852698
realloc	calloc
your program may also need to intercept realloc calloc getcwd as it may allocate memory when buffer is null in some implementations and maybe strdup or a similar function if it is supported by your compiler

852706
reference-type	generics
i m not sure if you can constrain the generics parameters appropriately at compile time but you could add in some runtime checks to only allow reference-type along with the desired subset of nullable value types

852714
webforms	asp.net
i started learning asp.net webforms last year

852729
configuration	environment
either have a known captcha on the page as tvanfosson suggests or a configuration setting to turn off the captcha validation for your test environment

852746
logical-operators	associativity
edit as chris jester-young noted this is actually because logical-operators have to left-to-right associativity

852754
contains	any
is there any way to either speed this query up or get the contains function to accept my # symbol

852761
ref	out
arguments are usually by value unless you explicitly make it ref or out in the delegation definition used for the lambda

852796
any	set
because is of higher precendence than || it is evaluated first because you did not have any brackets to set explicit precedence

852796
expression	evaluation
since the compiler understands that if a true it doesn t need to bother evaluation the rest of the expression it stops after evaluation a

852800
jquery	.post

852810
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
take a look at autoresetevent and manualresetevent

852824
value	field
i m not sure nulling the value is meaningful - you should either blank the value or delete the whole field not just the value

852861
any	set
i don t know of any architecture that does not represent an unsigned value of one less than two to the power of the number of bits as all bits set but here is what the standard actually says 3.9.1 7 plus note 44

852873
value	field
field i have are dayofweek weekofmonth and month value

852886
.when	ready

the code you have entered in your question is not visible you should selected the code and click the button with the 0 and 1 s but try adding something like this to the configuration section of your web.config

852911
simpledateformat	date-format
you should be using a date-format simpledate-format instead to create date instances from a string representation

852925
reflection	runtime
one advantage to using typedescriptor over getproperties is that typedescriptor has a mechanism for dynamically attaching properties to objects at runtime and normal reflection will miss these

852931
uitextview	uilabel
i would suggest taking a slightly different approach and seeing if you can use a uilabel instead of the smaller uitextview

852931
uitextview	uilabel
uilabel can be setup to be multi-line like a uitextview through their numberoflines property

852932
input-field	selected
is it possible to fill the input-field with a date which uses the same format as i would selected it with the datepicker

852932
input-field	selected
for example i have a value new date in my input-field before i selected a date with the datepicker and i want it to have the same format as i would selected it

852945
percentile	average
if you re confident that the average are going to be a good indication of the total time to download then you could display the 40th percentile and the 60th - if the average download times vary widely then the 10th and 90th might be better

852947
push	pull
the difference in using git clone is that it automatically sets up the origin repository so that you can easily use git pull and git push to synchronize the two repositories

852962
punctuation	words

type-parameter	return-type
my thought was maybe there s a way to use a type-parameter to inference the return-type

853019
managed-code	native-code
in order for native-code to call into managed-code the native-code has to spin up the clr s execution engine

853027
button	popup
i have a popup button that launches a canvas containing a form that a user can submit

853038
google-chrome	firefox
similar to ctrl + shift + t in firefox and google-chrome

853042
filtering	grouping
if the source implements ienumerable only you will not be able to sort or grouping the collection you can only filtering it

853042
icollection	ienumerable
compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

853042
grouping	sorting
in addition ilist allows sorting grouping and filtering

853042
grouping	sorting
it supports sorting and grouping but not traditional filtering

853057

853067
mta	sta
i know of the whole sta mta thing - so my com object would be converted to be mta and have no global state while not being multithreading itself

853069
contains	any
any virtual-methods slot that contains a pointer to system._abstracterror is an abstract methods

853077
versioning	upgrade
xcode will then presumably ask to upgrade the project which usually involves creating a new .xcodeproj versioning

853078
iptables	host
the only problem is that source nat in iptables is done in the postrouting chain and i m not sure it s used for connections that are accepted by that host so i might need to use another server

853088
output	mode
by default this uses the auto mode which only include the color codes when output to a terminal but not when you pipe the output elsewhere

swing	swt
the original code runs under swing but you can make it work under swt too using the awt swt bridge example code

853153
solaris	linux
the code is os dependent but there are versions available for all major oss windows linux macos and solaris are supported on the project s site but you can download the source and compile it for others as well

853171

coldfusion	railo
if you are designing an app that is compatible with coldfusion railo and openbd it appears safer to use remote_user

853225
asp.net-mvc	webforms
but put it this way i ve been on asp.net-mvc for about a year and the idea of going back to webforms sends chills down my spine

853231
children	nodes
you can make the lookups pretty fast especially for getting all children in a nodes using the adjacency list model but updates to the tree are slower

853247
sql-server	oracle
caveat most of my experience is with oracle not sql-server but i believe that the answer holds

853248
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby on ruby-on-rails has native support for migrations but i m curious if anyone can recommend one of the following django evolution projects

853260
stretch	styles
all containers within the default treeviewitem styles s control templates are set to auto and stretch to consume as much vertical space that is needed by the item content

853260
itemtemplate	treeview
reduce the size of the content of each item by altering the treeview s itemtemplate

853308
windows-xp	windows
i believe the same thing will occur when the control is overlapped by another windows in windowss-xp but i haven t tested that yet

853311
python	java
the library could be in for python or in java

853319
locale	hebrew
lcid 1037 is the hebrew locale identifier

853321
swing	gwt
the project itself is pretty straight forward the only unknown to us being replacing the swing ui with the gwt ui

853324
http	ssl
if it used ssl you would access it as http domain 4848

853327
macros	vba
you can do this programmatically using a vba macros

853332
value	field
on the one hand i have a regular hashcode function based on the value of various field following the chapter 3 of effective-java

the cmd-line client shows the lock owner with the cmd svn info

853374
unique	words
lets say between all your articles you only have 500 unique words between them

853374
python	php
sorry for using python instead of php my php is rusty and the use of zip makes that bit easier

853377
pixels	line
while gwt does mask many of the difference between browsers it certainly doesn t mask them all and you can spend hours looking for the source of a line of pixels in gwt just as you can in a normal web site

853377
swing	gwt
there are far fewer resources for swing than gwt

853383
credentials	account
changing the account under which the mssqlserver service operates should help but did you restart sql-server after changing the credentials

853450
wikipedia-api	wikipedia
i went through this url on data-mining from wikipedia - it put an idea to make a second request to wikipedia-api with the retrieved wikipedia text as parameters and that would retrieve the html - although it hasn t seemed to work so far - i don t want to just grab the whole article as a mess of html and dump it

853452
32-bit	64bit
second issue again a year ago so may no longer be the case was that compiling on a 64bit box with a 64bit jvm wasn t supported so i ended up needing a separate 32-bit jvm and wrapping an ant task that specifically referenced that for the gwt compile setup

853453
duplicates	contains
paging over a set which contains duplicates for the entity to fetch because joins were used is actually useless so you need to be sure the resultset returned is without duplicates

853457
cursor	row
some databases that use isam-type tables will appear to return a consistent row order when you run queries without an order cursor but deleting and inserting can easily change that

853483
syntax-error	syntax
i get a syntax-error invalid syntax when i hit the return button after typing the semicolon

853498
swing	gwt
i ve successfully test-driven the development of swing and gwt applications through the gui

853498
keyboard	mouse
gestures low level mouse and keyboard input to control the gui

853501

yes it does have support for datasets but there is also a build your own methods by dropping a component on the form and assigning writing 3 events get field value next record is at end of file

853513
windows-vista	windows
windows-vista windows 2003 server windows 2008 server

853539
value	field
for things like this i often stash the value in an asp hidden control input type hidden using the javascript and then add a pageload function in the javascript to parsing that field and then set the focus

853561
hosts-file	hosts
it is hidden in the hosts

853561
hosts-file	hosts
it was written in the hosts as

853568
any	set
set wouldn t make any sense for say a set iterator.

853572
filtering	grouping
attribute will pass so if i want to only allow user limited access to parts of the site i ll need to do add them to an ad grouping and use that to apply the filtering

853577
itemscontrol	grid
i have a grid inside of an itemscontrol s datatemplate so there will be many copies of this grid

853577
click	mouse
i want a mouse click on the grid to triggers the storyboard of an element outside of the datatemplate

853620

ruby-on-rails	grails
i would requests answers from those that have done significant web applications development using both ruby-on-rails and grails

853628
lookup	any
from there if you need any more info you can just lookup the object line number

853633
strtotime	mktime
you might want to use mktime instead of strtotime though

853638
instances	private
even though i can t change manager to be a different or new instances of person private set accessor i can change it s properties which have public set accessors

853643
json	xml
json keeps things compact and can be faster than xml

853649
controller	routes
i understand that zend-framework has routes and that they can be named but i can t seem to grasp from the manual how to create a simple route for certain controller actions so that i could do something like this

853656
web-services	security
in point-to-point situations confidentiality and data integrity can also be enforced on web-services through the use of transport layer security tls for example by sending messages over https

853662
any	set
there is any other way to set it

853665
json	xml
now however i m realizing that it s possible to create structures in xml that don t map directly to json

853670
contains	set
1. the follow set of b contains g and epsilon t f

853670
contains	set
2. the first set of s contains d f g and epsilon t f

853684
contains	elements
i am creating a terms and conditions box which will contains some key elements that the user will selected

853684
checkbox	button
since the t c s will have form components radio button checkbox

value	field
i need to enable disable post comments regarding the value of a new field in post list

853729
internet-explorer	firefox
to the button works for me in firefox internet-explorer 6 internet-explorer 7 and safari

853745
methods	extend
let s say you have some 3rd-party library class that you want to extend simply to add convenience methodss to it so you can call an inherited methods with default parameters for example

853745
jmock	junit
using junit jmock is it possible to write an assertion mock expection that tests that the correct inherited methods is called

853750
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i doesn t make any difference whether you are using asp.net-mvc or webforms

853754
hide	show
update i phrased the question badly - i m looking for a general solution not just show hide and therefore toggle

853759
buffering	streaming
i would prefer it be able to accept a url as an option but if required html can be passed in as a streaming byte arrays with all styles in a single file buffering

853763
bash	zsh
in zsh not bash you can

853765
sql-server	postgresql
for native support for this you really need sql-server 2008 or another dbms such as postgresql that directly supports spatial indexing

853770
firefox	safari
i could only duplicate this problem in firefox and safari so far

853770
logout	login
after a successful login if one were to logout and log back in everything seems to work fine

853772
associations	model
for your use case where you want to load the model with its associations out of cache i would strongly recommend that you try cache money which does it almost automatically

853773
hide	show
true show all elements false hide

853781
icollection	ienumerable
it implements all the interfaces you might expect it to idictionary icollection ienumerable etc. and as a bonus the entire class and its members are fully commented with xml

853785
shell	bash
alternatively as alamar noted if you use bash as your shell you can us the disown command

853785
shell	tcsh
if you use another shell such tcsh you may be restricted to the nohup form above

853819
firefox	safari
i had this very issue in firefox safari before when i had a tag to submit the form without a value assigned to that button - ie 8 was fine with this but other browsers definitely weren t

853825
row	col
you can do this by programmatically adding the number of columns you need 7 more to make 10 then programmatically swapping row col with col row

853827
cobertura	emma
coverage tools like cobertura or emma will tell you whether you properly covered your code

853833

not sure about linux but most unix variants provide sysctl 3 for this purpose

853863
performance-testing	profiling
in particular a significant performance issue was identified via automated performance-testing and profiling

853896
http	ssl
i ve got everything setup and it works like peaches when it s not using ssl http

853924
safari	opera
however due to newer phones having web browsers like safari opera and windows ie it would be advantageous to build a web application so a user wouldn t have to download some software onto their phone

853929
value	field
now obviously i don t want an admin to be able to make themself a system admin just by posting back a true value for this field

853932
contains	sorted
compareto could only be used if the set knew that it contains comparable objects sorted sets for instance might possibly do this

853935
hosts-file	hosts
you could edit your hosts and add an entry to point to your local ip or 127.0.0.1

853940
hosts-file	hosts
to get the dns to resolve and work correctly you may need to add an entry to your windows hosts -- mycomputer.mycompany.com 127.0.0.1

853955
onclick	onload
within that .ascx are 1-3 events that will fire 2 of them are onclick events and 1 is onload

853955
onclick	onload
the onclick event s are easier to work with in terms of i can hardcode it directly in the controls event like so and the onload must run when the .ascx is loaded i was testing this in a call this works fine in the .aspx page but as soon as i try adding it into the .aspx page it doesn t load and its ideal that this works but i have no idea why not

853984
http	ssl
set up an http server which has authentication email him the address and username from separate email account going to separate email acccounts call him and give him the password and have him log into your http server and download the documents over ssl

853995
contains	elements
represents an elements with the att attributes whose value contains at

853996
player	movie
unfortunately the movie player can only play movie in landscape

854033
oracle	mysql
oracle requires a sequence to be created and on mysql you just set the column as auto increment

854039
voicexml	vxml
the voicexml support is borderline limited control over the engine from vxml properties but if you re willing to use workflows instead you can do just about anything you want

854063
for-loop	loops
another way to do this is to pass the number of items in as the first parameter to the function and then use a for-loops to loops over the variable args

854064
printf	scanf
there are several strategies to solve this problem include an explicit argument which is the number of extra arguments use a format string to define the arguments such as with the printf and scanf family of functions or use a sentinel value such as 0 to declare the end of the arguments

854071
getter	setter
my address class is storing plain old strings with totally dumb getter and setter

854082
contains	set
e null o.equals e if the set contains such an element.

854106

i m trying to get nhibernate to load some records for me it s been partially set up and is used for some other parts of the app already and while working on an any mapping i got this exception-handling

854133
cosine	sine
seems unlikely that it d be much of a performance problem - it works out to something like a cosine a sine and a few multiplication

854136
triggers	insert
when i run either a debugging or release version of the application simply by starting the .exe i get an insert statement on the database that tries to insert a 0 for the foreign key of a table triggers an error because the primary key of the other table is not 0

854140
value	field
the only simple solution i can think of is to set the primary key of new records to a negative value my pks are an identity field and will therefore be set to a positive integer on insert

854170
player	movie
you could go up to the top root node of the movie player and walk down the child views recursively and set the hidden value to yes until you find the right item then insert your uiimageview below that item

854174
hash	md5
when you have an update you sign it on your site by getting the md5 or sha-1 or whatever hash you want to use

854180
treeset	treemap
the treeset is based on a treemap which uses the comparator in getentry

854180

sqldatasource	gridview
i have a gridview that accesses data from a sqldatasource in dataset mode

854275
sqldatasource	gridview
top doesn t seem to do the same thing and i don t know how to get the paging information from the gridview into the sqldatasource either

854275
sqldatasource	gridview
or is there a better way to get effective paging from a sqldatasource in a gridview

854281
brainfuck	ocaml
for example this ocaml journal article describes an 87-line llvm-based brainfuck compiler this mailing list post describes complete programming language implementation including parsing that can compile the fibonacci function amongst other programs and the whole compiler is under 100 lines of ocaml code using llvm and hlvm is a high-level virtual-machine with multicore-capable garbage-collection in under 2 000 lines of ocaml code using llvm

854287
cyclomatic-complexity	lines-of-code
when you have many many methods with cyclomatic-complexity scores of well over 20 one was 66... and regularly see methods with dozens of parameters or hundreds of lines-of-code you know something has gone wrong

854295
triggers	insert
there are two main options 1 - dbmss that allow an auto-increment keyword next to the primary key definition and 2 - dbmss that provide sequence generators that you then can use to generate the new values for the pk for instance by writing a before insert triggers that automatically inserts the new value in the column before completing the insertion

854301
nssearchfield	nstableview
i want to have an nssearchfield that can search through an nsarraycontroller bound to an nstableview

but fpdf is used to generate various dynamic documents like invoices in e-commerce product

854384
versioning	upgrade
1 upgrade the server versioning

854392
.net	wcf
another option would be to expose the functionality that talks to the database in your .net assembly as some interoperable service wcf

854417
m2crypto	openssl
sometimes the openssl documentation m2crypto wraps openssl can help

854418
fpdf	fpdi
in a class that extends fpdf fpdi appropriately use something like the following to generate a pdf from a templates pdf you ve already created

854422
rewrite	rule
changing the lighttpd rewrite rule to this fixes it

854429
traversal	parent
basically you get the currently selected node and then you traversal recursively up its parent

854439
firefox	safari
browser zooming works fine in browsers like firefox and safari because they zoom all the content and recorrect pixel-values

if you have windows-xp or windows 2000 then temporary internet files are in this location note that on your pc they can be on some drive other than c

854460
administration	account
if you have only one user account then replace username with administration to get the path of the temporary internet files folder

854482
selection	cell
as most excel peeps would know even though a solution looks like in excel doing a merge and center - that only preserves the content in the uppermost cell in the selection

854491
windows-xp	windows
from the ms sql-server site sql-server compact 3.5 is a free easy-to-use embedded database engine that lets developers build robust windows desktop and mobile applications that run on all windows platforms including windows-xp vista pocket pc and smartphone.

854502
any	set
this seems like best practice in any case set up your event handler before you start firing events

854504
restrict	shared
you ll also have to restrict access to the shared so users cannot circumvent the program

854520
arrays	loops
the most interesting way in my mind produces not an arrays but an that enumerates the same number - it has the benefit of o 1 setup time since it defers the actual loops s execution

854532
web-config	app-config
the enterprise library logging application block is built on the .net tracesource and tracelistener classes so you can pretty much just drop it into your project and it ll work and it supports a message formatter that you can configure in the web-config or app-config

854536
firefox	opera
i have a ruby-on-rails application deployed that works fine in safari firefox and opera

854550
expression-blend	silverlight
if you re using expression design all you need to do is copy and paste it to expression-blend make sure that your clipboard is set to silverlight xaml and it will automatically convert the bitmapeffect to a seperate image

854552
hosts-file	hosts
if not just add an entry to your the hosts

854572
linux	unix
you might also run into case sensitivity issues with leopard versus linux unix if you re deploying to those

854598
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

854616
cross-compiling	toolchain
here is a link to a pdf describing how to set up a cross-compiling toolchain for arm and eclipse

854617
any	set
it would be indistinguishable from a real arrays and would scale to any size except it would take no memory and no time to set up

854620
selected	button
users should be able to selected one or more items and remove them i ll provide a remove button

854620
selected	button
users should be able to add items to this list i ll provide a button that launches a openpanel which allows them to selected a path

854622
scriptmanager	updatepanel
the scriptmanager would output scripting only for controls which are being updated children of updatepanel that is

854631
double	int
i think you have an approximation problem dealing with int divisions try to keep it in double till you get the index

854653
required	checked
i have checked dependencies and my dll required msvcr90d.dll and kernel32.dll where the original dll only required kernel32.dll

854658
widget	button
when a user cklicks on the button i want a new windows to be opened the windows is a form with text areas button and other swt widget

854661
msbuild	nant
alternatively you could set up a pre-build step in your c# project that directly runs nmake msbuild or even nant

854675
environment	building
the question is is it possible to set up a distcc environment on the linux box that would building ordinary mac objective-c or c++ projects or even iphone projects

854683
checkbox	button
is there a widget in django 1.0.2 to render a models.booleanfield as two radio button instead of a checkbox

854685
silverlight	wpf
it s really frustrating because this is something that is computationally trivial but a nightmare to accomplish in wpf silverlight

854686
directory	folder
it startles me when by jsp forward ing the home page it can t access the css as it thought it was still in the actions directory whereas i know it is in the main folder and thus could access a file within the resources folder via . resources

854692
struct	unions
whilst using struct unions is the most efficient approach in term of runtime it comes with a number of complications convincing your compiler to pack the struct unions to match the octet structure of the packets you need work to avoid alignment and endianness issues and a lack of safety since there is no or little opportunity to do sanity checks on debugging builds

854692
value	field
in all of this it s possible even if just for debugging builds to verify that each field which is modifiable is being set to a sane value

854700
ubuntu	linux
it looks like many popular linux distros already have distcc packages ubuntu though i m not sure how they differ from apple s code

external	root
even if the vm is created in a non-default location you ll see a symlink in the default external data root directory referencing the configuration file

854768
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
typically you would use a uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller here

854768
uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i d probably go ahead and subclass uiviewcontroller to handle this with methods modeled after uitabbarcontroller

854781
.net	wcf
.net 3.0 has wcf and wpf which are great new ways to communicate and present

854785
macros	let
if the external data is accessible via a network interface let s say http then you can write some excel macros code to consume it

854787
click	mouse
if you re clicking the screen or left clicking the mouse in the sim you will triggers the context menu similar to if you click the trackball on a 4.6 device

854812
32-bit	64bit
i ve recently migrated my app to a 64bit os from 32-bit win2k3 and am finding that one dependency - activepdf simply won t run under x64

854814
value	field
sphinx doesn t return any information about the value of field nor even which field provided a match on the query

854814
value	field
it could be that field are stored in a non-reversible encoding and so can t be translated back to normal value

854817
configuration	environment
you dont mention if your shared hosting environment gives you full access to your own tomcat configuration but if you can access and modify your tomcat5_home conf directory there are a few ways to make this work for you

854824
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
so it doesn t have to implements any specific interface like inotifypropertychanged of inotifycollectionchanged to make it usable in mvvm

854834

i prefer the blueprint-css because it has a style reset for default browser styles and it has a stylesheet for printing as well

854877
prefuse	jung
see for a list of implemented algorithms also compared with jung grapht prefuse jbpt

854881
contains	any
does base contains any virtual methods

854897
any	set
that trace will show null without any issues but in my next function that moves items up after i have set it to null it is still set to the object that it was before it was removed

854903
filtering	grouping
the problem we want to bind a hierarchicaldatatemplateâ s itemssource property to a collectionviewsource to perform grouping and filtering

854912
hash	md5
in short since md5 is a 128bit hash you need 2 64 items before the probably of a collision rises to 50

854920
versioning	upgrade
we had to upgrade versioning of that to work with the new ide framework and when we moved from vs2008 from vs2005 some our ssis package projects didn t open correctly because we are still on sql-server 2005 so definitely check any dependencies you have on your 2003 ide with any 3rd party apps you may be running

854920
type-safety	generics
generics are a game changer for sure and prevent you from having to create typed collections on your own to have type-safety

854923

both mysql and memcached are on their own boxes so i considered network latency but watching ping s and traceroute ing look normal

854979
versioning	staging
also running the queries fetches on the respective machines returns expected times and i m running the same versioning gems on my staging machine without this issue

854983
directory	folder
app is a module directory so the default and ecommerce folder create modules within zf

854983
contains	set
app ecommerce would contains a set of controllers that simply extend controllers within modules ecommerce default controllers

854986
hash	md5
if the site is one with public registration the attacker could repeatedly register account with known passwords then use the known md5 hash for those passwords to reverse-engineer the password scrambling algorithm

854986
hash	md5
if you want to store your passwords really securely get away from md5 and even sha1 and move towards a salted slower hash function

855003
32-bit	64bit
currently we only provide rpm packages for 64bit fedora 10 but we want to start providing packages for multiple linux distributions - 32-bit as well as 64bit - and possibly different versions of each distribution as well fedora 11 as well as fedora 10

855003
environment	building
i ve heard that the best way to produce building for multiple linux flavours is to have a single build-server and use a different chrooted environment for each set of packages that you want to build

855006
implements	extends
bear in mind that i implements functionmapper not extends stdcallmapper

855022
value	field

value	field
the user can create as many different pages with as many different field as he she likes and all these value are stored in the value table

855022
pagination	grouping
the way i use this data is by either displaying a gridview with pagination that displays all records for a single pagetype or when looking at a specific page instance values grouping by valuegroupid

855027
python	php
i am very familiar with php and python and have written some websites in them

855033
windows-xp	windows
if you re using .net 2.0 you can use system.net.httplistener to create your own web server that takes advantage of the http.sys component which is available from windows-xp sp2 and windows 2003 server

855051
button	popup
when a button is clicked to view one of the records in the gridview a popup windows in the form of a modal dialog opens allowing the user to edit the fields

855051
button	popup
then when the popup is closed the button s server side code is fired ultimately leading to a line of code that calls gridview1.databind

855051
databound	gridview
i noticed that before the gridview is databound the ods inputparameters are set using session values

855063
cassini	iis
maybe the cassini server from microsoft or a variant of cassini from ultidev which is implemented by the same technology as used when you debug asp.net or a web service from within visual-studio without iis

855065
contains	elements
the schema you use requires that put-attribute is a leaf node can t contains child elements - so you can t do that

855067
implements	extends
frameworks aside to implements a cross-browser compatible site i recommend that you initially target a standards compliant browser like firefox and then only after it is working extends support to less standards-compliant browsers like ie6

855068
interface-builder	iboutlet
based on documentation online the way to get these connected is to define an iboutlet in the view and connect it to the controllers in the interface-builder

855079
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
there are even a few that try to replicate a lot of ruby-on-rails features such as codeigniter

855090
python	php
that article is about php but it would work just as well in python

855092
any	set
bifff - allows you to set things on any view by css selector

855094
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
i guess cakephp is close to ruby-on-rails for a php framework

855094
ruby	php
there are other frameworks for ruby php and python

855094
zend-framework	symfony
if you want to code in php you could try symfony with zend-framework

855098
button	popup
i have a jquery confirmation popup with yes no button

855104
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
cakephp is by far the closest framework to ruby-on-rails

855104
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
codeigniter while not related to ruby-on-rails is also terrific if you want something lightweight that won t force you to do anything its way

855110
standard-library	boost
why does nobody seem to use tuples in c++ either the boost tuple library or the standard-library for tr1

855110
tuples	any
are there any big drawbacks to tuples that i m not thinking of

855114
shell	bash
update - assuming that there isn t a better answer than nadia s below i ve asked a follow up question how do i write some bash shell script to convert all matching filenames in directory to command-line options

855118
32-bit	64bit
we have 32-bit debugging release and 64bit debugging release and the correct assemblies are references when you build that configuration

855121
double	int
for example in the ini file i might have some double int or string type values preceded by the tag name of the value

855121
double	int
if my solution is acceptable then can anybody tell me how i can declare a set of so that it can accept any type int double string without me actually knowing which type the enum is going to be using for the value

855128
xerces	jdom
tomcat expects this attributes s value to be a space-separated list of extension names see the manifestresource source but it appears one of your jars has the comma-separated list dom4j-core jdom xml-apis xerces junit instead

855155
configuration	environment
this step was necessary as the application needed to access a generated configuration file that contained information about the customer environment

855155
authentication	login
scroll to the bottom of the list and under user authentication -- login -- make sure that the option automatic login with current user name and password is selected

855171
subclassing	base-class
i m writing a smart pointers templates which is intended to be initializer only for a given base-class and its subclassing which provides boost shared_pointers-like implicit-conversion to variants of the templates has long as the conversion is valid from t to u valid base-class and const-compatible

855181
put	get
i thought this would work but no matter what number i put in for the stack frame the closest i can get is init

855194
ip-address	hostname
sometimes i need to find some strings inside db usually it is just hostname or ip-address

855204
any	set
over and above the domain name availability issue picking a name that s not used in any other context allows you to do useful stuff like set up automatic alerts for tweets blogs comments on your project

855235
crypt	hash
the crypt function in php uses whatever hash algorithm the underlying operating system provides for encrypting the data - have a look at its documentation

855237
unique	words
because of the order and occurrence independence the inputs can be thought of as sets of unique words not strings in the sense of arrays of characters

855253
margins	padding
put minimum-width on the outter box as well that equals the summed up min-width padding margins and borders of the two inner ones

855265
shell	bash
so my question is can someone write some shell script code preferably sh or bash to take all the filenames in the current directory with a .py extension and generate the above command-line with the .py extensions removed

855268
ruby	php
php isn t ruby

855268
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
cakephp is a good ruby on ruby-on-rails imitation

855268
ruby	php
cakephp seems to be trying to make php act like ruby rather than making a framework that fits nicely with php

855268
cakephp	django
see if you like it if not try codeigniter zend or cakephp or django or merb or..

855274
children	nodes
if you need 2 levels like nested tabs where the second level tabs are children of the selected tab at the top then you will need 2 sitemapdatasources and set the starting nodes of the second to the selected nodes of the first

855280
arrays	map
in your case i wouldn t use a map but directly an 256 slot arrays to put the factory_base in

855306
ruby	php
i myself came from php s zend framework to ruby on rails and really found it a relief

855306
ruby	php
once i started developing web applications in ruby on rails i did not want to go back to php

855306
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
so if you were to choose a php framework i would personally go with cakephp just because its the closest thing to ruby-on-rails

855307
rollback	commit
the commit happens and the constraint violation exception-handling fires and the transaction is rollback instead of being committed

855317
boost-variant	boost-any
i have a feeling that many use boost-any and boost-variant with some engineering instead of boost.tuple

855320
profiling	debugging
logger debugging s c com c++ easily with rich symbolic info hooks profiling flexible instrumentation

855333
ruby	php
cakephp is very ruby like and i have been told that its a good stepping stone for php programmers to get in to ruby and mvc

855350
value	field
page - field - fieldcontrol - valuegroup - value

855372
haskell	python
it s all very ugly and hacky looking when compared to something like haskell or python

855378
textbox	button
over and over i find myself developing winform business application screens that have a bunch of textbox for search criteria then a search button

855397
double	int
for instance dates are actually int that represent a julian date double are actually int and you have to divide them by 10 number of decimal places on the data dictionary of that specific item and so on

855407
sql-server	mysql
i m migrating a huge web application from sql-server to mysql

855414
python	c++
i think you ll find that people already using boost are more likely to find tuple uses in their programs than non-boost users and migrants from other languages python comes to mind are more likely to simply be upset about the lack of tuples in c++ than to explore methods of adding tuple support

855418
cgpoint	cgrect
that is does the cgpoint element intersect with with the cgrect element

855425
reflection	runtime
rtti may help but you can t create an instance of a class from its name at runtime like you could with .net or java reflection

855442
linkbutton	onclick
if i add a new instance of the linkbutton on every oninit then onclick handler for this linkbutton works

855458
dictionary	arrays
you can have a data structure a dictionary or an arrays of pairs which maps the string id to a static function which constructs the class

855473
any	set
so any client computer who connects to the router wirelessly can set those 2 things

855481
nyromodal	jquery
i am using the jquery nyromodal plugin within asp.net

855483
contains	elements
i have a desktop-application which contains an app.config program.exe.config at release with clearly visible elements which define my wcf endpoints and wcf implementation

855489
value	field
but we can do it even better why instead to change the value of the field we change the name of the field randomly

855491
put	get
if you put an index on userid username you ll have a covering index - so you won t ever need to go to the table to get the username anyway

855491
put	get
if you put your clustered index on userid you ll get a clustered index seek - which will end up at the row data anyway

855501
stripes	spring
i m building a web application using stripes and spring

855501
authentication	login
it needs to have a login authentication feature

855501
authentication	login
i have an actionbean that is called when the user clicks login but how do i actually authentication

855510
actionscript	mxml
each mxml file is a full fledged actionscript class

855516
tuples	any
for me it s habit hands down tuples don t solve any new problems for me just a few i can already handle just fine

855518
constructor	object
however i was wondering specifically why the pattern class uses the compile static method to create an object rather than the constructor

855519
selected	button
when the button is clicked the items in the combobox change but stuff 6 should be selected

855523
configuration	environment
add a configuration for each environment point to that configuration run tests and they run on the correct server

855524
value	field
what should i do to automatically retrieve the primary key field value and the record pointers stays on the record i have just created so that value can be used for de detail table

855527
swing	gwt
to specifically address the swing - gwt transition there s one simple rule

855527
swing	gwt
gwt is not swing and to build a good app you always have to know at some level what kind of html the widgets you are creating will produced and every now and again you will have to get down and dirty and modify some of the behaviour or even code some custom parts in javascript or html

855533
swing	gwt
testing a swing app with junit is mostly straight-forward but in order to get that level of coverage on a gwt app you ll need to widen your arsenal

855537
put	get
it might be possible if you can t get touch events from a subclassed uitextview to put a transparent view layer over the top of the text and get touch events from that then you would only have to figure out a way to turn this on and off for editing

855551
private-key	rsa
you need to use your own rsa private-key for signing

855551
private-key	rsa
if you ever want to sign something again using the same private-key get the rsa csp with the fromxmlstring methods passing the privatekeyxml

855562
stderr	stdout
additionally it s a good idea to close stdin stdout and stderr but i m not sure how to do that in php

855563
push	pull
try git pull first then git push

855565
contains	elements
based on those mouse events you would do your drag calculations and update the positioning of the contains elements the large image in your case

855577
comma	words
i have an input form with two textarea allowing a user to type in words separated by comma in each

855577
concatenation	comma
it then passes these to the output form which explodes the words from the comma and then concatenation them together until all possible permutations of the words are created

855599
constructor	object
so you should not be passing helper objects to the factory method the factory method should be creating the helper object it needs and passing that to the appropriate constructor

855619
constructor	object
each object would then represent the value you want to set in the constructor of the appropriate object in the order in which you want to set these variables

855621
hide	show
1 use javascript to show and hide parts of the form

855626
shell	bash
you can use the disown built-in in bash to detach a job from the shell that spawned it

855627
directory	folder
make sure your folder permissions are set so that a directory listing is allowed then just point your anchor to that folder using chmod 701 that might be risky though

855628
stderr	stdout
but he doesn t change his working directory to nor does it look like he closed open file descriptors i m not sure how this would work in php so that he s not connected to the stdin stdout and stderr of the original process

855630
shell	bash
and i can launch a bash shell from windows do ls emacs vi etc

855635
udp	tcp
beyond that if the normal tcp socket mechanisms don t fit your application then generally you need to fall back to using udp and building your own protocol features on the basic send receive properties of udp

855648
xml-serialization	xml
xml would be fine and seems like a good place to start since .net has xml-serialization built in

855648
value	field
i prefer something that saves property value rather than reaching directly into the private field

855648
configuration	upgrade
i want some way to define an upgrade path and remap the values on load preferably without writing reams of xml configuration files and i want to be able to write automated regression tests that prove i can open old files

855652
linked-list	nodes
you can trivially create a linked-list in the storage by having a known root let s call it nodes_root nodes which points to a value tuple of data prev_key next_key

855657
configuration	installation
therefore you will have to do something during the installation where you install a key on the client machine and you use that key to encrypt the configuration section

855658
google-chrome	opera
opera safari and google-chrome can not be convinced to open a file link in a page served over http

855672
uiresponder	uiview
a uiimageview is derived from a uiview which is derived from uiresponder so it s ready to handle touch events

855672
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you ll want to provide the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended methods and they ll get called if the user taps the image

855678
iteration	set
if you did need concurrent access then concurrenthashset provides a drop-in replacement that provides safe concurrent access including safe iteration over the set

855678
any	set
i d recommend in any case referring to it as simply a set throughout your code except in the one place where you construct it

855678
any	set
even if the set is read-only if it s used by a thread other than the one that creates it you do need to think about safe publication that is making sure that any other thread sees the set in a consistent state remember any memory writes even in constructor aren t guaranteed to be made available to other threads when or in the otder you expect unless you take steps to ensure this

855686
rewrite	rule
add the following rewrite rule to your apache-config

855702
postgresql	mysql
i m confident creating schema and optimizing queries in ansi-sql for sybase ms sql server mysql or postgresql

855707
order	add
i m trying to add the itunesartwork file to my iphone application in order to follow the guidelines for icons artwork for itunes

855710
startup	launch
you may still launch your x server at startup

855717
python	java
i find it amusing that for almost two decades there was consistent railing against the bondage and discipline languages for their lack of flexibility and mundane coding structures pascal cobol yet we have seen them resurface in languages like java and python

855734
silverlight	wpf
well the designer for wpf silverlight is pretty cumbersome to use

855761
vb.net	vb6
after reading the first two answers i realize it is more accurately a microsoft.visualbasic.collection which appears to be a class introduced for compatibility between vb6 and vb.net

855770
webforms	asp.net
when developing webforms asp.net applications the listview and repeater are generally the only controls that i use

855774
managed-code	unmanaged
mixed code is when you have managed-code that calls onto an unmanaged layer

855780
realloc	malloc
malloc calloc realloc free

855794
managed-code	native-code
managed-code however is precompiled bytecode in java-speak but is then processed by the just in time compiler to native-code at runtime

855794
any	set
any portability to another os instruction set is lost and must be recompiled to execute

855801
subtract	add
and then overload all operators so that you can only add subtract types with the same parameters and the you sum the parameters when doing a product

855805
perl	ruby
if there is a similar library in perl and ruby would you teach it

855814
sql-server	oracle
if you are new to oracle i d also suggest you spend a bit of time learning its transaction model as it is subtly different to sql-server which could bite you

855815
itextsharp	itext
pdfsharp is good so is itextsharp the java port of itext one of the first pdf libraries around

855823
vb.net	vb6
while i haven t seen a head-to-head comparison of the vb6 collection vs vb.net dictionary i would expect them to be similar since the underlying algorithm is essentially a hashtable either way

855833
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms page already have a javascript method for handling postbacks called __dopostback

855835
put	get
trying to get parameters from a put request using httpservlet#doput

855856
uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
look at tutorials regarding uiviewcontroller or viewcontrollers in general they will have discussion about uitabbarcontroller

855858
startup	launch
btw when launching your program through init it could launch it during an early stage of your machine startup

855864
any	set
if a request in a session could be handled by any node then that would imply that you have all-to-all replication set up in the cluster meaning the session data of node1 is replcated to node2 node3 ... node n the session data of node2 is replicated to node1 node3 .

855873
ruby	php
is there a web crawler library available for php or ruby

855885
vb.net	vb6
if you are using vb.net you are not using vb6 collections

855885
vb.net	vb6
the vb.net collection is functionally equivalent to the vb6 collection but they are not the same

855885
vb.net	vb6
has a comparison of the various .net collection types with the vb6 collection including the vb.net collection

855887
constructor	object
however you can make a class graphdatacacheserviceimpl implementing the interface a singleton by sealing it and providing only a getter property with the object created as a static variables from a private constructor

855898
malloc	free
you re unconditionally calling free without checking if the malloc succeeded so if the malloc failed and p is a null pointers then you re calling free null

855904
callback	methods
the 2 calls share a common callback that operates on the returned data and then calls another methods

855911
malloc	free
if you re doing stuff in between the malloc and free you could be overrunning a different arrays by accident and corrupting your own stack

855920
selected	listbox
when changing the selected item in a listbox i m getting a weird error where the changed item appears selected but i cannot deselect it or reselect it

855924
export	report
viewing the reporting services reports in a web browser has an export option right at the top of the report

855932
value	field
i would like a span to update when a value is entered into a text field using jquery

855937
tcp-ip	tcp
the tcp-ip protocol stack knows of course but i don t know of any way to interrogate the tcp stack to find out if everything sent has been acknowledged

855943
webforms	asp.net
you can t create a traditional asp.net webforms server control using an htmlhelper extension method the way that you describe emulate webforms like text property selected value etc... if you were able to implement such a thing using asp.net mvc then you should probably just be using asp.net webforms for your project in the first place

855943
webforms	asp.net
along with direct comparisons to the differences between asp.net webforms and asp.net mvc

855944
keydown	keyup
although you marked this as the correct answer note that you should use the keyup event rather than the change event or the keydown

855949
ruby-on-rails	django
afaik this is one of the plusses to the django ruby-on-rails framework

855951
malloc	free
if you are running on x86 you could just run your binary under valgrind and it would gather all this information for you using the standard implementation of malloc and free

855962
command-prompt	cmd
from the cmd-prompt you can view all environmental variables with the set cmd

855967
ip-address	hostname
it returns my ip-address not my hostname or isp

855975
attributes	properties
this class will serialization all read_write properties if properties is not marked by nonserializationdattributes attributes

855980
json	csv
using php i can convert mysql data or static table data to csv excel json mysql etc but is there a useful conversion script or tool that can convert table data into other formatted styled formats such as pdf and or jpg png using the php gd library or other

855996
struct	unions
recently i ve been working on some embedded devices where we have some struct and unions that need to be initialized at compile time so that we can keep certain things in flash or rom that don t need to be modified and save a little flash or sram at a bit of a performance cost

855996
struct	unions
i m not much of a c++ buff so i m wondering what simple ways there might be to make this happen in either c++ compatible c or in c++ that still allow initialization at compile time so that the struct and unions not need be initialized after program startup in sram

856002
unique	words
for collisions each bucket has a vector of words structures each of those contains a count a plaintext string and a hash unique within the bucket

856020
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you should use asp.net-mvc because you have a lot of more control about the generated client code than in webforms and is simpler than ashx handlers

856042
implicit-conversion	optional
you can extend your getargs with optional parameter type specifications for error detection or implicit-conversion and arguments count ranges

856050
hard-drive	floppy
my problem is about dl and dh.in order to point to 1st hard-drive to read from we can set it to 80h or for floppy disk we can set it to 00h

856051
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc is quite lightweight and surprisingly fast compared to webforms

856052
asp.net-mvc	webforms
httphandlers are the most light weight because the interface behind the ashx file is ihttphandler which is the basis of the page object that is used both for webforms and asp.net-mvc

856070
callback	methods
you could make use of this as your callback methods

856070
callback	methods
the second callback whichever it is will ensure that methods is called

856082
bad-request	http-error
my code works fine when i run it in visual-studio but gives me a bad-request http-error 400

856082
bad-request	http-error
well this code works fine in the local machine but gives me a bad-request http-error 400

856085
key-value	key
key-value pairs ordinarily aren t the advised storage methods but at least single rows with a single key and a single value are correct

856099
checkbox	textbox
while rendering the view page based on some condition in the controller action i want to disable all the controls textbox checkbox button etc present in the form in a asp.net-mvc view page

856100
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc webforms and the generic handler .ashx are all httphandlers implementing the ihttphandler interface

856132
entity-framework	ado.net
i m developing an asp.net app c# that connect to sql-server 2008 using ado.net entity-framework

856148
entity-framework	ado.net
not sure about the entity-framework but this is how you do this in vanilla ado.net

856153
protected	public
i personally test protected parts too because they are public to inherited types.

856163
webserver	upload
well to upload to the webserver you just need an

856163
buffering	streaming
here s a fairly generic way of buffering a streaming to a single

856173
triggers	insert
1st least attractive my preliminary understanding is that i can write a kind of custom triggers in c that could fire off a row insert

856173
python	perl
i ll also mention that i m leaning towards python for this task as easy access to the system linux commands as well as some in house perl scripts is going to be very very useful

856184
highlight	cell
example highlight cell b100 in the above example

856184
macros	vba
i don t know exactly how you d do this in c# but certainly they re available in vba and you can just record a macros do the above steps and then look at the generated code to see the autofill vba code

856208
triggers	insert
write an insert triggers which duplicates inserted rows to a secondary table

856208
any	set
if any rows are in the table delete them and do your processing or set a processing started flag and only delete from the secondary table upon successful processing

https is http hypertext transfer protocol plus ssl secure socket layer

856249
firefox	safari
if you are developing for firefox safari you can always check with firebug developer console as they show the loading sequence of files

856251
integration	payment
this is something like authorize.net payment integration

856260
addition	division
you re much more likely to get an improvement by exiting from the loop early so either store new r in a variables and compare with old r or store x r in a variables and compare that against r before doing the addition and division

856268
methods	extend
with spring asp.net-mvc it s easy to express a concept like a user is submitting the form if they use post or if they include the issubmit parameter. you d just extend simpleformcontroller and override the isformsubmission methods

856275
build-process	ant
this is replaced during the ant build-process with the correct context path for development testing production environment

856278
directory	folder
since the wrapper dll only works with the native dll when they are in the same folder the native dll should be copied to the output directory of project a

856307
display	width
how can you display a long string website address word or set of symbols with automatic line breaks to keep a div width

856309
vbscript	jscript
is there a way to do this from say vbscript or jscript

the essential difference between static and dynamic-linking is that static-linking includes the library in the application s object code while with dynamic-linking the application accesses the library on-demand from the system it s installed on

856562
string-conversion	int
it s your that s wrong not the string-conversion - php uses 32-bit int internally

856716
compression	streaming
you need to close the compression streaming before retrieving the bytes

856749
dependency-injection	inject

856852
altera	xilinx
i d avoid gate counts with fpgas here s some 4-input look-up-table estimates most of my experience is with xilinx but it ll be similar for altera and others

document	element
if you changed your processing somehow so processed not only sections but some other element too then the value of positioning would no longer necessarily correspond to the positioning of elements in your document

856886
document	editing
the library is configured in such a way that versioning is activated and document have to be checked out before editing

856887

857026
document	element
you can use the exclude-result-prefixes attributes of the xsl stylesheet element to suppress namespaces from the output document

857036
document	element
you can either use javascript which allows you to do the visual countdown or set the meta refresh tag in the element of your document as such meta http-equiv refresh content 5

857040
aggregate	grouping
as a best practice use grouping by on every column you use without an aggregate

857058
sortedlist	hashtable
because case-insensitive dictionary collection is such a common use the .net has a collectionutil class that supports creating hashtable and sortedlist objects that are case insensitive

857070
32-bit	64bit
it will be very easy if the input is limited within 32-bit or 64bit integer

857070
32-bit	64bit
i have googled but most of them are talking about the conversion within 32-bit or 64bit

857073
multiplication	exponent
for a table lookup you can extract the mantissa in 0.5 1 and exponent from the input using a function like frexp then normalize the mantissa in 64 256 using multiplication by a suitable power of 2

857084
dbix-class	dbi
class dbi and dbix-class are two fine starting points

857117

when you need limit with offset you can try some hacks like previously described but they all add some overhead for order one way and then the other or the expencive not in operation

857124
perl	awk
i ll answer with a perl one-liner because i know that syntax better than awk

857144
value	field
how can i go one step further and also list the average value contains within each field

857148
jquery	dojo
dojo isn t included but jquery is which is vaguely similar to dojo

857163
authentication	login
you could either send the user to the main page and do the authentication there and if it passes then you just continue on with the loading of the main page and if it doesn t then you send the user back to the login page like this

857176
contains	any
then have an addin that contains application events that fire after each calculation event looks at any data stored by the udfs and then rewrites the neccessary cells with warning messages about overwrite if appropriate and reset the stored data

857183
abstract	extends
but you cannot extends two abstract model classes - it also isn t very good idea anyway as your class will have too many responsibilities

857194
authentication	login
this works fine using sql-server authentication but it is a pain having to create sql-server login for loads of databases so it would be nice to use integrated security if possible

857209
windows-xp	windows
between windows-xp and vista and server 2003 and 2008 microsoft have removed the index key from hkey_local_machine software windows nt currentversion time zones and guess which value we store in our database to record an employee s time zone.

857211

easiest methods i can think of within the standard blog is to use jquery to hide the comment form - that way you only need to get the value of the field appearing somewhere on the page

857244
datagrid	textbox
in a datagrid when text in a textbox changes i want to add the value of another field in that row to an arrays

857262

somewhere in the code php the default database gets reset probably on a shared database connection

857316
environment	building
how are you referencing the assemblies for your building vs.net environment

857332

if that s required you ll do well to just pass it to a date parsing module and then checked its output for logical results

857350
associations	model
following is the associations between 2 model

857365
put	get
to get the full image path i figured out that i needed a multibinding to put the two together and have sucessfully created one

857381
contains	elements
fieldset must contains a legend followed by zero or more flow elements

857400
hosts-file	hosts
just setup an entry in the hosts

857403
ip-address	hostname
you can add the hostname and ip-address to your hosts file

857407
hosts-file	hosts
if you are creating a site and wish to map the hosts header to an ip perhaps your local dev box for testing purposes then you should consider editing the hostss-file instead

857409
buildpath	libs
i assume i ve got my buildpath wrong but i ve set the xstream libs to be in the buildpath for the project so as far as i know it should work

857416
linked-list	arrays
create a sorted hash to hold each unique element from the original arrays could also be done as a linked-list

857416
key-value	key
loop through the key s of the hash and printf d d n key-value

857427
contains	any
referer and end can contains an uri of any type as simple as or as complicated as

857448
callback	methods
an eventhandler object is associated to this connection and a callback methods is called when the connection is successful

857448
callback	methods
however it does not work for exception-handling called inside the callback methods the top level methods does not catch them and the execution fails

857450
any	set
the referer is set by your browser not by any server side mechanism

857463
for-loop	arrays
it needs one less local variable uses a while and not a for-loop and uses arrays assignment instead of the function call push

857471
while-loop	cursor
for example the old way of looping over a query is to create a cursor and then perform a while-loop over it until it returns nothing

857475
callback	methods
in that case you may want to catch the exception-handling inside the callback but not handle it - instead simply pass it back up to the main methods as part of the eventargs

857475
backgroundworker	winforms
the backgroundworker in winforms does something similar

857484
.when	ready
one function loads html page and .when ready it calls the original function

857486
order	add
the difference i suppose is that you re supposed to add new members at the end using the order property on the datamemberattribute whereas the property getting removed would probably not be at the end

857488
entity-relationship	diagram
edit you might check this cool link providing more info about entity-relationship diagram and tools

857491
pascal	basic
so a long long time ago i used to program procedurally initially with basic on my first bbc model b and then a small amount of pascal at university as well as assembly along the way

857491
perl	c++
then along came oo which seemed much more sensible all round and that was all i used with c++ perl java ruby...

857496
joystick	mouse
while they are more often used to handle touchscreen event they also map to mouse joystick clicks on emulators

857498
arguments	default
but unless you need to change the default settings you can simply pass in type.missing for all the arguments

857499
required	checked
checked for required fields

857515
javascript	dom
does anyone know if a library or program exists which i could feed with the javascript and which would then spit out the dom for my app to parse

857541
bazaar	git
pro if you have many branches you ll be pushed to adopt a modern dvcs my experience is with mercurial but i hear git or bazaar are also good rather than stay with a traditional centralized system like say svn

857548
click	mouse
for example if i drag an entity that was created in an area outside of that area it no longer responds to mouse click i have code that performs the re-parenting but somehow the diagram side of things is broken

857563
hide	show
this methods is nice to show and hide toolbar which got already activated via the addon manager but does not work for deactivated addons

857639
any	set
any ideas on how to automatically or manually set a width for this document

857639
fontfamily	font-size
sizing is perfect now and the only snag is that the font doesn t look exactly the same as the flowdocument next to it despite the fontfamily and font-size being the same segoe user-interface 15pt and that the labels look much further apart than the lines in the flowdocument

857665
32-bit	64bit
it works fine on 32bit platform but on 64bit platform openprocess returns access_denied for some processes the same processes on 32-bit can be computed fine

857671
positioning	slider
the values initializer is for providing the starting positioning of multiple-thumb slider

857671
arrays	map
i would provide an arrays of the possible values change the slider to map over the range of that arrays and then change your presentation bit to read from the appropriate arrays element

857672
javascript	dom
it is strictly business of text parsing - you shouldn t deal with running javascript and producing a new dom

857672
json	xml
you could easily find out how the ajax services work probably by receiving json and xml and extract the information

857674
switching	screens
earlier when we were using the ie6 browser then the textarea was display properly on screens but after switching over ie7 browser we have seen that after filling up 20 lines a active scrollbar start display with textarea and only 19 lines are display in textarea and 1 line is hiding in scrollbar and to check that 1 line we have to use the scrollbar

857690
order	add
i have tried to add an eventhandler to the field but then the autocomplete stops working all together and there seems to be no way to specify the order of execution of the handler either

857698
contains	elements
these arrays contains elements of the same type

857710
checkbox	button
generally button like this either do an action or indicate a status checkbox options etc

857713
web-services	security
sql 2005+ supports native web-services that you could almost use although i wouldn t suggest it because of security risks you may face

857721
authentication	login
i have set the security to shared authentication and have specified a password for the sa login

857721
command-prompt	cmd
i am able to log in using sa and password from the management studio and also from cmd-prompt using the osql cmd but when trying to log in from third party software specifically wherenet vss i get the popup the sql instance name or login information is not correct

857724
32-bit	64bit
are you running 64bit or 32-bit windows

857724
32-bit	64bit
tortoise runs as a shell extension so if your windows os is 64bit and you installed the 32-bit version of tortoise you won t see the context menus

857724
32-bit	64bit
if you use a 32-bit tool like total commander in a 64bit os and you want context menu extensions in both explorer and total commander you will actually have to install both the 32-bit and 64bit version of tortoise

857730
json	xml
according to what actionurl returned response can be an xml document a json object text etc.

857732
any	set
my problem was that i was trying to use a pack uri in a process before any wpf control windows etc had been instantiated so the pack uri scheme was not yet registered other wpf required stuff must also not be set too because manually registering the pack scheme doesn t itself fix the problem

857740
build-server	publishing
you need to add the publishing to build-server as a task under the tasks section - putting it after your last build step

857740
build-server	publishing
this will cause cc.net to only publishing to build-server when all previous tasks are completed without raising an error code

857740
build-server	publishing
typically if you know what is needed in a dos .bat file to publishing to build-server you do as follows

857744
export	csv
i was wondering how to go about export a query from pl sql to an text file or csv file

857757
configuration	logging
another possible explanation is that your configuration aren t being passed correctly to the logging framework

857757
configuration	logging
your logging configuration right at startup

857783
ole-automation	com
for the typelib marshaller to work the com interface must be ole-automation compatible

857786
contains	elements
so basically i want to call a methods on each elements of the container but it s not actually a methods of the type it s some methods on a contains type.

857806
checkbox	button
i am using two button select all and deselect all for selecting all checkbox and deselecting all checkbox

857806
selected	checkbox
only if i manually selected the checkbox then only those values are getting passed in the report

857814
data-members	private
i occasionally have classes with private static data-members

857820
expression-blend	designer
this example still allows you to view the live data from your model in design mode in visual-studio and expression-blend which i think is significant since you could have a mock data store that the designer connects to which has the smallest and largest strings that the ui can possibly encounter so that he can adjust the design based on those extremes

857820
put	get
i m a bit surprised that i even have to put a timer in my viewmodel since it seems like that is a function of inotifypropertychanged it seems redundant but it was the only way i could get the xaml user-interface to constantly once per second reflect the state of my model

857822
double	int
returns a valid int double value to postop

857822
double	int
because you are making a mathematical calculation try parsing the values into double int before you subtract them

857827
checkbox	button
i assume your select all and deselect all button are using javascript to set or unset all the other checkbox in the form

857834
textbox	button
if i have a page with a form imagine a simple one with just textbox and a submit button and i want to allow the user to dynamiccally add more textbox to the form via javascript what is the best way to handle the request server side

857836
textbox	button
edit as rightly pointed out if you want to still display values within textbox etc you can set the border-style property to none + any style declarations that you see fit and only hide elements that serve no purpose when printed such as button

857843
web-config	app-config
that will take the url from the app-config or web-config

857870
versioning	upgrade
the working copy has been subjected to too many svn versioning upgrade or whatever cleanup can t repair

857877
document	element
you could replace the lines with a different type of element such as textblocks or labels for which you can control wrapping or glyphs which are designed for fixed-format document presentation and print scenarios

857895
postback	ajax
what i would suggest is that you use an ajax updatepanel to allow the controls to be registered at the appropriate point of the page lifecycle before onload this will also make a difference on whether or not you need the boxes to persist across postback

857903
versioning	packaging
edit i put together an example of packaging slowaes and a modified versioning of anandam s pbkdf2 into windows scripting components

857903
rijndaelmanaged	aes
using this aes with a password-derived key shows good interop with the .net rijndaelmanaged class

857923
value	field
you can have a bunch of hidden field to accompany the checkbox and set their value when the checkbox are unchecked

857924
ruby	php
we are about to start a new web2 ajax app and are trying to decide if its worth the time and effort learning ruby rubyonrails instead of php codeignitor and jquery we currently use

857924
ruby	php
i would appreciate unbiased if thats at all possible talking languages frameworks comments from experienced php and ruby developers

857966
ruby	php
i can t say too much about ruby but i can say that i often feel like php gets a bad rap

857966
ruby	php
yes there is a lot of awful php code out there but you know it was mostly written by people who would have written awful ruby or awful python

857975
google-chrome	firefox
tested and working on firefox 3 google-chrome 1 and ie 6 7 and 8

857983
contains	set
instead of doing in to find the current item s user rights in a predefined set of applicable user rights you re asking a predefined set of user rights if it contains the current item s applicable value

858006
postback	ajax
you may also consider using ajax and webservices with webmethods for submitting the data instead of a postback if you re creating the controls dynamically with javascript

858017
ruby	php
i wonder when we write a program in php ruby or python how do we make it easily downloadable and installable by general users like a win32 app

858024
swing	awt
the parent logger of that logger the root logger will not get any log messages from your application but will receive messages from other parts of the jdk such as swing or awt

858030
value	field
but in java you could always resort to reflection to get the field value to sort by

858058
hide	show
just create divs on top of each other and show hide them using show and hide

858059
ruby	php
i think your question should be how do i write php ruby python apps to be able to be easily downloaded and installed on windows machines

858081
constructor	object
also i m not actually passing an object to the constructor but that part isn t important here

858091
conditional	operators
basically what is happening is that conditional operators is unable to determine the return-type of the expression

858091
conditional	operators
since an int cannot be null the third operand of the conditional operators it complains

858095
javascript	dom
don t worry about validity since you are doing this dynamically using javascript you can fill hidden element s innerhtml with your response data and then use any dom jquery functions you wish

858096
defined	declare
you need to declare and defined them seprately

858108
python	php
at least with php and python i know there are gtk bindings for windows

858117
logfile	tail
instead of loading a gigantic logfile in an editor i m using unix command-line tools like grep tail gawk etc

858119
updating	updates
be careful about updating collection from background thread not a problem in your example but if you ever need to use observablecollection than remember that it cannot be updates from non user-interface thread read more here

858128
portrait	screens
to support screens rotation on n92 z8 etc we still needed portrait and landscape versioning of some images since flipping aspect-ratio doesn t give as good results as resizing to the same or similar ratio...

858149
forwarding	port
if it was for me i would just keep it behind the firewall and use ssh port forwarding but i would like to have something simpler for this user

858162
firefox	opera
this works admittedly only tested on firefox 3.x.x and opera 9.x both on ubuntu 8.04

858162
firefox	opera
link to working example tested under firefox 3 and opera 9.x

858174
coalesce	isnull
or you need to use isnull coalesce is not null or is null in your where if one of the value you are testing can be null

858182
filtering	sorting
look at glazedlists for filtering sorting etc

858185
conditional	operators
it s because the compiler determines the type of the conditional operators by it s second and third operand not by what you assign the result to

858193
javascript	dom
the dom returns null for almost all cases where it fails to find some structure in the document but in javascript itself undefined is the value used

858194
highlight	selected
my item rendering is an image and the highlight for the selected item is under the image so you cannot see the highlight is there a way to make the highlight over the image

858206
temporary	copy
t return by reference you are creating a temporary copy

858210
csv	xml
now if there is a reason that you need to do this such as you re getting the data from say an uploaded csv or xml file

858224
order	join
which means activerecord needs to do a join and order

858233
stateless	stateful
when i change the stateful bean to a stateless bean everything works fine except of course that the state is not preserved

858253
activerecord	datamapper
and if you are not obsessed with activerecord you can also use datamapper s imap adapter

858265
value	field
it s up to you to define it as either a free field or restricting its value to what s in the database

858268
delegatecommand	mvvm
so that leaves in the wpf mvvm toolkit 0.1 project form the wpf team themselves you have a delegatecommand which also looks like an interesting way

858276
google-maps	gps
google-maps use cell-based locationing in addition to gps or when gps is not available

858287
value	field
keyfield_details to store custom field value in term of value and description

858322
target-platform	platform
i would just use microsoft s version for now and if you decide to port to another os later then implement it yourself for the target-platform and use preprocessor commands to specify your implementation on the non-windows platform s

858336
annotations	mapping
i m using hibernate annotations to indicate the mapping i want and to create the indices

858343
beautifulsoup	lxml
in particular you will want to look at the python answers beautifulsoup htmlparser and lxml

858378
downgrade	upgrade
every time you wish to change the schema you write a small class to handle the upgrade and optionally downgrade

858388
contains	set
if the sub-query returned a set of values that contains null no records would be returned at all

858391
hash	md5
the theory is that md5 creates a different hash for each input

858400
tuples	set
a selected statement will return a set of tuples and your idcode either will or will not be in this set

858402
methodology	waterfall
note i m not talking about development methodology agile waterfall etc. i m talking about design approaches

858427
freebsd	netbsd
debian ubuntu fedora mandrake red hat centos solaris suse freebsd openbsd netbsd

858430
realloc	malloc
this often comes up if one of the threads is inside malloc realloc and your current statement tries to allocate some memory

858430
any	set
also don t forget to set scheduler-locking off before continue otherwise only the current thread will make any forward progress

858446
ip-address	proxy
for sure you could take the requester s ip-address and send a http request you would send to a proxy

858448
paintcomponent	draw
another possibility is that you create a class that extends from jcomponent and program paintcomponent so it draw these three strings in different colors

858451
seam	jsf
i ve got an jsp tag that i would like to use in my jsf seam application

858473
postback	ajax
or use ajax calls to avoid postback for just updating content

858481
dialog	pop-up
if it s newer you could pop-up a friendly dialog box asking the user to upgrade

858481
vb.net	vb6
i would suggest upgrading from vb6 to vb.net for the following reasons

858493
document	element
you may try to focus hidden or absolutely positioning away input element and then focusing document

858500
hide	show
on a button click i want to hide one and show the other

858508
any	set
and as such doesn t have any ability to reach into private-members to set stuff

858514
expression	evaluation
remember the purpose of an expression tree is to capture the compile-time information about the expression and present it at runtime not the runtime value that evaluation the expression produces

858514
put	get
the expression tree you get represents the expression that you put in the lambda

858520
value	field
and then walk the list fields and returned value in the result set to get the field names

858525
pbkdf2	salt
you can specify the password salt iv and plaintext as well as the number of rfc 2898 iterations to use in the pbkdf2

858546
hide	show
alternatively you could wrap the table in a div and show hide the div with your usual methods

858557
conditional	operators
incidentally the microsoft implementation of the c# compiler actually gets the type analysis of the conditional operators wrong in a very subtle and interesting to me way

858564
any	set
if it s on the timeline your code setting the selectedplaylistitem could be being called again in any case i d stick some traces or breakpoints in where you set selectedplaylistitem to see if it s unexpectedly being called

858571
.net	wcf
.net framework 3.x .net framework 2.0 + new features wpf wf wcf etc.

858581
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
or using oracle s oracle data provider for .net odp.net instead of the microsoft oracle driver system.data.oracleclient

858584
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i am using rspec on ruby-on-rails for testing but recently looked into cucumber

858592
malloc	free
this has the disadvantage that for example strdup will still use the old malloc and a free may crash the program

858593
subtract	modulo
to decrypt subtract the random number modulo 10

858593
subtraction	addition
to solve this problem one could use xor instead of addition and subtraction

858593
digits	zero
if the first digits turns into a zero don t encrypt the first digits

858593
digits	zero
when you decrypt with xor again the first digits will turn into zero and you know that the first digits was not enrcypted

858597
directory	folder
yes i have created the logs directory under my application folder

858598
value	field
i m basically trying to set up a role in jaxb which says that whenever an null field is encountered instead of ignoring it in the output set it to an empty value

858610
subtract	add
if you absolutely must remove leading zeros from the output you can subtract 10 11 do the math mod 10 12 - 10 11 and then add 10 11 back again

858624
value	field
if you look at _result while stepping through this at runtime _result s bstr value is correct its value is egg from the description field of the table

858624
contains	any
so to summarize if i can rows put into the table via the insert scripting always blow up the app when they are accessed by stored procedure regardless of whether they contains any special characters

858627
firebird	mysql
i for one beyond additional providers like mysql firebird etc.

858641
value	field
if you generated an xml document with an empty value for a date field it won t validate properly

858644
silverlight	wpf
it seems that most developers when starting with wpf or silverlight feel everything should go into xaml that can go into xaml

858656
return-type	arguments
just like the arguments can be arraylist then why cant return-type also be arraylist

858661
bash	zsh
this works in bash and also zsh

858678
authentication	login
if i specify -u sa then i can login successfully but i d like to use windows authentication

858691
contains	any
my understanding is that this should make excel send the add-in all sheetchange events for all open workbooks without those workbooks needing to contains any macros code

858708
stderr	stdout
this will work even when prints to stderr which would confuse oli s answer and keeps stdout stderr which farzy s answer doesn t

858712
authentication	login
so it s trying to authentication you using the windows login credentials but you mustn t have your sql-server setup to accept those credentials.

858715
value	field
then you can copy the whole block again change the access is value to public and put the new public block wherever you want the public field to go - near the top where it came from originally i d guess

858723
selected	cell
selected the cell in which you want to put the value

858723
selected	cell
after pressing that equals go back to the first excel workbook and selected the cell the content of which you want entered in the second workbook

858739
perl	ruby
i d look into perl and test more - or possibly some of the ruby test stuff

858768
postgresql	mysql
but if the software needed to work with many different databases - oracle postgresql mysql sql server and db or if the test db at work was down for refreshes a lot i d probably write the pure unit test that existed totally in isolation

858768
getter	setter
i find using terms like unit extensively then getting a definition-weenie about it leads to people doing things like mocking out the filesystems or mocking getter and setter - activity that i find unhelpful

858778
directory	folder
cannot remove folder text-base the directory is not empty.

858786
contains	set
this is a separate dll which contains a set of resoures that are dynamically loaded into your application

858787
authentication	login
your error is quite literally saying you re trying to use windows authentication but your login isn t from a trusted domain

858816
binaries	install
however due to policy issues i can t install custom binaries on production machines

858822
quirks-mode	doctype
remember to put a doctype at the beginning or the page will render in quirks-mode

858827
quirks-mode	doctype
you have no doctype so browsers will enter quirks-mode and get lots of things wrong ie more than others

858835
contains	any
the only way to ensure that some html markup does not contains any javascript is to filtering it of all unsafe html tags and attributes in order to prevent cross-site scripting xss

858835
blacklist	whitelist
see this article on html sanitization which offers some specific examples of why you should whitelist rather than blacklist

858835
contains	elements
just from observing it briefly you should notice that it contains a very limited number of elements names

858839
sql-server	oracle
oracle syntax sql-server is similar

858847
postback	ajax
asp.net trace doesn t suit me since it ignores ajax partial postback though just they are the tight place

858852
value	field
when there are errors with the form and it is returned to the browser the selected options are not re-populated with the selectedions the user made even though the returned value for those field match the value of options in the selecteds

858852
value	field
also when the form is returned these field are not marked as having errors even though their value are blank

858852
value	field
if you enter a value into one or both of these field and submit the form without completing part of it any part of it the form is returned to the user as would be expected but the duration and frequency field are not re-populated with the user s selection

858852
value	field
these value match value on the options in the selected field

858857
multiplication	addition
but if you don t need to do any addition or multiplication then you could keep 64bit value as 4-character strings as javascript uses utf-16

858865
hard-drive	floppy
emulation - the bios emulates either a floppy or hard-drive and you can read your kernel through the int13 calls with either device 00 or device 80

858901
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
while not a port cakephp is very much similar to ruby-on-rails

858901
cakephp	symfony
symfony is a solid framework but if you re looking for something more rails-esque i recommend you try cakephp

858908
put	get
when writing services i ve often put a line like this in the beginning to get the current directory to behave like a normal application

858939
directory	folder
anyone know of a command-line utility or one that can run as a command-line that will collect all the .jpg files in a directory tree to a single folder only copying files that change

858968
design-time	designer
i would like to be able to give a better design-time experience and show that same transparency in the visual-studio designer

858976
any	set
while the jdbc spec does not specify whether or not the all data in the result set would get fetched any well-written driver won t do that

858979
openbsd	linux
if you have sophisticated networking on your workstation like openbsd s firewall or linux s traffic control then you should configure traffic shaping based on destination network

858993
directory	folder
you need to download the zlib binaries and place the items in the include folder into your c++ include directory

858997
integer	zero
if you write a big number to the first line of the file uint32.maxvalue or uint64.maxvalue then when you find the correct actual number you can replace that number of bytes with the correct number but left padded with zero so it s still a valid integer

859004
defined	declare
use of extern is wrong if you want to declare and simultaneously defined a file scope variables

859004
defined	declare
file scope variables are implicitly defined with a default-value of 0 or null if you do not explicit assign a value to them - unlike block-scope variables that you declare at the top of a function

859025
loading	gif
3 months late but i am having a very similar problem although not even loading a gif but simply generating a transparency image - say no background a colored shape - where when saving to jpeg all colors are messed up not only the background

859039
any	set
the deploys are set to fail if any sql errors occur

859040
csv	zip
in my case it was processing large zip files with csv like files that add up to 30 000 records to the database after which the user needs to confirm some information.

859069
click	mouse
however it can t be macroed as far as i know but it can be accomplished with a few mouse click

859079
linux	unix
...firebird is a relational database offering many ansi sql standard features that runs on linux windows and a variety of unix platforms

859099
arrays	loops
i m thinking about creating an arrays of markers at creation to loops through based on the markers location but that feels really inefficient to me

859124
nhibernate	ado.net
whether it be web-services ado.net linq to sql nhibernate etc

859147
margins	padding
as ricebowl remembered to comment you might need to increase your left margins or padding to make the bullet points stay put because instead of the bullet points being inside the they are now placed outside

859153
spaces	output
analysing your compiler s output is a good place to start too though they tend to optimize for speed rather than for spaces

859162
f#-interactive	fsi
the output of fsi f#-interactive repl describing the inferred type of a binding

859165
vbscript	jscript
edit the page language is jscript too not the normal vbscript

859171
webserver	upload
the problem is that after the file has upload to the webserver you cannot directly call the ssis package from the asp.net code because an ssis package will only run on a server that has sql-server installed on it

859178
safari	opera
in addition if you ever want your greasemonkey script to work in non-gm environments such as opera s gm-esque user scripts or greasekit on safari it ll help not to use gm-unique constructs such as require

859181
python	ruby
or if ruby or python already has such a library that can do that

859185
select	union
or you could say select 1 as selector union all select 2

859188
any	set
we need to maintain v1 s major feature set but fix any bugs as they re found.

859188
bazaar	git
i am going to look at mercurial and bazaar as well as git though

859206
unsafe	out
it means you re attempting some form of cross origin access which is unsafe -- while it may seem benign it s probably worth trying to find out why you re hitting it if you use the nightlies or the safari4 beta you can use the debugger in the web-inspector and make it break on all exception-handling which will let you see when it s actually attempting the cross-origin access

859218
forwarding	port
is there any sort of port forwarding magic i can do

859226
vb.net	vb6
this is probably why for example microsoft s style guidelines recommended that vb6 programmers put a type prefix with variable names but that vb.net programmers do not

859229
forwarding	port
here s a tutorial on port forwarding

859230
unsigned	short
this way you need to remember just 3 unsigned short integers in memory

859244
.net	wcf
but because you are using .net 3.5 already i would suggest using a wcf service to set up this communication expose operation contracts that do the job and set the bindings to netnamedpipesbinding in the config

859266
put	get
so now my question is how can i get this to work without having to put the dll in the gac or having to copy the dll into the web-deployment project folder

859273
contains	any
any available designated machine can contains the incoming file then our ssis package looks up the file location information from the database

859273
webserver	host
i personally don t know about the viabilty of using your webserver as the file host in this situation all my work has been on internally hosted apps

859274
dialog	pop-up
fyi the reason i am trying to do this is because i am writing an eclipse plugins and i would like to pop-up dialog that are not modal to the ide but that are modal blocking to my user-interface logic

859292
union-all	union
the all modifier makes union return all rows union-all maybe it can be applied to minus

859307
click	mouse
the problem was that if the user tries to interact with a tolecontrol from which twebbrowser descends the first mouse click is eaten

859315
ruby-on-rails	rspec
both rspec and cucumber come with some default tasks which work with ruby-on-rails but you can customize the tasks to suit your needs

859317
python	ruby
languages like ruby and python are chock full of things geared toward computer programmers

859317
ruby	php
if you hire a python or a ruby programmer just by virtue of knowing the language that programmer is many many times more likely to appreciate clean well organized code than a php developer

859317
ruby	php
the choice to write rails in ruby isn t an indication that ruby is better than php which many could argue

859317
cakephp	symfony
you re not being held back using a php framework like zend framework cakephp or symfony

859317
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
cakephp and symfony are both directly modelled after ruby-on-rails even if they aren t direct ports

859323
swing	swt
but again i don t see how this could help you since eclipse uses swt instead of swing

859324
any	set
can a spring bound command object be set to a persisted object before any post-submit binding occurs

859326
python	java
i m currently working in java and php and was evaluating python

859335
silverlight	wpf
when i start up vs 2008 to work on a wpf silverlight app and open a xaml or xml file the xaml xml editor is no longer working

859336
opera-mini	opera
as far as i know the only browser written in j2me is opera-mini not to get confused with opera mobile which is a different thing

859346
default	reset
you can reset this back to the designer by pressing set as default when the designer you want is selected in the list in the open with dialog

859356
ifconfig	linux
it looks like a way to find out the local ip address is by ipconfig on pc and ifconfig on the mac and linux and to do it programmatically it will be gethostbyname

859369
selected	cell
edit for clarification suppose a specific cell is already selected and in editing mode

859372
selection	highlight
for example i ll usually create a new class that extends tilelist then override the methods responsible for drawing the highlight and selection indicators to get a bit more control over the way those functions draw the indicators or sometimes i ll just comment out their contents altogether such that nothing gets drawn

859391
selected	textbox
do you mean to change the selected row in a datagridview or is there a textbox in your datagridview that you want to move the caret for

859401
filesystems	fileserver
another approach is use a shared filesystems such as nfs each worker machine mount the same directory on the shared fileserver and each worker write its processing results into a separate file on the shared fileserver

859404
return-value	arguments
your problem is that you are giving it an arguments which causes the function to be executed and the return-value substituted as the arguments to bind

859405
communication	messages
assuming you are using windows communication foundation for your web service s you could create a client messages inspector to capture the inbound communication and parsing out the parameters and store them into a database-table

859422
oracle	mysql
to make a sub query you can use row count in oracle and limit in mysql

859423
contains	any
my folder can contains both assemblies with exports and without ones but i need only assemblies that satisfied any imports in the app

859443
integer	digits
and noting that 10 12 is almost 2 40 2 39.863 it seems natural to convert your 12 digits number into a 40 bit integer and feed this number into a block cipher with a block length of 40 bits

859443
digits	zero
the remaining problem is that the blowfish might return a number up to 1 099 511 627 775 with 13 digits and that the returned number might contains leading zero but i believe that this can be solved in a second step

859443
digits	zero
my first thought was applying something like a burrows-wheeler transform to the string representation of the number in order to get at least one zero to the front of the number eleminating the 13th digits and then modify all remaining digitss for example 0 - 9 1 - 8 2 - 7 ... to turn additional leading zero into other digitss

859449
linked-list	arrays
but i also know that the right choice between treeset hashset or linked-list arraylist is crucial for performance and always using vector and arrays can t be right

859452
sql-server	oracle
is there any way of copying a database from oracle to sql-server 2005

859459
bonjour	avahi
if you run bonjour on your windows systemds and avahi on your linux systemds you can do away with the need to determine each systemd s ip-address

859461
sql-server	oracle
for example you would do this if you wanted to correlate data from sql-server and oracle together in one report

859468
gridsplitter	splitter
is the gridsplitter the wpf replacement for the winforms splitter

859468
gridsplitter	splitter
if i have items inside a stackpanel or a dockpanel can i still use a gridsplitter the way i used the splitter in winforms

859478
while-loop	cursor
replace the cursor with a combination of a table variable with identity-column counter and while-loop

859482
message	alert
when i try doing this to alert directly firebug gives me the following error message

859484
silverlight	wpf
some shadereffects that run in either wpf or silverlight

859492
couchdb	hbase
my question are any of the newer storage models bigtable hbase couchdb rdf stores etc. superior to a rdbms for this purpose

859497
internet-explorer	google-chrome
your code actually works in google-chrome but won t work in firefox and off the top of my head i m going to say it won t work in internet-explorer either which is generally not friendly about modifying native objects and functions

859528
updating	updates
first if you must use a cursor and you re updating stuff then declare the cursor with the for updates clause

859538
similarity	distance
now we can calculate the similarity of two histogram and as the euclidian distance of both histogram

859547
powerpc	arm
what i just said applies to most used machines x86 arm powerpc sparc

859548
sql-server	oracle
you can migrate from oracle to sql-server with microsoft s sql-server migration assistant

859548
sql-server	oracle
i have only experience with databases with simple procedures and could just rewrite them and do the data copy to empty tables in sql-server with the import functionality using oracle connector usable from sql-server if you have installed oracle client tools to the sql-server machine

859588
versioning	upgrade
bear in mind that you can buy upgrade editions of vs and upgrade from the express versioning or even eclipse

859614
linux	unix
on unix linux osx you can

859620
gridsplitter	grid
gridsplitter only works in a grid and is the easiest way to allow users to resize controls

859624
postback	ajax
this will cause a postback so ajax might be a good way to keep the user experience nice

859640
arguments	default
the second arguments to the dollar function is the context node and default to document it searches the entire dom

859643
datepart	dateadd
finally this code is t-sql so you ll probably need to convert the datepart and dateadd to whatever the equivalent is in sqlite

859645
recvfrom	datagram
just send the datagram contains its name then use recvfrom - or equivalents - to catch it at the other pcs

859657
order	add
simple just add an order by clause to your sql

859659
revision	rcs
we currently use rcs as our revision control system and everything is stored in 1 rcs directory - ugly i know - that s why i am working towards something better

859659
configuration	environment
one project in our environment could involve program a b and c and configuration file aa

859670
difference	zero
taking square root is not necessary but taking squares is as just difference may sum to zero

859677
relational-database	rdbms
to be honest i don t prefer ms-access as a relational-database management system rdbms

859682
integrated-security	connection-string
in a similar case i stored the connection-string for the dataset in a settings file app.config default behaviour in visual-studio when creating a dataset with integrated-security to a local development database

859686
quirks-mode	doctype
first get a proper doctype for your page so that it s not rendered in quirks-mode

859709
repository	entity
i am using a singleton methods to get to my entity repository which is located inside the datalayer

859723
any	set
you can add the images to any folder you wish and then set the build action for the images to embedded resource

859743
any	set
another useful thing about jmx is that you can remotely change variables on the fly for instance if you have some sort of pool set up that has a maximum total amount this maximum amount can be changed remotely without having to restart or change any configuration files on your application server

859747
processor	affinity
now that i know one core is slower than the others i can get accurate benchmarking results by setting the processor affinity to the same core for all runs

859747
multiplication	addition
floating point multiplication and addition

859747
processor	affinity
when i explicitly set the processor affinity then my application does not slow down on core #2

859747
processor	affinity
however if it chooses to run on core #2 without an explicitly set processor affinity then the application runs about 10 slower

859747
processor	affinity
that explains why my simple test cases did not show the same slowdown as they all explicitly set the processor affinity

859747
processor	affinity
so it looks like there is some process that likes to live on core #2 but it gets out of the way if the processor affinity is set

859747
processor	affinity
bottom line if you need to have an accurate benchmarking of a single-threaded program on a multicore machine then make sure to set the processor affinity

859762
boolean	int
assume active is a boolean field tiny int with 0 or 1

859782
hashtable	sorted
print all items stored in a binary-search-tree in sorted order or print all items stored in a hashtable in sorted order

859782
hashtable	sorted
it would take longer to print the items of a hashtable out in sorted order because a hashtable is never sorted correct

859784
processor	cpu
you may have applications that have opted to be attached to the same processor cpu affinity

859796
updating	updates
is there an easier way to pass in an object and updates the properties of that object so i can have something like this without it updating the original object

859813
hashtable	sorted
hashtable are sorted by some hash function not by their natural sort order so you d have to extract all the entries o n and sort them o nlogn whereas you can traverse a binary-search-tree in natural order in o n

859815
content-disposition	content-length
i m already setting the content-type header to application pdf and i ve tried setting content-disposition and content-length

859816
hashtable	sorted
correct a hashtable is not sorted in the way you probably want

859816
hashtable	sorted
elements in hashtable are not quite fully sorted usually although the arrangement is often kind of in the neighborhood of a sort

859818
parentheses	operators
you can always override the operators order with parentheses

859821
hashtable	sorted
you are correct about hashtable they are not sorted

859826
hashtable	sorted
correct printing sorted data stored in a hashtable would be slower because a hashtable is not sorted data

859838
postgresql	firebird
i will vote for sqlite first because it s compact lite and fast but depend on your application you may go with other choices like firebird or postgresql

859850
google-chrome	firefox
you could use firefox s fireshot extension and then use microsoft s paint and alt-prtscr to add the surrounding google-chrome

859864
bug-tracking	workitem
you can work with workitem for bug-tracking

859866
design-time	designer
secondly if you remove the section from xsd it will surely throw an error becuase it is not only used at runtime but it is also used by the visual-studio dataset designer at design-time to fetch the database-schema of the underlying database so that you can design the typed dataset in the designer

they can contain a highly-useful memo parameter that allows any arbitrary context or set of objects to bubble with the event

859938
type-conversion	int
i m trying to figure out exactly how .net internally handles the type-conversion process so i was looking for the implementation of op_equality in .net reflector but int doesn t have one

859946
javascript	dom
the execution needs to happen after the dom is fully loaded by the browser and can be implemented by encapsulating the call within a function and calling that function via the the onload event of the body or by using a javascript library like jquery to hook into the load event of the page

setting the content-disposition and content-type headers should do it but you might also need to call response.clearheaders to clear other headers that have been set

860159
python	c++
while erich s solution is probably better for your specific use case checking if a song has already been played is very fast amortized o 1 with a hash-based structure such as a set in python or a in c++

860175
defined	declare
if the function is not declare inline in the class definition it should be defined in another .cpp file

860185
hashtable	sorted
in which case the the speed of the bst vs the hashtable would have to come down to the amount of time it takes to fill the hashtable in the sorted order

860192

860200
gethashcode	equals
i have seen several solutions that provide base-class with id and id-based gethashcode equals

860200
gethashcode	equals
i do not see a equals gethashcode benefits either since the identity map implementation should guarantee that reference equality is the id equality anyway

860203
dialog	pop-up
in aptitude the menus are correctly outlined in line drawing characters but not the are you sure you wish to exit pop-up dialog

860210
binary-tree	skip-lists
binary-tree skip-lists vs

860226
gethashcode	equals
as far as equals and gethashcode go these are for order in lists where you create a custom order

860228
javafx	swing
i ve built a jruby desktop application with a swing gui 100 jruby and i m toying with the idea of replacing the gui with javafx for a more slick feel

860254

860351
derived-class	base-class
it has to do with how the public members of the base-class are exposed from the derived-class

860351
protected	public
protected - base-class s public members will be protected

860352
environment	building
if you re in some sort of loading environment where you don t care about either of these then use ctas create-table as selected to make a new table with the modified value building the indexes constraints etc and then swap the table names

860353
protected	public
there are three accessors that i m aware of public protected and private

860353
protected	public
the same happens with public private and protected inherited

860363
derived-class	base-class
it s essentially the access protection of the public and protected members of the base-class in the derived-class

860363
derived-class	inherited
with public inherited the derived-class can see public and protected members of the base

860387
data-members	private
private data-members however cannot

860387
data-members	private
the value is still encapsulated so if we have an instantiation of this class called myobj then myobj.myprotectedmember won t work so it is similar in function to a private data-members

860389
keyboard	mouse
it controls the keyboard mouse pointer grabs a set of gtk.gdk.screen objects

860395
protected	public
when inheriting you can in some languages change the protection type of a data-members in certain direction from protected to public

860405
hash	md5
since i don t feel like writing my own hash function and md5 is available my current approach is to use the first 32 bits first 8 hex digits from an md5 hash

860405
hash	md5
in other words are the first 32 bits of an md5 hash just as random as any other substring

860407
order	join
i thought i asked a similar question in sql order by and left outer join doesn #39

860422
compact-framework	.net
this article while not exactly what you are asking was very helpful when i was redesigning a .net cf application creating a multiple form application framework for the .net compact-framework

860424
hash	md5
of an md5 hash just as random as any

860425
hash	md5
you should therefore be safe to use just the first 32 bits of an md5 hash

860442
message	alert
firstly how would you get google alert information into a database other than to parsing the text of the email message that google sends you

860449

860546
account	in-app
i have an existing asp.net application that talks to load balanced wcf services iis hosted in-app pool running under account configured as serviceprincipalname etc.

860565
order	add
one way short of modifying the plugins source would be to pick up on this example and add a click event handler to your header cells to triggers your sort using a defined order

860576
contains	any
so my question is can anyone tell me for any particular linux encrypted fs whether the en|de cryption is done below the buffer cache and therefore the cache contains plaintext or above and the cache contains ciphertext

860587
tcp-ip	tcp
also - did you check from the configuration manager tool if tcp-ip properties are properly configured tcp port properly set etc.

860588
derived-class	base-class
a common way to do compile-time polymorphism and give access to the derived-class members through the base-class is through the crtp pattern

860615
environment	building
in fact my projects gets building and runs fine from my command-line environment but eclipse throws errors

860623
daemons	systemd
the gradual increase in memory consumption lets the daemons clean up the systemd without killing my app

860626
packets	ping

860633
selected	button
i m trying to apply a datatrigger to a button and it depends on a property from the currently selected item of a treeview

860633
selected	button
the idea is that i want to change the text of a button depending on a property of the selected item

860633
object-reference	instances
the setter complains about content not being valid because it doesn t have a qualifying typename but if i change it to button.content it then complains of object-reference not set to an instances of an object

860646
hosts-file	hosts
the name localhosts is an alias from 127.0.0.1 in the hostss-file if you edit the hostss-file unix etc hostss windows c windows system32 drivers etc hostss and change localhosts for any other word then you ll access your local hosts using that other word

860677
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

860679

860716
coldfusion	.post
yet another .post on cffeed and columnmap raymond camden s coldfusion blog

860717
contains	set
as sets in ocaml are immutable you effectively need to create for each item of the list a new set that contains the previous set plus that new item

860721
directory	folder
you put it in your c python26 lib site-packages directory under your own folder

860768
google-chrome	firefox
so far works great with ie firefox safari and google-chrome on windows and firefox and safari on macs

860773
selected	button
you can pick the debugging mode by pressing the selected button in the middle next to the attach to section

860788

860819
punctuation	words
check for sequences ending punctuation that follow words that don t start with uppercase letters

860824
driver	kernel
handle.exe has a kernel driver in order to do that

860830
value	field
jaxb was still ignoring my null value in spite of defining a default-value for my field

860834
keydown	keyup
it watches for virtual key messages and when it recognizes a keydown keyup combinations it adds character messages

860846
any	set
let s say you have a form with any of the fixed border styles and set the starting location to 0 0

860866
constructor	object
one of the pages take an object as a constructor

860877
arrays	loops
saving space and time on embedded systems - if you loops over arrays shorter than 255 on 8bit microprocessor writing

860883
conditional	operators
since your expression is using a conditional operators the compiler is too eager to assume your literal values are ints and then the assignment fails

860885
dbd	dbi
i can t reproduce this using debian s perl 5.10 dbi 1.605 and dbd postgresql 2.8.7 against postgresql 8.3.7

860885
any	set
i suggest isolating your problem to a small scripting like above and running it with dbi_trace set fairly high any seeing what difference you see

860907
32-bit	64bit
it is allowed to be 32-bit or 64bit

860915
buildpath	libs
create a user library java buildpath user libs with all your class files and add it to every project you need it

860916
32-bit	64bit
compile that same code on a 64bit machine and it would virtually be guaranteed to not work given that most 64bit machines allocate 8 bytes for an int so you would end up with 128 bits allocated and 32-bit of gap between your two sets of 32 bit flags

860927
any	set
when you create the alert set the deliver to to feed and then you can consume the feed xml as you would any other feed

860940
append	input
when i hit return it sees that as end of input rather than append the newline to the uitextview

860975
change-password	login
it means that when they login you can see if the mustchangepassword entry is set in their profiling and redirect to the change-password page

860992
javascript	dom
javascript image preloading works because when a dom element that contains an image is created the image is downloaded and cached

861006
perl	ruby
unfortunately i m not a ruby guy but maybe an example in perl will get you headed in the right direction

861016
directory	folder

861035
search-engine	web-crawler
i m currently developing a custom search-engine with built-in web-crawler

861044
global-assembly-cache	gac
you cannot use partials reference to assemblies in the global-assembly-cache meaning your control will throw the same exception-handling if assemblies are in the gac

861045
boolean	int
i always get 0 from int and false from boolean for all record members

861097
any	set
since you can not cut multiple pieces at once for any number of pieces m you want where m is in the set 1..n you will always need m-1 cuts

861101
directory	folder
installutil.exe lives in the framework folder somewhere in your windows directory

861111
post-increment	pre-increment
in c++ ++x is to be preferred over x++ because for classes with overloaded operators best practice is for post-increment to be implements in terms of the pre-increment

861112
post-increment	pre-increment
the first is pre-increment and the second is post-increment

861122
post-increment	pre-increment
well the pre-increment operation ++x returns the result of the variables after the increment has been done whereas the post-increment operation x++ returns the result of the variables before the increment has been done

861123
post-increment	pre-increment
pre-increment is more efficient than post-increment because for post-increment the object must increment itself and then return a temporary contains its old value

861148
windows-server	windows
i would like to have a windows 2003 server fire a script to fire another script in a separate windows-server 2008 computer

861169
protected	public
if you change it to protected or public does it then work

post-increment	pre-increment
and you should try to use it on it s own unless you specifically need the post-increment or pre-increment behaviour for something

861219
dependency-injection	inject
for example if you use dependency-injection di then you can often inject a different strategy at runtime by changing an xml file

861220
associations	model
to summarize do not add belongs_to unless you need bidirectional associations between model

861222
while-loop	loops
you would declare a table variable to hold the results of the stored procedure and then loops through them in a while-loops

861229
selection	highlight
i think it s easier to turn off selection and highlight effects then create what you re expecting in the rendering

861271
uitableview	uiview
this removes the menu uiview and loads the scores uiview which subsequently initiates the process of populating a uitableview with values

861271
uitableview	uiview
again this removes the menu uiview and loads the scores uiview which subsequently initiates the process of populating a uitableview with values

861277
executable	upx
executable image compactors like upx are not recommended for dlls in particular and for executables that may have many instances running because the in-memory decompression acts like relocation in preventing the in-memory image from being shared between multiple processes

861283
directory	folder
you dig into the repository folder s hook directory and all you need is there

861289
vbscript	vba
below is the implementation of it done in vb6 with a reference to tlbinf32.dll some demo vbscript and output and the wrapping of that functionality in some vba

861296
any	set
i understand that only one instance of any object according to .equals is allowed in a set and that you shouldn t need to get an object from the set if you already have an equivalent object but i would still like to have a .get methods that returns the actual instance of the object in the set or null given an equivalent object as a parameter

861301
xml-binding	xsd.exe
it uses the xmltextreader to iterate through the document and creates doclets which it deserializes using the xmlserializer and xml-binding classes generated with xsd.exe

861336
value	field
now for the question i want to find a way to locate the field used to store i s value

861336
ref	out
if i have an out or ref parameter i can use unsafe c# or raw msil to convert that parameter into a raw pointers a reference or a typedreference

861336
ref	out
so what i m looking to do is write a function that takes an out ref parameter and searches the calling iterator s fields to find a corresponding field

861336
reflection	runtime
given the overhead involved in runtime reflection in .net i suspect that this isn t possible without either preprocessing my source code or post-processing my assemblies after compilation

861356
for-loop	arrays
in this example i 0 set in a for-loop and the value held in that dimension of the arrays is a string

861358
windows-xp	windows

861379
webforms	asp.net
the realization that many web developers would like a more hands on approach to web development which embraces the opinionated programming model convention over configuration and strays away from the stateful abstraction that asp.net webforms provides

861379
ruby-on-rails	django
is it a result of the success of both ruby on ruby-on-rails and django

861392
google-chrome	firefox

is it possible with javascript and without using a framework such a jquery to have a simple form with a a list of checkbox or radio button and if a particular one is selected expand to show further further checkbox radio button

861422
virtual-machine	parallels
is the java virtual-machine really a virtual-machine in the same sense as my vmware or parallels file

861425
hide	show
you ll need to write dom traversal code to find elements in the form event binding code to bind functions to the events for the form elements this differs between ie and non-ie and then use the style.display property for sub-elements to hide or show them

861426
radio-button	checkbox
what you will probably want to do is just have an onclick event handler on each checkbox or radio-button and when that is clicked then create a new div and populate it with the extra information or if that information was already populated and was just hidden using css then have the event handler make it visible

861427
virtual-machine	vmware
jvm is a process virtual-machine whereas the vmware and the kind are system virtual-machines

861427
virtual-machine	parallels
pvm parallels virtual-machine are not

contains	set
if security is an issue and the access file is the only control you have you are unable to set security on the folder contains all the linked files. then you would have to embed

861526
constructor	object
there is no class or constructor you re simply assigning properties to an object using literals thus the name object literal notation

861553
virtualization	vmware
vmware is an example of full virtualization and seeks to virtualize a physical hardware architecture so that different unmodified guest operating systems can sit on it

861553

hyperlink	embed
i just wanted to show that you can embed anything into textblock including hyperlink and anything into hyperlink

861639
python	ruby
for example with the dlr you can execute any arbitrary ruby or python script in an application written in c#

861643
where-clause	sql
once you find the row you can update it or you can use the where-clause with the update sql statement but i find that to be a bit dangerous due to the possibility of inadvertently updating multiple rows without checking the content first to make sure it is what you want

861654
plesk	whm
plesk is a similar commercial hosting management suite similar to cpanel in fact most hosting providers who offer whm cpanel also offer plesk which has built in tomcat support

contains	set
obviously if you re not sure if the element is in the set or not check with the contains methods beforehand

861703
contains	elements
this isn t efficient compared to for example hashset s contains methods which does find the stored elements but won t return it

861703
contains	elements
if your sets may contains many elements it might even be a reason to use a heavier workaround like the map implementation you mentioned

861710

861733
height	frame
i have it and it covers all of the height and frame for portrait and landscape mode

861747
versioning	upgrade
if the new versioning is very different from the old one you might want to have an etl process to do the upgrade instead of just sql scripting

861771
contains	set
an object of type option that is either empty or contains the found object if it exists in the set

861775
uitextview	uilabel
so the user finishes editing the uitextview you get the string of text and pass it to the uilabel

861775
uitextview	uilabel
when you detect the touch on the uilabel you simply restore the hidden uitextview and restore the string you saved

861781
ruby	php
is in php or h user_data in ruby on rails good enough for defending all cases of xss cross-site scripting attacks

861782
mta	sta
if the component is mta the requests are execute in parallels if it s sta they are execute one at a time to prevent shared variables corruption

861794
versioning	downgrade
it has a special dsl for writing migrations it can automatically generate downgrade scripting and it tracks versioning so you don t have to write any code to do that

861800
contains	set
i have some problem where i set 2 floated div elements one of div contains selected element when the page loaded the divs didn t have the problem but as soon i click on of the element s on selected box the div that positioning in right shift to bottom

firefox	opera
ps try to ignore the ugly table header soon i ll fix it it s currently ok on opera firefox ie8 browser

861803
versioning	migrate
my advice is not to try standardize on the later versioning of visual-studio you can migrate the the solutions project files easily

861812
selection	cell
you will need to decide when to add the button maybe on cell selection maybe in editing mode.

861814
integer	zero
rather it returns an integer that indicates the number of matches--which in your case is probably zero

861827
versioning	upgrade
you can easily upgrade the versioning wihtout a hassle

861839
contains	elements
you selected all td elements that have a label that contains choice 1 and then you selected the input elements inside these td elements

861840
any	set
the lots of compilation units approach to c++ development usually comes from a desire to decouple classes and minimise dependencies between classes so the compiler only has to rebuild the minimal set of files in case you make any changes

861860
attributes	properties
we re using json to change properties an attributes on our widgets while we re using innerhtml on initial rendering or complete updates on widgets

861868
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
the simulator is case-insensitive to file names but the device is case-sensitive

861889
realloc	malloc
c++ has stricter type checking so you might need to add a cast to each call to malloc realloc calloc

861894
exception-handling	try-catch
i just get no exception-handling at all if i start them from the command-line neither in the eventlog or even if i try to print on the output the result of a try-catch block on all my application.

scp	ssh
you can transfer builds using mechanisms such as scp or ssh quite easily

861905
mouseevent	mouseenter
void mouseenter mouseevent e

861930
boost	stl
unfortunately this cannot be done before including headers using placement new as some stl and boost header do

861934
spreadsheet	apache-poi
see the apache-poi horrible spreadsheet format api for more details on hssfdateutil

861962
any	set
imho an advanced option for your user to set the connectiontimeout value would be better than any constant value you determine

862004
printf	scanf
length-limit what gets read in - i ve used 27 here as an example and unfortunately the scanf family require the field width literally in the format string and can t use the mechanism that the printf can for passing the value in

862013
logout	login
my current design is to do a post api foobar user with a body op login for logging in and similarly for logout the body op logout will be sent

862030
python	java
i don t really know much about exactly what security capabilities you get within the java virtual machine or .net runtimes but you might want to consider if running your python code with jython or ironpython might allow you to get added security

862037
connection-pooling	pool
connection-pooling is still in effect each connection spec will have its own pool leading to lots of pool of one or two connections

862045
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you ll be subclassing uiscrollview and overriding the touchesbegan withevent methods touchesmoved withevent methods and the touchesended withevent methods

862046

first set the uiscrollview s contentsize to have a width that is equal to or less than the width of the uiscrollview s frame

862047
selected	checkbox
i d like to implement a selected all checkbox in xaml

862047
selected	checkbox
then i have a checkbox outside of the listview which i want to have a selected all -behaviour

862047
selected	checkbox
i could easily solve the problem in my viewmodel however i think it would be more elegant to do this in xaml since the selected all checkbox doesn t directly have anything to do with my viewmodel

862051
graphicsmagick	imagemagick
apart from what the graphicsmagick comparison says i see that imagemagick still got updates and it seems that the two are almost identical

862055
persistent	transient
does hibernate provide a methods that returns an object s state transient persistent detached

862067
authentication	login
for the purposes of login i would prefer to try to maintain statelessness - this would mean requiring the client to pass http authentication on each request this means passing the correct authentication header each time

862072
endpoint	uri
the endpoint should be at the uri api users for all crud operations

862072
authentication	login
for login the end point should be api login but you would be better off using http authentication here

862081
udp	tcp
i think it would be helpful to review the udp protocol to understand the differences between udp and tcp

862093
contains	any
so i have a container any kind probably std map or std vector which contains objects of a class with some network thing running in a thread that checks if it is still connected the thread is defined inside that class and launches when constructed

firefox safari cancel these requests and allow navigation to another page

862168
response	timeout
if i get you right the ejb implements the service and it shall respond within 5 secs or rollback the transaction and send a timeout response

862190
default	reset
i am extending linq to sql entity classes using partial classes and i m wondering how to best reset some properties on the entity objects to their default state

862192
filesystems	xfs
since we are developing filtering not a new filesystems the behavior should be the same as the underlying filesystems ntfs hfs+ xfs

862209
getter	setter
the obvious way to allow editing of a positioning is to build a viewmodel which has getter and setter as well as a topositioning methods to extract the validated immutable positioning instances

862214
triggers	insert
i have a sql-server instead of insert triggers that populates a single column promocode

862216
mousedown	mouseup
when i have many controls on a form label button etc that do almost the same thing i often use one methods to handle all the controls click mousedown mouseup events

862222
ref	out
edit based on the comment from boris it may be worth elaborating on the difference between a ref parameter and an out parameter

862232
click	mouse
oh if for gui applications it s a little trickier as you don t really want to get to the point where you test mouse click and read pixels

862239
children	nodes
i want to get all a nodes that do not have any b children

862240
triggers	insert
insert is a read only temporary table which can be accessed in any triggers

862247
reflection	runtime
you could use reflection to dinamically load the assembly at runtime

862248
worksheet	excel
you are not allowed to write to non-caller cells directly from a worksheet function in excel

862252
expression	brackets
a | will scope to brackets or the end of an expression rather than just on the two neighbouring items

862252
expression	brackets
you need to put some extra brackets two show which part of the expression you want or-ed

862255
ref	out
you could use ref instead of out if you don t want to assign a value although this must then be initializer by the caller

862259
nyromodal	jquery
i m using the following jquery code to initiate the nyromodal calls

862264
environment	building
it takes too much time to maintain a maven building environment which defeats the point of having an all-singing building-system

862282
selenium	sahi
i have worked on projects that successfully used sahi or selenium for aft of web apps white for aft for .net wpf or winforms apps swtbot for aft of eclipse rich client apps and frankenstein for aft of swing apps

862282
integration	payment
you may have to mock out integration with a payment gateway unless the provider provides you a test environment that you can pummel with your tests

862299
instance-variables	accessor
i m new to objective-c and need to extend a standard class of a framework with an instance-variables plus accessor

862300

862325
order	add
then in order to call the sub go into the thisworkbook area in vba and add something like

862344
checkstyle	javadoc
very good reporting capabilities findbugs pmd checkstyle javadoc ...

862346
hash	md5
i intend to use a hash function like md5 to hash the file contents

862377
treeset	treemap
a treeset and a hashset also do it since they are backed up by a treemap and a hashmap so there is no penalty in doing so actualy it should be a minimal gain

862377
methods	extend
you may also extend your favorite set to add the get methods

862379
having	select
i am having a project which will have country dropdown at the top to select countries

862388
directory	folder
so there seems to be a few questions asking about removing files directory matching certain cases but i m looking for the exact opposite delete everything in a folder that doesn t match my provided examples

862394
widget	button
you have a qmainwindows and when a certain event is triggers you want to change the appearance of that particular windows like remove some button add a treeview widget or what not

862404
any	set
good luck there isn t particularly any decent documentation on how to set up xdebug with .net beans

862420
compact-framework	.net
one tip for people using the compact-framework instead of the full .net

862449
selected	button
each item in the viewstack would be a different mxml file so when the user clicks a button you change the selected index of the viewstack which makes the view change

862468
environment	building
building in simple cms support isn t too difficult provided putting the authentication and security isn t too stressful in your framework but it can get really fiddly if you need to provide a whole wysiwyg environment where they can upload content and format it

862470
stateless	stateful
even though i d still like to know why my original setup it works perfectly for stateless session beans but not for stateful session beans here is the solution i found

862495
canvas	pixel
with this you could change just the required pixel colours to anything and it works with everything in flash images canvas button s etc

862499
websphere	ibm
the ibm websphere mq sets the following jmsx header properties

862504
json	xml
web service is an app that exposes an http rest xml or json soap or otherwise interface

862506
callback	methods
if you set the cache duration to 5 minutes then you could check in your callback methods whether the item has already been saved - if it hasn t then you can push it to the database

862506
callback	methods
and then you would implement the callback methods accordingly

862523
transient	entity
ray s methods uses reflection to iterate over the methodss retrieve the getbean and setbean methodss and apply the entity setbean with your transient gwt object s getbean

862523
getter	setter
to use this hack you must have both getter and setter methods for every persistent field using proper getbean and setbean syntax for every bean field

862526
32-bit	64bit
references are 32-bit or 64bit depending on platform

862526
contains	any
a class instance has an internal reference to the type information which include vtable etc. plus a reference for each reference-type contains including strings or arrays plus the memory used by any struct these may be layouted so that access is efficient in fact leaving some memory unused

862550
children	nodes
it won t crash if a has no children because in that case first returns a nullnodes which implements the nodes interface but never matches anything

862553
spaces	output
however you would have to increase the number of captures and output with a _ on the end to the potential number of spaces in the rel

862565
triggers	insert
so in the end...you can insert data into c5 without running straight to the database...which can be very bad if people have triggers or other stuff happening when they insert data into c5

862584
case-statement	case-when
use case-statement selected e.name case-when e.active 0 then e.active 1 else e.active 0 end as estate_status from estates e where e.id # estate_id

862585
checkbox	button
okay lets ignore safari for a while skinning input and button are rather easy but how to completely skin select checkbox radio etc

862635
callback	methods
if you want to do the latter just display an animated gif that s a busy indicator while you submit the form via ajax from jquery using the beforesend callback then hide the indicator using the ajax methods s complete handler

862659
64bit	x86
on powerpc the binary interface to c specified that arguments would be put into registers there were so many to chose from however it seems that even on 64bit x86 requires arguments to be put on the stack

862686
any	set
based on a set of user-item ratings this could tell you an estimated similarity between any two items

862691
revision	updates
answering to updates 2 the svn-revert always get back the last revision from the file

862695
aggregate	grouping
there is no need to grouping by or aggregate anything since the sub-query ensures that there is not more than a single result row for any given productid mdash

862697
aggregate	grouping
use grouping by to determine the groupinging then use the appropriate aggregate to process the other fields

862702
authentication	login
i ve changed the web.config so that it uses activedirectory and automatically authentication users based on their current windows login

what s the difference between authentication and impersonation

862705
alfresco	liferay
liferay has cms functionality and can integrate with external cms platforms such as alfresco

862715
contains	any
json-serialized objects contains a hierarchy w o any reference cycles so it should be fairly straightforward to traverse something like

862759
constructor	object
installed deployed the feature etc and of course got the helpful no parameterless constructor defined for this object error - a problem with my definition in the elements.xml most likely

862760
contains	elements
.net appears to be a particular problem here as it sees the elements as an empty arrays even although it clearly contains numerous other elementss

862761
linux	unix
unix systems and especially linux agressively pages out memory that has not been touched for a while and while that is good for your average leaking c application it kill javas perfomance in memory tight situations

862763
abstract-methods	static-methods
abstract-methods require an instances but static-methods do not have an instances

862764
.net	wcf
it is a wcf tool and why it is located within windows sdk and not inside the .net framework

862793
svg	vml
svg vml is a possibility - they ll work without plugins and are similar enough to code for but i don t think you ll get correct enough image deformation

862793
svg	vml
svg works on almost everything except ie but it does have vml which is similar

862810
linux	unix
unix systems and especially linux agressively pages out memory that has not been touched for a while and while that is good for your average leaking c application it kill javas perfomance in memory tight situations

862814
selected	listbox
there is no problem what i did was that i forgott to selected the item in the listbox after i have added them to the listbox so of course nothing was sent in the postback.

862829
expression-blend	wpf
strange that the wpf team in making the wpf mvvm templates define the datacontext in code which very quickly makes it impracticable to edit your views in expression-blend since your data doesn t show up in design mode which is often a significant part of the layout

862835
frame	width
i can t just use the frame width and origin information for that

862839
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller which has a uiviewcontroller as it s root view controller

862839
contains	set
the nib name of the uiviewcontrollers is set to the name of the xib that contains my view controllers

862854
dependency-injection	inject
i set the datacontext through code where i am able to use dependency-injection to inject the proper objects services providers or what else i am using to find my code

862886
artifactory	nexus
be sure to use a maven repository proxy-server such as nexus or artifactory

862886
artifactory	nexus
standardized artifact management especially in conjunction with nexus or artifactory

862886
jar	war
it s a minor point but the fact that maven embeds details like the version number inside the jar or war not just in the filename by default is tremendously helpful

862897
sql-server	mysql
here is comparsion geospatial functions between sql-server 2008 posgis and mysql

862899
remote-debugging	debugging
it is a platform independent graphical gpl python debugger with support for remote-debugging over a network multiple threads namespace modification embedded debugging encrypted communication and is up to 20 times faster than pdb

862911
selected	checkbox
i am validating some checkbox and would like for the user to be able to selected only 4 from 7 possible and disable the others if the current box is being checked if there are already 3 checked or enable the everything if the current box is being unchecked

862917
authentication	login
if all of the above is true how can i impersonate the iis user for instance to my own username to solely authentication the current user with the windows login name

862920
diff	eol
the patch for ignoring eol style has been proposed in june 2007 but it only concerns git diff --ignore-space-at-eol not git merge

862922
selected	button
to reload the component list on the components panel click the menu button and selected reload

862923
64bit	x86
the latest on my machine windows 8 with visual-studio 2013 is v8.1a and it s in program files x86 on 64bit versions of the os

862929
firefox	opera
tested it in opera 9.6 firefox 3 safari 3.2 and ie 7

862943
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller that has a list of uinavigationcontroller assigned to the viewcontrollers property

862943
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
each uinavigationcontroller has a custom uiviewcontroller as its rootcontroller and this custom uiviewcontroller loads its view from a .xib file

862947
shell	bash
if you use emacs shell mode and want both bash and cmd sometimes set it up to use bash by default because you can type cmd at bash and the resulting dos shell works just fine

862947
shell	bash
if you setup emacs to use cmd as the shell which is the way nt emacs installs then dos shell works fine but if you type bash or bash -i to run a bash shell the resulting shell doesn t work right - see answer 0

862947
shell	bash
but it works fine if bash is the first shell emacs invokes

862956
logout	login
how about something like this for login and logout

862956
logout	login
the server does not actually have to create a request resource if you don t want but later you may change you mind and want to keep a record of login and logout

862960
selected	checkbox
you can quite easily selected the relevant checkbox using the psudeo-selectedor checked

862964
driver	kernel
i m writing a linux driver using netlink to communicate between user spaces and kernel spaces

862966
hide	show
is it possible to show hide all matching lines in vi or vim

862970
select	union
select from fieldvalues where groupid start union

862970

862977
macros	vba
i have always wondered if whatever actions we do are actually translated into vba macros before it is executed

863000
any	set
is there any way to set the minimum size of a popup windows through javascript

863008
configuration	environment
probably this forbidden file contains configuration settings and the like that are only relevant to your local build environment

863012
google-chrome	firefox
edit tested in ie7 8 google-chrome safari 4 firefox 3

863012
scrollbar	popup
so to be safe you should probably add a couple of pixels and also turn off scrollbar in the popup to make sure they won t take up any space

863029
python	lua
sadly people still hang to the idea to do uis in xml or c++ than in python or lua which would be much faster to write and change

863044
actionscript	mxml
there s no difference between an mxml class and a class defined in actionscript it s just different ways of writing the same thing

863051
reflection	runtime
or you could do more complicated things with reflection stack traces to check for correct usage at runtime

863064
constructor	object
furthermore most data-binding scenarios like to be able to create new object for which they usually use the parameterless constructor so that is a big advantage

863064
optional-parameters	named
interestingly perhaps the named optional-parameters in c# 4.0 allow something similar to object initalizers for immutable types - see here

863076
any	set
if once set the properties shouldn t be able to change at least due to any outside entities then i would use the constructor since the constructor can set any read-only properties as well as any read write properties

863076
any	set
also remember that just like any other methods your constructor can be overloaded so you can set up any number of ways to initialize those properties

863097
constructor	object
i always work on the basis that you should pass values to a constructor which are mandatory for that object to exist in a valid state

863097
constructor	object
if you work on the basis that an object should model a real work entity then that determines the minimum necessary to make any object valid - whether you set those as default values or by passing values in via the constructor

863102
constructor	object
other mechanisms also might require an empty constructor in the object

863108
scrollbar	margin
however if you want to have scrollbar and auto-resizing consider using a grid instead and use the margin property to position your items on this grid

863108
panels	grid
in general it is good to remember that most panels controls dockpanels stackpanels etc can be implemented via a grid control

863110
callback	methods
also this won t change the frame of the uiimageview when it s done so if you refer to that frame later on you may need to either take that into account or add a delegate methods callback for the end of your animation to set it to the proper value

863114
arrays	loops
generally you can loops through it if it s a collection or an arrays

863125
contains	any
how can i build a regular expression that will match a string of any length containsing any characters but which must contains 21 commas

863129
persistent	transient
if it has no identifier it s transient if it has an identifier and associated with the session persistent

863132
value	field
i m really keen to actually store the month as a word rather than any kind of value or date field as when bulk adding tasks i will likely edit the table directly rather than use a form

863141
internet-explorer	firefox
in internet-explorer safari and firefox 3 you can handle the onbeforepaste event for the input control

863141
firefox	safari
w3 standard event but firefox and safari have included support for it

863152
quickbooks	qbfc
you can see the data that s available using the qbxml qbfc quickbooks on-screens reference the requests you can send to quickbooks are found in the selected message drop-down box at the top of the screens

863152
quickbooks	qbfc
if you re writing a desktop-application you can look into using qbfc which is an api that talks to quickbooks using com dcom

863178
foreign-key-relationship	schema
if you have a foreign-key-relationship in the schema subsonic is smart enough to figure the joins directly

863187
nested-loops	loops
if a break is executed from within a set of nested-loopss only the innermost loops in which the break is executed is terminated

863194
variables	boolean
if you want to break out of the second loop as well you could use a boolean variables which is in scope of both loops

863204
constructor	object
constructor properties are for items that your object requires in order to be correctly constructed

863204
constructor	object
that is to say any properties the object should have in order to be initialized need to be in the constructor you don t usually want a partially intialized object after the constructor is called unless you re creating a factory or builder pattern and the constructor is hidden from all but the factory builder

863204
constructor	object
property intializers are best for additional configuration after a constructor that is required by your particular use case but is not required for the object to be considered initialised

python	php
like _ _ file _ _ in python and php

863280
firefox	opera
so far it s working in firefox and opera but it doesn t seem to work in ie7 or 8

863281
linux	osx
i ve used it successfully on windows linux and mac osx projects

863285
nstextview	nswindow
i ve discovered i can create a custom nstextview but does this have to be in an nswindow to display

863290
buffering	streaming
i am buffering a streaming of data points with a sort of switchable buffer imagine a garden hose with a valve in one state true i let the data points through to their eventual consumer

863294
ubuntu	debian
it works on ubuntu debian 5 and mac os x

863300
linux	osx
it is a stable c++ library that is cross-platform windows osx linux and more has been around for over a decade is well supported with many commercial apps written in it skype adobe photoshop album and a ton of open source stuff written with it the kde desktop for starters

863316
wxwidgets	mfc
i have more familiarity with wxwidgets though its design is heavily geared towards the windows mfc paradigm of application design

863335
linux	unix
gsolitaire c++ gnome gtk based for linux unix

863336
python	java
sorry the example is in python not java it s more brief

863344
onchange	keyup
or you can stripes the html tags with a regular expresion in the keyup event because the onchange event is not fired in textarea

863356
show	next
click on the h2 and use this.next to make the next paragraph show up

863374
value	field
the update methods work fine until that user put a blank in the field this produce a null value for the datatime object this object is nullable

863393
thickbox	jquery
i have an asp webform with a jquery thickbox i have an image that opens the thickbox when user click

863393
selected	button
once open the thickbox it shows me a grid with several rows and a button to selected one and after the user selected the record it returns to the main page the recordselecteded and cause a __dopostback

863401
environment	building
these people know the errors people tend to make in our building environment and they are the ones who feel the brunt of it when a building breaks so they re motivated to find issues

863407
archive	backup
you can stick these in separate schema and then apply differing policies for archive backup security etc

863410
erlang	python
after witnessing a demo by one of the creators of f# i was left with the impression that they have managed to extract great features from both python and erlang

863416
video-editing	video-player
you best bet is using a video-editing framework or change the source code for the flash video-player for example flowplayer to accept texts with coordinates from a second url and display that

863421
union-all	union
since those appear to be mutually exclusive statements in the union i would suggest that union-all is a better choice than union

863432
controller	routes
this isn t hard to do but the problem arises in that the routes are initialized before the controller so you will have to handle the lookup and reflection yourself to check for your criteria

863432
controller	routes
the easiest way by far is to just create a custom extension for the html.actionlink that does its own checks and keep it as a display only thing and then create dual routes for the same controller in your global.asax

863433
double-quotes	single-quotes
however the statement you have as it is it should be single-quotes and not double-quotes

863436
javascript	dom
so effectively i am not only adding elements to the document dom but sometimes i am also adding a piece of javascript

863454
webforms	asp.net
asp.net does this automatically by maintaining a webforms s viewstate

863459
environment	building
note this building is not for release it is for our staging user acceptance environment

863465
javascript	dom
to be specific i m in favor of making an ajax call to get javascripton then using client side javascript to build that partial view and insert it into the dom

863467
put	get
asp.net will get the data from the viewstate and put it in place

863489
environment	building
we also set up a nightly building for each branch that is deployed in the morning to our staging environment

863491
tapestry	wicket
and i think you d be better off for now bypassing more ajaxy type frameworks like tapestry or wicket or the more end to end solutions like seam as overcmpolicating the issue

863497
profiling	trace
this will ensure that it s encrypted going over the wire as well as ensuring that a nosy dba doesn t see the unencrypted information using profiling or a trace

863504
contains	elements
explanation after adding your arrays really contains 24 elements --- but most of them are undefined which also evaluates as false

863523
sigkill	sigsegv
i assume that if the os ensures a memory-mapped file is fflush to disk when the process is killed via sigkill then it will also do so with other terminating signals sigabrt sigsegv etc...

863526
selected	button
header has two button update quantities and remove selected items

863526
textbox	button
the user should be able to change the values in these textbox and then hit the update quantities button in the header to save all the changes at one time

863526
textbox	button
i was hoping to call a single javascript function from the onclientclick event of the updatequantities button which would then iterate through all the datalistitems find the txtqty textbox and make sure it is valid numerical input

863546
hide	next
this will hide everything after the h2 that is click on until either the next h2 is found or you go up a level in the dom

863564
contains	elements
which is far better than looping through the entire form and checking if the id of the elements contains txtqty in its id

863580
highlight	selected
actually i assumed that when i call selected that my node will be highlight as well i mean the blue selectedionbox around it

863583
pointers	stack
some people report that ws can fail with this error if got pointers inside application stack memory

863620
testdriven.net	gallio
i have vs08sp1 gallio 3.0.6.763 and testdriven.net 2.14

863650
silverlight	wpf
i m considering creating a wpf front end for a silverlight application

863650
silverlight	wpf
i ve previously shared source between silverlight and wpf by creating a project for each then using add as link to link source files between the two

863650
silverlight	wpf
has anyone come up with a good way to share the xaml between silverlight and wpf

863650
silverlight	wpf
a final option that crossed my mind was to have the wpf application use a browser control to host the silverlight app

863661
selected	button
choose your component colorpicker - change the color in the right column if you still can t get what you want press the skin button in the right column and selected image files from the list and insert your images

863681
driver	kernel
although it s skirting around the issue you can disable the requirement for driver signing by passing an option to the windows kernel from the bootloader

863681
windows-xp	windows
you d typically do this with bcdedit a windows command line tool to edit the boot data store as the good old boot.ini file was dumped after windows-xp

863681
command-prompt	cmd
try the following from an administritive command-prompt if you have uac enabled hit start type cmd hold ctrl+shift and press enter to start cmd as an admin

863686
perl	awk
you have textmate so that means osx which means you have sed awk ruby and perl that can all do this much much better and easier

863696
selected	listbox
i have a listbox with selectedionmode multiple which allows me to selected multiple rows by clicking either the left or right mouse button

863696
click	mouse
how can i restrict the selection to occur from the left mouse button click only

863730
synchronous	.when
.when complete the ajax portion of the page can present the details you normally would have presented while the user waited for process to complete synchronous

863741
64bit	x86
your msil project runs as 64bit on an x64 machine so for now your solution of making your builder x86 is probably the best although in the future msbuild itself may work around this

863745
inherited	subclass
i don t think subclass is the way to go when its just common functionality you want to get into your objects and not a real inherited situation

863749
click	mouse
you probably can also use one of the more general mouse event handler and check if the right mouse button has been click and then call e.handled

863754
explicit	typeof
i added a explicit refrence to it by calling typeof on one of the types in the assembly and all is fine

863757
google-chrome	safari
however on safari and google-chrome the appear on the far left of the page

863778
mime	rfc
i suggest you look at the various mime rfc mostly it uses base64 which thankfully .net already handles

863783
administration	account
i have an application that is launched from within a service using a local administration account

863783
shutdown	exit
if a user is logged into the host pc and i browse to it and shut it down the application exit and shuts down the pc as i would expect - using exitwindowsex with the shutdown priviledge enabled

863792
contains	elements
in our remoting implementation we did add to the channel stack a client and a server channels to check if the message contains a dataset and use a xml serialization to be able to send extendedproperties through the wire you may know that the dataset serialization does a tostring of the elements found into the extendedproperties

863794
jdbctemplate	jdbc
i just migrating one of our applications from pure jdbc to spring s jdbctemplate

863811
arrays	loops
if you get the arrays key in the foreach loops you can unset the correct arrays index using using that

863826
command-prompt	cmd
i m looking for a solution that doesn t require creating an .exe such as running a cmd from the cmd-prompt not powershell or a vbscript or javascript file as long as we are getting the real culture and not ie settings.

863830
show	next
but the scripting store the cookie of last selected tab so next time a person visits the site automatically that tab is show so as i have manually hard coded the css in the div it breaks the design like in image below i selected url upload and than reloaded the page

863836
lossless-compression	lossless
if you want mathematically lossless i would suggest something like motion jpeg2000 which has a lossless-compression option but it doesn t have the broad support in editing applications

863842
put	get
the main reason to have a get set wrap around a private variables is to be able to put logic around the access

863846
instances	self
the self in the methods definition def self.hash_password makes hash_password a class methods instead of an instances methods

863846
instances	self
in the context of an instances methods self refers to an instances

863857
pecl	pear
php has both a pecl extension and a pear package that can do geoip lookup

863860
ethernet	packets
unless you really have a good reason you re writing the code that receives the ethernet packets from the memory-mapped io region then using bit-fields overlay on memory produces extremely fragile code imho

863866
constructor	private
my co-worker feels that it s not best programming practice to set values of private fields anywhere but the constructor

863867
postgresql	rdbms
edit the rdbms will be probably postgresql maybe hope not mysql

863883
webforms	asp.net
i have a asp.net webforms that aside from other controls has a textbox for entering a value a textbox to display values a dropdownlistbox and a search button

863885
constructor	object
if someone does an operation on you that changes the value of the object especially something like + theres nothing wrong with modifying the value outside of the constructor

863896
required	checked
although it required some understanding to know which methods to call it can help you focus on speciifc scenarios and checked their bottlenecks

863939
external	host
that way the data is first retrieved from their host which would be external to you

863973
getter	setter
if i have to add code to the property i still only use the field inside of the property accessors and use the getter and setter everywhere else including the constructor

864003
sql-server	oracle
often enterprise applications used internally by a business will save their data to a back-end database such as sql-server or oracle

864064
background-color	transparency
as far as i can see it could even be that the transparency checkbox background in normal print and print preview is a hack as there does not seem to be a property indicating a transparency background the background-color is default whereas office has a background transparency

864065
profiling	trace
you can use profiling to get a real time trace of the statements getting executed sp stmtstarting

864066

864066
findstr	cmd
for full information on findstr regular expressions refer to the online cmd

864077
32-bit	16-bit
i thought only 16-bit and 32-bit fields mattered with byte order and you could convert between endians with ntohs and ntohl respectively

864081
firefox	safari
i ve made a simple site with a centered box followed by two-columns and it displays fine in firefox 3 and safari 3 but not in ie7

864094
ruby	php
i m writing a ruby app i ve been a php developer for 8 years just starting with ruby that sells tickets for a concert hall

864100
base-class	inherited
if you pass a user-controls into a function by its actual type it loses all of its user-controls base-class i know vb6 doesn t have inherited but when creating a user-controls you expect certain features

864102
getter	setter
there are certain conventions around getter and setter

864102
getter	setter
if i call a setter on an object then i usually expect the getter to return what i set

864109
value	field
my reading of the comment is that the two one-byte field together are construed as a two-byte value or were -- seems like one byte is unused anyway

864115
worksheet	excel
the marco only relates to one excel worksheet

864130
textbox	button
the controls should anchor - ie the textbox get bigger the button stay right aligned

864133
forms-authentication	session-timeout
the site as a whole has a 15 minute forms-authentication timeout and a 30 minute session-timeout

864168
nstextview	nswindow
i ve discovered i can create a custom nstextview but does this have to be in an nswindow to display

864176
punctuation	words
so a quick implementation that uses your list of garbage strings and does the job exploiting javascript s built-in dictionary speed to check whether a words is garbage or not and with handling for punctuation is given below

864177
numeric	zero
if you re dividing by zero you re trying to do something that doesn t make sense mathematically so no numeric answer you can get will be valid

i declare and defined the threading function in a normals way

864187
height	frame
make the top frame 0 height and have itself refresh periodically

864204
malloc	free
duplicates what really happens when you donâ t free after malloc

864217
sql-server	mysql
i don t think access was ever really intended to power data driven websites and it isn t nearly as powerful as a database engine like mysql or sql-server

864223
malloc	free
t free after malloc

864239
sql-server	mysql
mysql or sql-server can handle a ton of users much better

864242

864256
textbox	button
demo code add some text in the textbox and hit add button to add new columns xaml

864266
linux	unix
on any o s with a mmu which includes unix linux osx and the windows nt family the process has a data structure that is used to set up page mappings for tbe mmu

864277
authentication	login
it seems technically possible in that when a user tried to login to outside.com through a client-side silverlight interface that the sl app could connect to the outside.com login service and be told to authentication that user against ldap.inside.com

864290
fieldset	labels
you can reduce the amount of div tags by using proper form tags such as fieldset and labels

864290
fieldset	labels
this approach will give you a wide range of hooks the form itself fieldset legend labels labels title required text title inputs of a certain type form button both grouping and individual etc

864309
reference-type	generics
if you want this to work in a generics way you probably need to use reflection to check the type of t and handle value types different than reference-type

864319
dialog	pop-up
my dropdown boxes are showing through a jquery modal pop-up dialog how do i fix this

864346

864361
reflection	runtime
reflection is a facility where you can query an object about its attributes at runtime

864361
python	java
for example python java and .net have facilities where you can find the instance variables or methods of an object

864361
reflection	runtime
some use reflection to construct an object by quering its properties at runtime and dynamically populating an instance

864361
python	java
to take a simple example i ll use python because its reflection facilities are very simple to use and involve less boilerplate than those of java or .net

864363
reflection	runtime
reflection is useful for runtime configuration allowing parts of a system to be driven through external configuration

864363
constructor	object
the constructor method of the object being located using reflection

864381
execution	jobs
our core service is solid and handles execution the jobs as needed while the actual worker library can be expanded and changed as necessary without the core even caring

864383
selected	button
in the entry form of my wpf application i have a list of button where the user can selected where he wants to do eg

864383
show	next
also hiding the current work and show the next form will not work because the wpf application is hosted inside the window32 app

864384
shell	bash
equivalently one can use instead of backticks in some shell including bash

864384
output	cat
both syntaxes take the output of find and puts it on the command-line of cat

864384
spaces	output
this doesn t work well if find has too much output more than can fit on a command-line or if the output has special characters like spaces

864384
output	cat
that is if find produces too much output it ll run cat multiple times

864412
text-editor	editor
happy to use any tool to get this done ninja parameters for sort on the command-line a plist editor text-editor or whatever

864413
widget	button
you could use a qstackwidget any place you want to change things and change the shown page of the widget when the button is pressed

864437
show	next
makes me wonder why microsoft doesn t push their flagship language to prove that not only you can cut down significant development time and therefore money but also show that you can release a next gen title where the real time interactivity doesn t suffer

864444
put	get
before you get angry with c out please consider that the output often is something a user has put in there - potentially with some unwanted code

864479
author	posts
i m looking for a way to display the authors of a wordpress blog as a dropdown menu with an onchange event that redirects the user to the author page which lists all the previous posts written by that user

any	set
then in your working copy you can just set a nocommit property on any file that shouldn t be committed

864513
put	get
jmp target_address won t work i am guessing so they just put it as bytes to get around this issue

864527
direct3d	directx
that s also why other directx wrappers exist slimdx comes to mind as a much more direct direct3d wrapper

864534
execute	prepare
if you re only going to execute it once a prepare statement will take longer because the database engine has to do all the setup for a prepare statement then insert the value then have it floating around in a cache until the engine decides to fflush it

864534
value	field
with a single-use statement with real value filled in rather than question marks of course the query optimizer in many database engines can look at statistics on distribution of value for the two field and pick the index that will give the smaller set of records then read all of these sequentially and eliminate the records that fail the second test

864553
oracle	mysql
mysql has traditionally lagged a bit in support for the sql standard whereas commercial databases like oracle sql server recently and db2 have followed them a bit more closely

864559
javascript	dom
in the particular case that i mean about closures it was when you added a javascript reference to a dom object and an object to a dom object that referred back to the javascript object

864559
javascript	dom
in practice these leaks are usually small but to keep your code clean you should delete the javascript reference to the dom object

864561
put	get
same thing except have the windows batch job get the files instead of having the aix scripting put them

864561
sftp	scp
same as #1 except use scp instead of sftp what are the pros cons

864562
triggers	insert
you can either set some sort of insert triggers in your ms-sql server i assume you use ms-sql because of the asp.net part

864579
implements	extends
since icoolengine extends iengine any object implements icoolengine can be treated as if it s an iengine without all the icoolengine -specific methods of course

864585
value	field
if you want your application to reliably be able to access an app-specific cookie parameter it would be best to add this field to the cookie value rather than relying on the expiration field which is considered part of the cookie metadata

864616
short	base
with our code base we have created complicated applications for customers in short time frame

864648

to add instance-variables you must subclass

864885
python	php
using a python post handler instead of php

864897
json	xml
or better yet rather than hard-code the parameters in your java code put them into an xml or json file or a properties file that gets sucked into whatever jar file you end up producing

864907
order	join
basically this uses a subquery to get the latest entry for each emp and cat then join that against the original table to get all the data for that order since you can t grouping by amt and cum

864911
derived-class	base-class
perhaps the best thing to do is to define a derived_type field on your base-class which is set automatically on save of the derived-class

864927
webforms	asp.net
here is where asp.net webforms can give you incredible rad efficiency

864928
author	posts
updates actually you should simply be able to use wp_list_author for the whole thing as it automatically generates a list of author with a link to a page display all their posts

864928
author	posts
i have an author.php templates which display the author s info pic blurb and below it i m showing their 5 most recent posts using the plugins above

if the textbox control is set to autopostback it will postback on every keypress thus allowing the firing of the textchanged event

864990
controller	routes
thus i ended up with four or five routes for the same controller all with a default action specified

865005
http-proxy	squid
you can also route the traffic through an http-proxy such as squid that can limit bandwidth or use built-in linux iptables functions using tc for traffic control to limit bandwidth but this is often not easy to configure use

865010
hashtable	sorted
i think i ve stared myself blind on hashtable dictionary and sorted lists.

865017
triggers	insert
edit as far as i can tell my insert statements are succeeding one way or another when this error is triggers

865032
document	element
it accepts document but the top-most element with the scrolltop property is in fact document.documentelement usually refers to

865040
short	zero
the short answer is yes you do have to save this external because php by default has a zero memory persistence policy

865054
authentication	login

value	field
the name and username listed in strong text show just fine but the literal control that should show extra details the employeeid field and the name field inside the linkbutton won t show their value in the page

865108
implements	extends
except that it extends javax.swing.filechooser.filefilter instead of implements java.io.filefilter

865149
constructor	object
i put the above code in the main method and two bean definitions for two objects in one java class s constructor i used the other class s object - which was injected to this object - and called a method on that which will print some thing but it didn t worked i thought that the above code creates all the dependencies and injects them but it doesn t seem like that

865180
spawn	exit
my app is spawn an external process and waiting for it to exit

865183
push	pull
my question is is there a documented algorithm for validating a move where the user attempts to move a handle to value v which will in turn either push or pull all of the connected bars down the chain

865197
credentials	security
nettcp defaults to transport-level security with windows credentials

865197
credentials	security
either you need to turn off all security on both ends - server and client - or you need to just use the secure defaults with windows credentials

865227
textbox	button
right now the enter key submits for the first submit button but i want this to change if there is data in the second textbox

865232
document-ready	.when
document-ready event gets only called by the browser .when all the dom content has been loaded

865256
boost	stl
now if you intend on learning go for the best start quickly with stl basic and jump into boost libraries right away

865268
required	checked
this will required to rechecked the merged steps in isolation if the checked fails in order to determine which checked faild

865269
carbon	cocoa
i am not using any objective-c in my code but qt 4.5 is using a new cocoa based back end instead of carbon

865275
textbox	button
you can wrap each section in a panel and use it s defaultbutton property to specify the submit button for each textbox

865276
visio	dia
it s a general purpose svg editor so you re free to be more creative and expressive in your diagram than with dia or visio both of which i ve used

865314
display	height
i have a few right floated block elements anchor elements with display block because i need to set height on them inside a parent div

865331
javascript	dom
if you have javascript that modified the dom anywhere within the body of the page try moving it below the tag

865339
contains	set
the stackpanel then containss a set of user-controls b that contains a few button and a datagrid control

865344
buffering	streaming
because some native platforms only provide limited buffering size for standard input and output streaming failure to promptly write the input stream or read the output stream of the subprocess may cause the subprocess to block and even deadlock

865367
directory	folder
if files exist physically on the machine why not just put them in a folder make that folder a virtual directory in iis and use content-based routing and or url-rewriting to route the requests to them

865393
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
if you re trying to do ruby-on-rails in codeigniter you re approaching things backwards

865399
strncmp	strcat
in it is used as the type of the parameter num in the functions memchr memcmp memcpy memmove memset strcat strncmp strncpy and strxfrm which in all cases it is used to specify the maximum number of bytes or characters the function has to affect

865424
selected	textbox
below is some code that will display selected item in a textbox and a list of checked weekdays

865432
png	gif
the documentation says that the supported formats are bmp gif exig jpg png and tiff

865443
contains	set
because a cgrect contains a cgpoint and a cgsize you use one set of braces for the cgrect then another set for each of cgpoint cgsize

865448
tree	trie
i did this not too long ago to implement a binary trie based map the key was an integer and each level on the tree was a bit position

865448
implements	extends
to implements a set you extends abstractset and supply implementsations of size and iterator

865448
put	get
you will want to also implement get and put since the default map is unmodifiable and the default implementation of get iterates through the entryset looking for a match

865456
webforms	asp.net
classic asp.net webforms tend to make this a bit more difficult and encourage lazy programming because you can use all of the events off of the page rather than forcing good code separation and single responsibility principle

865465
any	set
when i ve had to do this sort of thing in the past the best not so great answer i had was to develop a set of scripting that ran in multiple iterations so that i could develop and test the process iteratively before i moved any of the data

865466
stateless	stateful
shall it be stateless or stateful

865466
lan	wan
are clients co-located in the same viewmodel appserver or remote in the same lan or even in a wan

865478
selectedindex	selecteditem
you can try combobox s selectedindex or selectedvalue to tell the selecteditem

865498
hosts-file	hosts
i suggest either using a configuration file or changing your hosts to point domains to localhost or dev servers on your development machine

865498
hosts-file	hosts
with the latter option you always use your production urls in code but your dev machine will resolve those domains to your local machine because it checks the hosts first

865508
versioning	upgrade
my advice is to perform a new update upgrade in order to catch a new versioning that may resolve this problem

865517
credentials	account
there s an old trick where you create local account on both servers with the sam credentials id password and then use the local account for your services

865552
32-bit	64bit
it is always unsigned but the it can be an unsigned 32-bit value on 32bit platforms or 64 bit value for 64bit platforms

865559
hostname	proxy
i am testing a static methods that builds a url string after checking proxy and hostname and all kinds of things

865559
ip-address	hostname
the test needs to validate that the returned hostname or ip-address is valid

865572
value	field
i am looking for a datepicker like what microsoft provides but it doesn t support null value and since this is tied to a nullable field on a database that isn t acceptable

865574
css-frameworks	960.gs
css-frameworks such as 960.gs go for overall fixed maximums but there s also much to be said for fluid widths in general

865577
datagrid	textbox
how to wrap text in a textbox column of datagrid in windows application

865585
packets	ping
you can test that it s reachable with an icmp echo packets or a ping 8

865595
primitive	int
you ll have to box your primitive int in the int class if it doesn t do it automatically for you

865600
webserver	host
this isn t exactly what the question asked for but you might find it useful to know that netcraft provides some pretty neat information about the uptime webserver software and isp used to host websites as well

865613
order	add
in order to find out where the time s coming from you could add some trace statements to your page load and then load the page with tracing turned on

865614
callback	methods
this could then be passed to the static methods you have written which would then callback against the interface when it needs the various settings

865632
ftp	ssh
you can connect via ftp ssh or direct file copy you didn t mention how you will be connecting to the other box

865648
removeclass	addclass
in regards to whether or not addclass and removeclass can handle these

865654
lookup	any
edit the structfindvalue suggested looks to be excellent as well i didn t think to lookup any relevant functions

865655
multiplication	division
division and multiplication by integers seems to work out of the box

865688
lgpl	gpl
you can use getopt lgpl or one of the various c++ ports such as getoptpp gpl

865689
queue	fifo
is there a device file driver on linux where if you write to it when you read from it you will read back what you wrote like a fifo queue device

865693
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason the onkeydown event is not firing in firefox or ie but it works fine in google-chrome

865706
ruby	php
i am setting up a debian etch server to host ruby and php applications with nginx

865732
scanf	atoi
aside from f scanf which has been sufficiently discussed by the other answers there is also atoi and strtol for cases when you already have read input into a string but want to convert it into an int or long

865732
strtol	atoi
strtol is recommended because it allows you to determine whether a number was successfully read or not as opposed to atoi which has no way to report any error and will simply return 0 if it given garbage

865735
unsigned	short
if the given image is n x m pixels big then the image is n x m x 2 bytes big each pixel is an unsigned short and it s a greyscale image

865735
space	input
during the processing image pyramids are made which are in float space so the total memory usage will be n x m x 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 where the first 2 is the input the second 2 is the output the first 4 is the input in floats the second 4 is the 0th level difference image and the last two fours are the rest of the pyramid since they re pyramids and each level is half the size in each direction these 4s are upper bounds

865754
difference	zero
when using mysql from jdbc -- at least as of a couple of years ago when i last looked into this -- there is pretty much zero difference between prepared statements and single-use statements because the mysql jdbc driver saves prepared statements on the client side when you execute the prepared statement it fills in the values as text and ships it over to the database engine

865756
subclassing	base-class
i added a getbase call to return the pointers to the base-class for any further subclassing

865772
formatting	import
if you are cleaning lots of files consider creating functions to do specific types of cleaning phone number formatting for instance then you can use the same function in multiple import

865794
credentials	account
however you need to implement additional logic if you want your admin to be able to return to his account without entering his credentials again

865809
removeclass	addclass
i don t think addclass or removeclass can handle these kind of classes

865833
callback	methods
the code beneath already resides in the callback off a load methods

865857
contains	any
diskdev_cmds contains apple s filesystems utilities doesn t have any tests

865865
selected	checkbox
then selected the checkbox go to main menu - object - edit style - edit a copy

865865
hide	show
when ischecked is true you move the rectangle to one of the sides show the on word and hide the off word

865870
haskell	lisp
so ideally yes you should learn c++ as well as ruby c d f# haskell io lisp and every other language you ve ever heard of

865871
environment	execution
in the environment we have to programme in today we can t rely on the order of execution of our langauage statements

865873
value	field
this change means that storing the id enables the field to lookup the correct value even if it changes in the lookup target list

865873
value	field
note that if the field is saved without the original lookup id being valid it will stored just the value as you have noted ows_author paperino pippo

865876
click	mouse
i have three different button they aren t nested within each other and they have event listeners for mouse click that call a function

865891
hide	show
or do i show hide the already existing html

865901
python	java
over the long term this will help make you a better developer in ruby python java etc.

865907
hide	show
i think it depends on what you re planning on display if it s images then i d be tempted to hide them on page load and then show on hover but if it s just a block of text then i d probably be tempted in append to the dom and then removing on hover out

865911
python	ruby
a comment on another stack overflow question states that python was just like ruby as it relates to everything s an object and everything in python was an object just like ruby

865911
python	ruby
is everything an object in python like ruby

865954
selected	checkbox
type in how many products they have sold and how many days they have worked and selected checkbox for the courses they have completed

865961
radio-button	selected
you want the list of items in a selected box to change depending on the value of something else which is presumably a checkbox or radio-button

865963
python	ruby
ruby docs - to ruby from python

865963
python	ruby
as with python in ruby .

865963
python	ruby
so there you have it from ruby s own website in python everything is an object

865969
primitive	int
certainly the primitive and builtin types int long str float etc. can be subclassed - and in fact the types themselves are objects

865971
subtraction	time
if time are involved a converted subtraction might yield better results

865985
codedom	.net
the relevant feature area here is called codedom and it works like the html dom for web pages except the document object model is used to create .net code

865985
linq-expressions	lambda
you can do lambda and linq-expressions conditionals and control flow anything

865990
value	field
you cannot read anything into the internal value field having any value when hasvalue is false

865990
contains	any
after all if value could contains null there wouldn t be any point in using nullable here

865994
asp.net-mvc	webforms
can asking a developer whether he prefers webforms or asp.net-mvc be a good indicator of his proficiency

866000
contains	elements
i m trying to get the elements in an html doc that contains the following pattern of text # s 11

866000
document	element
but i want the parent element of the text to match so i can use that as a starting point for traversing the document tree

866004
constructor	private
or you could still have the constructor but you don t have to add all of the private fields

866010
google-chrome	firefox
however if i load the page or even the individual javascript files in firefox or google-chrome it loads the full thing just fine

866056
keyboard	mouse
i m trying to work with copysymbolichotkeys but i m not sure that i m using it correctly as it lists commands as being reserved even though i do not see it listed in the keyboard shortcuts tab-pane of the keyboard mouse system preferences

866070
object-reference	instances
whenever i run my program i get nullreferenceexception was unhandled object-reference not set to an instances of an object

866083
python	ruby
everything is a tad of an overbid for both python and ruby -- for example if is not an object rather it s a keyword used to start a conditional statement or in python inside list comprehensions and generator expressions

866083
python	c++
the enthusiasm of finding out that functions classes methods and all sort of such things that aren t really objects in say c++ are objects in ruby or python causes such enthusiasm

866083
python	ruby
other things may be objects in ruby but not python or viceversa code blocks regular expressions ...

866085
python	ruby
while everything is an object in python it differs from ruby in its approach to resolving names and interacting with objects

866085
python	ruby
for example while ruby provides you with a to_s method on the object base class in order to expose that functionality python integrates it into the string type itself - you convert a type to a string by constructing a string from it

866085
python	ruby
ruby libraries tend to grow through the addition of methods to existing types like object while python libraries tend to grow through the addition of global functions to a given module

866100
difference	count
the difference is you ll return false if status 1 and count 0

866102
archetypes	appfuse
i m trying to build an application starting from an appfuse archetypes but i get some strange problems

866102
hsqldb	mysql
for once i d like to use a hsqldb for automated unit tests and integration tests and a mysql db for my manual testing so that i can easily manipulate the data when i need to so it would be nice to automatically switch profiles during the testing phases

866108
nlb	iis
i have two iis servers running using nlb

866125
order	add
at the moment i have to add to the .hg hgrc of each repo in order to push changes

866145
selected	button
when it s time to debugging set the breakpoint on the eclipse toolbar click on the debugging button s drop-down arrow and selected the django project you ve defined

866167
entity-framework	ado.net
there are many implementations - linq-to-sql is one as is ado.net data services entity-framework s linq-to-entities linq-to-objects linq-to-sql linq-to-amazon dblinq etc

866181
assign	add
you need to assign add rights to the registered role on forum there by giving both read inherited from the anonymous role and add to registered users

866181
assign	add
you need to assign add rights to the registered role on gallery there by giving both read again inherited and add to registered users

866186
entity-framework	data-access
linq to sql and entity-framework are data-access technologies

866208
value	field
but some field value will be null which causes an error in the addition of the fields typeerror unsupported operand type s for + nonetype and int

866208
value	field
right now with each field i get the field value and set it to x# then check if it is none and if so set x# to 0

866209
value	field
i have table with some field that the value will be 1 0

866227
value	field
i had some issues using it though as if there were validation errors the value of the read-only field would get lost

866227
value	field
to solve this i did something similar but overrode hiddeninput instead and kept the value in a hidden form field

866228
tuples	any
sqlalchemy proxies all access to the underlying database cursor to map named keys to positioning in the row tuples and perform any necessary type conversions

866258
selected	cell
i write an imagebutton to a table cell in a new row when a user selected an item in a list

866264
external	host
have it attempt to download the external file s that you are including one attempt for each external host that you depend on

866264
external	host
have it set a flag in the database that represents whether each individual external host is currently available

866264
external	host
when your pages are being generated check the external-host flags and print the source attributes either pointing to the external host if it s up or a local copy if it s down

866264
external	host
then when one does go down your local copy represents the most-current version from the external host anyway

866267
sql-server	oracle
i should say i don t know sql-server at all but i have successfully used this approach in oracle

866273
pointers	stack
misuse of varargs such as omitting arguments can introduce odd crashes due to stack corruption or reading invalid pointers

866273
pointers	stack
it will convert the string pointers foo to an int to put in field2 and it will try to read and interpret two other parameters that aren t present which will probably cause a crash here from dereferencing stack noise

866277
for-loop	loops
you can define a variable in the parenthesis of a for-loops and the scope will be the loops block

866277
double	int
with semantics similar to foreach in other languages x gets referenced to each element in the container so that the function actually double each value inside the int vector

866279
callback	methods
jquery has a methods called click the argument to which is a callback

866283
parentheses	macros
where commas occur in the second and third parts parentheses can be used to prevent them to separate macros arguments

866286
binary-compatibility	compatibility
in all likelihood the dll was not compiled with binary-compatibility or the original dll was not kept to ensure compatibility

866298
postgresql	mysql
i don t know if you use php or not but i ve found that addslashes works relatively well for mysql but bombs fast in postgresql

866299
wicket	spring
in a webapp using spring asp.net-mvc struts faces wicket whatever you are going to have a lot more control over everything but also be responsible for implementing more stuff

866314
png	gif
animated png images apng have been around for quite a while in an attempt to add this functionality of the gif format to png images

866314
firefox	opera
according to wikipedia they are supported in opera 9.5 and in firefox 3.0

866353
git-pull	git-diff
so if you were feeling brave you could replace that git-diff with something like git checkout branch git-rebase master or maybe just git-pull --rebase if you ve set that up

866358
contains	elements
i understand that the presenter should not contains any gui elements and the view form shouldn t really contains logic

866361
difference	count
in terms of readability and that s usually what i prefer over raw speed except for very specific cases there s no real difference between the following two options i ve added a count to the varargs versions since you need either a count or sentinel to detect the end of the data

866362
c++	lua
i m lead dev for bitfighter and we re working with a mix of lua and c++ using lunar a variant of luna available here to bind them together

866362
pointers	stack
i m thinking i need to get a pointers to the rock stone rockystone object from stack figure out what type it is then cast it to the correct thing before working with it

866378
buffering	streaming
of coure the tricky part is to get hold of such a -multithreading safe- streaming it shall block each side if an internal buffering is too full

866414
compact-framework	.net
sorry that this is not exactly answering your question...but you should check out the ui framework for .net compact-framework which does alpha blending already

866417
bluetooth	usb
i recently tried to get access to a serial communication using a bluetooth usb dongle

866425
implements	abstract
the thing is you will usually have to implements them making it a must for you to know almost every detail of an abstract data structure - contrary to how things work in languages with the structures like hashtable linkedlists etc

866461
value	field
provide lunar_typename c++ function outside of the lunar templates class -- as we do not need t there then and return from it the value of that __lunarclassname field of argument s metatable

866461
c++	lua
for example export type-specific functions getfiringsolutionforrock getfiringsolutionforstone and getfiringsolutionforrockystone from c++ to lua

866503
c++	lua
this problem is symptomatic of a difficulty with all of these automated ways of making lua interact with c or c++ with each of them there s some magic going on behind the scenes and it s not always obvious how to make it work

866503
c++	lua
a sensible alternative would be to do all the work yourself and just associate each c++ type with a lua table containing its methods

866520
response	timeout
most likely there will be a timeout which means the maximum amount of time to wait for a response before considering the connection to be dead

866528
children	nodes
should i start at the bottom nodes with no children of each set and clone up through the parents all the way to a new root

866532
textbox	button
i want to add a textbox and a button beside it

866532
textbox	button
then when i touch the textbox to type something keyboard will appear and the whole row with textbox and button scrolls up and the keyboard will be right below them

866535
c++	lua
i suggest that you define an object oriented system in pure lua and then write a custom binding to c++ for that aspect of the api

866535
c-strings	c++
in my last lua c++ project i used only null-terminated arrays of c-strings requiring lua to convert the string to an appropriate value

866557
environment	building
having all of those environment install on a single building machine made for some real havoc trying to get everything to stay in their own sand-boxes

866557
environment	building
ultimately using zed building and bugs we were able to keep each build step silo d to its own sand-box with its own environment variables and its own registry settings

866568
oracle	mysql
access really is a different animal it s a faux-db for goodness sakes so anyone willing to write a dal like subsonic would be targeting the real deal like oracle mysql and ms sql

866609
midp	cldc
we targeted midp 2.0 cldc 1.1

866610
placeholder	required
alternatively call cache.add with a placeholder object for each of the required dependent keys without first checking if they exist with a get and use an exception-handling handler to swallow the exception-handling thrown if it already exists.

866610
triggers	insert
continuing your example when subsequent to this activity a real something is added to the cache with the dog key using insert instead of add in order to account for the possibility that the key already exists as it does in this example then the replacement of the dog cache item which was simply a null value will triggers the invalidation of the animal_vacinations cache item per its cache dependency

866622
setinterval	settimeout
also something similar to setinterval would be nice where it calls the callback every n seconds but that can be implemented using settimeout

866625
revision	updates
if you check out the source of this website they append the revision number at the end of the url in a similar fashion to force the changes upon us whenever they updates the javascript files

866637
base-class	subclass
well assuming you are doing something with the iphone or mac in cocoa you can simply subclass nsobject the base-class in objective-c

866656
implements	abstract
i m putting them all in a common assembly along with some useful abstract base classes that can be used to help implements the interfaces

866663
onmousedown	onmouseup
while i agree that library is the way to go the answer you want is onmousedown onmousemove onmouseup

866663
onmousemove	onmouseup
in the onmouseup event you d clear your draggedobject variables and stop handling onmousemove

866667
textbox	button
so just put your textbox and button inside a view

866702
arrays	loops
the 4 bytes most likely contains the total number of objects in the allocation so delete will be able to loops over all objects in the arrays calling their destructor

866711
sql-server	ms-access
i was asked to develop this in ms-access but i think it would be better to build it in sql-server and use windows forms to build the interface

866716
keydown	keyup
use glutignorekeyrepeat to only get physical keydown keyup events

866723
sql-server	ms-access
an application built on sql-server will be more robust and support more users than one built on ms-access

866723
sql-server	ms-access
given that in almost every case i choose sql-server over ms-access

866741
boolean	int
to get the int boolean values out of the dictionary you d do the following

866743
sql-server	oracle
edit the reason we re using odbc is because we support 3 different databases - sql-server oracle informix

866749
aspect-ratio	scale
this matrix scale x and y with the field-of-view and aspect-ratio scale z by the near and far clipping planes and plugs the old z into w

866755
versioning	upgrade
maybe there s a chance that you can upgrade to a more recent 4.x versioning

866756
unique	words
in the worse case where all strings are unique you will need either o n memory to record your seen-set or o n 2 time to re-scan the entire file on each words

866756
arrays	map
first off if your dataset only consists of 3-digit integers then a simple arrays of 1000 bools will be much more memory effieicnt than a map

866756
unique	words
this is most effective when a large percentage of the words in the set are unique and thus holding a set of seen words in memory is prohibitively expensive

866767
any	set
can someone please identify the functional performance difference if any between set and selected in t-sql

866788
triggers	insert
ok it s not really evil but it may not return the id you re looking for if you have triggers or anything else that would insert another record in your db

866810
debugging	trace
you can debugging track objects trace and display chains in a lovely air application

866817
python	ruby
try something newer such as c# ruby python and best care about design pattern and work methodology

866818
contains	elements
also it seems that when an elements contains no attributess at all the error message is attributesvalue is null instead of the normal elements attributes not found

866827
any	set
by default it is set to error which causes eclipse to complain about references to any restricted classes

866829
integer	zero
valid values are in the range zero through the number of bytes of extra windows memory minus the size of an integer

866834
value	field
if the field has a value in it it is most likely a bots so throw the submission out

the web service gets document meta data from sharepoint it running on a server where i cant debugging but with logging i confirmed that the method enters and exit successfully

866865
webserver	security
in some web app server deployments security rules prohibit the web server from writing to the disk - webserver have no writable disk storage

866865
synchronous	.when
you could choose to get a little more sophisticated about workitem processing and optionally do the work synchronous .when the zipfile looks small enough

866877
32-bit	64bit
a float on intel chips is a 32-bit floating-point number so you wouldn t necessarily need 64bit for the operation

866881
divide-by-zero	infinity
use a float or double in floating-point arithmetic divide-by-zero is allowed results will be a positive or negative infinity

866906
triggers	insert
i could implement some business logic or a triggers to normalize all fields before insert and use uniqueness constraints across several fields in the table but it would be easy to miss some cases with something that varies as much as street addresses

866914
dialog	pop-up
i can t interact with a pop-up dialog

866955
mouseover	mouseout
it has some button made up of images with mouseover mouseout events on them in javascript and a bunch of embedded .net usercontrols

866955

when the mouseover mouseout events fire i change the images src to something else simple rollover effect

866957
radio-button	selected
choose export selected environment settings radio-button and next tick all settings and next choose a file name and directory and click finish to store a backup of your current settings in a .vssettings file

866957

in future if things go haywire again head back to tools import and export settings... and this time choose import selected environment settings radio-button and next choose no just import new settings overwriting my current settings and next either choose the name of your .vssettings file from the list usually under the my settings folder or browse

866984
webforms	asp.net
for asp.net webforms and asp.net mvc

866987
radio-button	checkbox
ok that works fine after the checkbox are created i m trying to run some code to get all the radio-buttons and it didn t work so i tried just getting one radio-button several times and it only gets it the first time

867004
.when	ready
then .when you are ready for prod you can release the versioning that has passed testing

867008
.when	ready
i m betting .when ef is ready it ll be a much easier transitions for you since the query language should be transferrable

867017
exception-handling	try-catch
i know that exception-handling have a performance penalty and that it s generally more efficient to try and avoid exception-handling than to drop a big try-catch around everything -- but what about the try block itself

867017
exception-handling	try-catch
what s the cost of merely declaring a try-catch even if it never throws an exception-handling

867019
quirks-mode	doctype
use a doctype or you ll throw browsers into quirks-mode

867024
elevated-privileges	windows
vista 7 and future version of windows require elevated-privileges in order to change system32

867024
directory	folder
appdata is a standard directory that s been around since windows 2000 that hides in the user s documents and settings or users folder depending on the version

867081
interface-builder	iboutlet
it has nothing to do with the iboutlet keywrod which is simply a helper keyword for interface-builder and is defined as nothing at compile time

867086
exception-handling	try-catch
this is because most of the exception-handling metadata gathering such as getting a stack trace etc. only really happens on the try-catch side not on the throw side

867109
credentials	security
is there any security problem in this since i am using the javascript to send the user credentials to the site when using this method i am not sure

867120
value	field
i have a status field which has 3 value pending activated

867127
order	add
as far as i know there are some editors that add a special character in order to fulfill it

the idea here is that words sharing the same prefix of and on share the same execution path up until the point where they differ

867140
click	mouse
i am trying to make a c# wpf form where i can drag it around the screen by click on it and moving with the mouse

867140
click	mouse
so essentially all you can see when the app is running is a little image - and ideally i want to be able to drag it around the desktop if i click and hold the left mouse button and move it about

867143
webforms	asp.net
actually i would posit that you should learn very little traditional asp.net webforms or not at all

867143
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc uses a totally different paradigm than traditional asp.net webforms and unlearning part of it is almost a requisite

867143
webforms	asp.net
the core engine of asp.net webforms -- the page lifecycle and the viewstate -- are both absent in asp.net mvc

867143
ruby	php
this is especially true if you come from a background that is more akin to mvc like php or ruby on rails

867153
ftp	ssh
it is by using the ftp ssh textmate bundle

867163
json	xml
pure data json xml rendered into the page using some client-side javascript template engine

867206
cursor	row
that s correct initially the resultset s cursor is pointing to before the first row if the first call to next returns false then there was no data in the resultset

867211
difference	factors
i ran tests for approximately 5000 files containing base64 encoded string and the difference between the time taken to write these two types of byte arrays is almost a factors of 10 with the one with writing the byte arrays using the real decoding taking more time

867216
authentication	login
you would give it true or false depending on if the user was authentication so the javascript would know to display the login or not

867218
constructor	object
you pass to the constructor the ienumerable object the value field the text field and the selected value

867219
python	c++
it was one of those silly newbie bugs but it got me thinking about the mechanisms of python i m a long time c++ programmer new to python

867219
data-members	constructor
if i add self.dict1 in the constructor or any other data-members how does it not affect the dictionary member of previously initialized instances

867225
google-chrome	firefox
test it on another modern browser opera firefox google-chrome safari etc

867230
gwt-rpc	gwt
to answer my own question gwt provides an interface called gwt-rpc that allows you to talk directly to java servlets therefore offering an amazing level of integration between client and server

867231
authentication	login
1 i wrote a quick login function because most of the functions in my ruby-on-rails app require authentication

867232
any	set
that would work if you want to see if there are any rows in the result set yes

867232
any	set
note that next always moves to the next row so if you are planning on doing any reading from the result set you need to take that into account

867240
mergesort	heapsort
there are often ways to avoid this but if you re really worried about the cost of comparisons i d go with something like mergesort or a heapsort

867241
difftime	mktime
not necessarily the best way but if you wish to use what s available on the systemd difftime and mktime can help -

867249
expression-blend	silverlight
is there something for javafx like what expression-blend is for silverlight

867278
hide	show
in the updatepanel logic show this when you want confirmation and hide everything else the act accordingly

i wouldn t totally write off using java and or python for a few reasons

867295
py2exe	exe
1 py2exe can compile your python code to an exe

867296
python	java
it has a syntax that is like a mixture of java c++ and python with the ability to make native windows apps

867297
any	set
you can use then an image control on any page even plain html and set the image source to display.aspx and your image will show up

867319
javadoc	doxygen
it is worthwhile to create good javadoc or doxygen comments and keep them up to date many people find these quite useful

867350
carbon	cocoa
there are lots of ways to cause a cocoa program to execute its own code under you control carbon is harder

867354
jprogressbar	progress
use a jprogressbar to display the progress

867359
project-management	scrum
if you can t directly apply what you learn to your legacy code you can always leverage newer technologies for peripheral software engineering tasks such as source code control configuration management bug tracking project-management eg the scrum approach to agile project-management documentation support and so on

867365
binary	octal
similar to how you can define an integer constant in hexadecimal or octal can i do it in binary

867368
any	set
is there any set of controls out there that have this wired up

867383
progress-bar	progress
so basically i m looking into a way how i could cleanly hide the whole command-prompt and link the transcoding progress to a progress-bar into my gui

867385
decimal	octal
there is an octal syntax prefix your number with 0 decimal syntax and hexadecimal syntax with a 0x prefix

867388
postgresql	oracle
i d need advice on following situation with oracle postgresql

867388
postgresql	oracle
with some other databases this can be handled with serializable isolation state but at least with oracle postgresql the phantom reads are prevented but as the result the table ends up with two distinct rows with same counter value

867400
perl	ruby
take a basic python perl or ruby tutorial

867404
json	xml
in most scenarios you need to only send json or xml as appropriate i am using json as an example

867405
digits	base
python assign to long integers all int s in python 3 just as much spaces as they need -- an arrays of digits base being a power of 2 allocated as needed

867417
version-control	sync
you can also do local commits by using distributed version-control as pointed out by alex martelli this is done by cloning the repository to your thumb drive and then sync it back to svn

867442
getter	setter
it would be nice if i could have a methods which would take as a parameter methods calls to setter and getter and call this for all fields but unfortunately this is not possible with java

867442
getter	setter
use reflection api to find out getter and setter

867442
getter	setter
change fields to public and manipulate them directly without using getter and setter

867466
value	field
these help to refresh the field with the value that actually got stored into the database

867469
droppable	draggable
when i make a draggable clone and drop it in a droppable i cannot drag it again

so when the user selecteds an item and presses a button a method will be called which will use the value the selected item has

867515
pascal	delphi
- maybe this could be adjusted from php for delphi pascal

867517
contains	elements
so while i can envisage a sql table that contains a column with the same name even with my preferred data elements naming convention it would be a rare occurrence indeed

867528
postgresql	oracle
both oracle and postgresql support what s called sequences and the perfect fit for your problem

867537
profiling	debugging
in some circumstances you can also use wct it s usually implmented by debuggingger s or profiling however it can be used from any code as the usual debuggingger requirement of being the thread which has the debugging port open is not a pre-requisit

867543
python	perl
i do think this problem isn t amenable to a general solution but you might be able to encode your domain knowledge into a custom perl python something script that generates the struct definition for each architecture

867577
csv	xml
that technique generated me +10gb xml output s from input csv including exstensive input filters and all faster than anything else i ve seen

867586
listitem	listbox
since the listbox is bound the the contacts observablecollection each listitem will have its datacontext set to the specific object that it is bound to

867590
any	set
in viewdidload you can set any table properties you like except for style style has to be set in the initializer or in ib

867592
document	element
the document must have one root element

867600
entity-framework	data-access
basically have a data-access and entities layer under your asp.net-mvc app then you can replace these entities with entity-framework or nhibernate entities at a later date

867613
webforms	asp.net
on webforms asp.net stores the control that initiated the postback in a hidden field called __eventtarget except for button controls. br more information about that can be found here and here

867625

possible destinations are amazon-s3 mosso cloud files generic ssh scp servers .

867628
any	set
any suggestions on how i should set this up in tfs

867637
unpivot	pivot
you need to use unpivot not pivot

867639
display	width
will produce a list of item1 item2 item3 display with a width of 23

867642
hashmap	arrays
if the fields need to be iterated when comparing why not dispense with the separate fields and put the data into an arrays a hashmap or something similar that is appropriate

867642
value	field
if different field need to be treated compared in different ways you could create approriate helper classes for the value which implement an interface

867652
markup	xhtml
one of the major reasons for developing the xhtml specification was to de-emphasise presentation-related tags in the markup and to defer presentation to css

867686
any	set
so can any body give me some suggestion about how to set a default value to a element in destination schema if nothing is mapped using biztalk map some setting in schema

867686
default-value	default
what i have already tried is i opened the destination schema for all the elements i have set the value n a to a property - default-value which was there in the property tab but when nothing is mapped the default value is not coming

867695
debugging	trace
i read somewhere a utils to show the class + line nbr of the function who called a trace foo which is very handy once you start getting a lot of debugging output

867706
subtract	time
solution 2 parsing the string one character at a time and subtract 0 from each character

867713
progress-bar	progress
i think your progress-bar needs to be based on progress and not time

867721
logfile	tail
i want to use gvim to view a logfile which is being updates continuously such that i always see the last updates line much like tail command in unix

867723
alpha-transparency	alpha
now when i try to extract the data for the first pixels in my png with alpha-transparency it has very weird alpha value

order	add
parsing the string in oposite order use one of the two methods for parsing the single digits multiply the accumulator by 10 then add the digit to the accumulator

867758
selection	cells
this is the cursor that only allows selection of shapes and ignores cells text and the formula bar

867770
abstract-class	derived-class
you could refactor this class in an abstract-class all derived-class just get both

867796
google-chrome	firefox
everything works as expecten in firefox opera safari and google-chrome but not ie7

867799
repository	entity
in the save methods of my repository i have this code for my entity

867802
treeview	listview
but for my part i think it is rather a bad idea to store business data in it untyped ui coupled... apart from the listview and treeview cases for which it is rather convenient

867817
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
a simple approach is to wtite the data out as csv and then import it into a spreadsheet like excel or openoffice.org to do the graph drawing

867836
macros	vba
the macros recorder doesn t pick it up because there is no vba command that can do it

867839
updating	updates
you can work around this by updating once with the updates to revision... dialog and selected fully recursive as depth

867844
filesystems	fat
subversion assumes that filestamps have at least a 1 second precision to check if files have changed but the fat filesystems on most usb drives supports only 2 second precision

867855
selected	button
i have a page with three radio button depending on which button is selected i need to validate some controls using required field validators

867882
attributes	properties
this tutorial is a good example of the idataerrorinfo technique - it makes adding validation parameters easy by adding them as attributes directly to the properties of the model classes

867893
sorted	lookup
found the problem for some reason mysql had decided to start trying to dodns lookup for connections dontknow why but itseems to be sorted out now after adding skip-name-resolve to my.cnf

867911
contains	elements
using these facts you can create an encountered boolean arrays of same size contains all falses initially and while visiting the input arrays put their related encountered elements to true

867912
git-repo	repo
i d recommend using git and github as the remore repo host though there are others and you can certainly self-host git-repo s

867917
configuration	logging
how do i exclude the files that are free for view to be displayed without logging in while still maintaining the user to login for viewing other files in the same folder using just the configuration file

867926
python	lua
another would be the embedding of a second language for scripting purposes such as lua python or javascript

867938
qabstractitemmodel	qmodelindex
one question that i keep asking myself is why are qabstractitemmodel subclassing required to supply a parent methods and why are they required to supply in the resulting qmodelindex the row of a child in the parent

867963
python	perl
with perl or python it d even be easy to crossreference it with the rest of the source and maybe even preserve comments or #ifdefs depending on how cleanly they were used

867980
configuration	logging
how do i exclude the files that are free for view to be displayed without logging in while still maintaining the user to login for viewing other files in the same folder using just the configuration file

868004
document	element
technically will create a div element or more specifically a div dom element but wont add it to your html document

868008
callback	methods
typically your problem happens when the vm uses only one internal java thread for all callback methods in the midp spec

868024
value	field
you can only return one value with the subselect so you have to obtain the field from the recommended table by a join - which i presume is what you have already

868026
postgresql	mysql
also php first or mysql postgresql first

868030
stderr	stdout
it uses different colours for commands and program stdin stdout stderr

868046
postgresql	mysql
as for whether first to install php or mysql postgresql - it does not really matter

868072
allocation	deep
if you are not allocation any heap memory or any other kind of memory that s not on the stack for that matter you can have infinitely deep as long as you are patient enough

868101
.net	wcf
i have a .net 2008 solution with a project that acts as wcf service host

868109
jquery	.post
this isn t directly answering your question but jquery s creator john resig has an interesting blog .post about executing the script tag contents when there is also a src attribute

868122
digits	zero
i am thinking always pad 0 zero in the front and add some checksum digits at the start which might alleviate this problem

868131
any	set
i wonder if is there any way to make shebang value on the top of my php cli files dynamic being set as a constant on a configuration file

868138
python	perl
whether it s bash perl python php...

868141
any	set
if you have parameters for the applet you ll need to set this up. then you can step through the applet code as you would debugging any other java code

868149
attributes	properties
i could able to display my custom controls properties in the properties windows using editorbrowsable attributes

868153
order	add
the only fix is to add an order by clause to your query in the data flow

868174
put	get
put two value mapping label them incoming and default on the map and drag the output from both to your destination you will get a warning at compile time

868174
value	field
put a logical evaluation existence isnil length that suits your need to evaluate if you have an incoming value and drag your source field to it

868174
default-value	default
add a constant parameter to default by double click and insert new parameter that is your default-value

868198
directory	folder
my old and new directory have same folder and files inside

868201
deployment	install
it may not be appropriate for your deployment but it is be possible to install the ssis service stand-alone independent of the sql-server service on you webserver

868207
implements	abstract
implements abstract true simply makes no sense

868208
checkbox	button
i ve a scenario where i need to check a checkbox and click on an ok button in a popup windows

868209
selected	button
now at click event of a button i want to get values of the selected nodes in the treeview

868210
low-level	hardware
this sort of program is typically implimented in a low-level language such as assembler or c where one has direct access to the hardware

868227
revision	svn
the old starter site is available via an old svn revision at the main subsonic google code repository here

868240
highlight	selected
i want to highlight the selected item with some color

868258
implements	extends
you could also implements the observers design pattern but then you would have to extends the canvas class

868295
value	field
i am having a field status which has 3 values activate pending reject .i have made action for changing the status to activate.when i perform the action i want to have the log of rows updated so i need some value which can be stored in log such as id coresponding to that row

868305
stored-procedures	ssis
design the etl using ssis but sometimes with ssis calling stored-procedures in the involved databases

868317

868350
object-reference	instances
the error is object-reference not set to an instances of an object

868360
database-agnostic	sql-server
so for your case nhibernate probably supports your database can be used as a simple data access layer just returning dtos provides a database-agnostic interface and can support sql-server when the time comes

868364
exception-handling	try-catch
call the service within a try-catch block and log ex.tostring if you get an exception-handling

868407
hide	next
how can i get its next sibling and hide it

868411
value	field
i think there are at least two concepts involved - the mutability of a variables or field and the mutability of the value of a variables

868411
value	field
because a value type field contains the whole value a value type stored in a immutable field must be immutable too

868412
shutdown	exit
however it seems that intellij idea does have a exit button next to its stop button which does allow shutdown hooks to run

868421
authentication	login
they would then login as normal of course and any cookies or authentication would be handled as usual

868432
webforms	asp.net
around - 100 of the webforms should be enough considering webforms are more about having things automatically handled for you and asp.net mvc means a lot more control over most of the things

868435
webforms	asp.net
i recommend creating a new asp.net mvc as opposed to webforms project and converting all your asp pages into asp.net in a single exercise

868435
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc lends itself to conversion from asp far more nicely than asp.net webforms in most cases

868457
getter	setter
no they re not if you look at the system.drawing.point struct for example it has a setter as well as a getter on its x property

868464
oracle	mysql
the sql needs to work on oracle sqlserver mysql and db2

868471
asp.net-mvc	webforms
personally i dabbled in webforms for a little bit -- but after using asp.net-mvc there s no going back

868471
asp.net-mvc	webforms
and on a side not asp.net-mvc is built on top of webforms so you can always use them if you want to

868475
directory	folder
back to topic not particularly sure but first add lib folder to your directory structure add it to source control and then try adding a solution folder to your solution where you ll do add existing item for each third-party assembly

868477
external	root
create an external libraries lib libraries folder in root folder add it to source control and reference libraries in projects from there

868510
libxml2	lxml
the symbol _xmlschematronparse is from a library called libxml2 that lxml depends on

868519
ruby	php
symfony is a good framework that uses about the same design patterns that make up ruby on rails but it s not php on rails since it has its own pros and cons

868523
constructor	object
an equivalent with object would be the copy constructor

868537
put	get
i was wondering in this case what if any change would i get if i put the static modifier on the thread static context

868549
libxml2	libxslt
make sure py2app is using the right version of python or install libxml2 and libxslt on your mac

868569
value	field
indicates that the value of a static field is unique for each thread

868571
authentication	login
i could then get my jquery ajax object to ask the user to login and then resend changes once the user was authentication

868591
.when	ready
but how to hide this indicator .when the file is ready and file download dialog pops up

868622
profiling	debugging
i pushed the app to our dev server changed the debugging flag to false in web.config compilation debugging false started up the profiling and used jmeter to generate a few thousand hits

868632
value	field
i have the field rent with the value of 53

868632
value	field
i have the field rent with the value of 53

868632
value	field
i have the field rent with the value of 53

868654
selected	checkbox
now i want the column header also to be a checkbox which if i select all the checkboxex in the column should get selected

868654
selected	cells
but if i use that if i click the firstcell not the header all the below cells are getting selected

868680
postgresql	mysql
i need to replicate data from microsoft sql server to mysql or postgresql

868760
python	c++
in python you don t modify parameters in the c c++ way passing them by reference or through a pointer and doing modifications in situ .there are some reasons such as that the string objects are inmutable in python

868767
text-align	display
i came up with a solution using text-align right and display inline

868776
rijndael	pkcs#7
i am trying to decrypt a file in java which was encrypted in c# using rijndael cbc pkcs#7

868784
value	field
which means that if the user checks the box and uploads the form it will give that field a value of checked as opposed to a value of say male

868796
command-line	cmd
then start exploring what cmd vc actually runs under its covers i believe that d be something like output tab there. you can do all that on command-line though windows is not the programmer-friendliest environment

868797
output	mode
it sounds like this could be because your source image is in cmyk colour mode and your output is in rgb colour mode

868805
python	java
you can however be an employed beginner java c# vb ruby or python programmer and people will pay you to learn

versioning	upgrade
if it s less than what you expect call some code to upgrade the database to the current versioning and then continue

868829
contains	elements
first create a xul overlay login.xul that contains an iframe elements that will display your login page

868849
qabstracttablemodel	qabstractlistmodel
i believe that both qabstractlistmodel and qabstracttablemodel handle the parent portion themselves leaving you free to just worry about the data you want

868855
user-interface	splash-screen
in cases where there is a significant unavoidable delay between starting an application and displaying the first user-interface optimize the perceived startup time by using a splash-screen

868855
user-interface	splash-screen
when the application is ready to display its first user-interface the splash-screen fades

868855
global-assembly-cache	gac
if an assembly is not install in the global-assembly-cache gac there are delays caused by hash verification of strong-named assemblies and by ngen image validation if a native image for that assembly is available on the computer

868855
deployment	install
if you decide to use ngen.exe for your application you will have to use another deployment mechanism such as windows install

868858
folder	dir
so you could have your c++ project pointing to the main folder then create a java project in a different dir and then use the above mechanism to compile all the java source

868889
click	mouse
i would like to simulate a click on one of the dialog s button so you don t have to use the mouse or tab over to it

868954
.when	ready
i normally just knock up the svc file .when i am ready to deploy

868957
default	reset
you d have to decide if navigating to a different form element would reset the button focus to the default button again

868962
default-value	default
the default-value will tell the design that the property has a default value and wont try to set it unless changed

868965

868976
selected	textbox
the problem is that i cant selected text from multiple textbox

868981
sql-server	oracle
looking at sql-server replication technologies you can use non-sql-server subscribers although only oracle and db2 are officially supported at this time custom solutions have been implemented successfully

868993
haskell	scheme
i would suggest you read up on functional programming and maybe learn a functional language like haskell or scheme

868997
any	set
if i have a set of tiles squares which can be any number and they are to fill a container rectangle of an unknown size how do i work out the maximum size of the tiles without having any of them overlap

869013
methods	extend
in addition to the zack s answer i would say that if you need to extend the el expressions in order to have the ability to call methods with parameters you can use the el functors library

869015
highlight	selected
you can t selected ie highlight text of multiple controls

869015
selected	button
i also just tested by adding a button to the form and posted your 3 selected snippets there too.

869015
selected	textbox
when i tabbed through the rest the entire field of the rest of the textbox were fully selected

869032
selected	textbox
if you hit tab to give focus to the next textbox you ll see the text selected

869042
fogbugz	svn
does fogbugz integrate with svn like trac does

869043
selected	cell
selected the start cell for importing the data - cell 1a on worksheet 2

869055
ref	out
the standard way that our applications pass information from oracle stored-procedures to the oracle .net provider is via an out ref cursor parameter

869061
fogbugz	svn
basically you set up an svn post-commit hook script that checks for the presence of a fogbugz case # in the commit message

869066
contains	any
by default clearexport_ssafe exports the files and subprojects in the visual sourcesafe current project but it does not export any files contains in subprojects

869067
deep-copy	object
you need to deep-copy your object

869090
fclose	eof

869099
xsd	xml
xml file parsed against xsd and corrected upload approved

869108
ruby-on-rails	rspec
this question about ruby-on-rails plugins brought up only the usual suspects paperclip rspec shoulda restful auth etc

869132
outlook-object-model	attachment
using the outlook-object-model this is pretty straightforward as both _mailitem and attachment have saveas methods

869169
return-type	arguments
where the class arguments was used just to indicate the return-type

869173
document	element
try using firebug or ie8 developer tools to inspect the element and make sure you don t have conflicting styles from another stylesheet or somewhere else in your html document

869188
order	join
it makes code easier to read in my opinion as the join participants follow the table order

869201
hide	show
my only solution there is to duplicates the fields in another section and hide show the appropriate section based on logic

869215
constructor	private
once you have either the public or private structs deserialized you can use the bouncycastle constructor to recreate the keys

869246
python	php
i recommend you read the src of the iframe on the server side instead using php python or what you fancy fopen the src and fread into a variable than do some str_replace on this variable to extract contents remove body body ... play with the design and place the result in your page

869250
contains	any
it then generates a string contains the formatted value no decimal places for bytes 2 decimal places for any larger magnitude and inspects the magnitude constant to determine what suffix to attach

869255
credentials	ntlm
consuming this service from a .net windows client the cached ntlm credentials flow to the server pc and things work great

869255
credentials	ntlm
ideally we d like the ntlm cached credentials to flow automatically to the server

869262
any	set
in acts on any kind of set operation whereas is on a single value

869270
internet-explorer	firefox
so if someone normally logs in from an ip owned by verizon using firefox and then suddenly they log in from one in brazil using internet-explorer that might be someone sharing their login details

869275
instances	private
if a struct or class has non-readonly public fields public properties with setters or methods which set private fields it is mutable because you can change its state without creating a new instances of that type

869275
value	field
in a comment you said you cannot have a reference to the value of field or variables

869283
void	main
public static void main java.lang.string

869283
void	main
public static void main java.lang.string

869302
authentication	login
if the value of the login is high enough you could send out a piece of hardware like banks use for authentication - it generates a pin every time you want to login

869309
g++	gcc
i use gcc g++ on linux and since my install is in spanish my native language gcc prints warnings and errors in spanish

869309
g++	gcc
i ve googled for this but every language topic about gcc and g++ refers to programming language not human language

869317
findstr	cmd
more advanced options for the findstr cmd will let you do fancier checks certain character sets ect

869321
constructor	object
but you have to be sure that the constructors functions you pass this to are not trying to access the referenced object before a s constructor finishes

869338
display	width
try adding a display block to the element so it spreads out to width of the parent instead of just the width of textnode of the element

869342
any	set
these locale categories can be set to any value supported by your installation

869350
stream	send
i ve implements systems like this and you would do better to use a video codec such as mpeg-2 mpeg-4 asp h.264 etc than jpeg and send updatess as p-frames delta from the previous image and if there s too big a change or missed updates or new client added to an existing stream send an i-frame

869350
google-chrome	firefox
in terms of how to get the buffer to send you can use a number of framebuffers to render to and set up the framebuffer code to start a timer when a change is made and while changes are occurring send periodic changes when enough time has gone by since the last change not sent yet send an update probably shorter time than the first value and also probably include some sort of strobe that forces an update that can be invoked on certain occurrences if you can for example get a page-load-completion indication from the browser which you can with a little work in firefox by changing the google-chrome etc

869350
remote-desktop	rdp
for examples of other solutions look at remote-desktop protocols and programs like vnc rdp windows remote desktop etc - that s effectively what they re doing again with fancier compression and damage-region tracking

869365
firefox	safari
this appears correctly in safari and firefox but not in ie

869372
continuous-integration	teamcity
we will be using teamcity for continuous-integration and subversion as our version-control system

869398
.when	ready
then .when the changes ar ready use svn import

869431
highlight	selected
jquery solution - for selected single node highlight asp.net 2.0 treeview control on client side

869432
highlight	selected
is it possible to modify it so that i can selected the div that is being highlight or customize the area that it outlines

869439
children	nodes
the root cause is that the standard dom level 3 cannot represent text nodes as children of a document without breaking the spec

869449
put	get
if i put the common functionality in a base class that inherits from the common ancestor i get a class which makes no sense to instantiate so i made it abstract

869466
administration	account
the best way would be to ensure no untrusted process gets administration access or runs as the same user account as your application

869471
administration	account
if the user rights permit this it s by design - the os provides the facility to all users that you the administration of the system have assign to the account under which they run

869478
innodb	myisam
make sure your tables are innodb because it won t work on myisam tables

869488
attributes	properties
ideally you ll want to just create a style called itemopen or something that has that z-index properties set up like this but even the style attributes will do the trick

869492
subclassing	base-class
why don t you go all the way and make your factory in the base-class pass in a parameter indicating which subclassing you want it to return

869528
administration	account
you can check your event-viewer on the target server and look at the security log to see the failed logins from the sql-server account on the other machine mine was running as a local administration

869532
hash	md5
with a 128 bit md5 hash that s 16 bytes per hash or only about 1.6mb of memory + overhead

869541
keyboard	mouse
this still allows the indicator to appear when focused by keyboard but hides when mouse activated

869560
cublas	gpu
follow up lapack is a full featured library for dealing with all kind of linear algebra stuff and it s damn efficient at this there are also gpu based libraries such as cublas which runs on nvidia gpus using cuda

869566
security	owasp
one of the most important security rules #7 on the owasp top 10 is not to write your own authentication mechanism when there are tried and tested mechanisms available

869568
hide	show
you can code your own solution with a div contains an input-field and a button and some javascript to show hide the div

869571
logout	login
if someone doesn t logout or switches browsers or their computer crashes they don t want to wait a day to login again

869575
vxworks	linux
i wrote my own library of safe functions only about 15 that we use frequently that would be used on multiple platforms -- linux windows vxworks intime rtx and uitron

869578
xlsx	xls
xls and xlsx workbooks

869588
python	java
edit examples are genshi python or jsp 2.0 java

869589
command-line	cmd
when i execute the cmd from a cmd-line it works fine but it fails when is being executed as a part of crontab errorcode 255 - cannot establish ssh connection

869591
order	join
it doesn t matter which order you write the join in as long as the tables you re referencing have already been mentioned in the query

869593
value	field
i want to find the first item in a sorted vector that has a field less than some value x

869597
downcasting	constructor
no downcasting no no if t has only explicit constructor for u

869597
double	int
but an implicit conversion happens from double to int

869598
least-squares	regression
a more general solution to this problem where you could have more equations than unknowns would be to find the linear regression least-squares solution

869625
unpivot	pivot
i have done things like that for ease of maintenance because pivot and unpivot do not allow lists to be dynamic sql because they result in a schema change on the output table

869636
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc is only part of asp.net - so for building scalable and fast asp.net mvc applications you actually must learn all asp.net i think you must learn webforms too - at least partially

869647
windows-xp	windows
windows vista and windows-xp

869654
design-time	designer
activity constructor are called during design-time also so doing things like connecting to a database etc should never be done in constructor this can make the designer take too long to open workflow document using these activities

869655
administration	account
i see you are using an administration account to run your service

869661
value	field
the easiest way to make the comparison work is to create a dummy object with the key field set to your search value

869668
entity-framework	ado.net
i m just starting out with the entity-framework and ado.net data services and i ve run into an issue that i can t seem to figure out

869672
directory	folder
i created a winform that would do the following create a new local user account and add them to a grouping create a new directory under our ftp server s base directory create a new virtual ftp folder so that a user could map a connection to the folder and finally give the new user full control of the new directory and because the directory was a virtual folder the new user has full control via ftp

869681
textbox	button
my problem is that this function fires when the user hits the enter button in any textbox not just the one that calls the function

869693
value	field
later someone invented setf set field as a generic way of assigning value to data-structures to mirror the l-value of other languages

869699
ubuntu	debian
if you have shell access and it s an ubuntu debian machine just do

869702
value	field
i am using a formula field to concatonate 2 decimal value separated by a dash

869712
web-services	api
is it a common pattern to establish a hosted back-end of web-services which does all the database shopping site api connections web-services work and have the iphone app consume services on this backend

869712
json	xml
also if you are establshing a web-services back-end is it better to use rest json vs rest xml vs soap xml...etc

869716
contains	elements
one way to deal with the optional elements is for your xml to contains empty elements when there is no value as in this column s comment

869728
arguments	default
the event is by default passed as an arguments to your function but your not capturing it as a parameter

869761
positioning	slider
i already implemented a song slider from sacha barber s application and it works when the user drags the seeker manually as in the song continues from that positioning but i cannot figure out how to make the seeker move according to the current positioning in the song

869765
ruby	php
that will help me decide if it s worth to switch from php to ruby

869768
constructor	object
i think i have to implement my own serialization constructor in order to be notified when my object gets deserialized so it can resubscribe to the event

869772
system.diagnostics	.net
i m still not sure how exactly system.diagnostics exposes process.processname without requiring the sedebugprivilege but then i know next to nothing about the code security features of .net

869776
background-image	background-color
the closest you can get is using a background-color with your background-image

869780
json	xml
are there any stream-reading parsing libraries available for json or xml formats in as3

869782
emacs	vim
vim emacs textmate

869789
ruby	php
and yes it is worth it to switch from php to ruby

869798
xsd	xml
furthermore the whole purpose of having an xsd validate the input xml schema is defeated

869802
double	int
what is the best way to get these input in types like double or int

869807
radio	click
2 when i click to radio

869807
selected	checkbox
a selected all checkbox in the same div

869810
callback	methods
the standard non-xml serialization mechanism uses special attributes to mark methods to be used as callback during de serialization

869811
json	xml
as for json vs xml obviously json is more lightweight which makes it a better candidate for the iphone generally but if your data requires a representation more complex than json can offer then go with xml

869815
subtract	add
if you really want to replace all your tdatetime variables with this you probably need to overload some other operators too add subtract explicit ...

869829
environment	building
i want to see all of the current environment variables during a building

869832
conditional	operators
is it ok to use conditional operators like a statement like so

869836
contains	any
this will match any string of any length that does not contains

869840
32-bit	64bit
they aren t separate registries--one is a subnode of the other and the os does virtualization to make sure that 32-bit apps get their keys and 64bit apps get their keys

869845
conditional	operators
the conditional operators is almost always used for selected two alternative values not statements

869847
command-line	cmd
so when you execute the cmd from the cmd-line it finds your private key in ssh-agent and uses it to log in to the remote machine

869855
environment	building
if you just keyin set in the post building event it display the environment variables in the output windows

869856
instances	self
in short it should be possible to prevent self recursive selection of a model instances in the admin

869856
instances	self
question is can you get at the article instances self being edited the admin before the form is created to do the same thing

869863
32-bit	64bit
the short answer is that if you run a 32-bit application on a 64bit machine then it s registry keys are located under a wow6432node

869863
32-bit	64bit
however if you compile your application as a 32-bit binary and run it on a 64bit machine then your registry information is now located here

869863
32-bit	64bit
this means that if you run both the 32-bit and 64bit versions of your application on the same machine then they will each be looking at a different set of registry keys

869866
conditional	operators
conditional operators are intentionally succinct and especially useful for assignments

869866
conditional	operators
that said a conditional operators can still be readable

869876
getter	setter
are implements using the getter and the setter of the superclass

869908
nsnumberformatter	nsscanner
you ll then want to use either strtol strtoul strtod nsscanner or nsnumberformatter to convert the input to numeric types

869945
configuration	logging
not really being familiar with the built-in jdk logging available with java.util.logging is there an easy way to have any log messages sent to jul logged against log4j so i can use my existing configuration and set up for any logging coming from ehcache

869954
asp.net-mvc	webforms
neither webforms nor asp.net-mvc are the end-all be-all of web development

869960
constructor	private
if you want to make absolutely sure nobody can create one perhaps you could make the default constructor private

869987
ruby-on-rails	django
.net presumably 4.0 will have it standard ruby-on-rails django

869987
sql-server	mysql
and i don t see why actually writing sql in sql-server or mysql is that painful nor do i understand the benefits of orm linq and so forth

869997
getter	setter
you say you presently have getter and setter for all these fields

869997
getter	setter
change all the getter and setter to access the arrays

869997
getter-setter	getter
then create a generic getter-setter pair that use an index as well as a getter for the compare flag

869997
getter	setter
as you already have getter and setter any other code using this class should continue to work unchanged

869997
getter	setter
if there is no other code using this class then throw away the existing getter and setter and just do everything with the arrays

870004
implements	abstract
a compiler does indeed act as an effective specification of a language in terms of a reduction to machine code - however as it s generally difficult to understand a language by reading the compiler s source one generally considers a programming language in terms of an abstract processing model that the compiler implements

870008
sftp	ftps
curl is a command line tool for transferring files with url syntax supporting ftp ftps http http scp sftp tftp telnet dictionary ldap ldaps and file

870008
http	ssl
curl supports ssl certificates http post http put ftp uploading http form based upload proxies cookies user+password authentication basic digest ntlm negotiate kerberos... file transfer resume proxy tunneling and a busload of other useful tricks

870029
order	add
i d like to add and order by for a many-to-one associations but i don t see how that can be done

870041
strcpy	gets
it makes sense that gets strcpy and similar apis where the destination size is unclear

870044
affinity	cpu
i d suggest setting the cpu affinity to the slow core and see if it s just as fast that way

870044
affinity	cpu
setting zope s cpu affinity to any cpu fixed the problem

870046
python	java
i have done this with pretty much every reflective mechanism that exists in the python world cpython on python api s and com api s using makepy jython for java api s and ironpython for .net api s

870052
button	popup
i have a button that when clicked opens a popup

870052
button	popup
the popup is a sub-menu containing more button

870052
button	popup
when one of the button on the sub-menu are clicked the popup closes

870052
button	popup
closing the popup when a sub-menu button is clicked i ve been able to do

870052
button	popup
within the click handler for those button i close the popup

870052
button	popup
i ve tried handling the lostfocus event for the button that opens the popup and setting staysopen to true

870052
button	popup
the problem now is that the lostfocus event is handled and the popup closed before it reads a click on any button on the popup

870061
unsafe	out
these operations while also inherently unsafe are more easily used right and make wrong code stand out

870063
any	set
quick update if i set the file extension of my generated excel file as xml it opens in the browser even though i m sending the correct headers but if i choose to save the xml file and then open it from excel it works without any warnings

870073
click	mouse
however for really long texts it disappears before there is time to read everything so i would like to make it stay longer or possibly until the dismissed manually eg by moving away the mouse or click

870080
union-all	union
also a union-all takes longer than a union distinct

870090
required	checked
there should be a decision about where user-input is validated at what boundary and where other potential defensive issues required checked for example third party integration points publicly available apis rules engine integration or different units coded by different teams of programmers

870096
buffering	capture
i believe you would then need to capture you scripting s output via output buffering and pass it to the layout to be echoed

870102
google-chrome	firefox
to prevent these things in google-chrome opera firefox etc

870107
deployment	install
it s just going to be used by fellow developers deployment templates who have all the base components already install framework vsto runtime

870118
jquery	.post
besides if you are doing anything more complex than loading some x html into an element you should probably use one of the more powerful jquery ajax methods get or .post or ajax

870124
selected	button
i actually don t want it to be a real mouse cursor no need for ability to click on button selected text etc

870126
put	get
on an aside this so question in a roundabout way asked if there is any way to get eclipse to put the + symbol on the new line when it splits a string for you

870133
versioning	upgrade
there might still be corporate environments where they won t upgrade for a while because they have legacy web apps that depend on the browser versioning or just won t spare the manpower to coordinate an upgrade

870137
detect	move
the objects are nodes and edges represented in datatemplate s with thumb and polyline objects and i want to be able to detect click and drags on the itemscontrol in order to move the nodes and edges

870137
click	mouse
how do i attach mouse event handler to the itemscontrol to detect mouse click and drags on blank space

870142
triggers	insert
getting triggers to insert changed column values only in audit table

870144
windows-vista	windows
the samples for windows search are included in the windows-vista sp1 sdk

870160
put	get
i asked how to do this before but it seems i needed to put more code to really get an answer

870167
stdin	pipe
i have a windows c program that gets its data through a redirected stdin pipe sort of like this

870167
stdin	eof
the reason for this is that 1 the input is a data stream and there is no eof and 2 the program needs to be able to abort its stdin -reading thread at any time

870174
put	get
if there is any way to get eclipse to put the + symbol on the new line when it splits a string for you

870199
rendering	redraw
i can get it to resize itself by calling rendering on the grid but how can i detect that the parent windows has resized so that i know to redraw the grid widget

870201
constructor	object
starting threads in constructor that run code in the still-under-construction object is dangerous

870213
revision	svnadmin
so basically i want to download all the revision and be able to import them into my own repo using svnadmin

870231
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 is available or even google-chrome firefox safari etc

870253
waitpid	fork
in unix terminology i want to fork exec waitpid and getrusage

870263
doubly-linked-list	linked-list
a linked-list or doubly-linked-list which optimizes traversals

870267
foundation	cocoa
the rules for memory management in core foundation are similar to those in cocoa if the method that returns a reference contains the words create or copy you own the reference and must call cfrelease on that reference to relinquish ownership

870272
subtract	time
note that you can only subtract the datetime data type--to subtract a date or a time value you would have to convert to datetime or use other methods to get the better precision a whole lot of dateadd datediff and possibly other junk or perhaps using a higher precision time unit and dividing

870288
updating	updates
you could write a before updates triggers where you use the old and new alias in your triggers to compare the value that were available in the record before the updates with the value you are updating with

870296
instances	destroy
i know the gc will take care of those instancess but i m not sure it would destroy the first instances before going on to the next

870313
order	add
we can add additional rules to our model in the future and do not have to make any code changes to our controllers or view in order for them to be supported

870315
contains	elements
the realm was specified in a context elements contains in a file located inside the webapp at meta-inf context.xml

870324
data-structures	tree
but since both data-structures have huge fanouts the vast majority of your matches will be on leaf nodes anyway making on average the b+ tree more efficient

sql-server	mysql
and i don t see why actually writing sql in sql-server or mysql is that painful nor do i understand the benefits of orm

870346
checkbox	textbox
i have a field in my model - call it distance - and i want to write a view that contains both a checkbox and a textbox

870346
checkbox	textbox
if the checkbox is checked the textbox becomes disabled and distance gets the value 0 when the form is submitted

870346
checkbox	textbox
if the checkbox is not checked distance gets whatever value is in the textbox when the form is submitted

870353
constructor	object
recently i ve created a simple class that calls getguiresources function in both the constructor and destructor and reports any differences in gdi object counts

870367
command-prompt	cmd
note if you are using this cmd in the windows cmd-prompt then you need to use instead of

870369
windows-vista	windows
i ve implemented a deskband taskbar toolbar using the bandobjectlib extending explorer with band objects using .net and windows forms from codeproject modified with support for the ideskband2 interface which allows the start menu in windows-vista to retain transparency when my deskband taskbar toolbar is enabled

870387
compact-framework	.net
can i code once in j2me and run it on any mobile phone just like i can using the .net compact-framework

870407
32-bit	64bit
a 32-bit os can t support 64bit software

870407
32-bit	64bit
core2duo is 64bit and can also run in 32-bit mode

870412
versioning	upgrade
there is no scripting that has the straight final versioning even deploy on a clean db does the deploy via a series of upgrade steps

870421
selected	button
our previous in-house cms used a fairly simple model which the editors seemed to like over each input field a thin row of toggle button js-powered selected which language was currently being edited

870421
textbox	button
they behave kind of like radio button selecting one deselects all the others and the textbox immediately flips to reflect that value

870427
versioning	upgrade
if you recompile the new features and thus have a new precompiled site running a new versioning of .net there won t be anything to merge unless you don t do a full deployment but if you don t do a full deployment how can you have upgrade to a new versioning of .net

870430
reflection	runtime
the only way to pull the properties of the runtime generated anonymous-class is to use reflection

870450
web-crawler	seo
for seo this would not be a problem since web-crawler don t issue posts and therefore do not see the ugly address

870460
order	add
add 10 more units of xyz to the order

870475
shopping-cart	cart
instead of putting each cart item in the session have a db table and every time the user selected an item add that item to the shopping-cart table

870476
binaries	install
as long as you re on a 64 bit os and install 64 bit binaries you re good to go

870489
contains	set
i have a query set up that contains a case statement which works 95 of the time.

870501
ruby	php
i program in php mostrly and ruby sometimes i happen to be in need of a way to implements those hash arguments into my php funcions like say an html select helper

870505
shopping-cart	paypal
from there the javascript file will create a form to use with a paypal shopping-cart

870505
shopping-cart	cart
this is the paypal shopping-cart code for the add to cart button

870516
python	java
my backgrounds are more in c and java than python i used ant and makefile

870518
python	php
i do a lot of python also and i dearly miss named arguments when using php

870518
codeigniter	cakephp
this is the way libraries like codeigniter and cakephp handle the same scenario

870534
compact-framework	.net
neither j2me nor .net compact-framework are ubiquitous though j2me is supported on an impressive number of phones you can only run either on phones that support them

870536
testdriven.net	xunit.net
we use testdriven.net with xunit.net for testing

870541
python	java
however outside of web development javascript is generally considered to be a somewhat ugly and hackish language so i don t think it would be allowed to transcend its browser sandbox and compete with the likes of c++ java python etc

870543
itemscontrol	grid
i needed an itemscontrol that supported scrolling and i needed to have the items on a grid rather than the default stackpanel

870543
scrollable	grid
in order to get mouse events with meaningful mouse coordinates coordinates in scrollable space it was necessary to obtain a reference to the grid using a strange incantation

870549
jquery	dojo
and most of its uses have already been bottle up in the form of jquery and prototype and dojo

870580
click	mouse
it s a dwell-clicker to help people like myself who experience pain when they click the mouse

870580
click	mouse
this software simulates a click when the mouse pauses at a location on the screen

870587
python	java
one thing to really watch out with if you are used to java like me is that python does not support split packages

870589
entity-relationship	diagram
when you have your entity-relationship diagram on one a4 or a3 in front of you proper normalization will mean no many to many relationships

870599
directory	folder
there s also a cache folder in the ide directory

870623
jsonp	ajax
if you try to send an ajax request a jsonp request or even a window.name request on unload safari and chrome run the code but the server never sees the request

870623
firefox	safari
this code and ajax and window.name creates a request for test.html in firefox and ie7 but not safari

870626
xsd	xml
i looked at validating an xml against referenced xsd in c# for validation procedure

870634
methods	extend
i d like to override extend not sure of the proper terminology this methods to log the text to a file instead or maybe in addition to the trace output

870640
packaging	building
there should be powerpoint and code samples to achieve automated building and packaging

870650
subclassing	inherited
unless you are doing some really funky inherited hierarchies and you shouldn t it is enough to know that the lookup order is left to right depth first and all subclassing of a class are searched before that class is searched

870673
hash	md5
more useful than checksums if you really need the extra application-level assurance would be a sha-n hash of the data or md5 etc

870685
automake	gnu
supports multiple versions of make gnu microsoft borland automake visual-c++ 6.0 and visual-studio 2003 2005 and 2008

870689
stubs	tdd
before i tried tdd i would create a class say employee then i would stubs in things like firstname lastname email etc

870696
macros	let
the old mfc macros code would let things slip but they worked

870710
any	set
the pointer name or any variables name for that matter are not compiled into the final binary provided you don t compile with symbols set to on

870713
project-management	project
once you get your project to a comfy state then start tackling some optimizations with cython and the extra project-management that comes with that

870713
distutils	scons
distutils can build extension modules so i m not sure you ll need make scons

870722
radio-button	selected
if you only have three options and the user is only allowed to selected one of those three options i would suggest using either a combo box or a radio-button grouping

870739
linked-list	tree
b+trees are much easier and higher performing to do a full scan as in look at every piece of data that the tree indexes since the terminal nodes form a linked-list

870741
.net	wcf
i m planning on hosting 3 or 4 wcf .net 3.5 rest webservices to be used by a new iphone application

870744
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter mouseleave

870744
contains	elements
elements also contains the storyboard

870781
datagridview	databound
if you re adding rows dynamically i must assume the datagridview is not databound

870808
e-commerce	product
question what database model technique or pattern should be used to deal with classes of attributes describing e-commerce product which can be changed at run time

870808
e-commerce	product
in a good e-commerce database you will store classes of options like tv resolution then have a resolution for each tv but the next product may not be a tv and not have tv resolution

870808
e-commerce	product
there is a nice common feature among good e-commerce apps where they show a set of product then have drill down side menus where you can see tv resolution as a header and the top five most common tv resolutions for the found set

870823
bitnami	redmine
you can try redmine - a painless installation is provided by bitnami redmine stack

870840
oracle	mysql
of course there s always the various enterprise databases oracle mysql sql server etc... as well

870844
silverlight	wpf
i have a working wpf application that would like to port to silverlight

870844
silverlight	wpf
i have a piece of wpf code that i haven t found a way to mimic in silverlight

870871
contains	set
will be a wrapped set contains the a tag that triggers the event

870871
contains	elements
will contains the parent td elements

870881
psake	nant
make a simple build scripting using whatever you want cmd nant rake psake ... that

870882
directory	folder
i created the directory structure as suggested with folder for logs

870887
ns-3	ns2
if you are using jaxb ri and don t like the default ns2 and ns-3 namespace prefixes you need to provide your own namespaceprefixmapper

870896
revision	svn
it s nice to be able to put the version of the app that your running on the bottom of your page like the svn revision number on the bottom right-hand corner of this page

870898
put	get
imo there is hardly a need for a framework simply use the servlet api and implement the request methods you need aka post get put delete head

870936
methods	extend
okay by open here you re meaning can be derived from and not open in the sense of ruby and smalltalk where you can extend a class with new methods at run-time right

870938
firefox	safari
and it works great except for this while safari and firefox on the mac work perfectly ie and firefox on windows add an extra page

870942
conditional	operators
conditional operators are handy for short statements

870942
conditional	operators
conditional operators can be made readable as multiline statements with the right indentation but if else syntax is much more familiar to most developers

870942
conditional	operators
i will add that multi-line conditional operators leave you open to semicolon insertion errors

870942
conditional	operators
if you must use a multi-line conditional operators make sure operatorss are at the end of each line

870947
nested	assign
what the optimizer is doing is comparing a lot of possible execution plans full table scan using an index nested loop join etc. the optimizer is assign a number to each plan then selected the plan with the lowest number

870955
keyboard	mouse
i just noticed last week that my keyboard has a right-click button between alt and ctrl on the right side so no mouse needed to mouse to a specific test

870962
basic	vb6
i am new to vb6 and visual basic in any form development and i ve come across a problem

870977
environment	building
with google app engine you ll find yourself building on an android-emulator you don t really run bigtable locally so there s not a one to one correspondence between your environment and that on the server

870983
arrays	loops
i want to loops through a arrays of string values and build a linq expression

870987
turkish	hebrew
the fontdialog class in c# has a property allowscriptingchange that lets the user selected the scripting western hebrew arabic turkish etc

870993
groovy	java
in the java space groovy has some support for building dsls

870994
inversion-of-control	solid-principles
in the process i had to learn about persistence ignorance inversion-of-control brush up on solid-principles and then learn about the asp.net-mvc architecture itself

870994
entity	poco
i ran into serialization issues with circular references in object graphs entity vs poco objects and persisting data from the client and back into the database

870994
put	get
i really am starting to get what rest is about and getting into the guts of http and rooting for html5 put delete support

871002
superclass	inherited
in oo this isn t an issue when you re using inherited to extend a type because when you call a function for which there is no specific overload it can just use the implementation for a superclass

871016
python	perl
i would recommend using something like perl or python over batch files though

871028
gitignore	git-add
this just output the commands to add an empty gitignore file to all empty directory in a git project and git-add -f em to the repo

871047
worksheet	excel
which forces excel to calculate the worksheet and

871058
command-line	cmd
it seems like there should be another way to do this but you can pass commands to be executed as command-line parameters to cmd

871059
python	ruby
i think python and ruby are becoming the big dynamic languages outside the browser

871059
json	xml
json has been pretty well received--even for things like data persistance as in couchdb but i d guess something like yaml will supplant json as json is supplanting xml which supplanted csv.

871067
selected	button
the problem is that the click handler isn t being fired until you let go of the mouse button and the drop-down vanishes so the label.disabled selected style is still applied

871093
ruby-on-rails	django
django ruby-on-rails jboss seam etc all take this approach

871099
business-logic-layer	data-layer
i would typically place this logic in the service business-logic-layer which would do the speaking to the data-layer and models

871134
integer	zero
if you cast to integer yeah integers don t have leading zero so they disappear

871135
integer	zero
i d say because the leading zero don t have any importance when cast to an integer

871149
ruby-on-rails	django
i think ruby-on-rails and django framework should be your top 2

871149
ruby-on-rails	django
i would go for django and if you find ruby cute you might look at ruby-on-rails

871159
locale	french
a locale is associated to a language english french japanese... and a region us canada japan...

871171
export	csv
but that said if you are only export simple data small text fields and numbers go with csv

871187
tortoisesvn	smartsvn
svn on windows is dreadfully slow tried tortoisesvn smartsvn command-line svn an update can take in the upwards of 5-8 minutes and it is only updating 10 small files

871188
contains	elements
the returned elements must be the parent node of a and should not contains any of a s siblings

871196
ironpython	cpython
so i can easily switch the interpreter from ironpython to cpython and vice versa

871207
dictionary	arrays
specify an indent of 1 to have your nested arrays or dictionary indent everything it prints by the specified amount

871210
arguments	default
the value of the debugging arguments is false by default for the command-line compiler but in flex builder you have to manually create a non-debugging swf

871225
firefox	safari
in safari 4 and firefox 3.5 you can determine the progress of an xmlhttprequest as follows

871235
jar	war
any project is responsible for building and then versionning its set of files to be delivered jar war ear ...

871268
exception-handling	try-catch
you could wrap the testing code in a try-catch block catch the thrown exception-handling check the internal cause log assert whatever and then rethrow the exception-handling if desired

871276
getter	setter
your title getter and setter should save the value in a _title variables to be used later for the assignment in commitproperties

871310
value	field
if i have to give a unique identity to a row in a table especially if it represents a business object i prefer to use a single value surrogate id - a guid or an integer - if any of the field in the table isn t suitable

871322
restrict	shared
we have a server application that we want to restrict non-users from triggerring it off from other machines or even by double-clicking from any shared

871354
sqrt	pow
operators and sqrt pow etc

871356
zend-framework	symfony
once comfortable with php and javascript i d recommend looking at some javascript libraries such as jquery or yui and looking at the source of one you like then maybe take a look at something like the zend-framework or symfony for php

871372
union-all	union
also a union-all takes longer than a union distinct

871375
subclassing	superclass
the superclass and all the other subclassing continue to work unchanged

871375
superclass	subclass
it is very expensive to add a new operation on things you have to add a new methods declaration to the superclass and potentially add a methods definition to every existing subclass

871402
ruby	php
php doesn t have support for named parameters and or smalltalk objective-c ruby style selectors

871412
filtering	sorting
according to msdn the valuetype property is used when filtering or sorting the columns with respect to the contents of their cells. so i would be sure to set it for any column that allows sorting

871417
declarative	imperative
using a containers is mostly about changing from an imperative scripted style of initialization and configuration to a declarative one

871422
put	get
i can put data into the amazon simpledb service and i can get it back

871437
constructor	object
then create a service class that implements the interface with a constructor that takes in a userdao object

871437
implementation	instantiation
this way the object that requires the service doesn t perform instantiation it s done by spring and is unaware of what underlying implementation is performed ldap sso simple password comparison etc

871439
arrays	loops
while the example code above is loopsing through the arrays in the simplexml object simplexml- body- querywithattributesresult- item you can also loops through a simplexml object say simplexml- body- querywithattributesresult- item 0 and that would give you each of the object s properties

871452
cvs	git
i m also a 10+ year mostly happy user of cvs though i also like git and with time will come to prefer it though most of the projects i work on currently use cvs or svn and we can t seem to get the bureacracy where i work convinced to let us punch a git-hole through the firewall

871458
declarative	imperative
either you encapsulate that complexity in imperative code or else in declarative code

871462
integer	modulus
you can either using integer division and divide it by two and inspect the remainder or use a modulus operator and mod it by two and inspect the remainder

871462
difference	factors
the fastest way depends on the language compiler and other factors but i doubt there are many platforms for which there is a significant difference

871476
abstract-class	pure-virtual
i m drawing some uml in which a concrete class inherits from an abstract-class which defines a pure-virtual methods

871530
textbox	button
what i m trying to achieve i have a search engine that has a textbox for the search text and two radio button for the search location ie city1 or city2

871532
pointers	stack
you are going to see or read about solutions that allow the startup code and the linker scripting to work together to not have to hardcode stack pointers heap space things like that again you can put a lot of work into complicated startup code and linker scriptinging to gain some automation and perhaps save some work perhaps not

871580
perl	awk
grep sed awk perl would take care of the data post-processing

871583
value	field
if you are matching the full value of the field use

871621
methods	extend
if you re using the latest version of junit you can extend the default test runner to handle this for you without having to wrap each of your methods in a try catch block

871628
stored-procedures	ssis
the exceptions are that i will use an ssis_ prefix for stored-procedures which aren t directly used as part of the normal database operations but which are used by an ssis package to reference the database

871642
click	mouse
it s because the transparent brush allows an area to be hittable and thus receive and respond to mouse click whereas the default null brush doesn t

871644
command-prompt	cmd
opening a command-prompt cmd and typing g++ or alike works fine

871672
instances	private
other than that having a separate lock object can be a good way of encapsulating the lock within the class it s used by preventing it from being used by outside callers in a way you didn t predict but there s probably no performance difference per se from using one object to another as the lock using the instances itself vs a private object declared just to be a lock within that class as you suggest provided the two objects would otherwise be used in exactly the same way

871700
linkbutton	onclick
think of linkbutton s onclick event which contains a call to a javascript function

871709
jquery	.post
edit i m using jquery to do the .post back to the server

871728
selected	cell
here i need to assign text to the selected cell s name label

871728
selected	cell
how do i get the selected cell reference and keep it for assigning

871763
value	field
which will bind the value to the controllers field

871773
queue	fifo
a relatively recent paper on lock-free fifo queue is this search for further papers by the same author s

871789
any	set
when you properly set up your socket file handles it will use the os s underlying iocp implementation allowing your operations to complete without using any threads or in the worst case using a thread that i believe comes from the kernel s io thread pool instead of .net s thread pool which helps alleviate threadpool congestion.

871789
synchronous	.when
one of the other main concerns is error-handling - properly handling errors .when writing asynchronous i o code is much much harder than doing it in synchronous code

871789
promise	future
it allows you to avoid the scalability hassles imposed by the cost of thread objects and in many cases you can completely avoid the use of locks and mutexes by making careful use of concurrency primitives like future promise

871791
any	set
it just means that any entries that do use the two byte set have a slight overhead of an additional marker telling the engine that the sequence is using two bytes

871796
arguments	default
coming from php i m used to declaring a function with a default arguments value like this

871802
boost	stl
i m not particularly familiar with the boost libraries so there may be a more standard way to do this but i think you can do what you want with iterators and the stl transform function templates

871812
python	java
clarification i m not working in java but in python so i can t use java-specific commands in my parsing mechanism

871821
instance-variables	ivar
private means that the ivar instance-variables can only be accessed directly from within an instance of that same class

871821
instances	private
so to answer your question private protects ivars from access by an instances of any other class

871828
populate	row
this will cause them to be populate with textbox in each row

871851
arguments	default
objective-c programmers accomplish a similar goal though by creating convenience methodss that just call to a more primitive methods with some of the arguments filled in with default value

871852
temporary	copy
that s easier to copy around etc. delete the temporary directory on exit

871854
iframe	popup
you may also use an iframe as suggested by phil or even a frame or a full-blown popup blockable mind you

871856
value	field
so when version 2 of the class is created record which value have changed and store this in two changelog field on the version 2 object there must already be one parent table that sits atop all your tables - use that one

871856
value	field
the second changelog field is a delimted list of changed fields eg date time to do this before saving you would loop over the value submitted by the user compare to current database value and concatenation 2 strings one human readable one a list of field names

871856
value	field
loop through the fields in the changelog field list and annotations the display to show that the value has changed a or a highlight etc

871856
display	outline
say in version 3 only the course outline changed - if that was the only changelog you had when displaying the schedule the change to date and time wouldn t be display

871888
constructor	object
when ever a function has a object passed by value it uses either copy constructor or bit wise copy to create a temporary to place on stack to use inside the function how about some object returned from function

871893
positioning	slider
when the user clicks on the slider the handle shall appear at the proper positioning

871894
constructor	object
the c++ standard states that the compiler can choose to create a temporary object using the copy constructor or it can choose to optimise away the temporary

871904
conditional	operators
i need to write multiple statements inside a conditional operators

871904
conditional	operators
what will be the equivalent of this if condition with conditional operators

871928
json	csv
if i had csv data that i really wanted to deal with on the client then i would use text csv and json any to convert to a format that javascript can parse natively before sending it to the client

871933
conditional	operators
the conditional operators is really meant to return a value from an expression not to execute full statements

871933
conditional	operators
by using the conditional operators you make your code harder to read and more perilous to debugging

871933
conditional	operators
if you insist on using the conditional operators alamar s solution appears to fit your need quite nicely

871933
conditional	operators
and if you do comment it there s really no bandwidth savings in using the character-wise shorter conditional operators over the if-else statement

871937
interpreter	runtime
interpreter languages often contains mechanisms for treating data as code which means you can pass code into a function in some form and then execute it -- or even generate code at runtime

871963
contains	elements
the text elements of the children contains the ampersand symbol

871968
ubuntu	linux
note i am using ubuntu and i am all-together new to anything linux

871980
children	tree
representation will often be like tree such as + 2 3 where + is the root and 2 3 are the children

872000
constructor	object
so the constructor builts the object where it is told to - the forth parameter of func

872018
directdraw	direct3d
those flags toggle the opengl pipeline turn of using direct3d and disable use of directdraw respectively

872022
templating	mako
other option that in my opinion simplifies writing apps for gae a lot is using user other templating language like mako that allows you to embed python code in the templates thus no fiddling required

872035
google-chrome	firefox
the problem s cause must be earlier when oquestion.achoicerand gets assigned you think it s assigned to an arrays and apparently ie and firefox agree with you google-chrome is telling you that it s null instead

872055
firefox	opera
if it doesn t find that it looks for mozilla without compati or opera in an attempt to determine that the browser is firefox or opera

872076
2checkout	checkout
does it make any difference whether i use paypal 2checkout or google checkout or is the underlying methodology the same for all

872079
entity-framework	ado.net
for entity-framework aka ado.net entity model to be there you ll need to install vs2008 sp1 which also includes the required .net 3.5 sp1

872085
integration	payment
then you have the code the documentation payment gateway integration etc.

872086
data-access	nhibernate
it uses nhibernate for data-access so assuming you know hibernate you should be rocking in no time

872111
for-loop	arrays
finally unless the first string is always the longest you could end up accessing a string past the end of its arrays inside the second for-loop

872114
mongodb	couchdb
it describes a few options that you may want to consider including tokyo cabinet tyrant couchdb and mongodb

872116
document	element
oh and the last thing if you want the result document to be order by name include an element with the both occurrences like so

872118
order	add
ioexception is a class from the java.io package so in order to use it you should add an import declaration to your code

872126
low-level	hardware
however for most developers something like intel s tbb or microsoft s new api s i also just dug up this code project article he s apparently using cmpxchg8b which is the low-level hardware route which i mentioned initially.

872137
right-to-left	hebrew
how to use datagrid in right-to-left like hebrew or arabic language

872153
codeigniter	cakephp
i m thinking about using java hence i d like to find a framework that will help me building the app i m used to php framework such as cakephp codeigniter

stripes	spring
i ve had a look at differents java frameworks such as jsf stripes struts2 tapestry wicket and spring

872175
groovy	java
grails is a coding by convention web application framework build upon a stack of proven java frameworks spring hibernate ... and using the groovy language

872175
spring	grails
the beauty of grails is that you need little knowledge of spring hibernate etc

872176
inherited	subclass
it s implied and in fact many case tools would show you the inherited methods as part of the list of the methodss of the subclass when click on the class at looking at its properties and some case tools even have the option of showing also the inherited methodss in the diagram

872183
document	element
for example i have the word faã ade in the text element of the xml document

872193
compact-framework	.net
the .net compact-framework supports messagebox.show which pops up a modal message

872197
persistence	hibernate
for persistence i usually use hibernate

872197
spring	grails
might be worthwhile to take a look at spring roo which is kind of like grails without groovy

872216
build-server	publishing
we used to use the publishing option in visual-studio when we deployed a website so we got a nice clean build to upload now we have a build-server

872225
any	set
these run with just their state not knowing anything about the state of the generator that invoked it which helps make things more modular and yet this preserves any non-user-specific state such as the current list of messages generated and the current set of warnings or errors as well as the control flow allowing total aborts to flow upwards

872226
contains	elements
i have a web document that contains a div elements

872226
contains	elements
that div elements contains an svg child elements which itself contains svg primitive text path etc.

872226
document	element
ultimately i would like to export that svg element into a proper self-contained svg document

872231
keyboard	mouse
as my drawing function is called from inside the paint event handler of the form mouse and keyboard events are handled only after the whole triangle is drawn which can take quite a while

872233
perl	c++
and till this day many modern and successful or even newly invented languages use this syntax - just think of java c++ c# php javascript c perl etc

872240
.when	ready
.when the base project is ready then you must create full database scripting

872244
user-interface	drawing
you could do this on a background thread periodically creating a new image copying the image you ve drawn so far onto it drawing the next layer or whatever and then marshalling onto the user-interface thread to use the image in the user-interface

872268
selected	checkbox
2- loop through all the checkbox on the page which are selected

872268
selected	checkbox
so myfunction would be called on each selected checkbox

872296
selected	checkbox
i want to count how many checkbox a user has selected

872296
selected	checkbox
for example from a grouping of 10 checkbox if he selected 5 then i want to be able to count it

872296
selected	checkbox
i can selected all of the checked checkbox is there a way to get the count of all the elements that are returned by that statement as well

872303
contains	set
if the field is not your primary key filed you can set an index on the field that contains ankush and make that index unique

872307
shell	bash
that includes every feature of the shell they are working in bash is pretty popular these days

872307
perl	awk
admins tend to like bash php python awk and perl

872316
internet-explorer	firefox
internet-explorer and or firefox

872339
constructor	object
it makes the constructor that takes a string parameter invoke the constructor that takes a directoryinfo parameter passing a new directoryinfo object which in turn is using the string as parameter to it

872361
base-class	inherited
our solution is to have all the entities inherited from one base-class

872363
contains	any
if you know any website or blog post contains a good comparison please tell us

872364
any	set
2 set a global hook for wm_close message using this i would be able to get a notification when any application gets closed through the close button on the title bar

872370
backslash	regex
compound this with the --ignore option values effectively being a regex mask and it gets easy to see how a backslash typically an escape char in regexes can be an insidious cause of unexpected behavior

872378
python	c++
for example you can t do multi-statement lambda expressions in python not that you have lambdas in c though you do in the newest c++

872424
32-bit	64bit
it appears that in 32-bit os ip2long returns signed int and in 64bit os unsigned int is returned

872424
32-bit	64bit
my application is working on 10 servers and some are 32-bit and some are 64bit so i need all them to work same way

872452
dot-product	transpose
it s fairly obvious when you look at the value in x u being the dot-product of x and the columns of u and the value in u t x being the dot-product of the x and the rows of u t and the relation of rows and columns in transpose

872457
contains	elements
contains the elements s that was removed

872460
python	php
it is written in php and being a django fan i m planning to rewrite it in python

872461
display	width
adjusting the size parameter via the table frame s width helped fix this display issue

872469
vb.net	vb6
we are upgrading a suite of data acquisition and analysis routines from vb6 programs to a mixture of vb.net vb6 and matlab programs

872473
button	slide
what i want to do is when a user selects a row another view should slide in with the back button and everything that a navigationcontroller provides

872484
32-bit	64bit
edit since you really wanted it to be signed even on 64bit systems - here s how you d convert the 64bit +ve value to a 32-bit signed equivalent

872495
repository	entity
have i perhaps created too many repositories - in general i map 1 repository to 1 entity class to 1 database-table

872500
double-quotes	single-quotes
i m not sure where your error is coming from it may be because you are using double-quotes not single-quotes for the code blocks but you are also injecting a separate scripting element for each name

872500
contains	elements
it builds a javascripting arrays as a string contains the names then injects a single scripting block that iterates over the arrays elements and invokes the bar function on each

872501
code-generation	mygeneration
i accidentally found qcodo while researching using the mygeneration tool for php code-generation

872505
32-bit	64bit
to convert to a 32-bit signed int from a 64bit signed int without losing the high bit you could mask and then type cast the output

872512
circular-buffer	queue
if you re concerned about the speed at which you re passing the data on to something else instead of controlling the read put the data into a data structure like a queue or circular-buffer and control the other end

872518
repository	entity
as for the repositories i usually go with a generic repository that would take a single entity in its implementation

872539
revision	svn
here s a self-contained example modified from what you posted that works fine for me in ipython -pylab with a recent svn revision of matplotlib

872544
32-bit	16-bit
specifically i m only interested in the range of 16-bit and 32-bit numbers accurate to + -0.5 the ones place or + - 0.0005 the thousandths place

872554
msbuild	nant
i m using nant for 1.1 projects which was simpler to integrate for me than msbuild

872557
sql-server	oracle
interbase is a totally rock-solid database - i would put it on a par with sql-server or oracle

872558
arrays	loops
i m getting confused with regards to scope and gc as i have a custom movieclip-extending class slide which i create instances of within a loops and push into an arrays but afterwards the items are null when i pull them out of the collection

872558
toggle	slider
i would like to be able to references the slider later in order to toggle them as needed - how can i keep the reference to my new objects

872561
constructor	object
constructor are run the object might

872561
constructor	private
i too have an app that requires instantiating compiled forms but have always used activator.createinstance and required other developers to include at the very least a private default constructor if they want their form accessible in my app

872595
command-line	cmd
i ve used the matlab dos cmd to execute a java program on the cmd-line it waits for the cmd-line to complete before returning control to matlab

872615
vbscript	jscript
vbscript and jscript languages and is

872615
vbscript	jscript
to profile vbscript and jscript

872627
vb.net	vb6
your vb6 and vb.net code could establish a reference to the activex exe to call it and sink its events

872627
vb.net	vb6
i started writing a vb.net class library that wraps the vb6 to make it accessible to .net

872638
textbox	button
now suppose i have a button on my form getage which is designed to retrieve the age of the employee selected in the combobox from the dataset allemployeeslist and display in a textbox on the same form

872651
scheme	let
i can t even get into a sub folder let alone the full folder scheme i need to open

872661
firefox	safari
firefox safari etc

872663
subtract	add
let s say your coworker monkeypatches the fixnum class and redefines the + methods to subtract instead of add

872684
arrays	loops
you could create the target arrays then loops through the words determining the probability that it should be picked and replace the words in the arrays according to a random number

872722
addition	exponent
but it is a proposed addition with a 5-bit exponent and 10-bit fraction

872737
python	ruby
using ruby or python does someone know how to draw on the screen covering up any other window

872743
subtraction	multiplying
just two multiplying and a subtraction plus a function call to round are quite economic and the code is quite readable too

872752
arguments	default
that is -compare calls -compare options range locale with appropriate default value for the three additional arguments

872752
arguments	default
2 the other pattern is to implement the many arguments version of the methods and provide default value when an arguments is null nil or set to some value that indicates the default is desired

872752
arguments	default
if you pass 0 for the readoptionsmask arguments the nsdata will read the contents of the file using an internally defined default configuration

872757
python	ruby
in order to do that you need bindings to it for python or ruby

872761
stripes	spring
you could for example use a stripes front-end with the spring for ioc and hibernate as your orm

872761
stripes	jsf
there are many great technologies that you can use for the presentation layer including spring-mvc struts stripes wicket jsf seam and tapestry among a few

872761
spring	seam
the popular frameworks for ioc are spring and seam these have associated technologies like spring-security and generally are supported by the other technologies

872761
tapestry	wicket
tapestry is another framework that attempts to be a full stack from what i understand and takes a wicket like or i guess wicket takes a tapestry-like approach

872761
spring	grails
grails is yet another full-stack framework using groovy and built on top of spring and hibernate

872770
sql-server	oracle
i am a sql-server developer with a task in oracle

872770
sql-server	oracle
dba set up a dblink in oracle that points at a sql-server database

872770
sql-server	oracle
i am writing a view on the sql-server data and then a view on the oracle side to join it with additional oracle data

872770
sql-server	oracle
problem if i change the definition of the view on sql-server even select from myview dblink errors with invalid column. closing toad and reopening seems to correct the problem but the real question is how to force oracle to re-read the metadata without resetting the connection

872772
specifications	w3c
quote from the w3c soap specifications should help here too

872777
constructor	object
this allows the user to pass a specific pen object to the constructor if it either doesn t have a default constructor or you don t want it to be used and second it still allows you to omit the pentype object if you re happy to let it create one with the default constructor

872783
defined	declare
if you change it to this then only_onions is already declare when you defined the module shish

872808
sql-server	oracle
sql-server keeps a list of locks in memory while oracle does in on the tablespaces

872808
sql-server	oracle
this is probably because oracle is old older than me and sql-server is young compared to oracle

872810
required	checked
invokerequired simply checked to see if invoke is required

872827
interface-builder	ibtool
unfortunately i can t hide it in interface-builder and then set the hidden property to no later because ibtool fails with exit code 5 if you try to hide a uitextfield

872828
command-prompt	cmd
to check this if i open the cmd-prompt navigate to the path mentioned in the screenshot above and type mysqldump cmd manually it recognizes the cmd...as shown below.

872834
google-chrome	firefox
both properties are custom for firefox and webkit safari and google-chrome

872836
uiscrollview	subviews
i know that the uiscrollview actually waits a moment if the user would like to scroll but at some point it should give up waiting and fire the event to the subviews right

872842
conditional	parentheses
using parentheses wasn t a that good choice as it can be used in the conditional expression itself

872842
semantics	keyword
a nice solution because you have 4 possible combinations with different semantics until while after the do loop keyword

872842
scala	java
on most other things scala uses java syntax

872845
any	set
so if your view that must receive a touch event is nested inside any other view all it s subviews have to be set to userinteractionenabled yes

872850
sql-server	firebird
i used ms sql-server in a big company i worked at a few years ago and i would choose firebird over ms sql-server

872863
boolean	int
aside from that you probably don t want to use boolean but int to keep track of a counter

872867
void	main
static void main string arguments

872868
hosts-file	hosts
therefore i m manually inserting entries in my windows hosts

872868
hosts-file	hosts
i don t know why the hosts works like this but is there any other methods i can use to get subdomains into my local web application

872874
global-variables	call
having local variables with the same name as global-variables is usually a call for trouble so try avoiding whenever possible

872879
contains	lookup
if you need to make the lookup you should use a hashset instead of an arrays as the contains methods for that is an o 1 operation

872884
deployment	install
for 2005 you can make your own sql-server deployment application that automates installing of windows install 3.1 .net 2.0 sql-server 2005 then installing the database through generatated sql script feel free to contact me if you need help with it i d gladly help you

872886
show	next
i want my treeview control to show an item with a folder icon next to it

872903
windows-server	windows
first you need to download the lib files from microsoft which can be found at the windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5

872904
contains	set
we re currently building a website with a categorized mysql table contains various competences and we noticed that the nested set model would be optimized for this

872904
any	set
although we ve got a pretty serious problem - the nested set model doesn t allow any sorting and we really need that possibility

872924
select	union
union is used to combine the result from multiple select statements into a single result set

872929
javascript	dom
would escaping all non-alphanumeric chars in user input to protect against dom based xss and filename info to protect against stored xss using javascript this outputs percent-encoded hex values suffice

872944
host	dns
no dns a records only resolves host names to ip-address it doesn t know anything about port numbers

872944
webserver	host
but you can always configure your webserver to serve differents pages depending on the host header thus making innesesary the use of port 8080

872960
ruby	php
we have essentially ported over ruby on rails active record to php

872968
union-all	union
you can use union or union-all depending on what behaviour you want

872968
union-all	union
the difference is that union removes duplicates while union-all doesn t

872972
environment	building
arguably the most powerful feature is the ability to specify environment settings in one place and have them applied everywhere including documentation when it building the source

872972
teamcity	jenkins
has documentation for integration w teamcity cruisecontrol.net and jenkins formerly hudson

872972
revision	svn
versioning dlls based on build number and source control revision svn tfs git hg

872972
environment	building
environment templating and building configbuilder docbuilder sqlbuilder deploymentbuilder

872978
union-all	union
note also that union-all will be much faster than union

872980
any	set
no access-control or constraint checking -- a global variables can be get or set by any part of the program and any rules regarding its use can be easily broken or forgotten

872984
communication	messages
well i have several applications that communication with the db thru an xml messages that is handled by a visual basic 6 component

872984
json	xml
we are trying to define some really simple xml format for crud operations and that the resulting xml could be easily mapped to rest or json

872984
json	xml
or some page with crud rest xml json samples

873012
webserver	security
firstly please don t let this become a usable project - getting security right for webserver is really hard

873012
http-get	get
the url when you get an http-get

873014
environment	building
arguably the most powerful feature is the ability to specify environment settings in one place and have them applied everywhere including documentation when it building the source

873014
teamcity	jenkins
has documentation for integration w teamcity cruisecontrol.net and jenkins formerly hudson

873014
revision	svn
versioning dlls based on build number and source control revision svn tfs git hg

873014
environment	building
environment templating and building configbuilder docbuilder sqlbuilder deploymentbuilder

873021
json	xml
you would need to url-encode the xml to be able to pass it but if you converted the xml to json then you could pass that string and then json- xml or json- object to process it

873033
if-statement	loops
however you may find that many programmers prefer not to use it when possible rather use a conditional if-statement to perform anything else in the loops thus not performing it and exiting the loops cleanly

873062
selected	button
on the debugging toolbar right click the toolbar and make sure debugging is selected you can toggle the hex button

873067
groovy	java
remember groovy is a superset of java

873069
msbuild	nant
if you use nant you can use it across many frameworks and shell out to msbuild to actually do the building task for you

873073
callback	methods
they are callback that will call the set methods of the autoresetevent

873081
reflection	runtime
edit if you are trying to read the types and methods at runtime you ll want to use reflection

873084
remote-server	tunnel
one solution could be to use tunnel on the server side a custom httphandler on your domain that grabs the image from a remote-server and redirects it to your sl petition

873098
webforms	asp.net
i load the category into a dropdown list asp.net webforms to allow people to select a category and based on what they selected

873101
decrement	increment
i ll have a stopgrow that stops the timer and shrink that decrement instead of increment

873108
mbunit	nunit
nunit or mbunit

873116
invoices	product
i want a more custom modular program though in my case i m creating a software to handle customers invoices and product and different users might have different needs and therefore i need to handle this somehow

873116
python	java
this is all in c# but would of course be interesting to see how it would differ in java python or c++ too

873120
subtract	time
the next time you call it you simlpy subtract the two values and if the result is over 500 half a second has elapsed

873132
arrays	loops
if you have an arrays of primitive you can just use a simple loops

873133
environment	building
then you keep one templates file in source control some settings files for each environment and uppercut building them for you automatically

873134
javascript	dom
since all so-called xhtml pages are being served as html at the moment all javascript code is written using the html dom

873140
children	nodes
a nodes in the tree can have 0 or any number of children

873177
subtract	time
then your getheight methods would subtract the starting time from the current time to calculate the height right now when you need it

873188
dlopen	dlsym
if you want to dynamically link you use dlopen dlsym to resolve unix .so shared library entry points

873195
ruby-on-rails	django
i ve learned both ruby-on-rails and django and i write all of my webapps in php

873234
show	next
if it is show your tooltip and you d probably want to pass the mouse coordinates into the tooltip s show methods instead of just passing in the textbox so that the tooltip can be positioning next to the link

873238
numeric	zero
the process of taking one numeric value and converting it to another without your help is called a promotion - you are taking for example a 1 byte number and making it into a 4 byte number by filling in zero

873257
integer	numeric
by default java will look at a numeric value such as 27 as an integer type

873295
robot	nxt
i have a lego mindstorms nxt robot and would like a phone for which i could potentially write a program that would communication with it over bluetooth

873299
emacs	vim
if you have the time i d recommend learning a serious text editor like emacs or vim

873310
zend-framework	codeigniter
take a look at cakephp codeigniter and or zend-framework

873350
iframe	popup
i have a popup iframe using lytebox

873353
ruby	php
it ll take you longer to initially use a framework for the same reasons a php developer would take longer to initially use ruby - you re not familiar with it

873356
g++	gcc
the idea is to compile the cpp files using g++ and the c files using gcc then link them together

873366
python	ruby
some might also put ruby and django python in this list

873374
g++	gcc
the easiest way to avoid undefined symbols while linking is to link with g++ not gcc

873374
g++	gcc
the link error may go away if you run all your gcc and g++ commands on the same system no matter the old or the new one

873396
defined	declare
your methods are declare as enqueue and dequeue but defined as enqueue and dequeue c++ is case sensitive

873417
classname	inherited
check that the codebehind property in the page directive points to the .cs file and that the inherited property points to the correct classname in the .cs file

873422
linked-list	queue
if you re using a linked-list you can insert anywhere and the queue will grow from the tail and shrink from the head

873442
arrays	loops
you can have two nested loops one to loop through arrays one and the other to loop through arrays two

873468
.when	ready
.when you open the file open it with the mode w+ like so and it will truncated it ready for writing

873474
value	field
the only way to get a generated id value from an auto_increment field in mysql is to do the insert and then call last_insert_id

873508
versioning	upgrade
id like to use it for testing with older versionings of .net but it wont let me install the upgrade versioning

873508
versioning	upgrade
it just wont install to an empty vm because its an upgrade versioning

873541
value	field
onblur fires when a field loses focus while onchange fires when that field s value changes

873546
implements	extends
and it has to extends plain hashtable instead of because generics were implements in the downwards-compatibe way via type erasure so once the compiler has done its thing there are no generics

873553
base-class	subclass
methods to return an nsdecimalnumber so you re going to get back an instance of the base-class and not your custom subclass

873553
convenience-methods	initializer
you ll have to create your own convenience-methods to return an instances of your subclassing or just alloc and initializer it another way

873554
host	dns
if you really want a zsh solution use host dig or nslookup to perform a dns query and assume that a failure means that a domain is still available

873563
defined	declare
declare it global and defined it that way

873563
instances	destroy
as long as all one of your user instances is not destroy those will retain the resource instances and so prevent it from being prematuraly deleted even though the global shared_ptr could have been destroy

873563
instances	destroy
the last user instances being destroy will undirectly delete the resource instances

873593
nested	assign
i ve also tried passing trainingdata in the constructor of newdata and using a nested loop to assign trainingdata s data to newdata but it is still giving me the same results where newdata references trainingdata

873599
contains	elements
the problem you are facing is that the linked-list only keeps internal references to the elements that it contains

873603
json	xml
there are also modules to read and write text files in the json and xml formats and json is particularly easy to read in a text editor

873604
children	nodes
the true parameter on clonenodes and importnodes specifies whether you want a deep-copy meaning to copy the nodes and all it s children

873610
display	width
i am making a photo gallery scripting that involves display an image in fixed width height box

873614
security	owasp
the best way to handle the owasp top ten in struts is to look at the owasp enterprise security api.

873620
execvp	fork
then i create a new process with fork and execute that command with the associated arguments with execvp

873621
contains	any
if you actually want to do any viewing editing of the actual files contains within the archive using arc-mode you will definitely need the third-party tool to be installed on your system and in the appropriate location

873621
put	get
so to get zip-archive mode fully working on windows you will just need to find a windows version of command-line zip unzip and put them into a directory that is in your path see unzip package at

873622
any	set
the frame of an object may be set at any time

873624
setinterval	settimeout
i found a few solutions about using setinterval or settimeout but wasn t sure if this was the best way

873654
value	field
most implementations of gethashcode are based on the hash codes of the field of the object but it s been cited that the value of gethashcode should never change over the lifetime of the object

873654
gethashcode	equals
these seem naturally contradicting when a mutable object because if the state of the object changes we expect the value of equals to change which means that gethashcode should change to match the change in equals but gethashcode should not change

873654
gethashcode	equals
to sum up what i ve learned from this is that the only way to achieve all goals and to avoid possible quirky behavior in edge cases is to only override equals and gethashcode based on immutable fields or implement iequatable

873656
environment	building
when we were setting up our automated building environment a few years ago we discovered that msbuilding.exe didn t properly handle all of the dependencies that we have

873682
selected	checkbox
1 build an xpath expression that will evaluate whether or not one of your checkbox has been selected

873690
.net	wcf
you can use all the convenience managed code provides like .net remoting wpf and wcf for example

873690
driver	kernel
support for 32- and 64bit kernel mode hooking also check out my patchguard 3 bypass driver which can be found in the release list

873690
windows-vista	windows
support for windows-vista sp1 x64 and windows server 2008 sp1 x64 by utilizing totally undocumented apis to still allow hooking into any terminal session

873690
32-bit	64bit
you will be able to write injection libraries and host processes compiled for anycpu which will allow you to inject your code into 32- and 64bit processes from 64- and 32-bit processes by using the very same assembly in all cases

873691
scala	java
since reinventing java martin odersky has gone on to create the new scala language which is cleaner inherits fewer mistakes and breaks new ground in a number of areas

873692
gethashcode	equals
if you want the lookup not to use the gethashcode or equals methods of the class you can always provide your own iequalitycomparer implementation to use instead when you create the dictionary

873702
ticket-system	redmine
i m using redmine is a ticket-system made with ruby-on-rails and it has the option of sending you mails to notify events

873708
contains	any
is there any way to make my contains uiview redraw while the animation is running

873709
gethashcode	equals
these are the fields you should use when overrideing gethashcode and equals

873709
gethashcode	equals
note that gethashcode and equals should work together

873709
gethashcode	equals
gethashcode should return the same value for two objects if they are equals

873742
constructor	object
obtain a waithandle for the named event object by using the eventwaithandle constructor that takes a string name

873744
cakephp	symfony
you should also just use a php based framework like symfony or cakephp using them should reduce your production time considerably

873744
getter	setter
you instantiate a new object and user getter and setter to store your data and instead of writing sql in your page code you create functions in the objects related to the query

873744
if-statement	loops
you get all the data you need and then put as little php in the display basically just echoing the variables you got in the action controller with the exception of some for loops and if-statement for conditionals

873744
python	ruby
you don t need to learn a new language python ruby just to use a great framework just have to fin one that works for you

873759
defined	declare
so if 2 classes need to invoke each other s methods each must be declare before either can be defined

873767
filehandle	eof
it simply uses built in filehandles rather than the filehandle module and checking for eof

873769
arrays	map
to accomplish anything like this you d need to use a map or other similar data structure which is rather like a php arrays

873778
hosts-file	hosts
edit your hosts with elevated-privileges

873778
hosts-file	hosts
i m still not exactly clear what they re getting at except maybe that they re telling folks to use dns for localhost resolution instead of the hosts

873790
python	java
preferably code in java python or ruby

873791
postgresql	mysql
not only you need php extension s dlls in order to add mysql and postgresql support to php

873791
postgresql	mysql
you also need mysql and postgresql native libraries

873791
postgresql	mysql
make sure you have mysql and postgresql client installed and their dlls into some locatable place

873799
put	get
if the goal is to get the image specific to selected option and if you want to put your own image name instead of picture +id i would modify like below

873807
python	java
well i know python has a function like this and i m assuming ruby does and java

873807
arrays	loops
otherwise you can loops through the arrays adding the word and a space and test if it is the last element

873810
hosts-file	hosts
just replace hosts to original

873810
hosts-file	hosts
if you want original hosts then i can send you

873812
32-bit	64bit
i m ok with using cygwin or mingw but i need to end up with 64bit code not 32-bit

873824
32-bit	64bit
-m64 generate code for a 32-bit or 64bit environment

873824
32-bit	64bit
note that that s going to drive you crazy i think if mingw really does it that way since normally on windows 64 long is 32-bit and long long is the 64bit pointer-sized

873849
windows-vista	windows
i ve noticed it rdping it from a variety of oses including windows-vista windows server 2008 and windows 7

873863
boolean	int
when a methods is called a block of memory is pushed onto the top the stack that memory block has space for all primitives int float boolean etc and object references of the methods which includes the methods parameters

873871
conditional	operators
the type inference on the conditional operators is not quite good enough i get a message like

873871
conditional	operators
in any case it s just a minor annoyance regarding how the types of lambdas type inference and the conditional operators interact

873890
postgresql	mysql
the problem here is that apache has loaded php but php was not able to load its extension mysql postgresql ...

873894
python	java
if you re a java programmer you re going have to learn python to try and use django so you ll have a big initial time investment just to get up to speed

873894
python	php
skill levels aside i d put money on either django python or cakephp php

873894
cakephp	django
django has a production ready admin panel which is easily configured but cakephp is a clean asp.net-mvc implementation in php and php is pretty dang easy

873908
stax	sax
if you are trying to just read in and turn the xml into an object then i would suggest stax as sax is faster than dom but too much coding stax is much nicer and you can learn more about it below

873944
selected	listbox
i m trying to display all selected items from a listbox into a textbox

873944
selected	listbox
what should be happening is that for every selected item in my listbox lb.words i want it to be appended to my textbox

873944
selected	listbox
so say my listbox contains apple orange and banana and i selected apple and banana my textbox text should read apple banana .

873954
listbox	textbox
when ever an end-user enters a search word in the textbox and presses search i wanted to write a series of if-statement that would specify if the entry in the textbox matched a value in one of the listbox to execute a custom query

873954
listbox	textbox
since the textbox takes string values as opposed to numeric values the code must equate the textbox entry with an item in the listbox

873954
listbox	textbox
i have been able to add a number in the search textbox and find the listbox item that way but this is impractical since my end users will only know values

873954
listbox	textbox
in all i was wondering if anyone knew how to programmatically search a listbox for a specific value that equals the value entered in a textbox

873970
.net	wcf
have you considered just using a wcf .net tcp binding and a publish subscribe pattern

873975
windows-xp	windows
longer version i have this setup working in windows-xp by calling dll registerrawinputdevices and getrawinputdata and listening to the input in a hidden windows

873975
ubuntu	linux
i want this setup to work on linux more specifically gnome under ubuntu but i do occasionally use other distro window manager so solution on the level of x is appreciated

873975
joystick	keyboard
this foot pedal does not register itself as keyboard or even joystick but as a hid device with usagepage 12 usage 3

873975
keyboard	hid
i notice that the latest ubuntu can detect and use the favorite keys on the microsoft natural keyboard which also register as hid device

873975
keyboard	hid
for those not in the know the microsoft natural keyboard registers as both a regular keyboard and a generic hid device

873978
google-chrome	gecko
en-us applewebkit 530.5 k html like gecko google-chrome 2.0.172.8 safari 530.5

873978
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested this with mozilla firefox and google-chrome and it works in firefox but not chrome

873978
google-chrome	firefox
edit 2 - so it seems that the reason it was working on firefox but not google-chrome was because firefox displays the html as its received while google-chrome waits for the connection to close before doing any rendering

873979
stax	sax
in my experience dom is useful for this kind of thing because it has a low learning curve compared to sax stax even though its not as fast or memory efficient

873979
document	element
once you ve got a dom document you can use xpath queries against the document to get individual element contents and parsing them

873986
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s limit is different than firefox s

873989
.when	ready
.when you log a user-interface bug its there in the issue tracker the programmers will come and fix them .when they are good and ready

873995
transfer-encoding	chunked
but since i don t know the file size iis seems to be buffering the output until a certain limit is reached packets size or time i don t know then sends a packets with transfer-encoding set to chunked

874009
configuration	environment
i tend to put xml config files into the classpath and expose configuration that is relevant to be adapted for different environment into external property files using a propertyplaceholderconfigurer or the like depends on actual requirements

874013
object-reference	instances
so when i do this it s basically the same scenario but i get an object-reference not set to an instances of an object. error at the same place that i was getting there is no viewdata item with the key blah of type ienumerable .

874024
contains	set
if an error set contains an error no functions execute

874029
buffering	capture
if you are trying to capture the current image in the front back bufferings glreadpixels read a block of pixels from the frame buffering along with glreadbuffering might be what you are looking for

874032
calloc	malloc
as to your comment on strncpy not nul-terminating the string which is true if you use calloc to allocate the string rather than malloc this won t be a problem if you allocate one byte more than you copy since calloc automatically sets all values including in this case the end to 0

874032
calloc	malloc
not that there s anything wrong with saying sizeof char - it clearly shows your intention and provides symmetry with calls to calloc or malloc for other types

874032
strncpy	memcpy
also i would use strncpy or memcpy rather than strcat

874032
calloc	strcat
using strncat and strcat obscures your intent - it makes someone looking at your code think you want to add to the end of the string which you do because after calloc the end is the beginning when what you want to do is set the string

874032
strncpy	memcpy
plus strncpy and memcpy will probably be a wee little bit faster more efficient than strcat

874042
selected	textbox
if you selected apple banana your textbox will contain apple banana

874047
ip-address	proxy
as you say ip-address is liable to change and in some organizations there may be a grouping of proxy servers setup which make requests originate from different ips

874070
linux	osx
cross platform it should be runnable on xp vista osx and common versions of linux such as ubuntu and kubuntu

874070
licensing	lgpl
permissive licensing such as lgpl or bsd or such

874070
perl	c++
among the softer requirements are having a set of abstractions for the most common backend functionality such as sockets file io and so on there is usually some platform specific adaptations necessary and supporting a good language such as python or c++ though it is usually fun to learn a new one not perl

874070
installation	environment
this is about being able to run the finished product on multiple platforms from a stick without installation it is not about having a portable development environment

874070
ubuntu	osx
is run on different operating systems such as windows vista ubuntu osx

874070
ubuntu	osx
a different view on the use case would be that i have five newly installed machines with vista xp osx ubuntu and kubuntu respectively in front of me

874070
ubuntu	osx
it was easy to get it to work on an ubuntu dist and on osx

874070
directory	folder
for windows-xp and vista i had to copy qtcored4.dll qtguid4.dll qtsqld4.dll and mingwm10.dll to distribution directory this was debugging code and i copied the qsqlited4.dll to a folder named sqldrivers in the distribution directory

874081
conditional	operators
as you can see the change to the value of likescheese only affects the version which has the conditional operators inside the lambda expression

874092
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql select column from table limit 10

874096
radio-button	selected
as you can see on i m using jquery to change some image and image attribute depending on radio-button selected i m also removing form text when clicking inside it

874116
32-bit	64bit
the main problem is that the jet dbms is a 32-bit library that gets loaded into the calling process so you will never be able to use jet directly from within your app in 64bit mode

874116
csv	xml
i would use jet to load the csv xls then put the data into an arrays of arrayss and use the xml serializer to write the data to the temp file

874126
tuples	any
this works for any iterable lists tuples dictionary generators generator expressionsâ as long as the items are all strings or unicode strings

874155
.when	ready
load fires after all content is downloaded ready is a pseudo event that fires .when the dom is ready to be messed with

874157
json	xml
this way the object can turn itself into a binary data stream or xml json

874165
convention	standards
the pages do not follow a standards naming convention and there are many inbound links

874165
url-rewriting	rewrite
1 is it best to point all requests to a url-rewriting page catch any request to .php pages first and pass them through to keep existing links then a giant case statement for each of the 15 pages finally the rewrite the url s of new pages as these will follow a set format

874178
defined	declare
i declare as __stdcall and defined as __cdecl by default

874186
webserver	upload
check your php configurations and make sure that file upload are allowed on the webserver

874192
linux	osx
cross platform it should be runnable on xp vista osx and common versions of linux

874192
licensing	lgpl
permissive licensing such as lgpl or bsd or such

874192
python	c++
supporting a good language such as python or c++

874192
sql-server	firebird
we use wxwidgets for flamerobin a graphical administration program for the firebird sql-server

874192
solaris	linux
it has active ports to windows linux and mac os x and has been compiled for at least some bsd variant and solaris as well

874204
google-chrome	firefox
to avoid refresh problems in firefox and forever loading problems in google-chrome and safari set the iframe s src to about blank once you re done

874214
excel-vba	vba
this only works in excel-vba but since you had it tagged vba i will suggest it

874224
contains	elements
2 you are using multiple model elements which is unnecessary in such a simple form because each model may contains many instance s and bind s

874224
contains	elements
the bind attributes should contains the id of a bind elements that has been defined elsewhere the bind elements itself will identify the node that the control binds to in this case via its nodeset attributes

874243
constructor	object
so you will see the difference is in the type of object constructor

874262
www-mechanize	lwp
since www-mechanize is a sub-class of lwp user-agent i would prefer to use the lwp ua handler to do this

874267
annotations	mapping
the biggest issue we ve faced on a semi-regular basis is that if you want to change your persistence mapping in any way using annotations alone you need to recompile and redeploy

874267
configuration	environment
you can use both annotations and configuration - which is the environment i m now working with - classes are annotated with functional type persistence metadata foreign keys joins etc - things which have a code level representation while irrelevant information table column names are stored in configuration files

874273
postgresql	mysql
those extensions depend on native libraries which are provided by the mysql and postgresql binary distributions

874278
jquery	.post
when i m trying to call an ascx with jquery .post i get

874279
openssl	zlib
microsoft don t provide a ruby build and compiling it is also more difficult on windows where you have to install a compiler download copies of zlib and openssl etc

874292
jquery	.post
at the moment i have a jquery do a .post to a controller which returns a contentresult

874297
constructor	object
and the webpage for __declspec selectany seems to indicate that constructor for global objects are not regarded as being references to an object incorrectly imho but there you have it

874305
export-to-pdf	export
when export-to-pdf it will export simple text and images so animation are not there

874318
gethashcode	equals
irrespective of the object type it will simply call the gethashcode and equals methods to allow it to put the value in the right bucket and retrieve it again

874343
contains	any
a left join contains all rows from the left table animals even if the join condition does not find any matching rows from the right table animals_food

874350
installshield	orca
i m somewhat familiar with orca the tool to manipulate .msi files as well as full blown install applications like installshield but i would like to make this using only raw visual-studio and other available open-source tools

874372
background-image	width
background-image doesnâ t stretch full page width

874383
margins	padding
there was a solution i saw at a list apart i think where you give the two inner columns a huge bottom padding but the same huge value as a negative margins

874399
polymorphism	override
if you actually want to be able to call the methods on a specific instance though and get the benefits of polymorphism a derived class can override the behaviour of the methods then you should make the it an instance methods

874414
development-environment	platform
it s a cross platform development-environment

874417
json	xml
is it limited to json or xml or can you even send binary types like mp3 or utf-8 html

874436
conditional	operators
you can use the conditional operators

874437
conditional	operators
you can use the conditional operators

874437
conditional	operators
as rafael pointed out the condition can be implicitly converted into a number so the conditional operators is not needed

874449
ubuntu	linux
the standard linux archive app that comes with ubuntu was used for gzipping

874452
shell	bash
when i execute the script from the bash shell the current directory doesn t change

874478
python	java
it s not clear from your question if you re asking about the java or python runtime

874512
textbox	button
in my site page one textbox and publish button

874512
textbox	button
when i clicked on button which is a text in textbox its published on facebook as status

874513
javascript	dom
a number of javascript libraries implement a custom event that fires when the dom is ready - but browsers load resources in parallel so while that event may fire before all images and stylesheets are loaded it is unlikely to fire before the other elements start to download

874519
required	checked
if you know accessing a file on the systemd required the privileges you want your scripting to have you can use the os.access to checked if you are privileged enough

874545
temporary	rvalue
since the temporary is in scope till the next sequence point the next semi-colon and rvalue aren t true const s this is well defined to my understanding at least

874550
selected	listbox
if you bind the selected item of the listbox to a property in the viewmodel then when that property is changed you can publish the event

874563
json	xml
it s possible to write code that parses a config file xml json yaml

874569
json	xml
but since xml can be a bit of a pain many devs use json encoded data instead because it s easy to generate and easy to parse

874569
json	xml
again the popular choices are xml and json they parse easily into a document object or an arrays structure respectively

874579
onmouseup	onkeyup
if you don t want to do that the events you re likely looking for are onkeyup for arrow enter on the options and onmouseup for click on the options events

874586
unicode	wstring
another technique i ve seen used is to conditionally define tstring to be either string or wstring depending on the unicode setting and use tstring everywhere in your code

874588
command-line	cmd
to my knowledge it can t be done through the cmd-line because the mysql cmd does not support proxy connections

874589
put	get
when i put the table into editing mode there is a white line to the left of the reorder control that i can t seem to get rid of

874617
mips	x86
the core files might be little endian arm or big endian mips and the program to analyze them might be running on a little endian host x86 or big endian powerpc

874632
children	tree
in general the focus line will have a tree of parents and a tree of children

874635
double	int
i created a converter to convert from double to int

874635
double	int
what do i have to do so that my converter successfully converts a double and sends back an int

874660
double	int
you are attempting to cast not convert from double to int which won t work

874662
google-chrome	firefox
because some of the properties used in css are specific to firefox and google-chrome

874668
processor	affinity
set the testâ s processor affinity to run on one processor core only

874701
double	int
you want to convert but you are doing casting from double to int

874712
firefox	safari
if i remember correctly it works in firefox ie safari

874717
telnet	tcp
for instance just telnet to the host on the given port if it s a tcp connection and see if a connection is established

874718
constructor	object
use the javascript regexp object constructor

874722
constructor	object
use the regexp object constructor to create a regular expression from a string

874751
text-align	display
you can display right aligned text in label by setting text-align property to middleright

874766
inherited	subclass
i am unsure if you can set it in a web-config file but what you can do is inherited from the gridview set the property in the constructor and use that new subclass

874785
tapestry	wicket
you shoud start by using a normal web framework like wicket jsf tapestry gwt etc.. later if it turns out your servers preformance is cpu-bound you might ocnsider rewriting the most often used parts of the apllication that way

874802
webserver	host
but your webserver already needs to be configured so that every request of foobar .example.com gets redirected to this specific virtual host

874815
stderr	stdout
capture stdout or stderr or potentially both either together or separately

874824
windows-mobile	windows-ce
i have been optimising memory performance on a windows-mobile application and have encountered some differences in behaviour between virtualalloc on win32 and windows-ce

874824
windows-mobile	windows-ce
on windows-ce 5.0 5.2 if i use the memory block at c in 99 of cases there are no problems however on some not all windows-mobile 6 devices readfile writefile will fail with error 87 the parameter is incorrect.

874837
malloc	free
they re fairly simple wrappers around malloc and free

874849
children	tree
recursive ctes are ideal for very small tree but the branch operations get all children in this branch.. get very costly with deep large tree

874851
hide	show
you could create ide macros to show hide your tool windows though

874865
stderr	stdout
you can try flushing stdout from the subprocess or using stderr or changing stdout on non-buffered mode

874871
internet-explorer	google-chrome
my code works perfectly fine in firefox and internet-explorer however it just dies in google-chrome

874874
constructor	object
only object have constructors primitives don t have constructors so they don t have a default constructor

874874
boolean	double
which is false in boolean 0.0f in float 0.0 in double and null as a reference

874905
double-quotes	single-quotes
it doesn t say escape quotes is for double-quotes only or for single-quotes as well so you need to write code to test it

874922
compact-framework	.net
we use sqlite with a .net compact-framework application currently and it s performance is fantastic and we ve spent a bit of time optimizing but not nearly as much as we could

874923
elementtree	lxml
maybe it also helps in your case to insert an explicit from lxml import elementtree somewhere in your code

874924
xsd	xml
or you could use xslt to transform your xml + xsd into xaml

874934
contains	elements
when you float items their contains elements no longer takes the vertical height of the floated elementss into account

874971
sql-server	ms-access
i just did this myself last year -- took an ms-access front-end sql-server back end application and rewrote the access part as a c# asp.net website

874972
if-statement	loops
as far as exercising some self-control my rule is that only necessary loops and if-statement get used as well as functions that filter escape format the output for the screen

874977
innodb	myisam
for mysql performance you should probably choose myisam over innodb as the storage engine provided your definition of optimal doesn t include most reliable

875012
joomla	drupal
don t waste time on joomla drupal - you will spend as much time learning it as you would learning any new programming language

875013
export	report
there are advantages to have a clean database model because it will be easier to do report export to excel etc

875019
implements	final
one reason that string is final is to prevent an instances of a subclass of string which implements mutable behaviour being passed in place of a string

875027
factors	primes
i have found every solution for when n pq 2 primes factors with p q

875027
factors	primes
i used the fact that for 2 primes q k+factors k 2-k+1 and p k+ k 2-k+1 factors k 2-k+1

875027
factors	primes
for n with 2 of more primes factors all of n s primess are greater than k

875029
perl	c++
usually when there is only one form in a language it is a left fold including python s reduce perl s list util reduce c++ s accumulate c# s aggregate smalltalk s inject into php s array_reduce mathematica s fold etc

875033
getter	setter
in actionscript 3 you can create getter and setter using the get and set keyword meaning you create a methods in the class and access data through a property of an instances of that class

875033
getter	setter
is there an equivalent of actionscript 3 getter setter in java as in

875033
instances	private
accessing a private field as a field from an instances of the class but having a methods for implementing that internally in the class

875039
variables	boolean
you could create a global boolean variables like g_windows_was_drawn and check it in the function that does the work of creating a windows

875041
getter	setter
as3 getter and setter are an ecmascript thing

875042
getter	setter
in java the only option you have without exposing the internals of your object is to make your own getter and setter as you have in your example

875042
getter	setter
so as in your example the field name would have getname and setname methods as their corresponding getter and setter respectively

875045
getter	setter
the get and set patterns though are so established in java culture that you ll find strong ide support for them eclipse will make them for you automatically and if you re working in something that uses the expression language first made for jsps el then you ll be able to use the property notation to access getter and setter

875068
strncmp	strcmp
this uses strncmp instead of strcmp thus ensuring that no more than three bytes are compared

875074
instances	self
i have written a class in python that implements __str__ self but when i use print on a list contains instances of this class i just get the default output

875091
ruby-on-rails	django
duplicate django or ruby-on-rails

875091
ruby-on-rails	django
i have been reading on ruby on ruby-on-rails and it seems like on some threads some users like django a lot too

875093
getter	setter
i would consider not having the getter or setter as they don t do anything in your case except make the code more complicated

875093
getter	setter
here is an example without getter or setter

875094
bmp	png
it supports a load of file formats such as bmp jpg png pdf svg etc etc

875097
base-class	inherited
you could make all your model types that you would pass into this partial inherited from a base-class interface that establishes the basic behavior that would be used by this partial view and accept any object of that class interface type or just have the view accept any type of object and then use reflection to base your partial view behavior off of

875100
children	nodes
search and replace operations like find all nodes with atleast 2 children find all nodes whose data starts with a and replace it with b if the subtrees have atleast 2 other siblings etc

875112
32-bit	64bit
i need to integrate some legacy 32-bit code - for which i don t have the source code into a project in such a way that it can be called from a 64bit .net assembly

875112
32-bit	64bit
how can a legacy 32-bit com object be accessed from a 64bit .net assembly

875124
webserver	security
also keep in mind that webserver and proxies might filtering your headers for security reasons

875126
32-bit	64bit
this way one can be 32-bit and one can be 64bit

875128
binary-search-tree	nodes
navigating through a binary-search-tree requires state in which nodes i am

875159
for-loop	loops
if you loops using a regular for-loops and loops over it backwards you can remove items as you go

875168
haskell	erlang
pattern matching provided by languages such as scala f# erlang and haskell i m sure there s more is designed to succinctly manipulate data structures like trees esp when used with recursion

875170
filtering	sorting
this kind of repository pattern adds some conditions filtering sorting command .

875188
lgpl	gpl
the only difference i noticed was that the qt-designer opens in a new windows for the open source lgpl gpl versioning

875189
multithreading	wait
the reason people use this rather than the method level synchronized keyword which locks on the executing class object s instance is that they might want a finer-grained or different thing to wait for locking on depending on how their multithreading algorithm is designed

875192
textbox	button
however this is only the second time i ve started to design stuff in wpf and the toolbox is literally only showing a few of the common controls - things like textbox and button and not much else

875200
font-size	display
this is of course very dependent on browser system install fonts and user s settings so you would have to calculate it for each fragment of text each time page is display resized or when user changes font-size even full-page zoom introduces some off-by-one errors which could cause number of characters change

875229
procedural-programming	side-effects
in procedural-programming this is not true since arbitrary functions can have arbitrary side-effects

875238
order	add
what is a good algorithm to determine the necessary fraction needed to add sub to the number in order to round it to the nearest integer without using the inbuilt ceiling or floor funcitons

875249
delphi	c++
i ve been doing this in c# and delphi but c++ is evil.the purpose is to create a file in the current directory where the executable is running

875255
internet-explorer	firefox
the images won t seem to load when i use the following syntax internet-explorer 7 firefox 3 etc..

875265
ruby	php
i think you can try some python ruby php java c and then choose one you like best and go further with it

875265
ruby	php
nowadays some companies do php only some companies use java mostly and some use only ruby on rails so you touch a few and decide on which one you d like to go further

875268
any	set
in your specific example you do have another option you could not float any of the inputs at all and set text-align right on #buttons

875268
any	set
while i rely on overflow hidden quite a bit it is worth noting that if you re trying to positioning any elements outside or partially outside of the containing element that has overflow hidden set on it the positioninged elements will be clipped off at the boundary of the containing element

875271
python	java
python java or c# c javascript

875279
perl	c++
i think it s always a good choice to know a language with c-style syntax c c++ c# php perl java because when you know one it s easier to understand other languages of this kind which are all very important

875324
revision	svn
homegrown tools are now wrapping svn and software is always going to have bugs therefore our svn revision are now going to have messes made of a revision when we encounter bugs

875335
python	ruby
these days there s a lot to choose from and without wishing to start a flamewar your best bet would be python or ruby

875354
authentication	login
for http authentication easiest solution would be to ask user for login password

875356
revision	updates
that way you can check things in and maintain revision history test them and then apply a tag that will sync the files on other machines when they updates

875360
python	ruby
so if you already know ruby or python well enough start with what you know and just go from there

875366
jquery	.post
this is done by the onsuccess event in the jquery .post which does #containingdiv .html responsefrompartialviewreturn

875379
python	ruby
then pick up a solid scripting language like python or ruby and if you plan to ever touch the web pick up javascript too

875384
value	field
field with known possible value such as age telephone number country manufacturer can all be pre-judged so are not an issue

875388
logout	login
to automatically logout a user you should set an expiration on your cookie storing the login or session information

875395
getter	setter
also before adding setter and getter it might be a good idea to ask yourself why are you exposing the internal data of the object in question

875417
perl	ruby
a scripting language perl python ruby

875417
haskell	scheme
a functional language haskell scheme

875419
compact-framework	.net
is there a fast way to rotate images in .net compact-framework

875421
buffering	streaming
when it s time to broadcast ads the server stops fetching the streaming from the generator reads ads from files and inserts them into each listener s buffering transmits them and resumes on relaying streaming from the generator

875432
getter	setter
they as the name implies allow variables to be retrieved and set - specifically they are called getter and setter

875434
ruby	php
it never hurts to know the currently popular set of languages which might include c# java php and ruby for example

875434
scheme	lisp
scheme lisp and clojure are also acceptable

875434
python	lua
can they combine simple unix commands effectively into scripts using a language like sh ksh bash awk lua or python

875434
python	lua
can they write good string-processing programs quickly using a language like lua icon awk python or ruby

875442
floor	ceil
it is easy to see that floor sqrt n â floor sqrt ceil n

875445
floor	ceil
the inner one is redundant because the square root for any number in the interval x x+1 where x is an integer always lies within the interval floor sqrt x ceil sqrt x and therefore you don t need to floor a number before taking the square root of it if you are only interested the integer part of the result

875451
instances	self
then in the uiviewcontroller s loadview or viewdidload methods set the tableview instances s datasource and delegate to self

875452
dotnetnuke	sitecore
as already given there are several content management solutions out there including sharepoint wordpress drupal dotnetnuke and sitecore

875481
python	ruby
are there spesific frameworks in asp.net python or ruby that are more open to integration than others

875482
constructor	object
to me it has never made sense with a constructor that never returns unless the frame is closed and does more than initialize an object

875485
launchd	daemons
according to wikipedia by definition a daemons should detach itself from the controlling tty so i think it s correct that no exception-handling is show and after all a daemons should keep working even if you close the shell that launchd it

875490
lookup	any
you might get rid of any o log m lookup of a b-tree by storing the index the logical id maps to physical location value pairs in a hashmap hashing on the logical id .

875504
swing	awt
also you need to include the boilerplate to always access swing components on the awt event dispatch thread edt

875514
any	set
that means you should develop a standard set of css files and x html files which can be imported or directly presented in any of those platform options

875514
authentication	login
using openid for authentication if all of your platform options support it would be nice but remember that each platform is going to require additional user metadata be stored for each user preferences last login permissions roles etc which you ll still have to wrangle between them

875524
imperative-programming	declarative
not all developers yet understand the difference between declarative and imperative-programming

875534
http	ssl
i use the apache commons http client package to do this in my current project and it works fine with ssl and a self-signed cert after installing it into cacerts like you mentioned

875537
selected	listbox
there s a page with all the possible fields and a listbox with all the selected services to be executed then when the user selects which service to execute change a car plate for example then i need to activate only the field s that the service require.

875537
contains	any
note that busexecutaservico is the class which contains the methods enablefield for checking if the selected item matches any field on the database

875561
keyboard	mouse
at the moment keyboard and mouse is locked captured by the first menu you focus on and the others are not available by hovering over them

875604
observer-pattern	factory-pattern
for example a factory-pattern is obviously something that aop can do better as di can also do it well but observer-pattern is simpler when using aop as is the strategy pattern

875607
any	set
i didn t find any set implementations on pypi so i m at a dead end now

875610
document	element
so how do you copy a style element from the head of one document to another

875618
administration	account
once this was changed to be the administration domain account instead the problem was resolved

875634
contains	set
i expected to set some breakpoint inspect the current variables where my contents are see what it contains what do i have to iterate over evaluate some expressions etc etc

875643
keyboard	mouse
suggestion with mouse or keyboard

875643
google-chrome	firefox
this works beautifully in ie6 ie7 ie8 google-chrome safari but not in firefox

875650
internet-explorer	firefox
this works in firefox but not internet-explorer

875667
frame	width
the problem is that due to this order the width of the ecb windows is set before the frame gets resized and then doesn t get scale

875685
environment	restart
recompiling after a 1-2 line change redeploying to the test environment and restart just sucks

875712
getter	setter
and you may want to include getter setter for metadata and potentially attachments because they are a legitimate part of your domain an email

875715
web-inf	taglib
used the tag in a jsp page with taglib directive pointing to my web-inf tlds site.tld file

875717
put	get
crippling my machine without my express permission will get you put forever on the filter-with-extreme-prejudice list.

875718
selected	button
if i selected one combo option then it should change the other combo options dynamically without submit button press

875739
required	checked
if you re just trying to see if you have access to a certain file that required administration rights a good way to checked would be

875739
administration	account
on the other hand if you really need to know if a user is an administration account you can also use this code on windows 2000 and higher

875753
frame	width
quite hackish because you re setting the width according to the default frame size that comes up first not the size you actually use

875757
environment	building
central server which monitors all the projects and notifies agents of new tasks so you can building on any environment you really need without setting up cross-compiling environment

875757
debian	linux
i have a setup that builds linux arm i386 binaries and packages those into debs and maintains a debian repository from build results - run unittests and all kinds of stuff on the code

875757
environment	building
but what i really wanted to say is that basicly allmost all codeigniter server software that i ve used are mainly just task schedulers and you still need to build configure the build environment yourself which is - in multiplatform scenarios atleast - bigger tasks that configuring a software that executes the building and produces nice reports from them

875758
ruby	php
ruby php and python all have easy to use http libraries which make this kind of an operation pretty easy

875778
authentication	logout
i am using basic level authentication and i need best logout code in jsp servlet

875780
any	set
since you won t be deleting or editing records you won t have any locking issues as long as concurrency is set to 1

875789
g++	gcc
clarification at the moment we re using -d_reentrant and -lpthread i assume i can replace them with just g++ -pthread looking at man gcc it sets the flags for both preprocessor and linker

875799
button	popup
when using the connect facebook connect button when i click it it opens up a new popup windows outside of the current windows

875801
daemons	systemd
but there s a tool called tcpwrappers which many systemd daemons also use - you know those hosts.allow hosts.deny files in your etc folder - they are part of tcpwrappers and can archive the exact scenario you described

875812
nested	order
taking a stab in the dark since nested set-tree data is by definition already sorted it sounds like you need to convert the data into another format usually a flat one in order to sort it

875816
hash	md5
the md5 hash of wolfram alpha no quotes is

875824
constructor	object
a more typical implementation would have the object constructor take a parameter which tells it which user you re dealing with like this

875832
sql-server	oracle
i m not familiar with sql-server logs but i know oracle has a bunch of them and they re full of good stuff

875854
value	field
i hope that makes sense to you. also it shouldn t be unexpected that any given db accessor would cast value to their appropriate type given the field type

875862
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
as with any dynamic-sql if the data comes from user-input without validation the procedure is wide open for sql-injection

875862
parentheses	operators
the comma separated values is put between the parentheses of the in operators to form an expression similar to where itemid in 1 3 16

875914
account	userid
is it best to check for a null user when trying to access userid or should i assign an anonymous account

875938
any	set
that way any part of your code that gets data from table will always get the realrow object instead which will have everything set to the proper data types

875946
python	lua
embedding lua is much easier than embedding python

875946
python	lua
lua is about 20x smaller and simpler than python

875951
json	xml
yes a php application can generate all of the data formats which gi uses such as raw xml json or soap

875952
wxwidgets	mfc
alternatives are wxwidgets mfc wtl fltk and many more

875953
any	set
general advice set up your robots.txt to prevent google from indexing any of these pages and make the login tokens or whatever one-time use only

875959
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc and webforms use different httphandlers in order to expose programmatic features to developers to handle requests

875959
webforms	asp.net
mvc gives you much greater control over the html that you put on the page as you will write almost all of it whereas webforms aka asp.net will render html to the page automatically

875965
value	field
you could use javascript to set all the value in hidden field to

875966
any	set
if the parameter data is used in any manner other than a set selection of options and if it is coming from an untrusted source potentially then one may want to validate the parameter values

875971
background-color	transparency
however you can get around it by finding that annoying view every time it appears and setting its background-color to transparency

875973
concatenation	comma
perhaps you could add the names of disabled invisible fields to an extra hidden-field concatenation by comma or something and build the php to not process fields that appear in it

875983
contains	any
however we do not want any customer to see another customer s issues not least because each issue can contains commercially sensitive information

875985
beautifulsoup	elementtree
invalid user submitted html content for example would need to be forced clean using something like beautifulsoup or elementtree

875988
defined	declare
the reason the class you defined would not work is that the scope of the closure is where it is declare not where it is run

876025
python	lua
there is less of a chance that people can mess things up when moving from python or lua mode to c++ mode in their heads

876025
python	lua
if you use python or lua to tweek the program those languages either become a dependency when it becomes time to deploy or you need to back things out to c++

876034
triggers	insert
in this case it would be possible if you turn off recursive triggers to link the record from the insert table via the primary key and make changes to the record

876042
any	set
however the issue is even though i have a myriad of hardware 2x dual quad rack mount servers 8 285gtx gpus 6x ps3s 2x hacked 360s they can run linux access to tonnes of common pcs as well as a few workstations i have no large data set that needs to be crunched or even any software that i can run distributed

876048
put	get
note although when writing the question i didn t get any references to this question the current side-bar points it out so i ll put it here for reference either way the question is different but might be useful

876049
populate	row
my guess is that it finds a row in the db table then identifies that is is a synonymnode class type by the discriminatorvalue column then tries to populate the class including the extra columns table mapped with the secondarytable

876053
rewrite	rule
your internal machine would only have to deal with one path and if you wanted to integrate the app with another service platform at a later date you would only have to add another rewrite rule rather than messing with the application itself

876091
equals	getter
jpa entities being just java beans classes defining getter and setters with optional supporting code constructor hashcode equals named queries copy methods what else

876094
click	mouse
however if user brings up right click menu by clicking on an area of the listview where there is no listitem showing below the last listitem then click the menu item the non-modal form shows up but the cursor seems to be stuck in a left button mouse down state in the listview the non-modal form is at the front but when i move the mouse it makes those drag area rectangles in the background listview as if the mouse button is being held down

876094
click	mouse
i ve tried using various bringtofront setfocus and tried to use sendmessage to simulate mouse click to get around it with no success

876095
constructor	object
as opposed to just having a public constructor and creating object using

876119
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

876131
webforms	asp.net
asp.net c# - avoiding the use of webforms - we are talking asp.net mvc here

876135
subtract	time
it is possible to just subtract the date and time to get the timespan so you should be able to use

876147
constructor	private
this is nice way of forcing myclass to be final if you use private constructor

876161
hash	md5
another methods that would also shorten the string would be to calculate the md5 sha1 hash of the string concatenated with a seed if you wished

876166
implements	extends
if your object extends nsobject all you need to do i believe is to implements these example for person object

876166
implements	extends
they will serialization all the objects that they hold if objects implements nscoder interface - they do if they extends nsobject

876173
actionscript	haxe
i think you re referring to haxe which is an open source programming language very similar to actionscript

876176
internet-explorer	firefox
currently this only works in firefox not on internet-explorer

876177
constructor	object
i figure out how i want those object initialized then derive a class d from c with a static method which provides the argument for the c in d s default constructor

876180
struct	unions
unions can also have members and methods and default to public access similarly to struct

876185
configuration	logging
by changing the configuration you can tell your logger factory to produce different instances of your logging classes according to the situation

876186
value	field
in this case the clr requires that the default parameterless constructor creates a new instance with all the field initialized to default value

876188
python	php
edit due to the several suggestions to use a serverless database or any other type of lookup table xml flat key value pairs etc i want to clarify the following although this code is written in php the idea is to port it to python and make a desktop application out of it - this has noting to do besides the example of course with php

876188
filesystems	hardlink
furthermore if i have to use some kind of lookup table i ll definitely go with sqlite 3 but what i m looking for is a solution that doesn t involves any other additional technology besides the filesystems folders files and hardlink

876192
credentials	account
it is worth noting that both methods end up hard coding the account credentials

876200
any	set
i d just like to note the exception-handling-handling code looks bad but the reason for it is i had exception-handling suppression code in there so that any exception-handling-handling would be suppressed and return false if a configuration option was set but i wanted to remove it for brevity sake

876200
callback	methods
once you do whatever you want where i left the comment we call the next beginreceive methods which will run the callback again if the client sends any more data

876215
droppable	draggable
from what i ve seen about jquery apparently there is a way to make an element on my webpage draggable droppable or what have you

876216
contains	any
contains any member of the basic

876218
nsapplication	appkit
appkit 0x95229630 nsapplication nexteventmatchingmask untildate inmode dequeue

876218
nsapplication	appkit
appkit 0x9522266b nsapplication run

876222
base-class	subclass
in other words depending on the type i was treating this as base-class or subclass the tostring methods would call a different methods

876223
32-bit	16-bit
also the sizeof operator tells you the size of an object type in terms of the number of char s not the number of bytes octets so if you were on some weird system with a 16-bit char and a 32-bit int then sizeof int would be 2 not 4

876229
postorder	inorder
provide the following operations insert remove inorder traversal preorder traversal postorder traversal

876239
stderr	stdout
to redirect both stdout and stderr to a truncated file i know to use

876239
stderr	stdout
how do i redirect both stdout and stderr append to a file

876242
stderr	stdout
redirect stderr to where stdout is currently going

876243
webforms	asp.net
in asp.net webforms and asp 3 classic asp i came across an issue whereby naming your form submit button submit would break things

876247
typedef	struct
you seem to have forgotten to typedef the type m_data that you re using in the various methods and i don t understand why you want a separate tree_node struct rather than using the class itself

876249
constructor	object
we can return a null object which is impossible to do with a constructor this may or may not be useful in all cases.

876268
firefox	safari
this is the case with both firefox and safari

876270
constructor	object
where you want the object to be around for some reason but don t want to do all the heavy lifting involved in the real constructor unless needed

876270
.when	ready
so you create a separate methods create and call it .when you re ready for the heavy lifting

876277
callback	methods
or you might declare traversal functionality using callbacks the caller passes a callback instance to the preorder methods the preorder methods traverses the tree and invokes the callback methods for each node the callback methods would take a node or more specifically node data as a parameter and might return a boolean that would let the callback spevify that it wants to abend the traversal

876285
javascript	dom
i would urge you to stay away from all of javascript s dom s reserved words

876286
scheme	lisp
scheme is also known to be able to handle this situation as well as give a tremendous advantage over your competition but scheme runs only on lisp machines

876295
textbox	button
but i can t do this in the first page because if i place the form tag just before the field set my other asp.net textbox and button would be out of the form and when trying to run it is showing an error telling that the txt box control has to be in the form

876314
linked-list	arrays
i think the fastest way is to hold the arrays in the form of a linked-list and have a hash table that can translate between index in the arrays to pointer to the entry

876315
assign	add
assign a new dept to ee is demonstrating that a dept is a emp even though it might add additional functionality such as the disp methods

876319
linux	unix
this a wrapper library written in c# to the usblib for unix linux which is written in c

876319
keyboard	hid
i have a small usb unitech barcode scanner which when plugged into the usb port works like a keyboard and the system both linux and win32 see it as a hid

876346
contains	elements
in general left subtree also contains the equal elements

876349
base-class	inherited
in inherited u need to create this object if u want to use both derived class methoda aswell as base-class methods

876379
specifications	w3c
you might want to have a look at the w3c specifications for css2 to avoid selector problems like this

876381
any	set
if you need a general layout package that handles any data set i d suggest graphviz over northwoods

876399
contains	any
when using xmldocument to load an xml document which contains invalid byte sequences there is an exception-handling but when reading all content into a byte arrays and then checking against utf-8 there is no exception-handling any ideas

876419
widget	button
apparently the jquery blockui widget changes the button behavior and it doesn t submit correctly

876420
hibernate	liquibase
yes liquibase uses hibernate s metadata classes which are the same whether you use xml mappings or annotations

876420
hibernate	liquibase
you do need a hibernate config file to point liquibase to but your mappings can be xml or jpa annotations

876421
compact-framework	.net
1 for gui design you can choose between c++ mfc and the .net compact-framework

876421
compact-framework	.net
the recommended way of doing the ui especially for a newcomer is the .net compact-framework using c#

876430
silverlight	wpf
tilebrush in silverlight 2 and 3 is only a placeholder class ready for future expansion and for wpf compatibility

876444
value	field
it uses field __ operatorname value style syntax

876445
user-interface	drawing
i m experimenting with drawing on the iphone by manually creating parts of the user-interface for my application in this case a graph

876451
derived-class	base-class
u need to create this object if u want to use both derived-class methoda aswell as base-class methods

876452
webforms	asp.net
there are a couple ways you can build user interfaces with asp.net but the most common is asp.net webforms

876478
webforms	asp.net
my suggestion would be start slowly and accustom yourself with the asp.net page lifecycle the code-behind and code-beside models of creating webforms understanding how asp.net compiles and executes pages on the server state management client script features such as javascript etc

876479
any	set
try to debugging to see if there are any _barbuttonitemflags set for your button.

876514
.when	ready
another solution embedded webkit .when it s ready

876529
json	xml
i have managed to implement an operation behavior to json serialize so that the message infoset will contain json compatible xml

876529
json	xml
i then wanted to add a messageencoder to turn the xml into json in the message body

876529
json	xml
i can t serialize the whole message as we still have standard soap headers etc and the s body still contains a root request or response object before the json compatible xml

876545
getter	setter
another solution which does not require static imports would be to create a complete applicationsettings class with fields getter and setter and pass an instances of this class to the constructor of the class that needs the parameters

876550
conditional	operators
do the below without any conditional or comparison operators

876552
fadeout	fadein
i changed the fadein and fadeout to fadeto between 0.01 and 1.0

dictionary	arrays
assuming you can reuse the source letters within one word for each word in your dictionary list construct two arrays of letters - one for the candidate word and one for the input string

876590
value	field
if the field is not set that is it has value you should insert the form data to a new record

876590
value	field
you ll set the id field according to the action for example data edit 1 will set the id field to and data new will not set value to it

876597
perl	php
php has pear perl has cpan and java has appache commons

876632
double	int
i am interested in finding out what the best null alternatives are for the following data types in particular double float decimal datetime int long although others are more than welcome

876639
getter	setter
in objective-c the property and synthesize keyword automatically create the getter and setter methods for you

876644
unsigned	zero
obviously for unsigned data you ll need .maxvalue avoid zero

876645
hosts-file	hosts
first this is not an effective methods to block websites but if you really want to do it this way then lookup the format of the hosts

876645
hosts-file	hosts
the hosts you are generating looks something like this

876650
hosts-file	hosts
the hosts maps ip addresses to hostname so it doesn t need the protocols bits and pieces

876657
hosts-file	hosts
many spyware adware programs block access to the hosts

876660
button	popup
i have an asp.net page where i have a button when a user clicks on the button i will check whether the user has logged in or not.if not logged in i will show a modal popup to login using jqueryui

876660
textbox	button
i have placed one textbox txtpassword and one button btnlogin control in the div which will be shown by the jquerydialog.but in btnlogin s click event i am not able to read the text value entered in the textbox txtpassword

876660
textbox	button
i had hard coded the text properties value of textbox1 as sample in the html part of my aspx file .in button click event i am getting it.but the other textbox txtpassword s text property is giving me null value

876668
onkeyup	keyup
i d like to hook a keyup onkeyup event so that i can do things like display an approximate running count of the number of characters in the editor

876676
filtering	sorting
the collectionviewsource class can add sorting and filtering to any wpf items control

876680
switching	screens
i m in the process of switching from multiple tabs in iterm to one gnu screens session

876694
pthreads	fork
after all you will learn all you need to know about fork if you use pthreads anyway

876695
ubuntu	linux
how to set up a subversion svn server on gnu linux - ubuntu

876697
methods	extend
you can extend the default htmlhelper and urlhelper just with an extension methods so you have the xxxhelper as first param in your methods

876708
pascal	delphi
doesn t sound scary until you change installation to use innosetup which uses a pascal delphi

876716
assign	add
you can instead use some ajax to send it to the server and then add code in the server so the value is assign

876727
driver	kernel
you will find there a filtering driver for keyboard keyb.c kernel spaces queue queue.c and techniques to hide presence in system

876746
csv	xml
if you don t have excel installed on the machine running the code you can export as xml or csv comma separated values file and then import that in to excel at a later date

876751
innodb	myisam
switch to myisam database instead of innodb and use full-text search on this column

876768
disposable	dispose
edit i overrode the dispose bool disposing methods since the base tracelistener class already implements the disposable pattern but as far as i can say the methods is not called

876774
pascal	delphi
delphi users might want to look at free pascal s paralel implementation of libchm since a pascal solution makes it easier embeddable

876787
json	xml
my understanding is you like embed json into xml infoset in the soap

876787
json	xml
i don t see a good reason to coexist json infoset with xml infoset

876787
json	xml
however you can return json data as a string value of a xml element attribute in the soap

876788
webforms	asp.net
we have an asp.net webforms application which occasionally generates a validation error like below

876803
debugging	trace
i am debugging a user dump file and there is this class member function at the top of the the stack trace

876803
pointers	stack
now when i jump to the 3rd frame - the this pointers value is invalid the this value is retrieved from the ecx register - but the ecx register value got changed in the first two function of the above stack trace - -

876804
json	xml
the data json xml can be provided by servlet services and they are understood by the

876806
.when	ready
and .when p1 execute it sets turn to 1 and is also ready to execute the critical-section

876809
jquery	.post
the most common way to do this is to use php and jquery s .post get ajax features to call on a page that has the php code used to insert into the database

876811
nested	order
we have a series of rectangles produced inside a canvas and they are nested in this order scrollview canvas virtualizingstackpanel rectangles in the xaml

876813
value	field
if your form1.aspx submits to form2.aspx then you have atleast a few ways to access the value of form field including hidden field

876813
value	field
the request.form property exposes a namevaluecollection contains all submitted form field names as keys and their value as value

876813
value	field
if this is asp.net 2+ and you used the cross-page posting technique you will be able to access field value in the previous page using the previouspage property of the page

876834
bitwise-and	complement
so we take the complement of the msb extend it to the full 8 bits and bitwise-and it with the original number

876835
value	field
asp.net does not allow any html basically a list of potentially dangerous values in a querystring or form field value by default

876859
ruby	php
the programs i wrote usually is ruby python or php so they may not be so much optimized

876859
multiplication	addition
can the compiler make the multiplication happen on one core and the addition happen on a different core and therefore make 2 cores work at the same time

876875
ruby	php
ruby python and php applications can all be written to use multiple threads however

876893
contains	elements
to sum up map will take the function head apply it to each of the sublists so that you will get a new list of type contains just the head first elements of each list

876923
hashtable	sorted
which is faster to find an item in a hashtable or in a sorted list

876933
constructor	private
give the settings class a private no-argument constructor

876934
duplicates	contains
contains duplicates data remove the

876936
ruby	php
however if you are running a webserver on there for ruby or php with fcgi or apache pre-forking ant to a lesser extent other apache workers with multiple processes then they would tend to spread out across the cores

876944
triggers	insert
most library implementations at least in high-level languages will automatically grow your hashtable behind the scenesâ which will cause slower-than-expected performance on the insert that triggers the growthâ but if you re rolling your own it s definitely something to consider

876945
filtering	grouping
select settings under filtering keys grouping in here you can switch off repeating keys for that user on that machine

876946
hashtable	sorted
the fastest way to find an element in a sorted indexable collection is by n-ary search o logn while a hashtable without collissions has a find complexity of o 1

876964
hashtable	sorted
algorithm complexity is a good thing to know and hashtable are known to be 0 1 while a sorted vector in your case i guess it is better to use a sorted arrays than a list will provide 0 log n access time

876966
scala	java
if so java doesn t support that but you might try scala

876970
shell	bash
if you have cygwin installed from it s bash shell run your executable say myprogram using the time utility like so

876978
sortedlist	hashtable
the get operation in a sortedlist is o log n while the same operation e a hashtable is o 1

876990
boolean	double
try to use a struct with the double + a boolean telling whether the value is specified or not

876997
jquery	.post
on the click event it does a jquery .post which deletes data from the database and returns the table with the removed row

877012
contains	elements
use event delegation and put the event handler on the elements contains the table

877016
jquery	.post
please do .post your jquery code respononsible for that whole logyc

877027
ftp	ssh
jimg is right - we don t know your type of hosting or ftp ssh restrictions

877032
hashtable	set
for extremely small data sets which are frequently changed and or infrequently searched an un sorted list may be even faster since it avoids the overhead of doing the sort. as the data set becomes large the growth of the list s search time overshadows the fixed overhead of hashing and the hashtable becomes faster

877052
gridview	listview
i want to have a combobox in the header cells of my gridview currently inside of a listview populated with the data from that column

877053
methods	extend
python offers an http server that you can extend with your server-side methods

877054
textbox	button
it has a textbox or two and a button

877081
arrays	loops
i m not an expert of python but what is wrong with a simple loops from start to end of first arrays

877087
cvs	git
vim 7 plugin useful for manipulating files controlled by cvs svn svk and git within vim including committing changes and performing diffs using the vimdiff system

877097
thickbox	jquery
i am using thickbox as i have other jquery bits on the site

877106
implements	super
either write a class that implements runnable and pass whatever you need in a suitably defined constructor or write a class that extends thread with a suitably defined constructor that calls super with appropriate parameters

877113
constructor	object
you need to pass the parameter in the constructor to the thread object

877115
implements	extends
you have a class that extends thread or implements runnable and a constructor with the parameters you d like to pass

877130
constructor	object
consider making m_bar a member or passing a pre-constructed bar object to the constructor

877142
constructor	mutators
if necessary inputthing could have accessor and mutators get set functions to prevent it needing a constructor taking many arguments

877152
show	next
as the value is checked if it is selected this should be inserted into the database and will show as checked upon next viewing of the page

877189
put	get
you could probably put a thread.sleep 15000 at the start of your main to get 15 seconds in which to connect to the application and start the profiling

877195
any	set
and set it to any keystroke you want

877198
animation	rotation
i am applying an rotation transform animation in an animation block with this transform

877198
animation	rotation
the animation begins and the user kicks in another event that would have to push the rotation towards a new target

877217
lookup	any
any help would be really appreciated as i have been trying to lookup in the .net with no luck

877223
delphi	c++
it s probably easier to go the other way - rewrite the business logic in c++ and call it from delphi via c interfaces

877226
any	set
however as a rule of thumb i d try to set user-agent header for any such application as noted by pjc50

877227
attributes	properties
does the input with runat server attributes has other or limited properties and methods

877231
rewrite	rule
is there a way to put a rewrite rule in htaccess that will convert query strings to segmented uris

877254
nyromodal	jquery
im using the nyromodal plugin for jquery within an asp.net 3.5 webforms app

877269
web-config	app-config
quartz.net uses common.logging so something like this in your app-config web-config

877292
http	ssl
note http support is only available if the socket module was compiled with ssl support

877299
i2c	spi
regarding spi i2c etc i haven t implements any of them

877325
ip-address	hostname
perhaps it helps if you use the server s ip-address instead of its hostname

877327
delphi	c++
you can mix delphi pascal code with c++ code in the same project

877327
delphi	c++
if you want to go the plain dll way even though you are using c++ builder you can try using a shared memory manager like sharemem comes with delphi or fastmm sourceforge to allow passing of string s instead of pchar s

877328
hide	show
i have tried to use the hide and show with no luck either

877334
jms	jta
generally speaking application server gives the administrator great tools to manage java ee resources data sources jms connection factories jms destinations jta transaction manager etc

877429
javascript	dom
alternatively for passing it arguments when it is open already use the handle that is returned child1 and access that window s dom via javascript

877431
python	php
a php python script that query after query rebuild the structure for the new year called by a cron job

877431
python	php
actually i m going for the first way a .sql file containing the structure and a php python script loaded by cronjob that rebuild the structure but i m wondering if this is the best way

877434
value	field
i require a sql scripting to validate a varchar field in a table in a sql-server 2005 database that contains datetime value in the format dd mm yyyy or null value

877439
hsqldb	oracle
someone asked the question int bigint or uuid guid in oracle db2 derby and hsqldb

877473
order	add
just periodically roll the old order into the history which is a read-only dataset now so you add an index to cater for every single query you require and it should if your data-structures are half decent remain performant

877478
radio-button	selected
since the disabled attribute doesn t appear to work reliably across browsers i think your only option is to remove the option elements not needed when a radio-button is selected

877515
http	ssl
ist of all the one thing i would like to point out here security.mode transport is used in case if your targeted service is hosted on http ssl which is not the case with your specified url

877519
selected	listbox
now depending on what the value is passed i need to set the selected item in the listbox

877520
default	reset
this way if the device gets an incorrect checksum then it knows the upgrade was incomplete and can reset to default previous firmware stored on another device

877520
required	checked
this required some pre-boot maybe in the bootloader to checked the checkedsum

877523
constructor	object
creating object using the constructor that takes one argument works as expected

877523
constructor	object
however if i create object using the constructor that takes no arguments i get an error

877525
private	self
to create ssl tls enabled server sockets i m currently using code like the following keystore.jks contains a self signed private public key pair used for securing confirmation - clients have a similar trust store which contains the signed certificate with the public key of that pair

877527
ubuntu	linux
how would your determine a max value to set an alarm on the i o activity of a ubuntu linux server hosting upto 4 sites running apache mysql and upto 4 tomcats

877530
jquery	dojo
does not use an existing javascript framework dojo jquery etc - unless you can roll create your own sub framework where i can compile in just the components i need

877541
required	checked
multiplying these together and if it is less than the required number of tiles then i reduce the optimal size and perform the checked again until all of the tiles fit the rectanlge

877569
perl	c++
regular expression generator perl php python java javascript coldfusion c c++ ruby vb vbscript j# c# c++.net vb.net

877573
display	width
the width of the dialog is the width of the paragraph that s first display in it

877578
dictionary	arrays
i m interested in converting a numpy arrays into a sparse dictionary as quickly as possible

877584
python	java
i know java fairly well python to some extent and know c++ but am rusty

877584
python	java
iâ d like to use either java or python but am not sure if they offer the audio capabilities

877610
ubuntu	linux
how would your determine a max value to set an alarm on the i o activity of a ubuntu linux server hosting upto 4 sites running apache mysql and upto 4 tomcats

877614
display	width
in particular getscreendevices returns an arrays of graphicsdevice objects from which you can read the width height of the display mode

877615
windows-server	windows
i have sometimes had a few difficulties getting my windows-server to recognise an ebs drive and have had to use the windows disk manager to recognise the drive but once that s done it works perfectly and is the same as any normal windows drive except that you can scale it up to tera or pera bytes

877651
hide	show
they have their place but more often i choose a suitable maximum number of allowed controls put them all on the page initially and only enable disable hide show them as needed

877652
getline	istream
now i want to copy the contents of the streambuf into a string but it apparently only supports writing to char sgetn creating an istream with the streambuf and using getline

877655
double	int
you must implement a single methods returning a type compatible with all of the implemented overridden methodss in this case number int double etc

877667
restart	reload
in the bootloader allow a failsafe methods by holding button x down during restart of reload new program memory from an available source of input sd card rs232 whatever

877679
triggers	insert
this table only needs to be initialized once as it s fairly easy to add the appropriate zero-filled records via a triggers on game creation and fire on insert update requests to update the period_summary table

877686
delphi	c++
i ported an old delphi program under qt c++ and i must say that qt is the framework that comes closest to vcl in terms of ease of use and power imho

877692
double	int
the commented out case of methodb being implemented as returning a double however would not work while it would satisfy the contract of interfacea it would conflict with interfaceb which demands an int

877699
constructor	object
and sure enough the test structs default constructor is called while creating the vector object

877699
constructor	object
but what i am not able to understand is how does the stl initialize the object i create a vector of basic datatype such as vector of ints since there is default constructor for it

877711
buffering	streaming
one thing we have found though is that seperate streaming for audio and video improve the latency and prevent buffering

877714
highlight	cell
i don t think the original poster is looking to make a palette of colors colours instead he is trying to highlight an invalid cell

877716
put	get
get and put in my applications

877717
hosts-file	hosts
however if i enter the ip of the site in my hosts the site works perfectly logs the user in without the additional challenge

877717
hosts-file	hosts
2 how can i get the site to succeed without a forcing everyone to edit their hosts or b the site challenging them and failing to log them in

877717
hosts-file	hosts
however it appears that in addition to having that dns entry we also have to have the hosts entry for the site to work

877726
delphi	c++
owl mfc activex vb3 4 5 6 vb.net pascal delphi c c++ c#

877732
constructor	object
just imagine the situation of modifying a class with a default constructor to be immutable thus requiring that the object be fully set up during construction

877735
double	int
double are there then int double int will get value 0

877738
contains	any
is there any way to selected items in a list that aren t contains in another

877757
firefox	opera
the only things you can really rely on are keydown events and even then not so much in opera and firefox -- safari and ie both provide keydown events during ime composition with a charcode of 229 and a keyup event with a charcode corresponding to the actual key that was pressed

877757
google-chrome	safari
there is a textinput event but that is only supported by safari and by proxy google-chrome should support it as well but it s not substantially better than standard events anyway -

877801
value	field
also the findstringexact doesn t search through the value field it only looks through the display text

877808
content-disposition	content-type
if the problem is the batch file is being displayed in the browser you need to set content-type and content-disposition in the http header so the user is prompted to save or run the file rather than have the browser display it

877815
host	dns
sounds like the dns server does not know the forward lookup hostname to ip for the host you are trying to connect to

877823
declarative	imperative
i suspect you re trying to do imperative things in declarative land which means you think in terms of steps

877825
scheme	lisp
i don t know what your specific problems with xaml are and i haven t used it myself but i ve found that when using xml based technologies like xslt a little lisp or scheme experience can go a long way

877828
touch	drag
so when i touch and drag it should scroll

877832
np-complete	bin-packing
intuitively this sounds like an np-complete problem it reduces to a problem very like bin-packing however the following algorithm a modified form of bin-packing should be pretty good no time for a proof sorry

877832
partition-problem	bin-packing
see the partition-problem and bin-packing for more information the former is a very similar problem and if you limit yourself to fixed precision transactions then it is equivalent - proof needed of course

877844
linqdatasource	sqldatasource
next to #region blocks i would say the asp.net idatasource implementations sqldatasource linqdatasource that force allow you to write data-access code directly into your aspx pages

877847
delphi	c++
personally i d rather build simple rpc-server as windows-service with c++ or delphi

877847
telnet	ssh
but many other kinds of server could also do the job ssh apache telnet

877847
environment	execution
however if you really have control on the execution environment then there always be some workarounds

877855
delphi	c++
hobbyists have access to delphi c++ builder and other codegear software

877900
silverlight	xbap
xbap applications have no issue with tab and key press issues as far as my experience.if you are going to find someway to add them to you silverlight application the stick with it if you find the solution

877900
silverlight	wpf
has anyone come up with a good way to share the xaml between silverlight and wpf

877927
python	perl
if you use perl or python you might try something like

877928
having	select
how do you select all fields of two joined tables without having conflicts with the common field

877931
keyboard	mouse
glovepie - advanced input scripting mouse keyboard game controllers

877933
toggleclass	show
you can just extend jquery with a toggleclass as show below

877954
delphi	c++
increasing c++ percentage that i ultimately backported to delphi

877957
subtyping	generics
it stems from the fact that if sub is a subtyping of super then sub is a subtyping of super which is not the case of generics types

877964
multiplication	addition
although you might get away with a numeric support class which would provide addition and multiplication of the various boxed number types the amount of complexity you save will be very little compared with providing two or three primitive matrices and a couple of big-number ones particularly if you use a templating system eg ant s replace task or xslt to generate the source code

877970
subtraction	addition
even if you solve this how are you planning on solving addition subtraction etc

877970
multiplication	addition
zero can be defined as the identity in addition or a zero in multiplication but without a generic definition of addition or multiplication a generic definition of zero is unlikely

877982
dependency-injection	singleton
of course it doesn t have to be a true singleton - it could be some shared resource provided with dependency-injection but the point is it needs to be shared somehow so you can get at it from the new request.

877990
order	add
that way the result looks exactly the same even if you add fields to the table or change the order of the fields in the table

878018
uiscrollview	subviews
prior to iphone os 3.0 the uiscrollview s hittest withevent methods always returns self so that it receives the uievent directly only forwarding it to the appropriate subviews if and when it determines it s not related to scrolling or zooming

878026
order	add
since order is relevant we want to make sure that the order in which we add objects to the entity context is also the order in which they are inserted into the database

878026
identity-column	sql-server
this is relevant since sql-server will be generating values for the identity-column

878030
configuration	environment
as is often the case some of the performance issues will trace back to the implementation of the application while other will be determined by the configuration of the server environment

878053
type-safety	generics
you need to consider that generics are only used at compile-time for type-safety checking

878060
order	add
i would instead add a dedicated sort order column to your database-table and take it form there

878061
execute	declare
they can all execute it at the same time unless it is declare as synchronized regardless of the fact that your class is a singleton iirc

878066
web-config	app-config
as for configuration look at the system.configuration.configurationmanager class which allows you to read settings from your project s app-config web-config file

878075
xcopy	cmd
the simplest solution would be to wrap your xcopy cmd in a command file and schedule it to run whenever you want as a scheduled task on your webserver

878114
detect	move
the distance calculation should detect when substring of the text have simply been move within the text

878125
button	popup
i have a modal popup that has a targetid to a hidden button

878125
button	popup
i want the popup to occur when a button in a grid is clicked but that button is programmed behind the code and therefore the targetid would be invalid.

878143
python	java
we would like to minimize the amount of development required but the only thing that i can think of now that would allow us to do this would be to create a client and server app from scratch in something like python java or c#

878152
duplicates	elements
as some time has passed since i initially wrote this answer the more disturbed recessed of my brain suggest that you could create a duplicates iframe position it below in z-space the first and when the onload event of the frame fires animate the opacity of the original iframe from 1 to 0 before removing the elements entirely

878171
factors	primes
i d also like to add that the size of n you re working with allows a factors heuristic to find the primes factorization of n fairly quickly

878176
constructor	object
i thought that the constructor for system.drawing.pen would use the gdi+ api to create a new pen thus using a new gdi object

878223
positioning	slider
you just need to add your own second slider and programmatically lock each bars min-max range based on the positioning of the other

878232
exception-handling	try-catch
could someone explain to me why it is considered inapropriate to have a try-catch in the main methods to catch any unhandled exception-handling

878245
value	field
i ve considered storing the original value for all the model s properties in a hidden form field and then writing a custom tryupdatemodel to only update the properties that have changed but this feels a little too like the viewstate we ve all been more than happy to leave behind by moving to asp.net-mvc

878264
exception-handling	try-catch
saying this if you have utilised exception-handling properly in a fine-grained and task-specific manner in the rest of your program and handled the errors accordingly there rather than juist displaying a generic error box then a general try-catch for all exceptions in the main methods is probably a useful thing to have

878264
exception-handling	try-catch
one point to note here is that if you re reproducably getting bugs caught in this main try-catch then you either have a bug or something is wrong with your localised exception-handling

878264
fatal-error	crash
the primary usage of this try-catch with main would be purely to prevent your program from crash in very unusual circumstances and should do hardly any more than display a vaguely user-friendly fatal-error message to the user as well as possibly logging the error somewhere and or submitting a bug report

878274
opacity	shadow
fill the same rounded rectangle without the shadow using destination out blend mode at 1.0 - the desired opacity

878289
exception-handling	try-catch
however this will only catch exception-handling on the gui thread much like your try-catch block - you should use similar code for each new thread you start to handle any unexpected exception-handling from them

878321
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

878331
dictionary	arrays
the first argument is a selector for the radio group the second a dictionary where the keys are the radio id to match and the value is an arrays of what select option values should remain

878359
multiplication	addition
there is no real good guarantee that the i value of the two threads are the same at the same time after all multiplication and addition probably will take different amount of times to execute and that means that one thread may need to wait for another for the i value to get in sync before comparing the a and b that corresponds to the dependent value i

878373
nsinteger	int
when i started with cocoa i remember that i read somewhere that int float and similar should not be used for class properties and to use ns equivalents like nsinteger

878384
contains	any
ensure this is contains in a hidden-field in the html and is therefore returned with any submit

878392
nsinteger	int
the int version is fine but nsinteger is preferred

878392
32-bit	64bit
nsinteger isn t an object and doesn t have to be referenced with a pointer â it s just a typedef that will allow the variables to be the native word size on both 32-bit and 64bit computers

878403
any	set
is there any kind of connection pooling available in tadoconnection library and how can i enable it and set it limits

878412
32-bit	64bit
i need some help to describe in technical words why a 64bit application prompts a not a valid win32 application in windows 32-bit on a 32-bit machine

878416
textbox	button
on .net 1.1 when a textbox contains an invalid value clicking on the submit button will not produce a postback e.g

878421
32-bit	64bit
by the way the reason for not a valid win32 application error message is that 64bit executable are stored in pe32+ format while 32-bit executable are stored in pe32 format

878423
any	set
if that property is set to true any static content javascript css images etc in your jsp page that starts with the path struts or with static will be served by the struts filterdispatcher and other class called the defaultstaticcontentloader

878425
singleton-methods	delegation
edited typed the return from the delegation singleton-methods based on a suggestion from kenneth ballenegger to eliminate the compiler-warnings

878426
command-prompt	cmd
if it s only the impact on the filesystems you wich to handle plain command-prompt cmd should be able to do it

878446
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit architecture is built to invoke hardware cpu instructions that aren t supported by a 32-bit cpu which your cpu is emulating in order to run a 32-bit os

878458
linux	osx
according to this you can use gnustep on linux and osx

878460
any	set
you have dual monitors set up and view a flash video let s say any youtube video in full screen mode in one of the monitors

878471
duplicates	contains
writing your own is less clear less efficient and contains duplicates code in this case

878479
switching	screens
i guess it prevents code that would exit the full screens if there s a switching to another windows from working ever

878486
dictionary	map
the tree map design pattern python folks would call it an ordered dictionary is one variation of this design pattern

878486
dictionary	hashmap
the hashmap design pattern python folks would call it a dictionary is another variation of this design pattern

878506
swing	swt
we implemented this functionality by embedding a batik swing canvas into an swt composite see here

878517
any	set
i also can t imagine that it would perform very well on any kind of large data set

878520
http	ssl
how at risk would i be if i were to go without ssl and just have the users login using straight http

878523
contains	any
the childnode from the _doc object that contains the information i need however it does not have any childnodes

878525
required	checked
in your case i would not use any synchronized as it is not required and checked on production-like hardware before determining bottlenecks

878541
apache	squid
right now i have a firewall iptables apache squid dns installed and a application server behind the firewall

878549
buffering	streaming
i d use the lower level open and read rather than the streaming equivalent as otherwise you ll have to worry about synchronizing the stdio buffering with the underlying file-descriptor

878563
silverlight	wpf
make sure your silverlight views and view models are isolated within their own assembly that is easily referenceable by your wpf application

878563
silverlight	wpf
add a reference to the silverlight class library that houses the views view models in the wpf application

878563
silverlight	wpf
inside your root ui element xaml files in silverlight and wpf do this

878563
silverlight	wpf
the reason why this works is because you can t directly reference a silverlight usercontrol from xaml within wpf

878563
silverlight	wpf
i gather this is because the system.windows.uielement in wpf is not the same as the system.windows.uielement in silverlight

878594
managed-code	unmanaged
managed-code and partly in unmanaged

878626
detect	move
i use this basic idea to move my objects about but now i would like to be able to detect collision between objects

878643
jquery	.post
i already have a implemented other simple jquery ajax application on the site but i m unsure how to convert over the standard login control to .post via ajax

878649
directory	folder
from a directory that only had folder in it

878685
directory	folder
from a directory where there are no files only folder and in fact the folder needed are imported right after

878695
json	xml
i m able to return json and partial views html as a valid actionresult but how would one return an xml string

878704
string.format	stringbuilder
some other options people have mentioned stringbuilder string.format string.join would only be preferable if you started with an arrays of strings

878710
button	popup
where jq_confirm is a custom jquery confirm function that popup a nice div with a yes no or ok cancel button pair

878722
python	java
the suite is more of a protocol than anything all the applications are written in a variety of languages python c# java etc and run on a variety of operating systems windows linux osx etc

878724
document	element
if your javascript snippet is out of scope in a function etc use the getelementbyid methods of the document global object to retrieve your or or whatever - in fact you can do this with any element provided you assign an id to the element

878750
selected	button
if you have this item in a container however then you could just use that container to selected your button

878769
contains	any
note to do the search in win2k we just entered .jar for the files and classabc for the search text string and the search would return any jar files containing class files where the title contains classabc

878798
macros	vba
i ve done all of these and know how much work it can save by creating a macros via vba to do this

878807
xsd	xml
i have a xsd file and i need to generate a xml file from it

878849
directory	folder
if you are worried about having too much to process you could try a sparse checkout with only the folder you need and then you could just commit the base directory or the subdirectories as needed without the overhead of the other projects

878863
any	set
but now i m saying that each set can have any mix of node s and edge s which isn t true

878890
radio-button	button
textbox button radio-button dropdownlist gridview etc

878890
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms are also event driven

878895
any	set
don t draw any line from map to set

878895
hashmap	arrays
whether it s a set a hashmap an arrays etc is implementation-specific and doesn t matter for uml

878938
environment	restart
restart explorer has the unfortunate side-effect of scrapping the user s current environment

878944
performance-monitor	perfmon
i had an app once that install a performance-monitor counter that should have been shared by my app and perfmon when it was running so installing it should be just to make sure either app was closed

878945
shutdown	restart
i ve in particular noticed problems with my graphics driver not getting updated correctly after an explorer shutdown restart

878972
contains	any
since it fails to understand cp65001 it crashes on any input that contains non-ascii characters

878973
any	set
is there any way vc++ specific i d guess to set a certain struct s member alignment individually

878984
methods	extend
you could extend the float type with a methods that would work like this

878990
debugging	trace
along with what quoo mentions the debugging player will show a popup windows with a stack trace for any uncaught exceptions that occur in the application at least for as3-based swfs

879002
put	get
why don t i have to put a form tag on my page to get it to postback

879006
unsigned	short
unsigned short x

879011
perl	ruby
can i replace emacs regex engine or tweak some setting so that when i use the query-replace-regexp or one of many other feature i can use the syntax i program with in java javascript perl ruby etc..

879021
registration	login
to add user login and register pages using out-of-the-box asp.net login and registration controls

879027
logout	login
you can expect all third-party software has been tested through a restart and almost all has been tested through logout login

879034
set	bag
in this case you d mark the nodes and edges as being unordered which relates to a bag or set and unique which narrows it down to being a set

879041
configuration	environment
i would use one connection string name appdb but actually host the connection string in an external outside of web.configuration file configuration file that is different in each environment

879049
glut	sdl
glut or sdl smfl etc does that work for you in a nice platform independent way

879064
animation	rotation
however since i am displaying completely different content after the rotation the default animation provided by uikit rotating the currently displayed view is inappropriate conceptually

879069
latitude-longitude	location
i am to compress location data latitude-longitude date time

879082
environment	building
unfortunately our building environment is such that we need to be running vc2003 2005 and 2008 concurrently and it would be much more convenient if i could run 2003 natively on windows 7 for the few projects we have that require it

879082
windows-vista	windows
i realize some things may not be available in the ide but i was able to run 2003 under windows-vista and if i could get the same base level of functionality under windows 7 i would be extremely happy

879090
16-bit	8bit
i ve worked on microcontrollers with 8bit buses and 16-bit pointers

879090
32-bit	64bit
likewise i can imagine systems that have 64bit cpus but 32-bit data buses which might then entail similar concerns about non-atomic pointer operations

879098
private-members	object
i think this argue is the same as dynamic vs static a class is the static definition of the object that can be used easily to know what to expect from an object it also helps tooling the languages to have proper intellisense support and documentation because you can easily know what are the different members and methods in the object another thing is the different paradigm of having the ability to declare private-members in the class that doesn t show on the object this can t be done in the prototype paradigm

879099
compression	streaming
compression typically works on a byte streaming

879099
compression	streaming
when a streaming has a non-uniform distribution of byte values for instance text or numbers stored as text the compression ratio you can achieve will be higher since fewer bits are used to store the bytes which appear more frequently in huffman compression

879109
google-chrome	firefox
i am using jquery 1.3.2 and the code that follows works wonderfully on firefox safari and google-chrome

879120
stream	send
this sounds to me like i need to make two response to the request it needs to immediately send a http 100 continue response and then continue reading from the original request stream httpcontext.request.inputstream without ending the request and then finally sending the resultant status code for the sake of arguments lets say it s a 204 no content result

879126
any	set
one of the things you should look at is whether you have set backcolor transparent on any of the child controls of your panels

879128
carbon	cocoa
mac os x -- os x has essentially three options carbon cocoa and the underlying core graphics layer

879132
32-bit	64bit
the primary reason why 64bit apps don t run on 32-bit oses has to do with the registers being used in the underlying assembly presuming ia-32 here language

879132
32-bit	x86
compiling for x86 32 bit means the compiler is limiting the registers to handling 32-bit of data max

879160
compare-and-swap	atomicity
check compare-and-swap cas and other atomicity operations not a c standard but most compilers have some access to the processor primitive

879192
click	mouse
then go into the control panels for the mouse click on the checkbox for enable program-specific settings and then click on settings

879200
directory	folder
you can copy the files into an appropriately named subdirectory directory of the data folder as long as it is the exact same version of mysql and you have retained all of the associated files in that directory

879218
pylons	django
i m looking to get up to speed on python is it worth working locally via the activepython interface then progressing to a website that supports one of the standard frameworks django or pylons or utilize the google apps environment

879228
json	xml
for json xml i have written an xml json action filter that makes it very easy to tackle without handling special cases in your action handler which is what you seem to be doing

879231
pylons	django
django and pylons add another layer of complexity to the edit feedback loop

879232
children	nodes
the generic templates causes templates rules to be recursively applied to children and attributes which gives you the opportunity to override the behavior for certain nodes

879235
ethernet	packets
jitter will begin to shoot through the roof as some packets have to be queue or retransmitted collisions on half-duplex ethernet or wireless

879248
having	select
my question is is there a way to get all the call stacks for all the threads in one shot without having to select each thread individually

879250
for-loop	loops
i know how to picture while loops but is this acceptable to represent for-loops using while and at this point make difference between souce code and algorithm

879255
itemtemplate	databound
i have a repeater control that contains an itemtemplate containing a databound label and a dropdownlist control

879267
value	field
i need to be able to search this field for exact value exactly 6.0 not 6.5

879285
freebsd	linux
this library works transparently with big- and little-endian elf files and runs just fine under linux despite its freebsd origins the usual . configure and make sequence is all you ll need to build it

879285
mips	x86
for grins i tried the reading a program header table example with minor modifications to get it to build on an x86 core file as well as a mips big-endian core file it appears to just work

879288
folder	dir
set svn ignore property on the root dir to ignore unneeded folder and never commit the root dir

879289
silverlight	wpf
does anyone know if views states used in silverlight will be available in next version of wpf

879290
boolean	int
where b is a boolean and a is an int

879298
debugging	trace
much more useful for the developer of an application than text stack trace would be to save a minidump using debugging | save dump as in visual-studio and send that instead

879306
hash	md5
the hash algorithm like md5 takes a table of bytes of arbitrary length and converts it to a table of bytes of known length - the operation is not easily reversible and small changes to the input table cause unpredictable changes in the output table

879306
salt	md5
input + salt md5 output

879309
contains	set
i could just manually implement hibernate lazy loading by dipping to hibernate and hydrating the hibernate object manually but the object graph for that object is huge contains hundreds of types that would need to be initialized and set

879321
forms-authentication	security
a but assuming we secure our application against replay attacks by enabling ssl for the entire application and since forms-authentication module also encrypts authentication data in authentication cookie then i would think there is no chance of this cookie being misused and thus cookies being persisted for longer periods of time should not present any security risks

879361
silverlight	wpf
with the new silverlight 3.0 feature that allows the components to be hosted outside of the browser our company is looking for details on the differences between this new feature and wpf windows applications since silverlight is partly a subset of wpf

879361
silverlight	wpf
is there a good resource that lists the differences between silverlight 3 outside of the browser and wpf applications

879377
jquery	.post
one thing that stands out is you have but in your jquery code you are using .post

879381
textbox	button
in simple terms i am creating a simple windows form with a combobox of employee names and a button so that when the user clicks the button the selected employee s email address appears in a textbox on the form

879383
copy-constructor	constructor
this means that gconv s having problem with one of your compiler-generated constructor in my case a copy-constructor

879383
constructor	object
check the function mentioned in the error message see what kinds of object it copy-constructs and see if any of those classes doesn t have a copy constructor

879388
boolean	int
valid type arguments are any arrays boolean date numeric query string struct uuid guid binary int float eurodate time creditcard email ssn telephone zipcode url regex range component or variablename

879389
any	set
this scripting does so so the cookies you can set on this page will be sent to any page in the www.quirksmode.org domain though only this page has a scripting that searches for the cookies and does something with them

879414
json	xml
i m looking for a library that will give me a nice gui for building the form and a json or xml or similar output that i can play with in the django backend

879415
enumerator	any
any also has an overload which takes no parameters and simply looks for any item in the enumerator

879434
webforms	asp.net
on my asp.net webforms i have a checkboxlist like this

879438
silverlight	wpf
here is a brief list of some common things that you don t have access to with silverlight that you might be planning on using in a wpf application

879446
arrays	loops
next you can strip each digit from f and store it in the arrays using a loops and the modulus operator

879446
modulus	digits
each time through the loop the modulus takes the last digits by returning the remainder from division by 10

879450
twitter	tweets
next best thing although still pretty undesirable would be to hold non-reversibly encrypted credentials to resend to twitter whenever you need to display tweets

879453
deep-copy	object
since all object in xmlbeans extend xmlobject we get the magic deep-copy function for free

879453
deep-copy	object
what is the correct and simple way to make a deep-copy of a jaxb object

879454
data-structures	dictionary
i start with my data-structures db tables xtd data dictionary etc

879462
databound	gridview
therefore the way i am adding the dropdownlist controls to the footer is in code dynamically on the databound event of the gridview

879470
assign	add
honestly don t fully understand why you are trying to assign two student sets into cats you should join both sets into one and then add them to cats

879471
double	int
since you want it to take an int and return a double

879474
attributes	properties
i have a properties per textbox on the pdf and am using attributes to specify the pdf textbox that the propery maps to

879474
attributes	properties
so the only solution i could think of was to create a base class and have each application type extend my base class and override each of the properties just to throw the new attributes value on it

879476
double	int
in this case you d have to make the functor the operator to return double and take an int as a parameter

879510
attributes	properties
eric lippert has a good blog on when to and not to use attributes properties vs

879516
contains	set
set up a command object cmd to contains the multiple-result-set sproc

879518
linux	unix
i m using meld and tktiff on unix linux and the like

879525
arrays	loops
why not just jam the integers into an arrays in your loops

879533
contains	elements
determines whether the list t contains elements that match the conditions defined by the specified predicate

879542
filtering	sorting
this is not a good idea for a number of reasons but for now let s just say that we should let databases perform a job they are really good at and that is filtering and sorting data

879558
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
the datavaluefield is common across checkboxlist radiobuttonlist listcontrol etc

879560
audio	id3
to be clear i m talking about an audio tag not an id3 tag

879587
any	set
first i d identify any connections operating at the maximum speed i ve set

879592
click	mouse
if however i do not move the mouse between the clicks then the double click is fired

879609
value	field
how do i get an extjs combo field to clear its value when the display text is blank or doesn t match a list value custom text not in the data store

879631
xsd	xml
i don t think it s supported by the designer at least not in vs2005 which i used for that project so you d have to open your xsd file in the xml editor and do it by hand

879645
order	add
but i would like to add it in an order fashion

879645
order	add
i d like to be able to add the two new options test and another to the dropdown so it s order another blah foo test and zebra using jquery

879659
16-bit	8bit
most these days are 16-bit but you can still make 8bit wave files

879675
hide	show
depending on which row is click i want to show hide an accordion panels

879676
compact-framework	.net
i m trying perform a relatively basic tcp socket send receive operation on windows ce using the .net compact-framework

879722
contains	elements
assume the buffer contains 4 elements

879728
contains	elements
i often have to deal with xml documents that contains namespaced elements but doesn t declare the namespace

879756
defined	declare
in c# you use struct to defined value types as opposed to reference-type declare by class es

879790
.when	ready
i ve always used coomponent.addnotify to know .when the component is ready to be rendered.not sure if is the the best way but it works for me

879802
directory	folder
for example if you create a grouping in in the project at the root of the project named foo this creates a reference to a container foo that is managed by the project settings it does not create a folder named foo in the root directory where your applications exists in the filesystems

879823
silverlight	wpf
if i recall correctly they only had support for generating .net code so silverlight and possibly wpf xbap applications were it

879825
webforms	asp.net
for example in asp.net webforms i developed a sort of blogging app

879825
order	add
in order to install this app i just need to drop a dll into the bin folder add a few web.config lines and then add controls to the aspx pages as needed

879825
asp.net-mvc	webforms
now i m working with asp.net-mvc and i ve come across partial views which seem to replace webforms usercontrols in some way

879834
perforce	cvs
all source control systems i know at least perforce svn cvs have a server component and a protocol of their own

879834
version-control	git
you can exchange files via http ftp but if you want version-control you will need a server running a vcs software such as subversion git or mercurial

879842
value	field
i have a selected list which is being populate using the value from a text field

879842
selected	button
i also have two button an add button which adds the entered value to the selected list and a remove button which removes the entered value from the selected list

879842
selected	button
if the value entered into the text field is not available in the selected list show the add button and hide the remove button

879842
selected	button
if the value entered into the text field is available in the selected list hide the add button and show the remove button

879842
selected	button
if the selected list is empty show the add button and hide the remove button

879842
selected	button
still not hiding the button when no value in the selected

879846
webforms	asp.net
plug-in hybrids asp.net webforms and asp.mvc and asp.net dynamic data side by side

879898
extends	final
the asp.net-mvc 1.0 final project templates has basic membership built-in but i need to extends it in two ways

879898
webforms	asp.net
i have found many articles that somewhat apply such as this one at aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com but trying to implement an asp.net webforms tutorial within asp.net mvc could be a waste of time if there is a better way to get started or an implementation already in asp.net mvc that closely fits my needs

879914
type-safety	generics
it s safer and simpler using the java generics since the compiler can do the checks for you to verify that you maintain compile -time type-safety

879920
webforms	asp.net
in the march preview we are offering a asp domaindatasource control that enables very easy asp.net webforms access to your domain logic

879931
terminate	timeout
if the read fails due to timeout you can then safely terminate the proxy without risking the health of your application

879943
jquery	.post
what happens when you request the url directly from a browser without the jquery .post call like so

879943
jquery	.post
that generates a get request instead of the post request generated by the jquery .post method -- but the action method parameters should be populated nonetheless

879949
linked-list	arrays
what about a function to remove an element from a linked-list in an arrays of linked-lists or a function to remove an element from a linked-list in an arrays of arrayss of link.

879950
firefox	opera
you can try various browsers in some order -- firefox opera etc etc

879960
value	field
as the value for the list are stored in the database and returned as is to other featurs such as the search web-crawler a dynamic field cannot be created

879960
value	field
it is possible to create a custom field that will display the value using todays date in its calculation

879962
shutdown	daemon
you could argue that this is backwards â after all shutdown 8 kills the daemon processes â but the jvm should act like a well-behaved process otherwise which means people should be able to expect it to terminate without having to be killed

879970
contains	set
remember though that smalltalk has a very different picture of the world than the other usual languages the only other common one like smalltalk was apl. you have an image that contains the whole set of code and runtime package

879973
protected	public
wire the timer s elapsed event to a public or protected internal tick event

879974
visualworks	squeak
it also depends of smalltalk dialect - in visualworks for instances tools supports overrides quite well while in squeak not so

879976
file-descriptor	pipe
yes you can use isatty 3 to tell if a file-descriptor refers to the terminal or to something else file pipe etc.

879976
file-descriptor	stdin
file-descriptor 0 is stdin 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

879989
firefox	safari
these images are not displayed in ie6 but are displayed in firefox safari etc.

879991
silverlight	wpf
jaime rodriguez has a very good post covering the key differences and features of both silverlight and wpf here

879991
silverlight	wpf
it s very high level and meant to differentiate between features that a wpf and silverlight out-of-browser application bring to the table

880015
integrated-security	connection-string
as you specify integrated-security sspi in connection-string than i guess you expect impersonating

880016
order	join
this forces the join optimizer to join the tables in the exact order specified in the query

880038
jquery	.post
then from your login button s click event you can use jquery ajax to .post the username password to the webservice

880039
sql-server	sqlcommand
sqlconnection and sqlcommand is specific to sql-server

880050
subclass	accessor
how about creating your own subclass of propertyplaceholderconfigurer that would keep a reference to the its properties object and provide an accessor

880058
contains	set
also you could use the base class idea to contains a dictionary that maps property to text field and just set it up in the derived class.

880065
widget	button
generate a button link that send the needed info quantity and widget id to an add-to-cart.php

880070
any	set
assuming the answers to these questions are yes then what we want to build is something that divides all the words in the language into sets of synonyms so we then can map any word in each set to all the other words in that set

880070
any	set
the token can be anything as long as its unique for any given set of synonyms like a sequence number

880081
put	get
i ve tried adding a runat server attribuite to each asp linkbutton tag but i get a runtime exception-handling that controls can only be put inside a form tag with the runat server attributes

880084
directory	folder
i m guessing you ll need to create some symbolic links aliases in your root directory to the public folder of each application

880095
any	set
and that will mean that any serialization of that instance that does not specify its own set of prefix+uri pairs will use the p prefix for the urn mycompany.2009 namespace

880099
output	cat
b nb lessquote appears to match my cat -v output

880102
contains	any
answer d returns a list that can contains type t or any of its subclasses

880102
assign	add
with the one can safely assign the elements of the list to a variables of type t and can add elements of type t to the list assuming it s a modifiable list implementation

880106
webforms	asp.net
unfortunately asp.net mvc does not support webforms controls right now

880116
primitive	int
this compares only the ids - a primitive type like a int or a guid - and this can be transformed into sql

880116
toupper	tolower
noted that the entity-framework recognizes toupper tolower and contains and some more - so i was to strict when i said that the entity-framework does not recognize methods calls

880116
toupper	tolower
further this query translates into charindex function calls using the collation of the column hence the search can be case insensitive without explicit toupper or tolower calls

880141
hash	md5
my current thought is to use a string with something like an md5 hash of the type name and member types and names

880145
any	set
remember that whenever you call getvisit you get a new instance if there isn t any so you need to set a property in your visit object to see if the session is valid

880147
export	report
i have seen this quite a lot if people tend to export the report a lot i remove all of the formatting from it limit the number of grouping you can drill down into and do as bill says and make sure you have no overlapping controls

880152
any	set
it also occurs if i set any background other than #ffffff

880173
benchmarking	profiling
i m with chas benchmarking and profiling your code first

880181
directory	folder
turns out you just plant the editors directory tree into your primary working folder or wherever and edit the include functions php to link the editor files to your own project files

880189
any	set
i ve seen numerous apps do this - the only example i can think of at present is cha-ching before you have any budgets etc set up

880189
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
i initially added a navigationcontroller to the main windows s xib the rootviewcontroller of which was a custom viewcontroller xib

880219
teamcity	gallio
gallio now has an extension to output teamcity service messages

880221
versioning	staging
we have a local staging server running sql-server 2000 and a remote public versioning also running sql-server 2000

880221
versioning	upgrade
the remote versioning will be upgrade to 2005 and i am wondering if the dts packages we have in place will continue to function between the two machines

880244
any	set
originally a string could be a set of any kind of values but since in the post-mainframe era a string of characters is by far the most common kind the fact that the values are characters became a default

880278
compatibility	legacy
note however that there are other entry points for opening files - eg fopen openat or one of the many legacy compatibility entry points

880284
registration	login
i am writing a web app servlet jsp on tomcat and wanted to know best practices experiences for user management login and registration

880291
pixels	line
the image data is returned in the format of a data32 32-bit per pixels in a linear arrays order from the top left of the image to the bottom right going from left to right each line

880293
value	field
i m looking to return a csv formatted string to set the value of a input text field with the option values from a selected box

880293
value	field
also does not update the hidden text field with the csv value

880307
value	field
if you re dealing with float value it s best to have them as an attributes instead of a field

880310
postgresql	mysql
move to a real database such as postgresql or mysql

880314
any	set
if you start changing any colours you ll need to set at least a color background-color and border

880319
sqrt	sin
if you successfully read a string pass that to a function name parsing that uses string compares to generate a token that represents a call to sqrt or sin or whatever function you like

880340
any	set
if you use three20 you can easily set any image you want as a place holder prior to your table being populated

880359
benchmarking	profiling
if it is profiling your code and benchmarking your changes

880370
contains	any
in your case it looks like your xml file doesn t contains any text other than whitespace which isn t in an attributes value

880384
factorization	primes
can you think of a recursive definition for the primes factorization that doesn t have that property

880390
disconnect	transfer
i need to connect and disconnect usb programmatically that is i have inserted the usb device i need to transfer the file using c# .net application the application will watch the particular folder and transfer the file from that folder to usb drive

880390
disconnect	transfer
i need to disconnect the usb after the file is transfer and connect the usb when needed

880391

i have the redirect working but the problem is that if i do a post put delete firebug shows my requests going to the test rig properly but i get a 301 redirect response and then a 2nd get response

880392
radio-button	button
if the value in the database is 1 the customer status should show the active radio-button else show the inactive button

880397
servicecontract	datacontract
so you should instead create a datacontract class that has no behavior associated with it then expose that in your servicecontract

880403
selected	cells
on the cells of the table so that the indicator is displayed to indicate to the user that if they selected the row they can edit it.

880420
dojo	gwt
a simple form builder shouldn t be too hard to program using gwt dojo or your-favorite-js-library if you want to go that route

880460
.when	ready
.when the connection is open and ready then i can send commands to the proxy

880463
boolean	int
i m using a database with generic data strings int boolean etc...

880464
value	field
so maybe you change the statuses to reflect new activity you check the box a text field appears for the reason and then you hit update and it passes the value to a server-side scripting that stores the new info without having to submit a for for the entire customer sheet

880473
sqrt	sin
i thought a map of strings to function-pointers might be a concise way to represent things like sqrt sin cos etc that take a single double and return a double

880474
updating	updates
i am wondering if it is possible to avoid the lost updates problem where multiple threads are updating the same date while avoiding using

880491
linux	aix
i m a c programmer with lots of server code experience aix hpux some linux i need to write a gui program for windows 2000 xp vista 7 which requires cad-like drawing functions and lots of data entry forms it s a specialised engineering app

880494
javascript	dom
a functional dom centric approach or an object oriented javascript approach

880495
defined	declare
the problem is i ve declare the class in the .h file and defined the implementation in the .cpp file but i can t figure out how to get it to compile and work when i try to compile the test file i wrote

880517
fflush	stdout
fflush stdout

880527
delphi	c++
if you must use native code then i would strongly suggest rad studio from codegear embarcadero it s a studio product that ships with delphi the object oriented language that evolved from turbo pascal and c++ builder if you are already familiar with c c++ then it s going to be very simple for you to pick it up

880528
visual-studio	release-mode
i am trying to get the same code executing on visual-studio 2005 and unfortunately the udp client only seems to work in the debug mode and not in release-mode

880570
udp	tcp
i used tcp in one project udp in the other one

880598
windows-xp	windows
it is a built-in component on windows vista so you don t have to package the runtime with your program installer unless you have to support windows-xp which you probably do so never mind

880604
arrays	map
presumably you want the key to the map to match on the value of the elements instead of the identity of the arrays

880611
children	nodes
each child of root is a single first letter of a possible word children of those being the second letter of a possible word etc. with each nodes marked as to whether it actually forms a word or not

880611
append	input
it starts with zero letters finds from the tree of valid entries that isn t a word but it does have children so you call your tester recursively with your start word of no letters append with each available remaining letter from your input string which is all of them at that point

880612
user-interface	drawing
_why has written shoes mostly on top of cairo which is what recent versions of gtk use for widget drawing also so it appears he purposely stepped back to the core of user-interface design and created a different framework from the ground up for a solidly different reason than one would use gtk for

880635
click	mouse
on my trackpad your code works perfectly fine but i guess thats because it s awfully hard to move the mouse between click

880638
python	php
php mod_wsgi python etc

880643
virtual-functions	member-functions
for example if memory is your tightest constraint you can just use c++ like c with classes -- that is only using direct member-functions disabling rtti and not having any virtual-functions or templates

880652
authentication	login
at certain stages in the gui app control is handed off to a different class for example the main control swaps from the login screen to the data entry screen once the user authentication

880663
gnu-smalltalk	squeak
so can anyone either provide or point me towards a list or set of what features classes are or are not compatible between squeak and gnu-smalltalk

880680
imap	nntp
since you noted that the isp requires authentication via pop-before-smtp you should look into using something like phpmailer which can facilitate this kind of integration - or roll your own using the php functions for pop which happen to be exactly the same as the ones for imap and nntp

880684
filtering	grouping
it gives you filtering by staff status and superuser status but what about grouping

880697
callback	methods
then you implement the observer callback methods

880698
beautifulsoup	lxml
beautifulsoup is good but not super-fast and i believe lxml can offer the same quality but often better performance

880702
factors	primes
note that the original question asked for all the factors not for only the primes factors

880702
factors	primes
there being many fewer primes factors they can probably be found more quickly

880704
any	set
turn on display_errors and set your error_reporting to e_all and you should see an error message about headers already sent - you have to call setcookie before any html is sent

880704
contains	set
your two possibilities would be to use output buffering so that you output everything at the very end or to switch to a methods where all of your processing code is executed first in one scripting and there you set _session and cookie values and then include a second scripting at the tail end of the first that contains the code to be output to the browser

880713
emacs	vim
what vim features did you miss in emacs and more importantly how did you get them back

880720
jquery	dojo
if by from scratch you mean you don t want to just skin previously existing widgets i would start by picking a javascript framework that met your specs jquery dojo aria etc. and then seeing if they can stretch as far as you can push them

880725
sftp	ftps
it has comprehensive support for sftp and also supports ftps and of course ftp if required

880737
ftps	ftp
also has ftp and ftps

880745
sftp	ssh
sftp is actually another protocol that runs over ssh - an extension of ssh if you like

880745
sftp	ftp
people tend to use sftp rather than tunnelling ftp over ssh

880748
arrays	loops
the template tag get_the_tags returns an arrays of all of the tags associated with the post currently in-context within the loops

880754
exception-handling	try-catch
if you already have a try-catch block where you think the exception-handling is occurring it will be trapped at that point

880758
beautifulsoup	lxml
if you want a faster option then use try catch to attempt an lxml or etree parsing first then try beautifulsoup and or tidylib to parsing broken html if the parsingr fails

880768
mousedown	mouseup
on mouseup nullify the mousedown coordinates to indicate there is no rect and repaint

880773
textbox	button
ok so i have a listview on one form and when a button is pressed it opens up a new form with the contents of the selected listview item and it s subitems in a series of textbox

880783
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

880792
implements	final
to implements this feature when you click the dom would need to be able to predict whether this is the final click or whether it s the first of a double-click however i don t think is possible in general for the dom to predict whether the user is about to click again

880799
selected	checkbox
what happens if you need to change your checkbox arrays to a selected element instead

880804
annotations	mapping
in particular it will do reverse engineering the most powerful feature of hibernate tools is a database reverse engineering tool that can generate domain model classes and hibernate mapping files annotations ejb3 entity beans html documentation or even an entire seam application in seconds

880821
beautifulsoup	lxml
i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now

880833
uiswitch	uibutton
uibutton doesn t do that and uiswitch is hideously ugly for all but the most utilitarian views

880846
highlight	selected
uibutton has an extremely rich set of options built in for images including highlight and selected images that will draw automatically with user integration

880879
order	add
i haven t been able to put the columns in order myself but with ruby-on-rails you can rollback alter the old migration file to add the new columns in the order you want then re-migrate up the old migration including the new field

880892
order	add
the basic idea behind the ran1 algorithm is to add a shuffle to the output of the random number generator to reduce low order serial correlations

880895
moss	wss
apply the wss bits then reapply the bits for moss then run the configuration wizard and bring everything back

880905
json	xml
if you re concerned about sending too much data substitute json for xml

880936
margins	padding
my first guess would be either padding or margins on your li elements

880938
python	ruby
python is a general purpose programming language much like ruby

880943
lookup	any
the dynamic part of the system-generated note would screw up any lookup that we perform on the phrase if we stored the phrase in english less the dynamic text

880955
firefox	safari
tested and working in ie8 firefox and safari win

880966
filtering	sorting
alternatively find a plug-in that has sorting accomplished but also generates simple markup so you can extend it with your own filtering

880976
jeditable	jquery
works with rails 2.2.2 and 2.3.2 w jeditable 1.7.0 and jrails 0.4 though jrails doesn t play much interaction here other than providing the includes for jquery 1.5

881011
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the reason being is asp.net-mvc removes webforms from the stack

881011
asp.net-mvc	webforms
whereas rhino igloo or castle igloo as well provide asp.net-mvc style separation ontop of the webforms model

881011
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you aren t already engaged with entlib and still want asp.net-mvc mvp webforms definately give it a look

881024
duplicates	contains
that will prevent you from inserting a record that contains a duplicates category_id post_id pair

881032
form-submit	onchange
anyway the key is to use the form-submit instead of using the onchange event which is known not to fire when invoked with javascript anyway

881038
maya	mel
probably not the most general purpose example but i learned python when autodesk maya adopted it as a secondary programming language to complement mel maya expression language

881073
class-variables	accessor
constants should use the ruby constants feature not a class-variables with an accessor as markjeee suggested

881112
push	pull
pull all commits from a branch push specified commits to another where

881116
instances	destroy
what i m wanting to do is have the new process own that last instances so when the user closes vs with the close x button it will destroy the com object

881138
external	embed
i want to use the object tag to embed an html file that uses external style sheets .

881143
interpolation	splines
i have a nice cubic splines code but it is for interpolation only

881144
checkbox	button
i have a html form that contains text fields checkbox radiobuttons and a submit button

881144
value	field
now here is the catch if the user modifies field contents back to original value the form button should be disabled again

881144
value	field
original field value foo submit button is disabled

881144
value	field
user changes field value to bar submit button becomes enabled

881144
value	field
user changes field value back to foo submit button becomes disabled again

881155
ip-address	proxy
is it possible to track a users ip-address who using proxy website

881158
cvs	git
i intend to switch over from cvs to git

881158
cvs	git
is there a similar tool to easily migrate from cvs to git

881185
cvs	git
i ve not tried this myself but friends have reported good success converting first from cvs to svn and then from svn to git

881185
cvs	git
it seems that the tools to do those respective transitions have been more thoroughly shaken out than a direct cvs to git transition

881187
checkbox	button
as pointed out in the comments this would allow the user to deselect all checkbox even if they chose one initially which isn t exactly like radio button

881188
checkbox	button
it has been designed this way and from a user perspective radio button mean select one and checkbox mean select many

881188
checkbox	button
user interfaces work because the metaphors used checkbox button the shape of the mouse pointer colors etc. are and behave a certain way

881202
textbox	button
now i have a form which has lots of button which call huge number crunching functions whose output i update in a textbox

881202
textbox	button
i call the textbox.begininvoke method to which i pass a delegate to the function which updates the text in the textbox however when the text is huge the form is non responsive as i can t click on the cancel button

881208
double-quotes	single-quotes
although as bill karwin notes below using double-quotes for string delimiters isn t standard sql so it s good practice to use single-quotes

881211
interpolation	splines
generally for splines interpolation you use a variables t to interpolate over the line

881218
push	pull
subversion and git are both free and have a variety of different ways that you can connect and push pull checkin checkout data

881230
cvs	git
i know how i would do this in cvs but i m a bit new to git and could use some suggestions

881249
interpolation	splines
splines are usually used for interpolation of some unknown or complex function by using of some fixed data set

881249
interpolation	splines
if you want to have ability to evaluate your splines outside of interpolation range but leave it as piecewise-cubic function with the same value inside of interpolation range then you should extend splines range by some nodes and add some logic of evaluation value at the new nodes for example you want to have your splines be not only a continuous function but also have some number of first derivatives be also continuous functions

881271
serialization	marshalling
the boost serialization library can be used to marshalling data into a binary form as well as text

881275
put	get
i ll pass this onto the team and see if we can get some more examples put online around this space

881277
native-code	unmanaged
is unmanaged code is native-code

881292
tablelayoutpanel	datagridview
rather than use a datagridview how about using a tablelayoutpanel instead

881315
delphi	c++
you can do in delphi exactly what you would do in c++

881315
contains	any
tpacket had better not contains any compiler-managed types like string variant iunknown or dynamic-array types

881322
git-repo	repo
i am not 100 sure how this works but you can create a git-repo for you common code say led and user-interface or even one repo for each and include a copy of this repo as a submodule of your repo for a and another copy as a submodule of the repo for b

881351
type-conversion	int
the default model binder will add some errors for basic type-conversion issues for example passing a non-number for something which is an int

881355
value	field
the first basically represents the virtual column and contains information such as the field name and type of value expected

881358
constructor	object
in fact void has no public constructor and so cannot be instantiated you can never have any object of type void except for the polymorphic null

881393
textbox	button
the user-interface of a finder dialog is simple textbox datagridview result ok button cancel button

881415
daemons	systemd
according to advanced programming in the unix environment by stephens and rago the second fork is more a recommendation and it is done to guarantee that the daemons does not acquire a controlling terminal on systemd v-based systemds

881422
loading	gif
ability to load these small portlets or entities asynchronously with loading progress gif

881446
compact-framework	.net

881453
http	ssl
etc with normal http or http over ssl ssl being preferred if the app is not inhouse use only even if it is i would think about using ssl

881483
directory	folder
if for some reason your breakpoints are not hit then go and delete your bin obj directory and also your mobile deployment folder some times vs gets stucked.

881545

i am running ubuntu 8.10 and i thought at first i could modify the etc hosts but i now understand i cannot include port numbers

881550
contains	elements
the project file contains one or more non-standard import elements

881550
contains	elements
the project file contains one or more usingtask elements

881554
getter	setter
important if you do not specify either synthesize or dynamic for a particular property you must provide a getter and setter or just a getter in the case of a readonly property methods implementation for that property.

881554
defined	declare
in other words if you declare a property but don t synthesize the property you won t be able to use self myproperty or self.myproperty unless you defined myproperty and setmyproperty methods

881555
children	nodes
if you only need to match the table s children first match the nodes you want and then match its descendants

881575
contains	any
to allow ssrs to refresh the cached data navigate to the directory which contains your design-time rdl file and delete any files which have the extension .data

881582
shell	bash
cd is usually built-in in the shell you should just look at the code of any shell bash or ash

881582
command-line	cmd
the cd cmd should be ultimately based on the chdir function but if you re interested in all the cmd-line expansions then the source is the shell

881585
value	field
the extension gets the value of field using javascript

881590
any	set
could you please be me and propose the set of new technologies that you think is the best and also propose some resources in case the developers don t know about these technologies and any thing else that we might wanna consider during that transition

881594
chdir	cmd
the cd unix cmd just calls chdir and examines the error codes

881619
32-bit	64bit
it s not a direct answer but i think there is a way to load a 32-bit dll into a 64bit app

881619
32-bit	64bit
also some changes will be necessary on the 64bit side as the consumer must use one of the ipc techniques instead of directly accessing the 32-bit dll

881619
32-bit	64bit
it is worth noting that in extreme cases this additional work could be comparable to the work involved in developing a 64bit version of the 32-bit dll from scratch

881619
32-bit	64bit
one possible way of reducing these costs is to implement a 64bit wrapper dll that exposes the same functions parameters types and so forth as the original 32-bit dll

881636
gethashcode	equals
there s no simple way for a single lambda to express the information needed for both equals and gethashcode

881636
gethashcode	equals
and if you provide a gethashcode that returns different hash for equals elements that will cause incorrect behavior

881637
windows-mobile	windows-ce
i am just starting off windows oem development and have come across these two terms windows-ce and windows-mobile

881659
python	java
to run python on any java platform

881670
windows-mobile	windows-ce
windows-mobile is best described as a subset of platforms based on a windows-ce underpinning

881670
windows-mobile	windows-ce
so as i understand it windows-ce is more of a real windows for mobile devices while windows-mobile is somewhat trimmed down and targeted at those with less cpu power and memory

881675
foundation	cocoa
you will find an overview of both foundation class hierarchy and application kit class hierarchy grouping by topics in the cocoa fundamentals guide

881682
installation	upgrade
you should put all of your own plugins into vimfiles to make sure that when you upgrade your vim installation you don t lose any of the custom plugins or modifications

881682
versioning	upgrade
if you were to instead change vim72 syntax cpp.vim when you next upgrade vim these files would be overwrite by the new versioning and any changes that you made would be lost

881687
windows-mobile	windows-ce
windows-ce relationship to windows-mobile pocket pc and smartphone

881690
callback	methods
i also provide a callback methods to show the result as an alert

if you want to add the children to the currently selected nodes get the treeview.selectednodes and add the children to it

881788
external	embed
to embed external html files in your page use iframes not object

881807
safari	opera
pushing an eventqueue and checking through events doesn t work of opera and safari apparently

881814
shell	bash
i would expect bash to be the widest spread shell at the moment since it is the default for many linux distributions it can even run on windows with cygwin but that s probably true for the other shells too

881814
perl	ruby
an alternative might be to not use the shell itself for scripting but one of the scriping languages out there like perl python ruby .

881815
pascal	delphi
icarus parsing delphi or borland pascal source code and generates a uses report

881825

now i need to generate a report that prints off one page for each set and each set s page contains a list of its bjorks

881857
json	xml
configurations can be handled by xml or json files

881864

is there a button or a quick way to edit one of the returned rows instead of having to right mouse click on the table again and click edit first 200 rows

881925
linux	bsd
i have been reading books on operating systems tannenbaum as well as studying how bsd and linux have tackled this challenge but still am stuck on several concepts

881925
linux	bsd
from what i can tell bsd and linux at best only support a maximum of a dozen of cores

881927
firefox	safari
this works pretty well on firefox ie7 safari etc .

881966
constructor	private
however after making copy constructor and assignment operators private it fails to compile with the following error error â foo foo const foo â is private

881966
copy-constructor	constructor
how comes it needs a copy-constructor if it only calls standard constructor at runtime

881968
contains	set
in other words a char has to be at least big enough to contains an encoding of at least the 95 different characters which make up the basic execution character set

881970
solaris	linux
it s there or a compatible version is available on most linux boxes and solaris

881971
constructor	private
note that the compiler may choose to optimise away the copy constructor call but the copy constructor must still be available i.e not private

881983
unpack	chr
alternatively unpack together with chr will also work

881985
any	set
my intention for the resource access layer is to expose a set of well defined c# methods to any c# .net 3.5 client on the lan and allow the client to access data stored in the dbms without having any knowledge of how the data is being accessed

881985
.net	wcf
however with the arrival of .net 3.5 and wcf there are many more options

881985
windows-vista	windows
all platforms on the lan are either windows-vista or windows server 2008 all have .net 3.5 installed

881995
value	field
maybe this field doesn t allow null in db get a default-value for it and avoid handling null value

882006
solaris	aix
there are no significant differences between the linux solaris and aix distributions whereas porting shell scripts between these platforms is a real pain

882010
long-integer	integer
create a table called sequence with an integer access long-integer and populate it with values 1 to 20 20 row table

882015
streamreader	streamwriter
and now i m interfacting it with c# where when i enter a text in the textbox it is passed through the redirect standardinput a streamwriter to the program and to read the output i call it s standardoutput a streamreader .readtoend

882023
linux	osx
is this something that differs on windows linux and osx

882057
stderr	stdout
you might use the fact that stderr is never buffering and try to redirect stdout to stderr

882063
json	xml
if you are using ruby-on-rails and json and xml than you are using http

882063
json	xml
if your server is sending data i would recommend putting a path to the file on the server in the xml or json

882063
json	xml
the client will send the xml or json message with filetobeuploaded name of file.ext and after sending the message will post the data with the aforementioned filename

rollback	commit
my goal is to complete the first big while-loop and at the end using a bool variables as flag decide if to rollback or commit the transaction

882151
linked-list	queue
there is one common use case in which linked-list outperforms arraylist that of a queue

882151
linked-list	queue
however if your goal is performance instead of linked-list you should also consider using an arrayblockingqueue if you can determine an upper bound on your queue size ahead of time and can afford to allocate all the memory up front or this circulararraylist implementation

882164
webserver	upload
i upload stats using a simple c# app on a clients server using https to our webserver

882188
any	set
generally you set the spfield.readonlyfield property to true to achieve the desired behaviour for any field

882211
versioning	migrate
in your new server instance you would be able to move over a copy of the latest versioning of files from versioning-control and migrate your work items by taking the new versioning of the process templates and putting in the fields that you need and then adding the data for the current work items i usually use excel to do a bulk import

882239
assign	add
i attempt to assign a newly created parent object here or use an existing but that works fine but i get an error when it tries to add the id of the parent object to the child s table

882254
json	xml
responding with data in format x json jsonp xml yaml ml etc. is not presentation so you don t need templates

882262
msbuild	nant
with that being said are there any guidelines or best practices for writing good tasks for build managers like nant ant or msbuild

882266
getter	setter
i don t think you can tell jpa which naming convention to use for getter and setter since it s a basic java beans concept

882268
shared-libraries	dynamic-linking
if you are dependant on a particular distros shared-libraries then you have no choice but to use dynamic-linking

882270
sql-server	firebird
first let me point out that i m no firebird expert so i m answering on the basis of how sql-server works

882271
jquery	.post
basically what you want to do is to make a jquery .post request to the server with the contents of your form

882356
ccavenue	paypal
if transaction fails on paypal page or ccavenue page then how can i rollback all processing in php

882377

882491
versioning	upgrade
is there a newer versioning of perl you can upgrade to

882500

882558
checkbox	button
note that nowhere does anything beyond the user-interface interface knows about button checkbox and the like

882572
executable	jar
both are programs that create executables that wrap jar s and the jre together so that to the end user it appears no different then any other executable

882594
callback	methods
i can t find a success callback for the validation plugins so i think you are stuck using the submithandler methods

882595
delegation	dealloc
in fact if you are implements dealloc as you should to tidy up myobject having the delegation send a release message to the object at itemproperty will mean that the itemproperty objects gets release twice which will leave itemproperty s retain count in an unexpected state and may cause it to be deallocated early

882595
delegation	dealloc
on the other hand if you don t tidy up memory in dealloc you run into a situation where you are relying on having the delegation being called to ensure that memory is properly managed

882598
silverlight	wpf
visulisation v speed wpf silverlight v webforms and grids

882605
google-chrome	firefox
how to check if specific web browser google-chrome firefox opera is installed on system

but you should consider fowler s table data gateway pattern where you package all the access to each table in its own class of static-methods and use a standards naming convention

882726
order	add
does anyone know how to add an item to a list but do it so it s order alphabetically using jquery

882737
uitableview	uiview
for the first you can change the uitableview s property tablefooterview to be a custom uiview to which you add your two or three uibuttons

882743
children	nodes
this function would write each nodes in a section and then if a nodes has children it would call itself to write those children

882759
spring	grails
you can try doing the admin interface as a seperate app to the original existing spring app and map the existing database to the grails domain objects

882764
c++	lua
given that a project i have in mind would be better served by the grammar already expressed in rake it s a rules engine is there any easy way to embed rake in a c++ app or is there a rake-like module for lua

882769
arrays	loops
finally if you want to put those in constants you could loops over the arrays and use define to define the constants

882785
stderr	stdout
after calling start you ll get a process object from which you can get the stderr and stdout streams

882785
stderr	stdout
especially the ability to redirect stderr to stdout which means you only have to suck down one stream

882788
cvs	git
bazaar bzr cvs git hg mercurial rcs scm svn subversion vcs scm vcs popularity survey statistics

882794

882850
directory	folder
is there a way to use the application s folder as the current directory

882872
click	mouse
the form will not be visible at least on my machine at 1 i couldn t see it at all and you ll still be able to capture all mouse click

882919
arrays	loops
in another loops over this arrays you can define them as constants

882949
hide	show
you can use a javascript library to show hide that html based on if a user as silverlight install

882954
integer	digits
additionally each integer need not contain the same number of digits

882954
integer	zero
my initial approach i converted each integer to its string format then added zero to its right to make all the integers contain the same number of digits this was the messy step as it involved tracking etc making the solution very inefficient and then did radix sort

882978
bufferedimage	graphics2d
you can create a bufferedimage call creategraphics in case a graphics2d is expected and pass the result to the paint graphics methods of the component that you want to capture

882989
document-ready	.when
normally you attach all your jquery goodness in a document-ready or onload event .when the page initially loads

882989
ready	live
there is a new ish feature in jquery that means you can still set everything up in document ready called live but you may find it simpler just to call the hookup code in your ajax success handler

882990
document	element
document type does not allow element div here

883001
children	nodes
i d like to display a dom nodes tree in a browser with collapsable children

883007
string-conversion	int
my temptation would be to say that the int to string-conversion would happen in the comparitor code rather than in bulk

883032
dictionary	arrays
plain nsobjects in arrays s or dictionary

883046
textbox	button
i have a dropdownlist and a textbox with a button on a form

883046
selectedindexchanged	onclientclick
when a button is click it does not go to my onclientclick even in the code but it goes to my dropdownlist s selectedindexchanged event

883055
webforms	asp.net
i think you ve stumbled across one of the defining differences between asp.net mvc and webforms

883070
integer	zero
i converted each integer to its string format then added zero to its right to make all the integers contain the same number of digits

883072
meta-inf	jar
ensure that the ejb-jar.xml is in the meta-inf of the jar that your ejbs are in not the ear s meta-inf

883082
implements	extends
one convenient possibility is for a custom rendering to extends jcomponent and implements tablecellrendering then in tablecellrendering.gettablecellrenderingcomponent you store the cell s state and return this

883088
compatibility	platform
listen for example xhtml validity and css cleanliness is so hard that there is a lot of people who focuses only on this while lot of browsers and platform compatibility on mind

883119
ruby	php
going further with the ideal you should technically be able to replace asp with php java ruby etc as the controller without touching the model or view

883131
stateless	stateful
what happens if an ejb3 stateless stateful bean no arguments constructor throws an exception-handling

883156
nonblocking	epoll
whilst asynchronous io nonblocking descriptors with selected poll epoll kqueue etc is not the most documented thing on the web there are a handful of good examples

883160
append	input
the mark allen comment on the other thread is suggesting that instead of append your new cloned input which ie doesn t give the selected file property to the other form you replace the old input with the new input which looks proper and then you put the old input on your upload form

883177
imagemagick	libtiff
ghostscript and imagemagick convert should also be able to do this for you although libtiff is supposedly quicker

883177
ghostscript	imagemagick
for your second requirement ghostscript imagemagick or nconvert can output pdf files as tiffs

883186
contains	set
or you can set a plain old height big enough to contains your flash piece on one of your containser items and let the others inherit from that

883191
templating	mako
the views are just html files with bits of html and css with some templating engine smarty mako etc code to display the data passed to it the way you want

883205
environment	building
edit i am using windows environment variables right now but would prefer something that did not require setup outside of just downloading the code and building it

883232
any	set
it would take as long to set up a parsing for c without any functionality

883247
javascript	dom
your source isn t changed by javascript but the dom is

883271
base-class	inherited
either in the base-class or a class that inherited it

883289
attributes	properties
the xmlserializationr does not store type information and if the object changes a bit it just does not fail but the xmlserializationr can not serialization private or internal properties from a super class i can not mark with attributes

883293
lotus	ibm
a lotus notes installation domino 7x which ends up trying to start a ibm sametime 7.5.1 chat client fails on some machines

883296
shell	bash
on unix if you are launching from a shell sript at least for bash and possibly for other decent shells you can use

883296
windows-vista	windows
shortcuts in windows won t do the trick but windows-vista 7 supports symlinks using mklink

883322
linux	unix
also python for unix and linux system adminitration

883327
internet-explorer	firefox
duplicate button inside of anchor link works in firefox but not in internet-explorer

883359
methods	extend
extend a methods like .gettrustgrid so you can get the same type you need

883367
double	int
however it is possible to perform typecasts so it is possible to cast a int type which are int values to a double type a floating type value

883371
registration	login
i ve taken a look at the stackoverflow question password encryption database layer aes or app layer aes and i d like to effectively and efficiently hash my passwords on registration web app and then be able to check they are correct on login

883395
datagrid	textbox
a wpf form has a textbox and a wpf toolkig datagrid

883405
factors	primes
primefactors is the simple repeated trial-division algorithm it walks through the list of primes and tries dividing the given number by each recording the factors as it goes

883405
factors	primes
multiplyprimes takes a list of primes and powers and explodes it back out to a full list of factors

883411
hash	md5
then you hash that say with md5 though you might want to use sha256 to be more secure to get 593d5518d759b4860188158ef4c71f28

883433
inherited	subclass
for finer-grained testing of exception-handling you need to roll your own with a try except else block you can do it once and for all in a def assertdetailedraises methods you add to your own generic subclass of unittest s test-case then have your test cases all inherited your subclass instead of unittest s

883434
filtering	grouping
this should also address if a user applies a filtering on the report you may or may not have given them this option. on a field other than the grouping

883473
defined	declare
traditionally what you d do is defined a category something like interface myclass myclass_private inside the implementation file that declare the private methods

883477
xsd	xml
the delphi 2009 xml data binding wizard fails to process a simple xsd which contains a complexcontent declaration invalid pointer operation

883483
hash	md5
however there s one more problem and that s that generating md5 hash is fast

883483
hash	md5
so the next step is to find a slow hash function and use this instead of a fast one like md5

883498
execution	exit
is is possible to make a wxframe object behave like a modal-dialog box in that the windows creating the wxframe object stops execution until the wxframe object exit

883505
updating	updates
you can updates parts of your content without updating the root but interoperability becomes hairy

883507
execution	exit
last and not least if the data in config.inc.php is required for common.php to work i suggest you switching to require_once instead as that will cause a call to exit or die in case the file fails to be include hence stopping further execution

883510
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve built nib in interface builder that has uitabbarcontroller at top level and switches between uinavigationcontroller s

883530
getter	setter
accessors and mutators getter and setter are expected to be very lighting weight

883531
click	mouse
so in this case a test recording tool is helpful as it can collect the mouse click and mouse actions the users do

883538
google-docs	spreadsheet
i am having a issue using google s sdc secure data connector with my google app engine application my app is unable to get data from within my network but using a google-docs spreadsheet i can get the data

883541
lazy-evaluation	maybe
lazy-evaluation-loading is fine as long as the lazy-evaluation load isn t going to take some insanely long amount of time and sometimes making things properties is really useful for reflection- and data-binding-related reasons so maybe you ll want to bend this rule

883544
blacklist	whitelist
this plugins allows various constraints upon the data using regular expression whitelist blacklist characters etc

883544
for-loop	arrays
even though arr is an empty arrays the for-loop assigns a valid value to i

883544
if-statement	for-loop
i corrected the error by adding an if-statement around the for-loop as follows

883558
arrays	loops
you should never use for i in arr to loops over arrays

883558
arrays	loops
if scripts add methods to the arrays prototype these too will be iterated using the for i in arr loops

883562
javascript	dom
i m trying to write a javascript function that adds some dom nodes to the document in the place it was called like this

883563
order	add
udp has no quality of service guarantee so when sending your packets of data you will need to add some sort of order number to your data to detremine how to put the data back together

883568
hide	show
i had issues with jquery and showing and hiding sliding table rows in the past in the end i had to get jquery to wrap the selected td in a div and then show hide that not nice i know but on a tight deadline it worked

883572
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
in applicationdidfinishlaunching i initialize uiviewcontroller using xib s but then manually create uinavigationcontroller add navigation controller s view to windows and push first view to navigation controller

883599
markup	xhtml
we have untrained web content producers able to inject markup into our site anyway so strict xhtml compliance would be a pipe dream

883601
value	field
to yes and then editing your content type to change the value of your field to hidden

883610
space	input
expression r and an input text t in o |r| |t| time and o |r| space where

883616
python	php
you could use any scripting language such as python or php to do this with an image library such as imagemagick or gd

883624
controller	routes
you can program into your routes arbitrary extra parameters you would like sent to your controller

883624
controllers	routes
looking at the request uri will force you to keep routes and controllers in sync which will make your code more fragile and less easily re-used

883626
selected	button
the problem with this is that the button eats the click and the item does not get selected if the button is selected

883626
silverlight	wpf
note i am seeing my problem in silverlight but i am guessing that the exact same behavior can be seen with wpf

883643
uitabbarcontroller	uitabbaritem
first it looks like you have your uitabbaritem s under the navigation controllers instead of directly under the uitabbarcontroller

883657
debian	linux
considering maintainance cost options and performance which server plattaform can i decide for mysql hosting windows or unix linux ubuntu debian

883665
managed-code	native-code
on the other hand because managed-code in some scenarios is slower than native-code you might want to try unsafe code instead

883678
ubuntu	osx
it functions as a great text editor that i ve used on ubuntu windows xp 7 and osx

883678
scp	ssh
if you decide to try out ke i d suggest the remotedrive tree ssh ftp scp remote editing and source tree as a start

883686
emacs	vim
cross platform you d be looking at something like emacs or vim neither of which are particularly friendly

883687
boolean	int
there are a specific set of types i am looking for int boolean date string

883690
any	set
while i agree that a disabled control should look disabled you could just set the combobox controltemplate to the standard one or one your using removing any of the standard functionality

selected	listbox
if you were to put a button in a listbox for example the same behavior occurs - clicking the button does not cause its item in the listbox to be selected

883710
textmate	bbedit
on the mac side i have always been a fan of both bbedit and textmate but much more so of the latter especially given its lesser price tag and more modern feel

883710
notepad++	textmate
on windows i d stick with either e which is basically a port of textmate to windows or notepad++

883710
notepad++	scite
you could also look at scite but like notepad++ it has no project org features

883713
authentication	login
however i need to implement some authentication of the account before the user can login with it and want to set the account to be disabled on creation

883713
account	api
i ve been making use of the security.accounts.user class to achieve this so far but can t seem to find anything in the sitecore api that will allow me to disable the account

883728
.net	wcf
wcf is very fast and for properly-designed usage it is often faster than .net remoting

883728
.net	wcf
with .net remoting you are also requiring a binary dependency be shared on both the client and service which is not a requirement with wcf

883731
linux	unix
assuming linux unix like system .

883735
children	nodes
means this nodes effectively and text means all the text nodes children of this nodes

883735
document	element
for an element node the string-value is the concatenation of the string-values of all text node descendants of the element node in document order and for a collection of text nodes the comparison will check whether any text node is equal to the one you re testing against

883765
union-all	union
the statement utilizing the union-all has theoretically a small performance disadvantage as it has to union the results of all statements before the insert can happen

883772
selected	checkbox
i need to get values from some selected checkbox and pass those values through pagination in php mysql

883772
selected	checkbox
if on another page user selects other checkbox i need to add their values to arrays selected earlier

883799
pdf-viewer	acrobat
if your intention is to open the pdf for viewing like you probably do with your pdf-viewer acrobat reader and not to open the file programmically you cannot do it in turbo c++ ide

883808
hide	show
when you click on a new page link hide all div s except the one you need to show

883814
getter	setter
setter methodss like that are sometimes explained in more detail in the getter methods the introduction text in class documentation or one of the documentation companion guides you see linked on the bottom left

883833
dictionary	map
i am a c# developer and i don t fully unterstand your code but i would use a dictionary to map between the type of an object and something else - i assume you return a enum value

883840
dependency-injection	inject
most dependency-injection frameworks have means of looking at the type being inject and then using that to construct the log instance

883851
administration	account
account cn admin ou adam users o microsoft c us an adam administration account i ve created

883852
keyboard	mouse
basically you are redirecting keyboard mouse input via the flex app and using it to display realtime 3d activity using a standard movie component

883855
hide	show
if triggers 1 hide or show target 1 or scrolls down to it this methods would have the added benefit of still doing something if javascript was disabled

883866
.when	ready
only .when a subproject is finished and ready to ship should it be merged into trunk

883866
bazaar	git
subversion makes that case challenging but other revision control systems such as git mercurial and bazaar make that case easy

883886
compareto	equals
you see compareto methods sometimes returns 0 which should be consistent with using equals

883898
exception-handling	error-handling
instead of dying you could throw an exception-handling and do the error-handling centrally in whichever fashion you see fit -

883912
union-all	union
union-all won t hurt performance since oracle estimates the union ed query only when it needs it it doesn t cache the results first

883926
python	ruby
the ruby interpreter can also be embedded within c programs and may be considered by some to be more object-oriented than python

883944
difference	zero
in other words many people would say that 7pm-7am the next day is a difference of a day whereas 7am-7pm the same day is a difference of zero days

883969
python	ruby
i d recommend either python or ruby

883971
declarative	imperative
data-binding for all its wonders is declarative and harder to debugging than nice imperative stuff where you just set breakpoints

883975
configuration	environment
at the moment the code is reading an environment variables project_configuration that points to the specific configuration file

883987
children	nodes
i ve tried creating a temporary doc and replacing children with the root nodes of the documents

883987
document	element
the importnode and adoptnode functions cannot import adopt document nodes but they can t import the element node and its subtree.

883989
firefox	opera
of course a good text editor revision control and firebug in firefox or dragonfly in opera are also essential

884013
groovy	java
if you want something that interoperates very closely with java go with groovy

884013
python	ruby
if you need jvm compatibility also look into jython python on the jvm jruby ruby on the jvm and scala a functional language on the jvm

884013
python	java
if you don t care about java and jvm compatibility look at ruby python and erlang

884013
scheme	tcl
going further afield tcl tool command language lets you embed an interpreter in c++ code there are many embeddable lisp and scheme interpreters etc

884015
linux	unix
ctrl-break windows or ctrl- possibly ctrl-4 and kill -3 on linux unix

884017
datagridcell	textblock
i know that by default the content of a datagridcell is a textblock and it s text property is set through column binding result but if that result is an object i guess that i have to create a contenttemplate

884019
children	nodes
for example to get a list of all text nodess that are children of a post nodes

884023
json	xml
here s a javascript tool that will convert json to xml and vice versa which should enhance its readability

884037
subtract	add
note that if the start day is a weekday add days to move to the previous monday and if it is on a weekend subtract days to move to the next monday since you already missed this weekend.

884050
aggregate	grouping
we want to ensure that it is easily possible to aggregate grouping by by product attributes

884073
contains	elements
both functions require a single argument list or tuples that contains two elements

884078
any	set
second one thing you should know is that the default model binder requires that any properties you wish to set be available via public accessors

884086
updating	updates
it says it is updating but when i check the files they have not been updates to the latest versioning

884093
click	mouse
i understand that there is no such thing as click events in wxwidgets from the question wxwidgets detecting click event on custom controls so a simple mouse down event will do

884095
create-table	alter-table
create-table for new products and alter-table by adding removing columns as the user performs the operations

884123
contains	set
i have a linechart that contains multiple series both lineseries and plotseries and i have a custom datatipfunction set for the chart

884140
contains	set
i have a javascript search that searches a set of html files and returns a list of files that contains the keyword

884164
aggregate	grouping
the grouping is not going to be easy because what aggregate operator are you going to use on color

884182
bufferedwriter	filewriter
the finally tries to close from the outside of any decorated stream first so if you had a bufferedwriter wrapping a filewriter we try to close the buffereredwriter first and if that fails still try to close the filewriter itself

884186
perl	php
can ruby php and perl do the same on the command line

884187
order	add
edit one approach to this would be to add an additional field to sometable that captures the order

884203
keyboard	mouse
it does not really make sense to stop execution of a windows as the windows only handles events that are sent to it like for example mouse keyboard or paint events and ignoring them would make the program appear hung

884209
htmlpurifier	xss
is there a javascript equivalent of libraries like htmlpurifier which remove xss code from strings

884226
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

884234
environment	building
if you re not in an environment where your data sources come from jndi provide your own connectionprovider implementation and either pass it to the settings object before building the session factory or specify its class name in the hibernate.connection.provider_class property

884241
order	add
you could theoretically add a parameter or change the location of the bookmark url in order to identify a user that clicked a bookmark

884244
bufferedwriter	ioexception
whilst bufferedoutputstream closes even on an ioexception from fflush bufferedwriter closes correctly

884247
push	pull
i need to host a mercurial repository on a server so that a number of people can access it to both pull changes and push their own work

884248
web-config	app-config
you ll want something like this to increase the message size quotas in the app-config or web-config file

884250
font-size	width
.sifr-root text-transform uppercase color #ffffff text-align right width 484px font-size 20px font-weight bold

884262
triggers	insert
if the table has a triggers with an insert to a differnt table with an identity that is the value that will be returned

884276
panels	grid
panels grid etc

884313
order	add
i saw a solution elsewhere that suggested we add some javascript to our master page file in order to allow line breaks

884323
solaris	linux
a library built for a platform other than linux redhat say solaris will not link with your exe

884327
numeric	digits
i found that the following will work with unrecognized numeric digits columns

884341
implements	extends
in this particular case you should follow wilums2 s advice and extends mouseadapter instead of implements mouselistener

884341
convention	standards
more generally the short answer is no there is no standards convention for how to document empty methods though i generally use something like

884345
reflection	runtime
essentially you ll need to use reflection to grab the runtime type

884346
downcasting	upcasting
surely if you ve got an then you re downcasting rather than upcasting

884347
windows-vista	windows
2.0 sp2 2.0.50727.4016 windows-vista sp2 and windows server 2008 sp2

884348
constructor	object
i use the following function to detect values that belonged to an object s constructor instead of the object itself

884354
callback	methods
if the listener interface contains more methods callback than you need then just ignore the ones you don t care about

884360
message	alert
how to avoid outlook security alert when reading outlook message from c# program

884380
message	alert
a number of events will potentially interrupt an application - incoming call sms message or calendar alert

884381
hash	md5
as you mentioned since the answer is hash you will need to md5 hash the user supplied values

884389
contains	any
note this will prevent commiting to any repository path that contains the substring tags

884405
rewrite	rule
and the mod_rewrite rule to rewrite such requests to your script.php file

884435
python	lua
i d like to do this in lua since i m more familiar with its c api than i am with python but if it will save headaches i d be happy to do it in python

884435
c++	lua
i ve got a solid grasp on how to call lua functions from my c++ and vice versa and i know how to pass basic data types back and forth

884435
c++	lua
i would also like to be able to instantiate an instance of the object in lua using the wrappers and pass it off to c++ to be used as a normal c++ version of the object

884440
python	ruby
the point of this is the creation of a bash ruby python insert-script-langauge-here script to convert a mess of these files into something usable pliable like maildir or mbox

884469
python	perl
these files could contain bytecode though perl doesn t write bytecode out by default unlike python

884473
python	java
directors are supported for languages such as python java c# though

884487
double	int
i dislike the fact that there is a differentiation between primitive native types int boolean double and their corresponding class-wrappers int boolean double in java

884562
exponent	modulo
you need to know the public exponent e often 65337 for rsa keys but other numbers such as 3 or 17 have been used and the modulo n which is the 512-bit number provided in the question

884572
space	input
i have found a number of solutions that require working space proportional to the size of the input but none yet that can get away with constant working space

884575
premature-optimization	microbenchmark
the optimistic suggestion is to use std max float float in the hopes that someone else ignore those who taunt microbenchmark and premature-optimization and has done the research necessary to provide a specialization for std max float float that will use the your hardware s specialized instructions

884594
constructor	object
but then of course i run into the problem that the constructor now produces an infinite recursion since also tries to access the wrapped object

884595
sbcl	ccl
it came down to ccl openmcl versus sbcl

884600
firefox	safari
it works fine in safari but nothing appears in firefox

884604
contains	any
i thought it was just a person directory but after i discovered that it can contains any objects in a hierarchical structure

884610
.net	wcf
.net 3.0 features + linq asp.net ajax new controls richer wcf support incl rest atompub and a few other features

884626
google-webmaster-tools	sitemap
create a sitemap reference it in your robots.txt and register it with google-webmaster-tools

884634
constructor	object
but then of course i run into the problem that the constructor now produces an infinite recursion since also self.theobject anobject tries to access the wrapped object

884659
rational-numbers	base
in the special case where m are both powers of a common base or equivalently if log m p is a rational-numbers then m i will only have a few non-zero digits in base p near the front so we can safely output most of the digits we ve computed so far

884661
order	add
when i add an order by clause at the end of the query order by any column the query takes about 10 seconds

884691
default-value	default
for one of the prompts set the default selections property so that your default-value will be automatically selected on one of the controls

884691
selected	checkbox
also be sure to set the selected user-interface property to checkbox grouping even if you only have one value to be checked so you get a checkbox control

884697
double	int
the problem here is that if both operands of an arithmetic operator are int then the operation is performed using integer arithmetic even if it s part of a bigger expression which is of type double

884697
subtraction	addition
the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

884708
internet-explorer	firefox
recursion is supported on internet-explorer and firefox browsers.

884717
contains	any
in that example b will end up with the value of 8.00000... this is because a_int does not contains any decimal information and so b only has the integer related information at its disposal

884730
ghostscript	imagemagick
most probably you ll need to do some imposition yourself either make ghostscript do it you ll have to write a postscript program or stitch the resulting rendered pages with imagemagick or something similar

884760
sniffing	packets
is there anything i can do to debugging this situation other than packets sniffing

884769
required	checked
if you do this where do you store code the unreviewed code and how do you deal with the issue where the developer has to updates the code to deal with conflicts resulting from other checked - do you required him to get his code reviewed again

884795
margins	padding
change the margins to padding and see if that helps

884804
json	xml
you don t want every page tracked pages returning data such as json or xml should not be meddled with

884826
having	select
so in short is there a way in nhibernate to do a select without having it generate the from table clause

884832
python	java
has rock solid php import and export support also supports c++ java python

884834
value	field
but the thing is none of the foreign key field in db1â s tables holds a value equal to sqlmembershipprovider.applicationid 100 which would suggests that there is no relationship established between tables in db1 and db2 i know that is not the case since iâ m able to assign users to roles

884903
mousedown	mouseup
i would suggest changing to either the mousedown or mouseup event

884920
value	field
we re using the switch but the problem is some of the field values themselves contains double-quotes indicating inches so the delimited field value might be something abcdef19

884920
value	field
we ve thought maybe a global search and replace to escape the double-quotes in field value

884936
triggers	insert
the triggers is part of the transaction that sent the data to the insert or deleted tables

884961
32-bit	64bit
then the 64bit and 32-bit versions work with the same build

884995
attributes	properties
if you want to support recomposition you d have to set the allowrecomposition properties of the import attributes to true then you can implement ipartimportssatisfiednotification on your class and the interface s onimportssatisfied methods will be called whenever the imports have been set

885004
webserver	nginx
set up nginx to serve up the php and dynamic pages itself and you ll have a much faster service and won t have the problem where apache dies and leaves your webserver nginx hanging

885007
wmv	mp3
you can use the ifilter interface which was design for windows desktop search there are already implementation of the interface for mp3 wmv jpeg

885026
managed-code	unmanaged
which i am sending as part of a copydatastruct message from unmanaged to managed-code

885050
select	union
the results from any sql select including a union are a static set of columns

885053
contains	set
you set the nib of first view controllers in the inspector to the nib file contains the actual view objects since you are trying to split them into separate files which is a good thing

885058
dependency-injection	inject
suppose i should have added i use di dependency-injection therefore should i inject the new class as well

885059
rewrite	rule
but when i tried to set the same rule on my local development machine mac the rewrite doesn t seem to be working

885076
target-platform	platform
for example i used eclipse platform sdk eclipse-platform-sdk-3.4.2-win32 as target space and when i display the source code locations page that you mentionned it is filled with source locations declared in the target-platform

885079
any	set
clicking any link opens word client side i set the file associations to do that so the ie browser doesn t try to open it instead

885088
operators	keyword
the key difference are the let keyword that introduces a new variables inside the query and the fact that you can compare strings using the operators since system.string implements this operators

885103
base-class	inherited
i ve got a bunch of classes that inherited from a common base-class

885108
configuration	environment
i dont have access to the provider environment so i cannot use any configuration files cxf.xml cxfservlet.xml etc..

885114
vb.net	vba
once you have the vba macro its easy enough to convert this to vb.net or c# that uses interop

885114
macros	vba
i don t know much about mailmerge but this is some of the vba generated whilst i recorded a macros

885123
msbuild	nant
i d recommend using nant or msbuild and just use the .csproj file generated by visual-studio

885127
attributes	properties
to pre-define the tag value you would just need to decorate the desired properties with this attributes

885135
postgresql	mysql
the first thing you need to decide is what dbms you will use mysql sql server oracle postgresql one of the object-oriented databases etc

885136
instances	self
is there any way of accessing the the instances the namespace of which i m working in similar to javascript s this or python self

885137
json	xml
as jim mentions application xml or text xml or application json works for most of what gets transmitted in a rest design

885148
cvs	git
if you want to convert migrate from cvs to git the best solution for now seems to be mentioned above cvs2git mode of cvs2svn

885150
ruby-on-rails	django
you ll find a lot of frameworks django cakephp ruby-on-rails have you develop the model and the frameworks will build the corresponding tables

885157
communication	messages
i have worked out a containser for my communication where i will send a fixed length header at the beginning of each messages which will contains among other things the length of the messages

885166
postgresql	mysql
i d like to note that this does not happen on mysql only postgresql

885168
dependency-injection	inject
it seems more than a little silly that spring a dependency-injection container of all things has not supplied a way to inject something similar

885171
rubinius	jruby
also the jruby developers have indicated that they are willing to implement a rubinius bytecode android-emulator inside jruby if rubinius bytecode becomes a popular way of deploying ruby apps

885175
udp	tcp
regardless do the following for either your one udp socket or for each tcp client socket

885175
communication	messages
this thread would communication with the main thread via a thread-safe send messages-queue and a similar messages received psuedo-queue

885186
any	set
it will need to be able to integrate with any number of our own solutions meaning it will have a set of services or apis that one can use for integration

885237
compression	streaming
to double check that this is being done correctly i also save the streaming as a tiff and view it in astifftagviewer which shows that the compression is correct

885239
embedded-fonts	fonts
this all works fine except when the pdf contains images or embedded-fontss in which case the images are corrupted and any text using the fonts disappears acrobat display a message about the missing fonts

885240
cvs	git
this isn t so much that one side it better than the other it s that git mercurial et al allow you to work in ways that are different from subversion or cvs

885257
required	checked
i think git has better tools and a better toolchain and the fact that it doesn t required a central repo and a checked out repo is nice when you re working on small projects by yourself

885259
sql-server	oracle
but database connections oracle sqlite ms sql-server in .net are not thread-safe nor are the surrounding objects

885275
code-coverage	emma
i have a problem with ant and emma a code-coverage plugins it makes report but without source code

885283
expression-blend	wpf
if you have a ui designer or you are proficent in expression-blend wpf is probably the way to go

885285
gridview	listview
i have a listview with a gridview in it

885289
push	pull
i created a silverlight component and a wcf service both are communicating using a pollingduplexhttpbinding to enable push and pull functionality

885320
subtract	add
for add multiply the order of operands doesn t matter but for subtraction and division you should subtract and divide the first operand by the second

885322
environment	building
the first is well suited for migrating to a maven like building environment - the latter for having all the source code in at once

885322
environment	building
i decided for a non-maven approach here and we focus on having an easy eclipse environment so i created a building enviornment using ant4eclipse and team projectset files which we use anyway

885338
smartgwt	wicket
when i combined google eclipse plugin smartgwt gwt 1.6.4 and wicket the gwt compiler would emit bad javascript

885340
contains	any
you won t be able to use this to serialization any objects that contains other objects of non-basic type without converting them to a __dict__ and so-on recursively for the entire network graph

885340
base-class	inherited
i know that doesn t seem very sexy but it is a lot more maintainable in my opinion than a wrapper given the severe limits of the plist format and certainly better than artificially forcing all objects in your application to inherited from a common base-class when there s nothing in your business domain that actually indicates those disparate objects are related

885342
constructor	object
so if you add this to your view controller constructor all you need to do is call object becomefirstresponder

885376
any	set
an other way would be to add a key with any name to hkey_local_machine software microsoft visualstudio_yourversion_ assemblyfolders and set its default value of type reg_sz to the path with your assemblies

885378
configuration	logging
i am trying to configure log4net purely by code but when i did with a minimal configuration i was flooded by logging messages from nhibernate and the fluent interface

885386
stateless	stateful
you can expect to see the introduction of a flow model that compliments spring asp.net-mvc s stateless controllers model and allows stateful web flows to be defined as pojos

885406
constructor	object
i m maintaining some c# 2.0 code and the programmer uses a pattern of reading a collection of business objects by opening a datareader and then passing it to the object s constructor

885410
stream	send
usually you will first send two or four bytes with the length for the rest of the message so the other side knows to read that many bytes from the stream

885411
dfa	nfa
build a basic finite automaton dfa nfa nfa-lambda for the language in the alphabet sigma 0 1 2 where the sum of the elements in the string is even and this sum is more than 3

885416
any	set
but really - if you are spending time with your version-control system on any day other than the day you set it up then you are doing something wrong

885420
constructor	object
passing a reader connects your constructor you didn t put myobject in a class but you call new myobject to your data storage and i presume your object isn t written to be such

885428
content-management	publishing
checkout andrew connell s book professional sharepoint 2007 web content-management development building publishing sites with office sharepoint server 2007

885430
http	ssl
this would mean to install and enable the apache module for ssl encrypted http traffic port 433 https in the adress line of the browser and disable the standard http traffic for this directory on port 80

885431
constructor	object
by passing the datareader to the object s constructor you establish a very tight coupling between the business object and your choice of persistence technology

885431
constructor	object
resolving this isn t too difficult - you d simply move object initialization out of the constructor and into a distinct factory class

885441
string.format	stringbuilder
use stringbuilder or if you re using java 5 or 6 use string.format

885448
c++	lua
if swig gives you trouble i ve had good luck with the latest version of tolua++ which is for the sole purpose of binding c++ and lua

885455
while-loop	loops
you perform the query and iterate across it but you don t get anything out of rs2 you set clas based on the value of odd but don t modify the value of odd inside the loops meaning that there s no point int he while-loops at all much less the query

885456
lookup	any
is there any sort of api that just offers a simple symbol lookup service

885477
twitter	last.fm
i am using different api s from various websites last.fm delicious twitter .

885490
version-control	git
there is survey on decentralized version-control systems by brian de alwis of department of computer science in the university of saskatchewan being run see this announcement on mercurial and git mailing lists

885500
required	checked
your best bets are probably going with one of the other lookup services still screen-scraping and checked whether they don t required captchas

885500
required	checked
the last appears the least likely to required a captcha at any point but it s worth checked all three

885514
python	java
in python because i don t have a java compiler handy

885530
spring	guice
i ve used spring and i ve looked into guice and i think that these are both rather obtrusive extensions to languages

885562
textmate	vim
so my question finally is whether anyone has found an ide not textmate or vim that works with grails 1.1.x when the plugin folder is in it s default location under home .grails 1.1.x plugins

885567
required	checked
draconian xml rules required checked if every character is properly encoded

so in short the decision between integer and floating point math is done at the operator level

885600
sql-server	oracle
index-organised tables if they work as i believe they do in oracle and sql-server where any table with a clustered index is basically index-organised work by storing key tuple in the primary key index instead and presumably key pkey in all the others - no ctid no heap

885607
spring	guice
in comparison spring guice etc

885609
constructor	object
i want to be able to add these references incrementally not all at the same time on the constructor and i want to disallow the ability to delete the object underlying these references from my class also i want to test for null-ness on these references so i know a particular reference has not been added

if that is not possible how about a methods of calculating what the offset is going to be in pixels given the font-size so that i could adjust the positioning of the dynamically created and positioning fields before display them

885651
command-line	cmd
for the ps cmd-line not the dos cmd-line windows cmd processor

885657
json	xml
the dbm file format may not be cross-platform so you may want to to distrubute your data in pickle or repr or json or yaml or xml format and build the dbm database the user runs your program

885667
authentication	login
but they forget however that you still need to manage the case where the user is still logged in but the session has expired which creates a new empty session on the next request or when a user s authentication expired but not their session requiring them to login again but carrying around an old un-expired session possibly with another user s sensitive data

885673
oracle	mysql
you can configure multiple database providers mysql sql server oracle sybase etc.

885677

what you re needing is a cmd line option parsing library to take care of the messy details of processing the cmd-line arguments

885745
binary-tree	tree
an example of a non-self-adjusting structure would be a naive binary-tree in which nodes stay where they were first inserted no matter what happens to the tree

885750
environment	building
we d like to automate our deployment to production but for security reasons we don t allow smb file-share access from our dev test building environment to production

885877
margins	padding
does the problem remain if you use margins instead of padding

885879
implements	extends
i would argue that extends thread there was unnecessary and therefore implements runnable is preferred

you can add a view to an existing uiviewcontroller s view by using addsubview or by pushing a controller on to the uitabbarcontroller s view

885897
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in the latter case the uitabbarcontroller must be have been a uinavigationcontroller with a rootviewcontroller

885897
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this assumes you have a uinavigationcontroller as a view in your uitabbarcontroller and it s called navcontroller

885897
uinavigationcontroller	uiview
if you just want to add a uiview to the uiviewcontroller s view in the uitabbarcontroller overlay then you can just use addsubview as you ve already figured out no uinavigationcontroller necessary

885905
common-lisp	scheme
it s common-lisp which is quite similar to scheme

885908

no matter what the platform our product is install on we ship amd64 x86 and msil assemblies to certain locations to let the user create deployment projects for these the platforms

885990
authentication	login
this doesn t seem right to me as there is a really good chance i would be using these same libraries elsewhere like login authentication

a simple extension of merge sort s merge phase can do this in o n lg m time where n total number of items and m number of lists using a priority-queue eg a heap

886207
double	int
using string int double etc is more expected and therefore more maintainable

886221
ruby	php
i like python and feel it s a long term language whereas regarding ruby i wasn t sure and php seemed like a huge hassle to learn

886237
perl	awk
i don t have the shuf command so i am looking for something like a perl or awk one-liner that accomplishes the same task

spreadsheet	apache-poi
apache-poi is the right thing here as long as reading the spreadsheet is concerned

886328
function-call	inline
when you have code in the header file for simple getter setter methodss it s more or less just fine because you either want to save some working time because of code maintenance typing same methods in header and implementation file or because you actually want the methods to be inline due to function-call overhead in time critical places

886331
uitableview	uiview
i have a uiview which has a button on the button s tap i am showing a new uiview which contain a uinavigationbar and a uitableview

886338
hide	show
instead we have an asp.net listbox that controls the first parameter and when it s selection is changed we are using the reportviewer.serverreport.setparameters function to hide show parameters it takes in an arrays of reportparameter and the reportparameter constructor takes in a boolean to hide show the parameter

886338
hide	show
1 button hide the parameter and 1 button show the parameter using the setparameters function as mentioned above

886338
hide	show
even with this simple scenario the hide show button work fine in the development environment but we still have the same issue in the production environment the show button doesn t work

886345
getter	setter
i m not sure if this is exactly what you re asking but the best way to set the value of attributes or elements using xmlbeans is to use the xmlbeans-generated getter and setter

the minimum you need to do in order to give someone access to a cube is to set up a role add the relevant account and grouping to the role and then go into the cubes tab and change the permissions from none to read for the cubes you wish them to see

886438
twitter	last.fm
since you said you are using other api s like last.fm and twitter you might want to take a look at this railscast about creating non activerecord models models that are not tied to a database

886438
twitter	last.fm
you should read more about resources as your localhost last.fm and localhost twitter are resources and not views

886451

886472
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
nsapplication nsviewcontroller nswindowcontroller uiapplication and uiviewcontroller all load nib files on your behalf

886490
http	ssl
http and ssl mutual authentication should be used for this because client already has at least corporate ca-signed certificate on its smart card stored

deal with it in the object constructor

886547
xsd	xml
i think your xsd will give you java classes to produce xml like this

886557

when you are happy with the prime number generation then look at how to do winforms - how to put a listbox textbox and button on a form

886557
textbox	button
how to handle the click event of the button and how to read from the textbox and write values into the listbox

886558
for-loop	arrays
since this could be easily checked for in the for-loop i think your problem lies in handling the result arrays

886562
compact-framework	.net
taking this into account i ll need to make sure that all of the projects i create are compatible with the .net compact-framework

886574
integer	zero
and the below dereference of a reinterpreted zero value integer i think you have learned something important

886600
datagrid	listbox
since observablecollection already implements this if you bind your datagrid listbox itemscontrol etc. s itemsource property to a collection of this type it will automaticly update the user-interface any time an item is added removed replaced moved reset

886600
any	set
finally we can set the updatesourcetrigger to propertychanged telling the binding to set the source we are binding to in the object data provider whenever there is any change to the text

886609
object-files	extern
this involves resolving references between object-files extern symbols checking that there is a main entrypoint for c programs and so on

internet-explorer	google-chrome
i would like to know about the basic compatibility issues in the major browsers internet-explorer google-chrome when compared to mozilla firefox such as

886692
dependency-injection	singleton
for some background the issue is that i m using spring.net for dependency-injection etc but it loads its singleton on application start meaning that if i change any spring related code configuration i have to stop the development server so that it starts again next debugging run ensuring the application start event is triggered again

886696
restart	daemon
when done restore the original configuration file and restart the daemon

886721
updating	updates
well linq is more about querying than updating so i ll still separate it into a linq query and then a foreach loop to do the updates

886773
append	input
i m receiving an xml via php input and after using simplexml to break the elements down into variables and then what i want to do is append an arrays or create an arrays of the variables every 30 seconds or so

if it is seperate for each process where is this stack pointers stored

886810
postdata	request
and change nsmutableurlrequest postdata to send another request to server

886814
exception-handling	try-catch
i could wrap a try-catch log error rethrow around all my dictionary access but this would lead to difficult-to-read code cluterred with all my exception-handling logging stuff

886828
contains	set
remember that unix system libc calls typically do not set errno unless an error occurs so unless accept returns -1 errno can contains anything

886835
contains	any
the record file contains a list of words so i need to search into that list to find any word that could be similar to my word

886836
pointers	stack
all of my physical dll entrypoints are defined to take a single void pointers and i marshal subsequent parameters from stack myself by working from offsets from the first argument and the known argument list that has been communicated to the host

886836
pointers	stack
however i m aware that a my functions aren t cleaning up stack as they re supposed to as they re defined as __stdcall functions that take a 4 byte pointers and so they always do a ret 4 at the end even if the caller has pushed more arguments onto stack

886840
any	set
a methods grouping is the name for a set of methodss that might be just one - in theory the tostring methods may have multiple overloads plus any extension methodss tostring tostring string format etc - hence tostring by itself is a methods grouping

886854
for-loop	loops
i know i can do this alot faster by using one for-loops to loops through the image data and set it right away

886866
right-join	union-all
ace jet may not support full outer join directly but the workaround is simple enough just union-all the left join inner join and right-join respectively of the tables

short	base
the long and short of it all is that i need find the node base on itâ s positioning away from the current node

886915
double	int
as darin stated you should be always using trygetvalue - it makes the code easier to read to maintain and you won t get a keynotfoundexception and while your at it always use tryparsing instead of parsing for int double datetime whatever for the same reason

886926
deep-copy	object
i appears that when list.add is called it doesn t do a deep-copy of the dependent object

savepoints	rollback
but i can do rollback to savepoints which brings me back to the state i was at when i did savepoints xyzzy is the name of the savepoints

887400
savepoints	rollback
so in your case i suspect what you need to do is create a savepoints before your updates statement if it gives an error do a rollback to savepoints and set your flag

887408
delphi	c++
the gotobookmark functionality and the use of filters in datasets in delphi and c++ builder is known to be a very serious performance bottleneck

887409
methods	extend
or else if you want to implement a dd library of your own you can take help of their methods or extend them as both the libraries are following object oriented paradigm

887422
codeigniter	joomla
in php if you use joomla symphony or codeigniter then your scaffolding and architecture is already in place

887424
any	set
file attributes are an os specific extension so won t appear in any standard function set

887425
rad-controls	telerik
for example i register the telerik rad-controls dll with a tag prefix as it says in the samples

887426
rollback	commit
two problems you can t rollback a commit and how do you know what happened to the second database

887437
attributes	properties
it works with attributes how do i do with elements header properties in above code

887454
constructor	object
there is a whole library of object representing stuff like constructor methods and such

887466
debian	linux
i can t answer all of your questions but there s a full port of debian gnu linux on arm

887477
instances	private
instead of creating a private class that extends fooobject we create an instances of the abstract-class and provide the implementation of the abstract methods in line with the rest of the code

887485
double-quotes	single-quotes
what s the best way to ensure i return to the correct state upon closing the eval expression i.e return to double_string if i was in double-quotes single_string if i was in single-quotes

887492
debian	linux
you can install a arm-based debian linux distribution and tinker around with it

887502
lan	wan
assuming i have a cluster of n erlang nodes some of which may be on my lan while others may be connect using a wan that is via the internet what are suitable mechanisms to cater for a different bandwidth availability behavior for example latency induced and b nodes with differing computational power or even memory constraints for that matter

887507
contains	elements
custom configuration elements can contains other configuration elements but the configuration values always come from attributes

887512
callback	methods
i already have a non blocking version of my methods which passes a callback class in which has a methods that is called on callback

887512
callback	methods
would it make sense to construct a callback class pass it in to my previous methods and then perform a wait operation and on the callback have that class do a notify

887515
build-system	autotools
use standard build-system like autotools

887519
base-class	inherited
so how can i implement inherited with user-controls so shared functionality is all in the base-class

887527
base-class	subclass
ensure that the subclass inherits from the base-class both in the cs code-behind file and in the first tag of the xaml as shown above

887551
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following code that is working on ie but not on firefox google-chrome

887554
default-value	return-type
if this happens it just returns null or the default-value of the return-type

887555
constructor	object
deep-copying is implemented trivially in c++ by the copy constructor since in c++ all object have value semantics by default

887561
revision	svn
that kind of revision metadata has to be stored elsewhere like trac or some other system that s built on top of the svn repository

887565
registration	login
the customers currently don t have a login password and we don t want to validate their registration so we want to give them a automaticly generated password key to login to the website

887586
listbox	textbox
i would like to write only numbers integers in my textbox and would like to display that in my listbox

887593
any	set
however there are some awesome things you can do with java.lang.reflect.proxy - write generic code that implements any javabean-style interface set and get methods or even code that implements any interface by having all methods return default values - possibly even recursively methods that return an interface type return an object that behaves in the same way

887616
python	ruby
i am curious about the usage of the feature known as open classes or monkey-patching in languages like ruby python groovy etc

887637
google-chrome	firefox
this appears to be an issue with firefox and google-chrome s interpretation of the specifications rather than your code

887637
google-chrome	firefox
the w3c specifications show that table cells should support onkeydown but this doesn t appear to be supported by firefox google-chrome currently you could try reporting this as a firefox bug through their website

887637
click	mouse
if the keystrokes are some kind of navigation then perhaps a context menu done based on mouse click events would be better

887643
value	field
this is because the minus sign would have caused mysql to try and calculate the value of the field contents minus something else

887652
linux	unix
i am not a unix expert so maybe i m wrong but i think that unix or linux don t store file creation time

887657
value	field
the form field is disabled regardless of the value of disabled

887662
contains	any
for example if the property has a non-nullable id and your form does not contains any data for that id the model binder will leave the property as null since it cannot make a new instance of the type without knowing the id

887662
value	field
if any required fields are missing or if the value are submitted in such a way that they cannot be converted to the type of a required field then the entire object will be left null

887676
windows-xp	windows
pathping is a network utility supplied in windows nt windows 2000 windows 2003 windows-xp and windows vista

887676
traceroute	ping
it combines the functionality of ping with that of traceroute in windows tracert by providing details of the path between two hosts and ping-like statistics for each node in the path based on samples taken over a time period depending on how many nodes are between the start and end host

887676
traceroute	ping
the advantages of pathping over ping and traceroute are that each node is pinged as the result of a single command and that the behavior of nodes is studied over an extended time period rather than the ping s default sample of four messages or traceroute s default single route trace

887677
jquery	.post
i have a form which i .post back via jquery ajax

887678
configuration	environment
in my own unit test environment using hypersonic i massaged the hibernate configuration before building the sessionfactory i myself did this to do things like setting hsql-compatible identifiergenerators but you can problably go through clearing the schema properties of the mapped classes

887688
linux	unix
linux and unix file system stores

887688
linux	unix
file access change and modification time remember unix or linux never stores file creation time this is favorite question asked in unix linux sys admin job interview

887688
linux	unix
understanding unix linux file systems

887700
contains	set
set the header field that contains the length of the end section of the file to the number of bytes just written after the header

887736
httpd.conf	.htaccess
look at the acceptpathinfo directive used in apache directly in httpd.conf or via .htaccess

887757
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

887777
entity-framework	data-access
i think this is where i get confused i do feel it isn t good using the entity classes because that means i need a reference to the entity-framework data-access in my presentation layer to be able to access the entity classes

887787
order	add
if i add an order by clause on the conditional field though i start to get 8 results

887796
callback	methods
then in the ajax success callback methods use jquery to append the data into the table or give them a message telling them why it was rejected

887801
sql-server	oracle
i need to run several sql commands across multiple connections and each connection is on a different server oracle sql-server

887801
sql-server	oracle
for example i need to perform an insert in a table on both oracle and sql-server databases then commit them if no exceptions were thrown

887801
any	set
i have looked high and low and could not find any articles describing step by step setting up msdtc with mutual authentication including configuring firewall settings and msdtc settings. i looked at the microsoft documentation on setting up msdtc but it seems completely worthless and not fully documented unless you can find me a really good msdn article on how to set it up.

887829
duplicates	contains
the strongest lead is the duplicates loading of an assembly contains a type used in the signature of the â œmissingâ methods

887837
32-bit	64bit
make sure your paths is correct for instance since i m running a 64bit os my program files path is different from a 32-bit os

887844
uiimage	calayer
you can draw a existing view to a uiimage by using calayer s renderincontext methods

887845
jeditable	jquery
for specific help using jquery check out the jeditable plugin which is designed to provide the ability to edit data in place

887862
postgresql	mysql
is there any formal performance and stress test reports of open source database specially sqlite mysql an postgresql

887869
metaphone	soundex
unlike soundex or metaphone or nysiis edit distance algorithms make you compare your misspelled composer name to every other composer in the systemd

887870
select	union
is there a clever way of doing this in one select statement i.e without union

887877
command-line	cmd
where first param is the cmd name all other position params are the same as cmd-line position params and all keyword params are options

887889
cos	sin
is there any use of sin 720 or cos 1440 angles in degrees

887889
cosine	sin
in general is there any use of sin cosine tan of any angle

887892
union-all	union
using union-all means that the server won t perform a distinct which is implicit in union operations

887893
groovy	java
an example of its use on the java platform since you mentioned groovy is load-time weaving with something like aspectj and jvm instrumentation

887894
build-server	teamcity
we have a teamcity build-server running and want to compile a visual-c++ project

887894
teamcity	msbuild
the msbuild file can be easily built from teamcity though i needed some additional tricks to satisfy cmake s stupid looking for the compiler though i won t invoke it thing

887899
select	union
union three select statements should do the trick

887902
callback	methods
create the callback in your sync methods call that will coordinate with the sync methods call via wait notify

887902
callback	methods
when the callback is called it will call notify to wake up the sync methods so it can return the results

887920
cosine	sine
trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine will wrap around when they reach 360 degrees and act the same way as being at 0 degrees

887920
cosine	sine
this wrapping around can be seen by representing the sine cosine tangent functions using an right triangle inscribed in an unit circle and this behavior makes those functions periodic because they will repeat their patterns over and over again

887920
cosine	sine
in this case the sine and cosine of angles beyond 360 will be calculated

887927
value	field
however if you tried to call getval on one of the non-int field it would return a completely wrong value

887935
solaris	linux
i have a java application that parses a large xml schema .xsd using xerces that runs fine on linux and windows but gives a stackoverflowerror on solaris with exactly the same inputs and configuration

887939
sine	sin
on a sine curve sin 720 sin 0 etc so i d expect any decent implementation of those functions to handle degrees greater than 360

887949
binary-tree	tree
a decision tree is a binary-tree that asks the best question at each branch to distinguish between the collections represented by its left and right children

887953
contains	any
means a nullable integer type not an int that could contains any other type of variables

887970
authentication	login
i need to make app-designer allow me to login with 2-tier mode using ldap authentication

887978
solaris	linux
i would determine the defaults under windows linux and try setting those for solaris

887983
udp	mtu
3 you are sending messages that are bigger than the udp max message size 4 each device in your network has a max message size mtu so you might be exceeding a limit there

887983
udp	mtu
in case #4 i m pretty certain if you meet the udp max message size then you should be ok but there very well could be some older hardware or custom device with a small mtu that your data is going through

888005
cosine	sine
sine and cosine are just periodic functions so they have the same value every 360 degrees

888005
cosine	sine
is 82144.33 degrees then you re going to want to calculate the sine and cosine of that angle

888020
arrays	loops
loops through the grid and loops through the arrays to compare

888020
contains	elements
after step 2 is completed the arrays should only contains elements that are not found in the grid

888028
any	set
if the fetch request doesn t have any sort descriptors set to it explicitly will the objects be random every time or are they going to be spit out into an arrays in the order they were added to the managed object context initially

888080
profiling	debugging
but if this is the case there is no auditing as it is a shared account and also our dev profiling which you will appreciate are vastly different from a shared one cannot be used to debugging production

888084
cos	sin
in that context taking the sin or cos would tell you something about the ultimate positioning of the dial but you would lose the information about how many turns were involved

888095
select	union
anyway i m pretty sure it has case support so even if it doesn t have recursive queries you can just do select 1 from dual union all select 2 from dual union all select 3 from dual ofs instead

888096
alpha-transparency	alpha
i ve had problems with alpha transparencies and pngs can you make an alpha-transparency png with c#

888099
round-robin	jobs
multiple jobs can be submitted and it will kind of round-robin send the jobs to the printers per whichever one is idle

888099
any	set
any suggestions how to send 3 print jobs but have that set of jobs all be queued up to only one physical printer

888109
rollingfileappender	logfile
you could use log4cxx with a rollingfileappender to write this information into a logfile

888109
rollingfileappender	logfile
the rollingfileappender will handle rolling over the logfile when it reaches a certain size

888127
swing	gwt
all gwt widgets support attaching various listeners to them so there would be no problem in firing actions that change cells just like you do in swing

888144
teamcity	ncover
i m trying to apply a fix to allow ncover v1.5.5 to run on windows-server 2008 x64 via my teamcity continuous integration server as outlined on this blog

888145
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to convince my webserver admins to upgrade our versioning of the .net from 2.0 to 3.5

888173
selected	button
i d like to know how to create a button that would selected all

888182
callback	methods
a practical benefit of __invoke is that it becomes possible to create a standard callback type rather than using strange combinations of strings objects and arrays depending on whether you re referencing a function instance methods or static methods

888194
packets	ping
during the authentication process you can ping the remote ip and take a look at the ttl on the returned packets if it s too low then the computer can t be from the local network

888198
protected	public
lets say i inherited a class that has several public properties and or methods however i do not want them to be public properties methods of my class - in other words i want to make those properties protected properties of my class

888201
elevated-privileges	windows
there are choices though none of which pain-free you could use an activex control which however only runs on windows and not on all browsers i think and requires elevated-privileges

888204
hash	md5
i have some code i m revewing which is used to convert some text into an md5 hash

888204
hash	md5
well imagine it s the home page of stackoverflow - for each post generate an md5 hash of the user so we can generate their gravatar url

888212
directory	folder
this is because you do not know if the site will be deployed as root under a folder in root web or in a virtual directory

888218
derived-class	base-class
the derived-class must be a full representation of the base-class

888221
parsing	comma
if you re trying to populate a list you ll need to create a helper class that can iterate through the strings class and extract the appropriate values or encode your selections in a comma delimited list and parsing split that before feeding it to your dropdownlist s selectionlist

888246
instances	private
that private member variables were private to the instances and not the class

888247
base-class	inherited
the best you can do is creating a class and wrap the base-class insted of deriving from it - but this will of course break inherited

888256
value	field
for example if a user has an infinite number of textbox to type things into but each textbox s value will be concatenation into a single database field what is the safest character to delimit each input

888267
erlang	python
if it matters the system is mostly in .net 3.5 c# linq sql server etc but will use python erlang too

888284
base-class	inherited
inherited is all about saying you can use this derived class in the same way as you can use the base-class and it provides specialized behaviour.

888284
base-class	inherited
if you can t use the derived class in the same way as the base-class then you shouldn t be using inherited you re breaking liskov s substitutability principle

888288
required	checked
you can enhance the above by extends the fieldtype structure to include information about the type of value stored char int float etc and then write accessor for each type which checked the required type against the defined type

888289
uisearchbar	uitableview
when the user types into that uisearchbar it will automatically filter the results in the uitableview that is below the search bar

888294
double	int
because the compiler will promote the int argument to a double

888319
library-project	libs
both of these projects are very closely related but each has their own .net class libs-project for a core libs

888344
any	set
however our buildagent machines using teamcity are set up to be sterile and have the bare minimum installed on them required to build any given solution project

888344
any	set
tc account for this by allowing you to set all sorts of variables for any given buildconfiguration or even by buildagent ..

888344
environment	building
i m copying down from source control perforce a copy local of what i want include 1 and then trying to define an environment variables 2 -- and yet tc fails the building 3

888356
runas	cmd
as a security best practice log on to your computer by using an account that is not in the administrators grouping and then use the runas cmd to run iis manager as an administrator

888356
command-prompt	runas
at a command-prompt type runas user administrative_accountname mmc systemroot system32 inetsrv iis.msc

888356
selected	checkbox
selected the the exact url entered above checkbox to prevent the webserver from appending the original file name to the destination url

888356
selected	checkbox
selected the the exact url entered above checkbox to prevent the webserver from appending the original file name to the destination url

888374
versioning	packaging
that would allow you to control the building packaging versioning and release of individual modules and the parent project as a whole

888399
administration	account
my problem is that administration level account can see this with no problems whatsoever but viewers are getting an error stating that they have insufficient privileges to save the properties of the web part

888400
default-value	default
the long default of the serialversionuid is the default-value as defined by the java serialization specification calculated from the default serialization behaviour

888405
.when	ready
.when new batch data is ready the management object stops all new query requests maybe even queueing

888417
32-bit	64bit
however my code needs to run on a 64bit machine and compiled for 64bit due to other reasons and it seems to me that the exiv2 code only compiles in 32-bit

888437
sql-server	mysql
if you re wanting to generate this file for input to another application i think your best bet would be to log directly to a relation database sql-server mysql whatever.. then periodically generate that file as needed from the logged data

888452
revision	svn
that took a big chunk of time and svn revision

888453
credentials	account
we don t have one single account to access these servers some of them we use a functional id other our ad credentials

888509
webforms	asp.net
it s either just asp.net or webforms

888512
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms and mvc

888512
asp.net-mvc	webforms
webforms is the classic while asp.net-mvc is the new big thing

888518
configuration	environment
you could have a standard where they use an alias for ssh that logs the remote username as part of the login process or where they store their username in a .ssh environment file but allowing environments to be set may require ssh sshd configuration changes

888524
iequalitycomparer	icomparer
the default icomparer and iequalitycomparer for tkinterface simply compares the pointers value as four byte integers so there is on queryinterface done to get back to the aggregate

888524
iequalitycomparer	icomparer
you can avoid this problem yourself by supplying a icomparer or iequalitycomparer when you construct the list

888525
triggers	insert
you could add an after insert triggers updating the username field with the value of the identity-column from the inserted table

888539
updating	updates
with all the process above you minimize the amount of records to be updates to the minimum necessary and so the time the final table will be locked while updating

888559
any	set
update as it has been criticized that the example moves the cursor only back by one character i will add this for clarification using setcursorpositioning you may set the cursor to any positioning in the console windows

888605
malloc	free
i believed that malloc calls boil down to checking if there is enough free space on the os so malloc would be inexpensive

888608
constructor	object
listofbusiness is a constructor and doesn t explicitly return an object

888636
selected	button
you can select which output you want to see on each console by clicking the display selected console button second button from the right on the console view

888638
updating	updates
i want to prevent this and do the updating myself so that i can perform the updates in such a way that it s registered with our custom undo manager

888639
any	set
i personally think this stinks because we now have a core set of libraries that are hard to test because i can t mock stub these classes or do any injection into their constructor

888647
nested	assign
have you ever found a problem when assign a click event handler for your custom wpf user-controls with a nested button control

888651
contains	any
what i want to do is to make sure that per user there can not be any overlapping periods that is say we have a row of data for user 1 from the 15th of may 2009 to the 18th of may 2009 then there cannot be any other rows in the database that contains any of those dates 15-18th of may 2009 both dates include

888661
hide	show
i found this - - which is helpful but in the example he has a finite number of columns and he just hide or show them according to which ones have value

888666
data-manipulation	data-processing
i d like to do some lighting data-processing - a little binary data-manipulation followed by conversion to text serialization

888671
triggers	insert
you need to use an insert update triggers

888671
triggers	insert
make sure when you write the triggers that it handles the case where more than one row is being insert or updated at a time

888683
listitem	selected
you can create a listitem collection that first holds all of the initial selected indexes like kirtan suggested then create a new collection that holds all of the newest selections whenever the selected index changes

888684
instances	private
classes are friends of themselves in c++ terms private methodss and fields of any instances of that class can be referenced from any methods of the same class even static-methodss

888688
vbscript	jscript
theres also the windows scripting host that uses vbscript and jscript

888698
value	field
you can use this to get information from the control for example the text field s current string value or compare it to an iboutlet instance variables if you have multiple controls hooked up to the same action methods

888744
cucumber	webrat
i d like to have some cucumber webrat integration tests of my search features that use but the problem is that the data is loaded and then rolled back in a transaction during a typical cucumber test so there is no way for thinking_sphinx to index it

888748
sql-server	mysql
in sql-server or mysql you can do that with a case statement

888750
instances	destroy
will this instances be destroy by the gc

888756
appdata	temp
file c users heckacr1 appdata local temp temporary

888756
appdata	temp
file c users heckacr1 appdata local temp temporary

888762
put	get
in each of those cases the same view code might be being used however the controller is the one who knows to call different functions on the model to get the data to display and put it into the right collection name so the view can find and display it even though the view is actually ignorant of what it is displaying

888768
google-earth	google-maps
access to the google-earth 3d plugin with very few changes to a standard google-maps site

888768
google-earth	google-maps
i started working on my google-maps project a few years ago and in that time i have seen new tilesets the upgraded gui controls mousewheel zoom google-earth plugin .

888778
lookup	any
reverse lookup sets are automatically created for any foreign keys or many-to-many relationships to the model in question

888796
configuration	environment
still trying to figure out best practices for having a different di configuration for the production and unit-testing environment

888798
revision	svn
back up your production database and take note of the revision you have checked out from svn

888823
client-server	security
no client-server method is allowed due to cost and security reasons

888834
stderr	stdout
i believe this has something to do with the fact that basehttpserver sends log data to stdout and stderr

888842
coalesce	isnull
coalesce is the versioning of isnull which can take more than two parameters

888843
shell	bash
bash can stripes parts from the content of shell variables

888856
user-interface	look-and-feel
however i must admit that i m not yet well enough versed to understand how he does it - and also it seems like a somewhat complicated process whereby one physically change the look-and-feel in question bytecode manipulates it injecting the look-and-feel-widget stuff into the user-interface delegates - and i still don t know how the jtabbedpane or tabbedpaneuser-interface is actually modulated to inject that icon button

888866
authentication	login
when user tries to reach any location which requires authentication - the first thing we try to do is to find him in db by session id and if not - he just can see nothing but login form include

888876
selected	button
it works fine in every browser except ie8 in ie8 it shows a dotted box around hidden button when a label is selected

888893
optional-parameters	named
first of all let me say that i know about dynamic no pia named and optional-parameters and finally covariance and contravariance

888893
optional-parameters	named
in my projects 99 of the time my code is in c# i almost never do office automation i don t plan to use any dynamic language any time soon and besides being necessary for office automation i think named and optional-parameters are wrong and no overloads do not count if you have that many overloads the problem is in the design not the language

888900
sendmessage	message
i created a class and in that class i have a methods sendmessage to withargs which recieves an object a message and an arrays of arguments

888917
click	mouse
my gwt 1.6 application intercepts mouse click on hyperlink so when a user shift-click on links to authors they get an edit.

888920
qgraphicsscene	qdialog
as an alternative and probably less-supported approach i recall some work in the qt-labs about embedding qt widget including qdialog s into a qgraphicsscene

888926
cfengine	puppet
presumably if you re having to consider centralising things like datasource configuration you ll already have something in place cfengine puppet chef rdist ... to manage operating system configuration files - so why not just use that

888937
webforms	asp.net
if you re not doing asp.net webforms development you wouldn t care but there are significant improvements there as well

888954
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch is very cheap in python and attempting to construct a float from a string that s not a number raises an exception-handling

888955
iteration	sorted
the rational for this is that a std binary_search of a sorted vector with a custom comparitor is nearly as fast and sometimes faster than a map lookup and iteration is much faster

888957
put	get
when storing this information as a string make sure that all numbers are the same length so if the formatter returns 15 you store the string with 015 so that you just divide by 3 later to get the byte to then put into the arrays

888962
scala	ocaml
later i discovered functional programming via mozart oz ocaml later scala haskell and clojure and then i understood that many of the patterns were just boilerplate or additional complexity because the language wasn t expressive enough

888962
command-pattern	visitor
now i ve been doing some professional coding in java and i really feel the pain when i have to use a convention such as visitor or command-pattern instead of pattern matching and higher order functions

888968
mac-address	subnet
the mac-address is only resolvable on the same subnet - assuming this isn t a fairly small intranet app you would not be on the same subnet as your clients

888983
average	max
2 - footnote you do the ratio of the max arrays average arrays_without_peak

888993
put	get
idealy you should never use properties to get data from your object compute things and put data back in the object

888997
margins	padding
this task should be done using but i m not able to positionate succesfully the titles widths and margins padding

889085
gnu-smalltalk	squeak
here are some minor difference that were leveled out to make things easier on the benchmarking game - gnu-smalltalk squeak

889100
version-control	git
i have 5-10 independent projects that i want place under version-control using git

889134
space	input
starting with the x - swap the current input line with the hold space x then for the first line don t print anything 1d subsequent lines print the line just swapped from the hold space p on the last line swap the hold space again and print what was in it

889179
contains	any
given a name i want it to return the entry that contains that name in any of the three fields

889205
compact-framework	.net
your best route is to rewrite your application in something that targets both x86 and the arm mobile platform of your choice one of java j2me .net compact-framework flash c c++ etc or just make your application run at the server and expose it via the web

889212
powerpc	arm
0.r396-5 alpha amd64 arm armel hppa i386 ia64 mips mipsel powerpc s390 sparc

889229
push	pull
beside measuring speed of operations commands involving network like clone pull fetch or push

889229
push	pull
dependency of speed of network operation time it takes to clone pull push from network bandwidth and from network latency ping time

889230
windows-mobile	windows-ce
i m trying to port a driver and a few applications from a pda running pocketpc 2003 windows-ce 4.21 to one running windows-mobile 6 ce 5.2

889269
configuration	environment
at our company we were using the different configuration of the build environment and different target environment

889279
packaging	building
as an aside prior to my involvement with the building-process a product building was a 14.5 hour affair with no automated testing packaging or cm

889279
packaging	building
thanks to some effort and following the best practices laid out by the existing codeigniter community the same project building is down to 7.5 minutes with automated testing packaging and cm

889280
execute	declare
rather than going through an interface function by function and adding boilerplate logging in aspect programming you define a pointcut which is a kind of regular expression for methods and then declare methods that you want to have execute before after or around all methods matching the pointcut

889284
iteration	elements
also even if the iteration time changes for very large number of elements in the map the fact that you are trying to iterate through all the elements of such a big map means that most probably you have chosen a wrong data structure

889310
value	field
the vs debugger knows although it probably use another methods of obtaining the call stack trace as one can double click any stack frame in the call stack windows and look at the value of the locals and class field

889334
pure-virtual	base-class
if you don t want to make it pure-virtual and thereby force the implementation you might just make the body of foo in the base-class just immediately throw an exception-handling

889336
vb.net	vb6
- very good - all kinds of metrics about your project vb6 vba vb.net

889339
put	get
obviously it will take some time to get to know the players but joel oleson has put together a good blog article to help get started in the sharepoint twitter community

889346
automake	gnu
supports multiple versions of make gnu microsoft borland automake visual-c++ 6.0 and visual-studio 2003 2005 and 2008

889353
derived-class	base-class
simply by defining a member function foo in the derived-class you have hidden all of the foo functions in the base-class

889353
derived-class	base-class
you ll need to refine the question a little - are you concerned that the foo in the derived-class is not a proper replacement for the foo in the base-class

889374
configuration	environment
we usually have our build environment set up so that we can build debugging builds that use -o0 and release builds that use -o3 the build environment preserves the objects and libraries of all configuration so that one can switch easily between configuration

889375
webforms	asp.net
if you are using asp.net webforms and it is an intranet app have you looked at using the asp.net ajax modalpopup control

889383
conditional	operators
that last part is known as the conditional operators

889383
conditional	operators
while the conditional operators is technically a ternary operators that is an operators with 3 operands it is a misnomer and rather presumptive to call it the ternary operators

889407
spring	grails
i agree that building your admin interface is a good exercise to learn grails and also agree with the previous answer that grails is difficult if not impossible to integrate with an existing spring application

889407
spring	grails
grails is built on top of hibernate for its orm so if you re already using hibernate with this spring app you can work this to your advantage

889408
string-length	digits
the string-length will always be different but will follow the same pattern as the above digits comma space digits comma space etc

889414
contains	any
these bundles contains the binary usually mach-o and any other resources the application needs to run

889418
clique-problem	np-complete
unfortunately the problem is a clique-problem and is np-complete because all three columns are not unique

889424
constructor	object
i discovered this by setting the object to something in the constructor only to watch the contol s parent set it back to null

889437
methods	extend
extension methodss allow you to define methodss to extend other classes such that it appears that the methods was actually defined in that class

889438
abstract-class	pure-virtual
many times when i tell someone else to give a default implementation of its pure-virtual destructor for its abstract-class he she looks back at me with big eyes

889443
silverlight	wpf
we have a working wpf app that we are looking into running in the browser via silverlight

889452
wamp	php
in order to run .php files you will need php installed and because you already have installed wamp you should be fine

889452
wamp	php
c wamp bin php php5.2.9-2 php.exe

889455
selected	button
it is a total hack but it still lets me bind my command to the button and continue to have combo-box behavior for selected the item

889456
put	get
i m not sure if this will meet your exact requirement but if you put both the canvas and the content inside a grid as peers it will get you a centered result

889457
firebird	mysql
i think sqlite and mysql are quicker than progres or firebird but if you need some specific features like ctes only few database have even if it is sql standard

889463
value	field
calls to update can also use f objects to update one field based on the value of another field in the model

889463
any	set
do an update on a non-sliced query set of items matching any of those primary keys

889477
associations	model
throughout my application i m assuming the model has the associations and i m accessing its attributes and methods

889479
derived-class	base-class
this makes the base-class methods to be invisible in derived-class

889484
document-management	content-management
use sp for document-management and use something else for content-management

889497
treeview	grid
a few days later i had custom cmdlets that interact with the gui to build treeview grid diagrams menus etc.

889500
textbox	button
for instance the default update trigger for textbox.text is lostfocus and clicking on a toolbar button does not blur the active textbox focus

889504
any	set
is there any way to set the whole web application s timezone to b even though the hosting environment is in a

889504
globalization	localization
i ve already set the globalization tag in web.config with appropriate uiculture and culture values and they work great for days of the week and other localization settings unfortunately they did not adjust the clock what is the easiest thing i can do to achieve the adjustment so when in the application i do datatime.now i get the current time in timezone b not a

889511
triggers	insert
all we are trying to do is inside a triggers make sure the user is not insert two fees that have alone in the name

889513
user-roles	userid
this mapping generates mapping table user-roles which has two columns - roleid and userid

889527
children	nodes
i d need a mysql query that moves a nodes and all its children within a nested set

889551
jprogressbar	progress
so i have this nice spiffy mvc-architected application in swing and now i want to add a progress bar and i m confused about good design methods to incorporate a jprogressbar into my view

889552
required	checked
granted not every user has provided an email address but you can always perform this checked first and if it fails you can fall back to the about me section editing or simply required that the user have an email address

889554
png	gif
i am benchmarking a custom brower and want to benchmark the rendering speeds of different types of images gif jpg png of the same file size to see which of the image formats this browser renders the fastest

889567
triggers	insert
you could create a sendmails table with a triggers on insert

889571
children	nodes
how can i output all of the text in a nodes including the text in its children nodess while excluding the text in a nodess

889577
python	java
you can implement either one in languages that don t support it natively python and java come to mind and javascript on the other side

889602
any	set
you should be able to use any pdf printer software that provides a silent install option and just set the current printer when you need to print via pdf

889605
space	input
your input space is a list of characters from some character set containing all characters

889605
contains	set
your output space is a list of characters from some character set contains only numbers

889605
space	input
convert input space to finger space

889605
spaces	output
convert finger spaces to output spaces

889605
space	input
as we reduce the input space to the finger space we just drop any character not found in the finger space

889605
spaces	output
converting from finger spaces to output spaces is even easier

889605
spaces	output
we just find the same number in the output spaces

889616
difference	count
in sql whatâ s the difference between count and count #39

889623
vb.net	vba
if at all possible i would like help in doing this query in vbscript vb.net vba etc

889666
bitwise-and	bit-shift
use bit-shift operators combined with bitwise-and and or operators.

889696
associations	model
ive done it on the controller level with a before_filter that ran before all methods which needed to access the model associations that did or did not exist yet

889705
dictionary	map
we have decided to use a cache table that will store a dictionary of guids that map to friendly user information

889709
value	field
the new row is there and has a rowstate of added but the value is blank this is a string field

889718
firefox	opera
web browsers - ie firefox opera safari

889718
linux	unix
application file servers - windows server linux unix

889718
vb.net	vba
data maintenance - c# vb.net excel vba

889718
oracle	mysql
database servers - sql server mysql oracle

889725
contains	set
this matches anything that is at least six characters long and does contains at least two alphabetic characters and does contains at least two characters of the character set

889737
filtering	sorting
the columns i m sorting filtering manipulating are readings_miu_id readdate readtime rssi

889737
value	field
i need to add to this code the ability to put into the table analyzed one record per readings_miu_id while changing the readdate to show the desired date range in this case it would need to show something like 4 21 09 to 4 29 09 and while also taking the average of the value in rssi for each distinct reading_miu_id and inserting that average rssi into the rssi field in the analyzed table

889737
vb.net	vba
using vb.net 2008 and sql-server i could run each line through some logic statements to do what i need to to the data but i don t know how to do that in an sql or vba

889744
webforms	asp.net
i recommend you skip asp.net webforms and jump to mvc directly

889757
webforms	asp.net
first of all asp.net even using webforms does allow you to have complete control over the markup output

889762
selected	button
the easiest way to double check is to open the form in design view selected the button in question and press f7

889766
webforms	asp.net
mvc.net and webforms are built upon asp.net

889767
response	timeout
send the message with a timeout and see how long it takes to get a response

889770
oodbms	rdbms
i wonder if rdbms or oodbms will be suppressed in near future

889770
oodbms	rdbms
does that mean that rdbms will be suppressed by not yet well developed oodbms

889784
directory	folder
i have this happen alot where people hardcode their version numbers 1.0.0.0 and then have 5 different copy of dlls on their machine local directory shared folder gac etc.

889801
webforms	asp.net
if you are going to use classic asp.net webforms you really need to learn how it works to avoid truely ugly html

889801
webforms	asp.net
a lot of the ugliness of classic asp.net occures when people write webforms like they wrote vb 6 windows applications

889809
oodbms	rdbms
we can use oodbms key-value stores mapreduce frameworks semantic web etc. without detracting from rdbms

889845
jquery	dojo
look into jquery or dojo

889853
windows-server	windows
microsoft have indeed changed the way initializecriticalsection works on vista windows-server 2008 and probably also windows 7

889855
identity-column	sql-server
why does sql-server doesn t allow more than one identity-column in a table

889869
identity-column	sql-server
sql-server keeps track of a single value current identity value for each table with identity-column so it can have just one identity-column per table

889873
identity-column	sql-server
so it s impossible for the sql-server to have more than one identity-column per table

889886
webforms	asp.net
if you are looking to acquire skills in the latest and greatest then mvc is where you should start but i would also consider whether you will ever be asked to support asp.net webforms

889901
identity-column	database-table
an identity-column is a column also known as a field in a database-table that -

889901
identity-column	sql-server
sql-server uses the identity-column as the key value to refer to a particular row

889905
attributes	properties
there are more advanced techniques for controlling properties interaction with the designer google shouldserialize but these attributes should get you most of the way there

889912
key-value	key
in the key-value pair if value is a int and value 1 i somehow could not do map key -- cause that will make the value 0

889913
callback	methods
then you can get access to the keys pressed by using the text field s delegate callback methods

889930
handler	service
your service can also use session change notifications in its handler function to see when users logon logoff unlock their session and so on

889933
children	nodes
a quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal nodes has up to four children

889968
value	field
should the user realize they have more than 5 files to upload in the process of attaching them i would like the form to preserve the value when it submits itself for the change in # of field

889968
value	field
using the tag with the preservedata yes attributes is supposed to accomplish this - but all i m getting is a temp value stored in the input s value on resubmit that isn t display in the field nor works for a submission

889979
perl	c++
the xab notation is used in c c++ perl and other languages taking a cue from c as a way of expressing hexadecimal character codes in the middle of a string

889986
postgresql	mysql
sysbench is a great utility for benchmarking mysql and i believe has plugins or the capability to test postgresql

889986
postgresql	rdbms
regardless of performance if you really know what you are doing with rdbms software and need an open source solution you ll probably want to go with postgresql -- otherwise stick with mysql

889997
order	add
you can actually add an order to your joins just like in a math equation where you might do this 5 + 4 3 + 1

890024
compact-framework	.net
i m trying to programatically determine the cluster size of a storage card using c# .net compact-framework on widows mobile

890038
bison	yacc
i m writing a grammar in yacc actually bison and i m having a shift reduce problem

890038
decrement	increment
it results from including the postfix increment and decrement operators

890038
decrement	increment
bison tells me there are 12 shift reduce conflicts but if i comment out the lines for the postfix increment and decrement it works fine

890057
json	xml
this came up recently and possible a dupe the ajax response data json xml or html snippet

890061
base-class	inherited
wsdl or that link that says service description on yourservice.asmx you should see the inherited between base-class and child something like

890062
persistence	hibernate
i highly recommend you pick up the book java persistence with hibernate to learn more about this

890078
value	field
when you choose your data source the page requeries repaints and all of the available parameter value for the other parameters are filled in based on the queries for those field

890079
document	element
according to the documentation jquery 1.3.2 introduced a change in which element assumed as visible if it and its parents consumes spaces in document

890079
contains	elements
now the problem is that if the elements contains only floated elementss or absolutely positioning elementss it itself takes no space it has zero width and height

890081
ruby	php
therefore c++ would be better than languages like php python ruby c#

890082
python	ruby
come on lets all just learn python or ruby

890093
protected	public
i think people conceive of internal protected and private as restrictions from the natural state of public

890093
protected	public
rather internal protected and public are weakenings of the natural state of private

890111
ruby-enterprise-edition	passenger
it s not phusion passenger that has its own set of gems it s ruby-enterprise-edition

890128
value	field
this reminds me of overflowing buffering overflow of c types - pointing to the top variables and overloading to set the other field value

890139
value	field
i can save date time value in mm dd yyyy hh mm ss format as a varchar but that defeats my intention of sorting the table on that date time field

890155
ruby	php
some of the primary reasons scripting languages like ruby or php have been invented is so that us a programmers can get more efficiency out of the language and toolsets we work in

890167
higher-order-functions	lambda
a lambda is part of a very important abstraction mechanism which deals with higher-order-functions

890180
primitive	int
if you know that they were int when they were put in then they were transformed to int while in the collection collections cannot contain primitive only objects as such you can simply

890206
directory	folder
they aren t even in the normal bin release folder under the project directory

890208
moving-average	average
if performance is really important - a variables based on history average moving-average etc or prediction if you can make one ahead of time

890209
ruby	php
the idea behind languages like ruby python php and groovy is essentially rapid application development rad

890209
ruby-on-rails	django
the frameworks ruby on ruby-on-rails django cakephp and gruby-on-rails are there to better facilitate rad

890209
python	php
as someone with experience in j2ee development and python php there is a very apparent set of advantages and disadvantages

890209
ruby	php
ruby php and python do not you simply open notepad write your code and save it with the correct extension and you re ready to upload

890227
jquery	.post
jquery #yourcontent .load url param value .post || get param value

890235
javascript	dom
if you need to do other things with the data besides display it returning as json is a clearly better option because you can work with the data as a native javascript object instead of having to traverse the html dom

890241
development-environment	platform
there are many profiling tools out there usually they are specific to the platform development-environment that you are in

890246
windows	ms-dos
the sfl is written in ansi c and has been ported to ms-dos windows os 2 linux

890246
freebsd	aix
and other unix systems ibm aix sunos hp ux solaris netbsd freebsd

890250
javascript	dom
what i wonder is if there s a easier better way to handle dynamic forms adding form items to the dom via javascript when using springmvc and spring forms

890250
javascript	dom
to add lineitems i have some javascript that calculates the new index and adds that to the dom

890253
division	modulo
based on robert s code here it can even be done without the division or modulo replacing them with one shift and one and like so

890253
lookup	any
for any size integer you could just loop through the bytes and do a quick lookup like so

890269
circular-buffer	queue
when the free-list is empty you replicate the behaviour of a circular-buffer by instantly dequeuing an element from the queue and using that instead

890273
n-gram	words
generate some vector representation for each answer words count using text n-gram

890279
textmate	emacs
however you can extend emacs to work like slickedit and textmate that is copy cut the current line when no text is selected

890294
constructor	object
some apis allow you to specify on the constructor whether ownership should be assumed whether to clean up the injected object

890318
perl	awk
i ve used it this way for preprocessing tasks that i might otherwise have delegated to awk or perl such as collecting details from the current fossil revision into my built project

890322
octal	hex
one option is to directly input the character you re interested in using hex or octal notation

890336
selected	cell
i can replace the whole cell with what is on the clipboard but i want bona fide paste -- either insert the text at the insertion cursor or replace the selected text

890342
boost	stl
once you got these basic sorted i would recommend to concentrate on getting to grips with the stl and eventually boost

890344
c++	lua
this is analogous to embedding lua in a c c++ application for use as a configuration datafile language

890357
linked-list	nodes
a linked-list has o 1 insertion and deletion once you have the nodes but 1 and 2 are o n thus negating the gains

890361
wordpress	typo3
i love the functionality and ease of use cushycms provides for simple small sites where setting up and installing a traditional cms drupal wordpress typo3 are not necessary

890375
arrays	map
map the queue into an arrays

890375
required	checked
removals required a checked of the bit before to test on underflows but other than that are the same as for the write but using read index and clearing the empty full bit

890400
controllers	routes
i ve been toying with the simplyrestfulrouting assembly that comes with the mvccontrib extras and for the most part i really like that it quickly sets up my routes and leaves me with a good convention to follow in my controllers

890400
controller	routes
edit by pigeon holed i simply mean i feel like i m dirtying up the application when i have to create a controller action that is outside the definition of the default restful routes .

890433
ruby	php
the framework includes code to generate licenses in c# carbon cocoa php python ruby and stl

890438
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
sorteddictionary and sortedlist both have o log n for retrieval

890438
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
sorteddictionary has o log n for insert and delete operations whereas sortedlist has o n

890438
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

890438
sortedlist	sorted
if the sortedlist is populate all at once from sorted data it s faster than sorteddictionary

890447
any	set
if profilingmanager.automaticsaveenabled is set to true then when change is made to any profiling data the profilingmodule will update tables in a database accordingly

890447
contains	set
b if profilemanager.automaticsaveenabled is set to true and if property contains complex type is set to read-only then i assume profilemanager will realize that and thus wonâ t try connect with database in order to save this property

890457
dependency-injection	inject
the nature of dependency-injection means that the inject object does not know much about the lifecycle of what it was inject with

890463
checkbox	button
however the problem seems to be caused by the fact browsers commonly add some random uneven margins to radio button and checkbox

890465
directory	folder
so i am trying to use virtualpc s shared folder feature to share the host machine s subversion directory and open the project in vb6 on the virtualpc

890466
directory	folder
try a cleanup first and if that doesn t solve it revert or update the directory to restore the subdirectory .svn folder

890476
json	xml
convert the xml to json using this plugin

890492
debugging	trace
the vendor s app fails and logs a debugging message that includes the following stack trace i changed a couple names so as to not give away the vendor s identity

890495
linux	unix
that unix and linux oss are well designed .

890495
toolchain	gnu
the gnu toolchain is unnecessarily arcane

890508
json	xml
would it be possible to store the xml as json i would assume it would be

890508
json	xml
for instance in php you can convert xml to an arrays or object and then convert that into json with json_encode

890514
linux	unix
which is the bindings for libmagic on linux unix and possibly windows

890514
webserver	upload
i like the magic number method because it can catch wrong extensions and alot of trickery if you are handling files on a webserver that are upload

890517
data-structures	linked-list
wait until your data-structures class and then code it with a linked-list

890537
uninstaller	nsis
my nsis install creates start menu links to run and uninstaller my application

890565
keyboard	mouse
the tempting alternative of using interop to access the wh_cbt windows hook from c# won t work -- the only global hooks you can get at from c# are the mouse and keyboard

890590
integer	zero
since integer arrays are initialized with all values at zero then after the first iteration frequency 3 would be 1

890591
contains	elements
once the entire code snippet executes the frequency arrays contains the number of times each elements from 0 to 7 was observed in the responses arrays

890603
value	field
my most perhaps least brilliant idea was to use a seperate class to check any objects before being saved to the database against a list of allowed value in various field

890645
uitableview	uibutton
i need to customize each cell in a uitableview like each cell will have uitextfield and uibutton

890656
put	get
at an architectural level rest is about organizing your application functionality in terms of resources and exposing a fixed and uniform set of crud operations on them http-post get put delete methods

890682
python	perl
perl - search two different ways using programming or script as a keyword along with python or perl to prevent false positives for the word python not related to the language

890683
sorted	lookup
where people continue to inspect the diff visually - in this the performance of the exsiting scripting is dismal - most of the processing seems to be in sorting the arrays of lines in lexicographic order reading fetching arrays element tie file fetch tie file cache lookup and putting it in it s correct place so that it s sorted tie file cache insert tie file heap insert

890710
function-call	inline
it is theoretically possible for a compiler to optimize away virtual function-calls to either a normal function-call or inline code provided that the compiler is able to prove the history of the object that the calls are being made on

890712
class-variables	subclassing
as i understand it they re just like class-variables except that they are not visible to subclassing the way class-variables are

890714
webforms	asp.net
my first real development in asp.net was with mvc and i must say i truly miss it now that i m onto the next project using webforms

890725
benchmarking	profiling
as steve mentions benchmarking whatever solution you end up with i d also profiling your memory usage

890726
uitableview	uibutton
uitableview cells respond to selections - it get s handled in tableview didselectrowatindexpath maybe this satisfies your uibutton requirement

890726
uibutton	uiview
in case where you need uibutton it should not be difficult - it is just another uiview component

890726
uitableview	uibutton
maybe have a look at question uibutton in a uitableview header ignores most touches

890728
pixels	line
sometimes they gain a 1 pixels wide line on the right and bottom between the image div and the drop shadow background

890729
gallio	ncover
i m the author of gallio which include ncover integration so i was curious to see what ncover would do on .net 4.0 beta 1

890741
difference	count
instantiated class count is having a huge difference

890745
updatepanel	datalist
i have a datalist control that is not retaining it values during postback when the control causing the postback is outside of the updatepanel that the datalist resides in

890745
selected	button
when the user selected several rows in a grid and presses a button a datatable is filled on the backend and assigned to the datalist which has its item templates set to the usercontrol

890747
python	lua
he s convinced i ll do fine with and pick up c# in no time past experience in - c c++ php python lua

890754
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
i have used ruby-on-rails and castle not cakephp so i will talk in general terms

890766
linux	osx
an alternative for ftp support is to use a a program like fuse osx linux only to mount a ftp server as a directory i believe there are a couple of commercial windows programs that offer similar features

890776
digits	zero
4 use that as the last 4 digits of the sku with a leading zero

890778
value	field
if you do want to have tokenize then you will have to provide an nsarray for the object value to be display in the token field

890778
value	field
it does appear that the cocoa bindings reference states that the object bound to the value of an nstokenfield should be a string or number but in my experience this is incorrect and the token field should be bound to an nsarray just like when using setobjectvalue

890779
json	xml
on the .net side of things does it openrasta does it so does ado.net data services albeit limited to xml and json

890779
json	xml
as for conneg being yagni people already expect to have both json and xml representations for some of their resources and with rdfa looming they all become more and more important

890809
ruby	php
the reason why it works well in ruby rails is that ruby doesn t really have static state in the same way that php has

890811
curly-braces	parentheses
note that you need curly-braces and not parentheses

890811
rdfs	owl
to dajobe s point regarding entailments inferred triples rdfs label is an owl annotations property and will be ignored by inferencers unless you include your own rules and or owl constructs

890816
host	root
choosing atom-editor over having one host media type that supports multiple root elements doesn t necessarily bring you anything you ll still need to start reading the message within the context of a specific operation before deciding if enough information is present to process the request

890816
contains	elements
so i would suggest that you could happily have one media type represented by one root elements and use a schema language to specify which of the elementss can be contains

890816
document	element
there is nothing inherently wrong with application vnd.acme.humanresources+xml describing an xml document that can take either or as a root element

890824
class-variables	subclassing
class-variables are shared across all instances of a class which include all subclassing

890824
instance-variables	class-variables
unlike class-variables class instance-variables will take different value for each class object

890833
credentials	account
what is the minimum to be able to track user credentials track failed login attempts for account locking actually lock account etc

890834
arrays	loops
in loops it s often best to make this guess by doubling the size of the current arrays once you run out of space

890841
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and firefox but in google-chrome the xmlwindow.document.getelementbyid getxml is null

890853
click	mouse
currently i have a onmouseenter event that changes the cursor when the mouse moves over it so i know the system is recognizing that however what i actually want is for the application itself to become focused as if the used had left click on it - so i can then perform other ops

890870
32-bit	64bit
the reason why this solution switches from uint64 u to unsigned long w and v in the middle is that the yyyymmdd and hhmmssiii fit to 32-bit and 32-bit division is faster than 64bit division on some systems

890876
lazy-evaluation	maybe
maybe the server is evaluating the datetime.now at server start try making it lazy-evaluation through a templates or use a variables in your view

890892
revision	updates
if you want to updates your repository to a clean checkout of then simply do substitute with the revision number for

890897

is there a way to pass current sharepoint user credentials as sql-server authentication login

890899
arrays	map
map the events on an arrays representing the week you want to display

890899
value	field
now you can use the value in this arrays to fill the field split in the events subarrays

890909
authentication	login
in your custom authentication provider you should capture the user login information and then store to the webserver session

890913
groovy	java
i had a project that was combined java and groovy

890913
groovy	java
i used groovy for processing a text file and java for swing ui

890913
groovy	java
for my application which reads a lines from a text file and looks for data at certain offsets the java code ran about 3x faster than groovy

890930
windows	ms-dos
if you were running an old text-mode ms-dos program in a windows it would be using a code page 437 font

890941
python	java
self is a python convention which means this in other languages like java c# c++ etc...i ve found it bizarre that you need to explicitly reference yourself when talking about objects i have a java background but you sort of get used to it

890964
32-bit	64bit
as you can see avoiding excess 64bit manipulations helps even in native 64bit mode - but makes a huge difference in 32-bit

890968
inherited	subclass
it inherited from java.lang.object and there is only one subclass signedmutablebiginteger which is only available from inside the package

890973
constructor	object
this was a object definition instead of a reusable constructor function for simplicity

890980
output	args
if you wanted to output the contents of args you can just loop through them like this.

890993
command-line	cmd
normally it won t do this if a cmd is given on the ssh cmd-line which results in python running in a non-interactive mode

890996
arrays	loops
iterating an arrays outside-in as you have done in the second example will tend to be slower because on each iteration of the inner loops you are getting widely different memory locations

890998
virtual-memory	paging
the second option bounce all over memory for every single pass of the arrays this will reduce your cache hit rate and in the worst case involve you in lots of i o paging virtual-memory on and out

891014
convention	standards
the fact that this string arrays is called arguments is a standards convention but not strictly required

891018
abstract	sealed
are the modifiers public protected internal private abstract sealed readonly anything more than a gentleman s agreement about design and api use that can be broken as long as you have access to reflection

891023
double	int
accordingly most perhaps all of the value types character short long int bigint bigdecimal float double even string in java are immutable

891024
append	input
possible variations include append a check digit to the secret code and basing the input to the feistel network on more than just the sequentially generated number number + 10 000 event id number et cetera

891026
lookup	any
for complex lookup and any lookup essentially involving or i recommend django s q operator

891041
browser-cache	caching
it s about how you handle you browser-caching your database caching how you use non-standard persistence providers like couchdb how tuned is your database and a lot of other stuff.

891055
document	editing
the reason i want to know is that i want to provide basic online document editing really basic basically just rich text at this point for a php web app

891057
aiff	wav
file server in the network has a huge library of mp3 aac aiff wav music files

891063
version-control	git
i advised her to check out tortiosesvn or whatever m -flavor of git is out there for local version-control

891067
defined	declare
to eliminate the cyclic dependency one should be declare before the other is defined

891098
haskell	python
it might make sense in other languages but python is not haskell or lisp or ...

891140
forwarding	port
ssh port forwarding

891140
forwarding	port
basically you forwarding port 3306 on your local machine to 3306 on your remote machine then you tell your graphical mysql tool to connect to localhost 3306 and you assume that your remote machine is listening on the standard port of 3306

891147
textbox	button
you can provide a multiline textbox for comments and a submit button post the text to your server and then mail it to yourself on the server

891153
selected	button
the form has a bunch of questions each question has 4 radio button and the user selected one of them

891163
required	checked
1 force your checkbox to auto-postback and then on the postback check what value was checked unchecked and then enable disable the other checkbox as required

891194
authentication	login
i made a test on a site that is set to use basic http authentication to find that remote user is set to empty string while logon_user is set to the user name i used to login to the site

891202
contains	elements
if your html contains other form elements other than your option radio-buttons use clever naming convention of these radio-button so that while enumerating over the parameter names you know what to request

891203
typedef	struct
it might be a good idea to avoid typedef struct altogether

891205
scheme	let
here s a scheme that has the advantage of letting you calculate the next ticket hash from the previous so you can verify whether one is missing but doesn t let outsiders calculate the next one

891219
arrays	loops
tie file s cache can help performance in some circumstances but not when you just loops over the arrays one element at a time as you do here

891226
exception-handling	error-handling
exception-handling should be for exceptional conditions not as routine error-handling

891245
callback	methods
now i want to add my own javascript preferably callback methods after the request has been executed

891246
python	ruby
i d like to go into django with python but it seems that some hosting companies like dreamhost netfirms they both offer ruby on rails in the basic hosting package but not django

891249
project-management	scrum
the brand of agile that we use is composed of project-management practices as defined by scrum and engineering practices as defined by xp

891250
substitution	replace
all png fix methods require that a transparent gif be available to replace the png image it s part of how the substitution works

891250
png	gif
if that gif is missing then you get this broken image appearance even tho the png draws fine

891258
32-bit	x86
i m looking at making a hardware debugging tool that runs on the bare cpu x86 32-bit protected mode and no os

891258
inline-assembly	assembly
with c one can use inline-assembly or call subprograms written in assembly to access the bios for basic things like keyboard i o or displaying text on the screen

891261
ruby-on-rails	django
if it is compared to ruby-on-rails it will be harder just because of the buzz around ruby-on-rails and it is quite likely a basic package would include ruby-on-rails before django so if that cost factor matters be aware of it but there is pleanty of competition for django hosting so the lack of hosting isn t a reason to avoid it

891271
perl	php
the standard hosting packages are either windows iss or linux php perl mysql

891276
blackberry	nokia
nokia s40 nokia s60 sony ericsson blackberry etc

891277
export	report
i have a report and i print it using printvisual now i need to save it in pdf file but i don t know how export it in pdf

891285

microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

891295
foundation	cocoa
the cocoa foundation equivalent is the nssetuncaughtexceptionhandler function

891304
digits	base
we can generate such a number by generating its digits in base 5 we pick the random number 0

891304
digits	base
just the reverse of what we just did -- we convert it to an infinitely precise decimal in base 7 and then each base 7 digits will correspond to one output of rand7

891304
digits	base
the integral part of the result is the next base 7 digits

891304
digits	base
if they agree on the first k digits then we can safely output the next k digits -- regardless of what the infinite stream of base 5 digits are they will never affect the next k digits of the base 7 representation

891304
digits	base
and that s the algorithm -- to generate the next output of rand7 we generate only as many digitss of rand5 as we need to ensure that we know with certainty the value of the next digits in the conversion of the random real number to base 7

891304
average	minimum
in one run of this i made 12091 calls to rand5 for 10000 calls to rand7 achieving the minimum of log 7 log 5 calls on average to 4 significant figures and the resulting output was uniform

891306
internet-explorer	google-chrome
all modern browsers support native json encoding decoding internet-explorer 8+ firefox 3.1+ safari 4+ and google-chrome 3+

891311
bazaar	git

i also moved the two attributes into a new controller but i still have one properties to set to make certain it is working properly

891331
positioning	slider
then i have a slider to manipulate the positioning of the images and the only way i know how to redraw everything is to overwrite the myview with a new instance and in the main contentview do something like

891333
stateless	stateful
are session beans stateless session beans stateful session beans synchronized

891356
.doc	xls
you can use com objets to generate .doc xls or whatever see

891360
transient	entity
i was expecting that the methods will be called by hibernate to resolve entity name of a transient object when i save the object

891360
superclass	subclass
discriminator is used to identify a subclass or superclass mapping when a database record is fetched from a database

891360
superclass	subclass
however when it comes to mapping of a transient java object to a database row only class name of the object or provided to the save or saveorupdate methods entity-name is used to find subclass superclass mapping

891360
subclassing	superclass
the userproperty entity is a superclass mapping but there are subclassing with their own entity-names and hibernate does not resolve subclassing identified by entity-names this is actually noticed in the hibernate s code

891363
webdev.webserver	cassini
basically if the debugger is currently running it will stop it then kill any processes named webdev.webserver which should be all the cassini instances and then starts the debugger again which will implicitly start cassini again

891366
firefox	safari
in firefox 3 and safari 3 you can use rgba like georg schã lly mentioned

891378
attributes	properties
put dependency attributes on authentication and authentication properties

891422
configuration	environment
this way we can store each of our environment specific configuration values in the same configuration file and just qualify them with development staging production etc

891423
contains	any
i have a windows forms custom control which acts like a panels in that it can contains any number of children

891424
home-directory	privileges
as i did not have root privileges there i did make install with prefix set to a folder in my home-directory

891424
cc-mode	dired
now when i start emacs it gives an error cannot open load file encoded-kb it also is unable to run dired or load cc-mode

891427
authentication	login
my problem is the page that will accept the request a file upload page in this case is protected by authentication - the initial request for it above will return a login page instead of the page itself

891431
python	perl
that s how i ended up switching from perl 4 to python as my main language back in the 90s rather than sticking with perl 4 of which i was an expert and guru or switching to then-brand-new perl 5 -- a few pilot projects fully developed in each environment left me with no doubt about what was best for my own productivity

891468
textbox	button
in the right hand side of the textboxs there is a button that when clicked allows you to select a range of values in excel and when selected fills the textbox

891478
blackberry	sd-card
there are two kind of filesystems on blackberry - sd-card and store

891478
blackberry	sd-card
standard directory on sd-card where video music etc stored is file sd-card blackberry

891481
web-config	app-config
haven t tried this so not sure if this will work for you but you could try creating your own dialect and registering that in the web-config app-config

891491
munin	cacti
i agree that cacti is awesome but i preferred using munin since i found it easier to create new templates in munin

891502
gethashcode	equals
be sure the objects you are stuffing in the dictionary have a good hash value look into overriding gethashcode and equals for your objects you are using as keys in the dictionary

891505
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms abstracts that away from you with the cunning use of viewstate

891534
unsafe	out
it was the fastest methods i could figure out at the time shy of going unsafe which was what i was trying to replace and maintain comparable performance.

891536
fadein	show
you return a format json from the server with data and handle the success callback jquery fires when the request is complete and add an element to your document you can style however you want and show with things like fadein if you want with a message describing what happened

891554
linux	aix
something that takes 1 second to run on linux takes 45 seconds to run on aix

891564
integer	zero
these are integer types with the extra properties that if you insert a zero into them or if you do not specify a value to be inserted then the next higher previously unused value is applied instead

891574
linux	aix
for scripty type stuff there should be no special considerations for aix so the large body of experience knowledge and example code available for linux will be useful to you

891574
linux	aix
i dont think ibm is dropping aix anytime soon but they are actively porting the standard linux tools to aix and some of the aix tools to linux so the environments are converging

891581
mousedown	mouseup
i ve tried a few solutions mainly involving returning false from the mousedown or click events and although they disable text selection in some browsers they also seem to disable the mouseup event entirely ruining the drop bit of the scripting and leaving this perma-floating icon hanging around the mouse-- not fun

891584
children	nodes
i can t check target s children for relatedtarget b c there s not an easy way to get all child nodes

891593
strtotime	getdate
strtotime possibly combined with getdate localtime or gmtime

891594
cstring	wchar
anything apple exposes on the nsstring class is for cstring char or for unichars but nothing for wchar

891602
32-bit	64bit
i was developing an application of asp.net 2.0 in 32-bit machine but now i have 64bit platform for the same application

891619
attributes	properties
write a function representing the innermost part taking a string the result so far and a tuple of the properties and the attributes and returning the string after the replacement

891619
attributes	properties
use seq.map_concat to go from the arrays of properties returned by getproperties to a sequence of properties attributes tuples

891639
worksheet	excel
to save the file you can use the following in an excel code module alt+f11 when the worksheet is active

891643
output	mode
your program should take as input the output of your encoding mode

891643
any	set
this is only a guideline rather than a rule since i couldn t find any documentation on the precise set of characters supported but you should probably avoid control characters funky invisible combining characters private use characters and the like

891643
pixels	line
0 points for something that is 1000 line of code only to scale the image down treat it as 1 bit per pixels and base64 encode that

891643
python-imaging-library	imagemagick
you may use existing image libraries like imagemagick or python-imaging-library for your image manipulation

891643
linux	unix
if you need some help understanding the unicode character set and its various encodings see this quick guide or this detailed faq on utf-8 in linux and unix

891644
32-bit	64bit
3 it would be worth reading the msdn article on migrating 32-bit managed code to 64bit to ensure you don t have any interop serialization etc

891645
sql-server	ms-access
i have sql-server 2005 db that is accessed by an ms-access database using link tables

891646
user-controls	treeview

i d like the answer for postgresql or failing that mysql -- i m using rails

891669
bug-tracking	fogbugz
i use bug-tracking software at work called fogbugz

891679
any	set
the following methods is called when any of the barrange itemrange or barsize properties of the object are set

891690
contains	any
however i did not understand the answer given to that question and in beautifulsoup-3.1.0.1 beautifulsoup.py does not appear to contains any instances of encodedname or tag.__str__

891714
safari	opera
it works in safari opera and konqueror and for the remaining browsers you may use some javascript

891717
contains	elements
it will however contains an arrays of all the dom elements found which jquery exposes

891717
document	element
so if there was a single element with a class of foo in the document you could do

891732
linker-flags	linker
there are also stack size linker-flags depends on your compiler linker and platform

891736
shell	bash
i cannot yet believe i graduated with a computer engineering degree without ever seeing a bash shell or even hearing about emacs or vim

891740
assign	add
everyone can add tasks and assign them to someone including themselves

891810
value	field
i see that i can give them parameters but only raw objects and also in ireport i can only make field out of simple data types but most of my value are rendered in the tostring of my objects so i d like to just return those

891831
web-services	security
the web-services are deployed on oc4j and they have security enabled on them

891831
handler	service
created handler extending javax.xml.rpc.handler.generichandler for both service which were supposed to be able to process the message

891835
for-loop	arrays
it is essentially the same a for-loop walking an arrays

891848
constructor	object
all the object are immutable and have fixed hash codes which are computed from the values the class gets instantiated with in the constructor

891854
superclass	subclass
inheritance creates a strong relationship between a subclass and superclass

891854
superclass	subclass
subclass must be aware of superclass es implementation details

891858
attributes	properties
it provides an in-memory collection but lets you attributes properties on your objects as indexable so that it can create efficient queries against them

891860
callback	methods
the code sample will fire a file copy asynchronously and once the copy is done it calls the callback methods

891860
updating	updates
in the callback if you dont want to wait for user-interface to updates then you will have to call the user-interface updating code asynchronously

891862
look-and-feel	substance
i finally asked kirill of substance look-and-feel look-and-feel-widget of how he manages to put a button in front of the tabs in the look-and-feel-widget that decorates jtabbedpanes and this is his reply

891872
photoshop	layer
psd is photoshop s format and supports layer

891872
fireworks	layer
i know fireworks uses png with layer but i know a lot of other editors don t support it

891884
background-image	width
the outer container takes the full page width and has a background-image

891884
centering	fixed
as you can see i have given the inner containers a fixed width as well as left and right margins auto as is often suggested as the way to centering a div horizontally

891885
spring	grails
i m trying to make one application with a grails app and a spring app

891885
spring	grails
i ve tried to sneak the grails app into the spring one but this is impossible

891885
spring	grails
it s easier to sneak the spring app into the grails app

891885
spring	grails
grails knows what spring is but spring has no idea of what grails is

891885
annotations	mapping
in this article you can find useful information about how to use your hibernate mapping files or annotations in grails so you don t have to remap everything

891898
contains	set
i would like to set up a dashboard report in ssrs that contains a bunch of sub reports but have the reports that are displayed be configurable at run time

891900
show	next
i try to set hidden no in my viewwilldisappear-event but it does not show before that view controllers disappears and the next one appears

891901
principles	srp
you want to extraction code from one class and put it in a class of its own probably to keep up with the single responsibility principles or srp

891904
contains	any
as you ve realised .endswith will fail if there is anything after the en or if that varies but i don t think it s any more reliable than contains

891908
superclass	inherited
you can t change the implementation inherited from superclass at runtime obviously because inheritance is defined at compile time

891908
inherited	subclass
inherited exposes a subclass to details of its parent s class implementation that s why it s often said that inherited breaks encapsulation in a sense that you really need to focus on interfaces only not implementation so reusing by sub classing is not always preferred

891908
superclass	subclass
the tight coupling provided by inheritance makes the implementation of a subclass very bound up with the implementation of a superclass that any change in the parent implementation will force the sub class to change

891908
subclassing	inherited
excessive reusing by subclassing can make the inherited stack very deep and very confusing too

891909
search-engine	web-crawler
usually it is used to show error pages 404 or 500 http statuses because if you will use redirect instead of server.transfer browser more important if it s a search-engine web-crawler will not receive original http status 404 for example

gridview	listview
what are the advantages of using listview over gridview

891918
gridview	listview
what would i sacrifice if i migrated my gridview to listview

administration	credentials
if user exceeds the allowed copy-limit a dialog box requests him to enter administration credentials or deny him as it would be configured

891946
lgpl	gpl
please note that these are under lgpl and gpl if you plan to copy it but they can be good to look at when making an own implementation

891950
32-bit	64bit
i seem to have problem getting linked servers working to query between database servers running sql2000 32-bit and 64bit sql2005

891951
required	checked
even though the lock prefix doesn t required memory to be aligned and the cmpxchg operation that s probably used to implements interlockedexchange doesn t required alignment if the os has enabled alignment checked then the cmpxchg will raise an alignment check exception-handling ac when execute with unaligned operands

891986
font-size	width
the first line leaves a height for the element the second pushes the text beyond that height font-size depending x3 is just a good starting point the third hides it from display and the last nukes the width of the text

892025
spring	grails
insert grails into an spring app is not easily achievable you can try to insert the old spring app into a grails app and continue from that point

892051
constructor	object
if it s essential that the object is constructed correctly then it s not a bad idea to put the logic in the constructor

892051
default	reset
you should consider putting the logic in another methods - which should be public if you want to be able to reset the object back to its default state

892057
subclassing	inherited
i have a basic class that derived subclassing inherited from it carries the basic functions that should be the same across all derived classes

892057
defined	declare
i can declare virtual-functions and only defined them in the derived classes that are going to use them

892057
derived-class	base-class
but this would mean when changing functions in any derived-class i would have to edit my base-class to reflect those changes

892066
gethashcode	equals
i recommmend simply overriding the gethashcode and equals methods as the compiler warns but as you seem to want to supress them you can do that as follows

892078
value	field
you have to specify the text field and value field properties of t but this selectlist object can be allocated directly to the html.dropdownlist helper

892081
forwarding	port
does mysql dbms provide some interface port which can be connected directly to or is a webserver that forwarding the communication mandatory

892087
virtualbox	vmware
with something like vmware fusion or virtualbox you could install a complete linux system with python2.3 and do your testing there

892088
constructor	private
make your constructor internal protected or private according to your needs and implement a factory pattern

892098
formatting	import
i ve been trying to import the body from email into a field in a sql 2005 database but it keeps losing the formatting carriage returns tabs etc

892101
value	field
i am having 2 models.i want to have model2 inline with model1 .on the admin page i want to show some field of model 2 as a inlines and all of them as readonly.also when i click on the value of the inline i should link me to the model2 with that value

892109
tunnel	vpn
if you re doing this over the internet you should probably use a tunnel or vpn for security

892115
constructor	object
if the constructor calls methods of the object those methods run in a partially constructed object

892115
constructor	object
this can really bite you when you override the method in subclasses in java and c# the subclass implementation will run before the subclass constructor has initialised the extended state of the object and so fail with null pointer exceptions

892115
constructor	object
it makes unit-testing with mock object a bit more complicated if the constructor calls back out to object passes as parameters

892115
constructor	object
if i need to perform more complex logic to initialise an object i write a static factory function that calculates the constructor parameter values and passes them to a simple constructor

892127
attributes	properties
another way is to tag the properties with the designerserializationvisibility attributes specifying hidden do not persist in initialization code

892154
java-me	midlet
if you have only looked at the sun java-me sdk you should probably have a look at the apdu midlet example in the latest series60 sdk and added documentation in nokia s java developer s library

892177
constructor	private
in such cases make sure to make the assignment operator and often also the copy constructor non-usable by inheriting from boost noncopyable or declaring them private

892188
vbscript	jscript
i m a jscript asp coder like you not done vbscript for an age so the above might need a bit of polish i had to stripes out all the

892191
assign	add
i want to sort dictionary based upon value of each dictioanry item.but if i use sorted dictionary search time-complexity will increase from constant to log2 n .so i want to directly assign reference of value list in dictionary to a list.then i can sort this list and get results.i dont want to iterate to each element of dictionary to add its value in list that will increase complexity

892220
mapping	unique
the unique id is marked as a in the nhibernate mapping file

892261
implements	extends
if it gets more complex then you ll probably want to make an outer class that does not implements actionlistener or extends jbutton to handle the data

892261
swing	awt
also note you should be using the eventqueue.invokelater boilerplate to ensure that swing components are only ever used on the awt edt

892269
solaris	aix
not familiar with aix but the following works on linux and solaris

892274
affinity	cpu
you could try to set the interpreter affinity to a fixed cpu and see if this issue still comes up

892286
startup	launch
for that volume you might want to launch a webmail startup and give away email account

892290
command-line	cmd
you should look into pgp command-line - this allows you to perform pgp cmd from the command line

892296
grouping	sorting
as a hopefully related aside last time i looked the implementation of grouping_by preserves the relative order of the data fed to it which can be useful to remember as it allows you to sort the data in the flat list of posts and then when you grouping them the order is maintained within the groupingings rather than dealing with sorting withing the nested data output by grouping_by

892302
moss	wss
what is difference in developing applications using .net asp.net and developing application in sharepoint moss or wss

we also required the ability to verify that the cd-key is valid using a quick checked algorithm so that we can inform the user if the code he enters is invalid

892325
hide	next
i have the following html and i want to hide all lsheader which has no next elements with class contact using jquery

892348
hide	show
i would also suggest injecting an additional stylesheet and use that to show hide and style ugly elements

892350
.when	ready
i have subversion and tortoise install and have subversion install correctly but i would like to know how i can work on files in my htdocs folder from my machine and then commit the files and once i commit they are transferred to my htdocs folder and are ready to view .when i go to the localhost

892361
constructor	object
use a reference member when you want the life of your object to be dependent on the life of other objects it s an explicit way to say that you don t allow the object to be alive without a valid instance of another class - because of no assignment and the obligation to get the references initialization via the constructor

892361
constructor	object
in cases where you want the object lifetime to be dependent on an external object s lifetime and you also need that type to be copyable then use pointer members but reference argument in constructor that way you are indicating on construction that the lifetime of this object depends on the argument s lifetime but the implementation use pointers to still be copyable

892368
type-safety	generics
i am quite comfortable with generics and such but in this special case i have a question concerning the type-safety unchecked cast from

892394
any	set
but this is not working as ruby-on-rails is treating a false boolean as i don t want anything set for this params is there any way to get around this

892442

892446
keyboard	mouse
how to access global mouse movement and keyboard input events

892466
put	get
probably faster and easier to get an image of a compass and put an imagemap on it

892466
selected	button
even better absolutely position radio selected button over the compass points of a background image

892469
change-password	login
so hashes are useful because they change-password login name salt value combinations to a code that cannot be reversed

892489
http	ssl
http ssl are the most common ways to do this

892493
environment	building
once you ve extracted a schema using one of the techniques that were suggested you gain a whole range of new options like the ability to use source control on the schema as well as being able to easily building clean testing environment

892493
environment	building
once you do it s normally fairly trivial to create an option alternative versioning that rebuildings it in a different location allowing you to building test environment from any previous committed versioning of the schema

892499
http	ssl
to stop interception of the network communication make sure you use ssl ie https not http

892558
background-color	height
note you must have overflow hidden otherwise #user1234 does not have a height and you will not see the background-color

892576
external	host
if you ever encountered such a situation and you still insist on using the external ip-address as the host header then you only option is to add the machine name of the web service into the hosts file

892580
any	set
any one of those visual cues would then set a named system event and inside your console app you d have something listening for the same event likely a worker

892585
cygwin	nmake
for that i have nmake utility and cygwin utility too

892586
contains	any
this prints 5 66 7 8 if you type a line contains 5 66 7 8 separated by any whitespace

892613
contains	elements
assuming that gethashcode for every member contains in the list is implemented properly and thus changes when an elements changes i d imagine something along the lines of

892617
any	set
set an event handler for any element that matches a selector even if it gets added to the dom after the initial page load

892625
hide	show
the viewcontroller class simply show or hide the imageview depending on whether data is available

892633
cygwin	gnu
therefore you should use gnu make installed with cygwin

892642
any	set
4 the methods of conversion depends on the character set you are converting to and from and the code pages used if any

892647
delphi	vb6
i am interested to know as to why you want to move from delphi to vb6 classic

892649
directory	folder
if the program you re using is installed correctly it should already be in the program files folder so you could just refer to the configuration file as . config_file.txt if its in the same directory as the program or .. other_program config_file.txt if its in a directory different than the other program

892664
multiplication	division
a string representation d h m this needs division multiplication and basic arithmatic

892680
windows-xp	windows
are there any known issues that might cause this to happen in windows vista and not windows-xp

892688
push	pull
the bookmarks extension for mercurial adds local names and with mercurial 1.6 you can move these bookmarks around when you push pull

892688
perl	ruby
i chose mercurial since it feels clean and elegant -- i was put off by the shell perl ruby scripts i got with git

892697
any	set
until now any stored proc that returns a result of set of filedetails has been placed in the shared.dbml even it is a server-only sp

892698
browser-cache	caching
get requests may be caching by the browser depending on browser-cache size and so on but post won t be caching

892700
required	checked
write the value then checked that it is the value required would seem to be the simplest alternative

892706
value	field
there is no way you can insert the value for a file field

892708
increment	average
each number is increment by one very frequently on average 100 value are updates every second and read very frequently 20 000 reads per second

892715

892716
expression-blend	designer
it s possible that you could convince the designer to use expression-blend

892717
memcached	apc
depending on how much memory you have and how long you have to keep them around - you could just use the apc cache or memcached

892729
javascript	dom
build additional file inputs using javascript dom methods

892733
logout	login
i m using spring-security framework.when i update the permissions it does not take effect immediately.i have to quit the current user means logout and then re-visit means login will be to update the user s permission

892752
32-bit	64bit
most 64bit linux installs do not include 32-bit versions of gtk qt and installing them can be complicated and error prone so you ll need to compile 64bit versions of your application too

892771
updating	updates
that when you say when i updates the permissions you are referring to updating the user s permissions in the database or whatever you are storing data in

892798
union-all	union
also if you can get by with union-all instead of union do so - may be cheaper to not eliminate duplicates

892802
benchmarking	profiling
i would suggest using xdebug php extention to benchmarking and profiling your scripting

892811
arrays	map
i ve read references such as this one that suggest the tiles be rendered in a way that will zig-zag each column in the 2d arrays representation of the map

892835
scheme	let
if you think its a hair brained scheme and can be done better please let me know how

892860
attributes	properties
i d question the srializable attributes on a properties as according to the compiler

892881
inherited	subclass
look in the nhibernate documentation for the table per subclass model of inherited

892888

so you selected the text and then the character is sent to the textbox overwriting the selectedion

892910
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu look to be moving toward kvm

892912
tiff	gif
an ole object column contains images but the image type jpg gif tiff is unknown

892919
windows-mobile	symbian
the language used really depends on the os that it is running windows-mobile symbian linux something home-grown etc

892920
contains	elements
that arrays must be able to contains n 4 3 elements assuming you are working in 3d and therefore have 3 coordinates per vertex

892920
transformation	normals
so if the gpu can t hold all that data normals transformation might be a neccesity

892929
google-chrome	firefox
when the gallery is created in firefox google-chrome etc clicking next moves the image on one and the hover state remains for you to click again

892938
any	set
prototypes being as they are any property or methods that you don t set yourself for supercar will be looked up in car

892938
constructor	object
to wrap up car.call this name in the supercar constructor gives each new supercar object it s own unique name property but without duplicating the code that s already in car

892943
google-docs	spreadsheet
using bdukes answer i have created a google-docs spreadsheet that lists all the new types in 4.0 as of beta 1

892956
attributes	properties
i want to define some properties on a class using the indexable attributes in order to use the class with the i4o library but when i try and compile the code visual-studio says it cannot find the namespace for indexable

892997
python	java
another way of asking how do i get httpservletrequest.getcontextpath ala java but instead in django python

893000
selected	textbox
according to blorgbeard s answer you are selected the text first and then the is typed into the textbox replacing your selection

893022
widget	button
frequently the view in asp.net-mvc is a collection of widget rather than being something which draws the display directly so you end up with nested asp.net-mvc hierarchies anyway the application is asp.net-mvc data model view objects app controllers where the view object has a collection of widget each of which is asp.net-mvc widget state eg button pressed look and feel toolkit binding mapping of toolkit events - widget state

893045
any	set
however if there s any kind of validation error or other exception-handling i set the iserror flag to true and set an error message in the message property

893053
python	perl
the weird behavior is just in the interactive python or perl etc. shell

893063
arrays	map
by drawing an isometric map using drawing in a diamond which i believe refers to just rendering the map by using a nested for -loop over the two-dimensional arrays such as this example

893063
arrays	map
one downside to that approach is that the x and y coordinates of the tiles on the map will increase in diagonal lines which might make it more difficult to visually map the location on the screen to the map represented as an arrays

893063
arrays	map
note the illustrations included in this answer were created with a java implementation of the tile rendering code presented with the following int arrays as the map

893076
json	xml
we are building a restful api for our company which will provide xml json and potentially other content types

893076
put	get
focused on forcing the developer to perform some form of validation of the get post put and delete variables

893076
ruby	php
we already have experience in php but we also have developers who have never written a web application in their life so learning python or ruby or java is acceptable

893084
value	field
gridview display the value of a data source in a table where each column represents a field and each row represents a record

893100
hide	show
the best way that i can think of to do it while still using a textsymbol is to change the point size and if the extent is large enough hide show the element as the extent changes

893123
value	field
when you serialization a serializationd copy of the current value of f s static field

893137
python	ruby
that dynamically typed languages like python or ruby are somehow less qualified for use on large projects

893162
cvs	git
i m looking for an ide for python that will give me a lot of the capabilities i ve grown used to with eclipse not only for refactoring but in terms of code completion project management scm integration currently cvs but likely to switch to git one of these days et al

893163
ruby-on-rails	django
both django and ruby-on-rails come pretty close to fitting most of your criteria except i think that django s documentation is way better than that of ruby on ruby-on-rails

893163
ruby-on-rails	django
i know ruby-on-rails scales pretty well up to a point but i don t know if the same can be said of django

893179
darcs	svn
it has syntax highlighting code folding integration with various scms through the use of additional bundles i know it supports svn git mercurial darcs and probably a few others

893193
continuous-integration	teamcity
in addition to this i am configuring teamcity for continuous-integration

893208
hide	show
to have two button and hide one and show the other

893210
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in firefox ie6 and google-chrome and have seen the same issue

893214
xsd	xml
microsoft office has infopath which takes an xsd as an import and lets you quickly and easily define a form-based editor for creating xml files

893220
logging	trace
if you find you still aren t able to see the information you need you can also try message logging the service trace viewer tool can read those files too

893230
32-bit	64bit
64bit has many advantages for server apps but for desktop apps 32-bit is often completely sufficient

893230
windows	wow64
and as wow64 can be expected to be available for at least a decade there is little speaking against running 32 bit apps on 64 bit windows

893239
rewrite	rule
this rule rewrite any request that can not be mapped to an existing file or directory to the index.php

893251
callback	methods
secondly it s the click methods to assign a callback to the click event

893259
implements	abstract
in java if a class implements serialization but is abstract should it have a serialversionuid long declared or do the subclasses only require that

893260
environment	building
i would assume this is not an issue with hudson directly as it is with the building scripting and or the environment itself

893260
environment	building
is your building scripting relying on certain environment variables being defined or worse the job running from within a certain directory-structure it works if it s run from under home mash blah but not from under another directory like tmp

893266
textwrangler	bbedit
textwrangler - lite free as in beer verision of bbedit

893272
integer	digits
it was in the process of taking the number to be painted dividing it by 10 converting to integer converting back to float subtract and so on just to get the next digits to paint

893281
insert-into	declare
if you have to augment this with some sort of shadow table of users with additional information how about wrapping the oracle account creation in a separate package that is declare pragma autonomous_transaction and returns a sucess failure status to the package that is doing the insert-into the shadow table

893287
msbuild	nant
task from both msbuild and nant

893288
rabbitmq	activemq
projects like apache s activemq or rabbitmq are already widely used and highly tuned and should be able to support the type of load you are talking about outside of the box

893289
enumerator	any
order any enumerator by a property no reflection

893291
exception-handling	try-catch
in the catch section of your try-catch you should write the exception-handling message stacktrace and anything else you may want to a log file -- additionally you could write that data to the windows event log as well

893300
wmv	asf
if compatibility supercedes compression i would recommend asf which is basically just a containers for wma and wmv

893311
document	element
a solution for me would be to run the code to close the menu on any other element click as well as document click

893323
base-class	inherited
basically your generic type becomes a base-class and il is dynamically written creating a concrete class that inherited from the generic but with the new property added in

893327
callback	methods
i ve got a callback methods that is called whenever new data is available

893327
callback	methods
this is obviously a classical producer-consumer problem the bytes are produced by calls to the callback methods and consumed by the begin endread and read methodss

893327
callback	methods
the implementation should use a fixed-size internal buffer so the callback methods needs to block when the buffer is currently full

893330
subclassing	base-class
the serialversionuid of an abstract base-class does get propagated to subclassing

893334
value	field
anyone know whether it will be able to solve data level security for example usera can only enter 500 in this field on the screen or usera can see only these value in the dropdown

893350
contains	elements
assuming that the transform only contains a rotation it s easy just take the acos of the m11 elements

893383
selected	button
i have a code builder page where users selected various radio button and it generate html markup mostly script tags that they can use on their page to display some data

893383
updatepanel	formview
the form exists in a formview control and is wrapped by an updatepanel like so

893418
backwards-compatibility	deprecated
if you read the windows user experience integration guidelines specifically the section on confirmations you will notice that the question icon has been deprecated for a long time so it is only fitting that the task dialog does no longer provide it even though it is still supported for messagebox for reasons of backwards-compatibility

893421
internet-explorer	firefox
this is working fine in internet-explorer but in firefox i get an error in getting the gender from a listbox

893422
any	set
originally i was doing this in another view controllers using a pointer back to this classlist file but once i discovered that didn t work i simplified and tried to just set any sample object and key within the classlist file

893454
integer	numeric
numeric 32-bit integer

893454
numeric	zero
it is trivial to slap a tostring on a numeric value use simple string manipulation to insert a hyphen or spaces or whatever for the +4 extension and use string-formatting to restore leading zero

893455
attributes	properties
so i m thinking along the ideas of decorating some of the properties in the viewmodel with an attributes and then reflecting over the viewmodel and using that name to extract values and coerce from the form object

893471
profiling	trace
you can set up trace to monitor this sort of thing by loading a page and looking at the effects in the profiling

893472
subtract	add
are you going to add subtract multiply divide zip codes

893484
subtract	add
zip code is a not a number in the sense that you add or subtract against it

893489
subtract	add
zip codes don t add or subtract or participate in any numeric operations

893489
numeric	zero
the presence of meaningful leading zero on zip codes is yet another proof that they re not numeric

893490
qpainter	qimage
i saw setcompositionmode in qpainter but the docs say that only works on painters operating on qimage

893491
firefox	opera
other browsers firefox opera safari probably i didn t test it support events like domfocusin domfocusout which are equivalents for ie s focusin and focusout events

893511
compact-framework	.net
i am using .net compact-framework on a windows mobile 6 environment and i need to get a list of modems and the serial port that they re attached to

893511
compact-framework	.net
but unfortunately this is not available in .net compact-framework and i haven t found any other way to do it

893573
client-server	multi-user
the most common pattern in a multi-user client-server application is session-per-request

893573
persistence	hibernate
in this model a request from the client is send to the server where the hibernate persistence layer runs a new hibernate session is opened and all database operations are executed in this unit of work

893584
callgrind	valgrind
i use valgrind and its tool callgrind

893592
double	int
then why double int works

893592
double	int
there is a standard implicit conversion from int to double and there is an equality operator that takes two double so this works

893601
selected	button
for example instead of selecting the datagrid with the mouse the user just clicks a button and the datagrid is selected

893612
javascript	dom
you could do something similar with googles results html either server-side or client-side javascript dom traversal

893614
perl-module	xml-twig
my xml-twig perl-module comes with such a tool xml_grep where you would probably write what you want as the -t option gives you the result as text instead of xml

893632
base-class	inherited
at this moment the base-class holds too much information in my opinion and we may divide it in three pieces the most basic and necessary information for 99 of the pages on a base view model and then a model for the lists and a model for the forms that hold specific data for that scenarios and inherited from the base one

893649
numeric	zero
however the very real drawback of storing them as numeric types is that you ll lose the ability to easily see if the data was entered incorrectly has missing value or if the system removed leading zero leading to costly operations to validate potentially invalid zip codes that were otherwise correct

893651
value	field
arrayss are different if the element type of the arrays is blittable a value type with no non-blittable field then the arrays can be pinned

893658
delphi	c++

but you need to remember that in order to recreate your stuff you will probably need your exact configuration you did it with in the first place and that not only means your source code but also your build environment your ide maybe even other libraries generators or stuff in the exact configuration versions you have used

894936
versioning	upgrade
i have run into trouble in projects were we upgrade our build environment to newer versioning or even to another vendors where we were unable to recreate the exact binaries we had before

894937

895080
margins	padding
if you don t use this declaration or specify a margin padding for each element each browser will use its own default margins padding for that element and the page will be rendering inconsistently across different browsers

margins	padding
basically it s used to reset the margins and padding on every element in the html because different browsers sometimes have different defaults

895087
nspopupbuttoncell	nsmenu
if you really need to roll this yourself rather than using one of the built-in controls that show a menu you can create an nspopupbuttoncell and use that to show the nsmenu

895089
margins	padding
this is part of the â œcss resetâ theory.this eliminates all difference in padding and margins across browsers its very heavy on the rendering agent to apply rules to every single element in the document especially with large web pages and this can also destroy a lot of good default styling especially when you want to have default styled submit button

895093
margins	padding
resetting the margins and padding of all elements is something you can do more specifically and in my opinion better with other elements element grouping and classes

895094
margins	padding
as tf111 explained the idea is to get rid of the browser specific settings for margins and padding that are different across all browsers

895237
put	get
as developers many of us rely on the output of the computer science world to further our development tools in fact without them many developers would be left floundering but put a computer science graduate in front of a user and get them to design a meaningful piece of software for them and the academic intellect is going to fall to pieces because the two speak completely different languages

895762
mongodb	couchdb
i was wondering if anyone can tell me if mongodb or couchdb are ready for a production environment

895762
mongodb	couchdb
how are you using mongodb couchdb

895767
.net	wcf
should i be using .net remoting ie 2.0 or wcf or another technology stack

environment	building
i regretfully wind up putting a lot of derived sources under source control because i work remotely with people who either can t be bothered to set up a proper building environment or who don t have the skills to set it up so that the derived sources are built exactly right

895788
autotools	gnu
and when it comes to gnu autotools i am one of those people myself

895788
environment	building
this sort of difficulty probably applies more to part-time volunteer open-source projects than to paid projects where the person paying the bills can insist on a uniform building environment

895798
value	field
1 register an event receiver in the field editor and use it to set the value of the field

895798
value	field
2 if you want to preview the value in edit new forms calculate the value in the field control

895798
value	field
this requires your field to be order below the fields you base your value on otherwise you will end up calculating your value based on old data

895805
mongodb	couchdb
i don t know anything about mongodb but from the couchdb faq

895816
entity-framework	ado.net
there has been a series of posts on the ado.net blog discussing the enhancements that are being made to the entity-framework in .net 4.0

895819

why i want to do this i ve set up a bare empty git repo on our netapp filer where it will be backed up but i want to work with a clone on my local hard drive and push and pull back and forth

895820
ironpython	cpython
ironpython is a great solution but i keep going back to cpython for windows

895840
any	set
set the trust settings local or on server i suppose so that any files from a specific sharepoint are always trusted

895853
create-table	alter-table
the ones that manufactured their storage schema by executing statements like create-table and alter-table were surprisingly the ones easiest to maintain

895878
markup	xhtml
so as ugly as the formatting or output from the designer in visual-studio can be it is more likely to work in more browsers than would properly formatted markup such as xhtml

895884
decimal	octal
the 033 will get replaced with 33 octal which is 27 decimal by the compiler

895885
put	get
it seems for the moment the best way to get an interlockedswap is to put a critical section around to ensure the steps don t get split

895895
updating	updates
the clustered index is the physical table so whenever you updates any row you re updating the clustered index

895896
perl	php
whether you use php or perl is moot from a scaling perspective much in the way that the difference between a webapp written in php and c is moot

895900
distance	polygons
so i was trying to get point distance the point is within the polygons to the edge of the forested polygons

895901
exception-handling	try-catch
wrap all methods calls in a try-catch exception-handling ex elmah.errorsignal.fromcurrentcontext .raise ex

895911
linked-list	arrays
but then i realized i m going to make each item in the arrays point to a different c-string the in the struct userlist linked-list rather than modify the data already being pointed to

895913
distance	polygons
if you want to find the nearest edge you basically want to iterate across all of the line segments the polygons defines doing a line-segment-to-point distance calculation

895923
distance	polygons
google has a wealth of results for distance from point to polygons edge

895947
puts	gets
note scanf with unadorned s is as bad as gets because it puts no limit on the amount of data that will be slurped in

895949
python	java
this is just speculation but i think they will implement a count method in java similar to their python implementation

895960
decrement	increment
as a rule of thumb you need to balance the calls to methods that increment a retain count with methods that decrement it

895960
decrement	increment
init retain increment it while release decrement it

895964
linked-list	arrays
your function fills in an arrays of strings from data contained in a linked-list

895968
contains	elements
plus you can only swap the depths of elementss that are all contains by the same elements - nested elementss one inside the other cannot jump out of their nesting

895975
contains	any
having database credentials in a special file usually db.properties or some simple xml file that contains the required information driver url username password any orm parameters if needed

895999
.net	wcf
msdn says remoting is now legecy stuff .net 3.0 in favor of wcf

896001
javascript	dom
it was designed as a dom tool but can be easily adapted to be namespaced and to act as a full-stack javascript framework

896006
schema	rdbms
an rdbms is one option though your schema will be rather non-relational and you won t be able to take advantage of some of the powerful relational tools that the rdbms offers you

896012
javascript	dom
they work very very hard on making the selector engines in libraries fast but it s still dog slow compared to normal javascript operations like looking up a variable in the local scope because it has to interact with the dom

896012
document	element
especially if you re using a class selector like that jquery has to loop through basically every element in the document looking at each class attributes and running a regex on it

896013
push	pull
you have to have control of both apps of course and change app1 to support either on a push or pull model the data transfer to app2

896023
panels	grid
in silverlight 2 the easiest solution is to replace the rootvisual with a panels like grid or canvas and have your own code to switch the child elements which are usually your own user-controls

896033
json	xml
it provides structured xml and json and raw output for domain name whois lookups

896041
physics-engine	box2d
i ve used the box2d physics-engine and its solver could handle more balls and it is much more accurate

896050
decrement	increment
to overcome these limits you ll need to keep for each kind of entity you want to count a counter that gets increment everytime a new entity of that kind is put decrement when an entity of that kind is deleted

896055
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
if the view controllers is added to a view hierarchy through code the view controllers will not get viewwillappear or viewdidappear messages

896064
python	c++
i m not sure about the python syntax programming in the c++ version of wxwidgets normally

896074
textbox	button
i have a single windows winforms app with multiple textbox and i need to print the entire form once a print button is clicked

896080
directory	folder
check the installation folder for your copy of pygame and if it s there modify your python installation s font path to include that directory

896082
sendmessage	message
if the methods that you want to execute on the remote application are simple you could also use sendmessage postmessage to send a windows message to the other application and triggers operations to be executed

896093
message	alert
one type of email i d like to the framework to send is an alert mail message that is essentially a regular mail message except with alert prefixed to the subject line another might be a email contains a list of order items but i m not sure of where the responsibility falls for converting the list to a string for an email lies

896095
locale	french
for me it seems like a bad design especially if you don t intend to use a property file with different languages and change to say english or french depending on locale

896114
click	mouse
so after doing a drag drop in order to make it fire you have to do something else like a mouse click focus hit a key anything

896122
json	xml
another option is to store the relevant keys and common search values in regular columns and put the rest in an xml column or equivalent formatted text json or whatever works for your app

896125
directory-structure	subdirectories
create a directory-structure based on the company name or ticker with subdirectories for each date

896131
versioning	upgrade
i have used beast to sponsor a forum and would like to upgrade and move the deployment from ubuntu to os x on a more recent versioning of ruby on ruby-on-rails

896139
linked-list	queue
usually when i use other types such as linked-list or treeset the reason is for functionality and not performance - for example a linked-list for a queue

896139
linked-list	hashmap
i do sometimes construct arraylist with an initial capcacity more than the default of 10 and a hashmap with more than the default buckets of 16 but i usually especially for business crud never see myself thinking hmmm...should i use a linked-list instead arraylist if i am just going to insert and iterate through the whole list

896145
curly-brackets	braces
in other languages like c++ java c# etc you ve got curly-brackets abound so using a movement like di can easily find a matching curly braces and act on that block

896179
value	field
for example certain field can only be updated when the status property has a particular value

896180
return-value	arguments
this serialization deserialization happens to both the arguments coming in and the return-value going out

896180
lookup	any
if you have a cluster of glassfish java ee application servers running an e-commerce application each customer s requests are load-balanced to any available server and that server must be able to lookup the customer s session state customer name shopping-cart etc.

896190
linked-list	arrays
those are definitely my default although often a linked-list would in fact be the better choice for lists as the vast majority of lists seem to just iterate in order or get converted to an arrays via arrayss.aslist anyway

896215
google-chrome	firefox
for example ie6-8 get an iframe element with id of ie_historyframe google-chrome safari get a safari_rememberdiv and firefox gets a firefox_anchordiv

896217
telnet	tcp
plus to tcp socket programming you must understand how telnet protocol works for that you can refer to rfc request for comment documents

896224
keyboard	mouse
i ve got the mouse and keyboard control part but now i needed an ocr to process the screenshot

896228
export	report
also print preview would sometimes not allow the users to run a menu item to export the report to excel or others

896228
export	report
so you had to right click on the previewed report to get some type of internal focus back on the report so they could then export it

896231
having	select
i am having trouble with the select new... part

896244
arrays	loops
my advice read up on data types integer real character arrays dimension input output read write open close rewind and loops do for and you ll be doing useful stuff in no time

896251
one-to-many	entity
in my case i have a company entity that has one-to-many relationship to contacts my linq-to-sql entityset

896253
httpwebrequest	webrequest
and why does httpwebrequest.create make a webrequest not a httpwebrequest

896262
canvas	pixel
see also javascript - get pixel data from image under canvas element

896265
selected	button
when there is no data missing you can selected the field and hit the backspace button and the data will appear minus the one character you just errased

896265
sql-server	ms-access
i am new to sql-server and i have used older versions of ms-access for a few years

896276
dependency-injection	abstract-factory
look up the abstract-factory design pattern dependency-injection and inversion of control

896276
spring	guice
you can roll your own solution easily enough or use a framework like spring guice or pico

896288
groovy	java
knowing just how well groovy and grails excel at integrating with existing java code i think i might be a bit more optimistic than michael about your options

896288
spring	grails
any spring beans you might have can be specified in an xml file as usual in grails-app conf spring resources.xml or much more simply using the spring bean builder feature of grails

896288
groovy	java
because of groovy s tight integration with java you ll be able to create objects load them from the database modify them save them validate them etc

896295
processor	cpu
this is discussed because the cpu will automatically store accessed memory in cache close to the processor

896298
boolean	int
there s nothing special about boolean or int they were just convenient types

896302
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

896320
spring	jsf
i ve worked with jsf spring asp.net-mvc and struts and i think i got a good level on these frameworks

896322
subset	unique
considering the set a a a d d d c g h z z your goal is to list all its unique subset in order except the empty set

896322
integer	digits
if the i th digits of the integer is 1 fetch the i th element from the set

896329
any	set
this works because notfound is set when fetch is executed and there aren t any more rows to fetch

896332
put	get
i m not sure exactly what you mean but if you take the background off the a and .currentpage and put the following on the li you get something maybe closer to what you want

896334
boost	stl
use of boost and the stl is required to employ many of his techniques

896348
digits	base
instead of counting in binary count each digits in a base dependant on the number of each letter

896353
groovy	java
btw grails is not considered as a java framework its for groovy

896353
groovy	java
groovy has the capability to work with java seamlessly but thats the different story

896353
groovy	java
yes its about groovy and like java its awesomely good

896353
groovy	java
groovy follows the notion code less do more whereas java is something like code more do more

896366
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

896380
hash	md5
why not use encryption to store the passwords in the database such as md5 because they will return different hash versions for example

896391
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

896397
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

896401
for-loop	loops
if data is a as you suggest you can use a for-loops rather than a for each loops

896407
groovy	java
the groovy syntax is much terser than java it s much easier to do things in one line of groovy code that would take you several in java

896407
spring	grails
grails specifically provides you with a number of advantages over other web frameworks i can only talk for struts 1.x 2.x and springmvc however - grails is actually built on top of springmvc by the way and you can integrate other components using spring

896408
content-length	http-headers
only applicable if air allows access to the appropriate http-headers content-range content-length

896408
udp	tcp
hand roll your own tcp or udp protocol exchange

896411
populate	row
furthermore i have a table which has a percent of total column the given row s quantity s percentage of the sum of the quantities for all rows which needs to be populate with the proper value via bindings

896412
web-deployment	web
with regard to the javascript files what i do is use web-deployment projects to pre-compile the web app

896418
any	set
output of the set of commands that you run an example of the file or any more details

896422
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

896440
set-union	set
here s some code for unordered_set_difference you can tweak it to make the versions for set-union and set difference

896440
contains	elements
note if bucket occupancies are high it s probably faster to copy each hash into a vector sort them and set_intersection them there since searching within a bucket contains n elements is o n

896445
constructor	object
alternatively you can of course also create an instance of wshttpbinding and endpointaddress in code and set the necessary properties if any and then call the constructor for the client proxy with this ready made object thus overriding the whole app.config circus and creating whatever you feel is needed

896447
dependency-injection	inject
and inject list of databases using dependency-injection using a di framework like castle windsor spring.net etc either by setter or ctor injections to your manager class

896473
getter	setter
they have a lot of properties with getter s and setter s and not much else

896480
instance-variables	class-variables
for the same reason i m confused as to why in one context class self can define class instance-variables while in another it seems to create class-variables such as here

896482
httpwebrequest	webclient
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false

896483
aiff	wav
it will play virtually any file format aiff wav mp3 aac keep in mind that you can only play one mp3 aac file at a time

896486
instance-variables	accessor
think of the class as contains a dictionary of members including all the accessor and instance-variables

896510
command-line	cmd
it s definitely a bug in dtexec - i had a similar problem setting an integer value via the set cmd on a dtexec cmd-line that complained further in the package execution the output variables was of the wrong type when returned from a stored procedure

896511
svg	vml
you will need to either use an image or vml svg

896511
svg	vml
please note that ie doesn t natively support svg and no other browsers support vml but there is an svg to vml wrapper

896518
dijit.form	dojo
basically you need a controllers action that returns the json for your data store and you need to include some dojo to bind the data store to your dijit.form element

896519
button	popup
i want to show a modal popup when a user click on an asp button

896519
selected	button
the value of the option selected must be saved to an input hidden and then the asp.net button must do a postback

896535
export	report
so i often avoid the headache of export directly to excel and providing a view of the report which is copy and pastable into excel instead

896535
row	col
all i did was write a format methods which i could pass in as parameters what the header prefix suffix row prefix suffix col prefix suffix and table prefix suffix

896550
repository	entity
i have almost completed implementing my repository pattern by having a interface a newsrepository class and a news entity

896550
subclassing	base-class
2 how do i pass into the base-class on the updates methods the subclassing getviolations and map methodss please

896565
value	field
a variant on the theme is to have a value for field you don t want updated like keep_old_value ideally this will be 0 or null

896575
order	add
if you have a way to determine which image should the selected return then you can add a where and maybe an order by in the sub-selected

896631
firebird	mysql
this particular method is tightly coupled to an sqldatareader so you d have to rewrite it for it to support say access or oracle or mysql or firebird or whatever

896638
directory	folder
basically what i need is to take a path to a file or directory on a local machine or preferrably on a share on a remote machine and get the list of users grouping and the corresponding permissions for this file folder

896660
click	mouse
probably not as long as you re using dcop to perform some task that would ordinarily be done with a mouse click or hotkey

896668
linux	unix
if you have the unix linux core utilities at your disposition there is

896669
configuration	environment
but with the problem is the same with those in a web environment namely asp.net almost all of the references for user controls for example let s suppose with assembly name in their path for a virtual path provider scenario are coded a string references not to mention the configuration files and other external reference sources - unfortunately even resharper doesn t found all

896680
iostream	boost
the boost format library brings this functionality to iostream for those who need it with defined behavior throws an exception rather than undefined behavior as is the case with printf

896685
children	tree
children should also know their parents so we have like a doubly linked tree

896688
environment	building
cmake enables you to describe your building environment with common settings specified in only one place

896697
constructor	object
in c++ a constant object would require the compiler to evaluate the constructor at compile-time which i think is still beyond what a c++ compiler can do theoretically you could do it but it is very very hard to do in practice

896701
value	field
when i try to update this field with new value

896714
callback	methods
this seems to be the case but when i include a callback none of the instance methods defined in somemodule are visible in the object

896750
account	api
authenticated api get requests are counted against your user account s tally

896754

896755
python	php
python django doesn t attempt any smart variable replacement like php

896762
callback	methods
you use uinavigatorcontroller and or uitabbarcontroller and you add views for tab bar controller as an arrays for navigator controller you pop up the first view and setup callback methods

896764
directory	folder
then simulate an update with directory of that folder

896764
command-line	cmd
it s not even valid cvs cmd-line syntax -list would have to be a global argument rather than a cmd as it follows directly after the cvs and there is no actual cmd specified

896778
fxcop	nant
also nant contrib has a fxcop task

896807
feedback	account
using both in combinations should make it possible to implements a simple dispatcher that base its decisions on the predictive models and improves them by taking into account actual execution times as feedback reward via reinforcement learning

896823
temporary	copy
copy the data to keep into a temporary table

896836
debian	linux
it s more lightweight than anything else and still manage to do the job right so for linux i don t think there are any other options and for ubuntu and probably debian and the rest of them there is even a package vim-rails that contain a lot of scripts to ease up the development

896839
google-chrome	firefox
i ve come to the conclusion that it seems it is possible based on my use of telerik s context menu which works fine on ie google-chrome and firefox

896845
emacs	vim
so i recommend that you use a text editor such as emacs vim gedit or whatever

896845
gnome	kde
the kde gnome terminals are more than good enough

896845
bash	zsh
you might want to look into using zsh instead of bash

896850
jquery-slider	slider
i m about to try and implement the jquery-slider into an old classic asp store where the slider would control the price range

896856
checkbox	button
that said it is a convention in user-interface design to place labels to the right or radio button and checkbox

896869
detect	move
in fact you have to add custom code to enable updating add an appropriate control textbox combo datepicker etc that does allow editing hide it at design time then at run time detect which grid cell should have focus move and size the control to fit the cell then make it visible then handle events to validate the input then write the contents back to the recordset.

896872
jquery-slider	slider
sure just use the jquery-slider or any of the slider found with the google

896874
stderr	stdout
in addition i want to be able to read the stdout stderr of these processes and search for keywords in the output

896879
groovy	java
grails adds groovy goodness to existing java frameworks and provides the tooling to use it easily

896879
spring	grails
grails web part groovyfied spring asp.net-mvc like jon points out

896911
traversal	parent
this specialization lets you have parent s and children to link between other hierarchies in a completely traversal way

896914
pascal	delphi
free pascal lazarus can compile some forms of delphi apps to wince arm

896924
put	get
instead use jquery live events and put regular html in the info windows then use ajax calls with jquery to get the interactivity you want

896942
seam	jsf
this is one of the features of seam where they have tried to improve on standard jsf

896943
ref	out
if the value of the variables is used for returning deciding or calculating other value from the methods call do not use ref neither out

896956
show	next
now gitk will show the yellow commit right next to the master marker and git push will be working again

896961
ref	out
not sure if this is really answering your question but one good usage of passing a value by ref using the out keyword i have found is.

896974
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.10 gecko 2009042316 firefox 3.0.10 gtb5 .net clr 3.5.30729 firephp 0.2.4

896982
decimal-point	numeric
i would just remove any non numeric character thatâ s not the decimal-point

896986
stderr	stdout
this will detach scripting from calling process and redirect stdout and stderr to nowhere or to logfile if you want...

897004
triggers	insert
in the bundle editor you can create a snippet that insert nsuinteger and has a tab triggers nsui

897015
pylons	django
if you really don t want to delve into the frameworks - and you should i heartily recommend django or pylons - there s still need to go down the road of cgi

897019
gnome	kde
it is also possible to lock down kde and gnome gnome at least has a built-in tool which you can also use to lock down the rest of the system

897033
command-line	cmd
currently svn cmd are built up and executed on the command-line which feels like a major security vulnerability

897056
dbd	dbi
then under dbi you can use either a direct oracle driver dbd oracle or an odbc driver aptly named dbd odbc

897071
selected	cells
in my uitableview sometimes cells stay selected after touching

897075
stderr	stdout
for each process i actually ended up redirecting the stdout and stderr to a temporary file then periodically checking the file for updates and dumping the output into a textview

897085
directory	folder
beacause maven didn t get the workspace.html from the .war directory but got it from the public directory i had to remove the folder from the path of the scripting block

897097
mouseup	keyup
would mouseup and keyup do for this purpose

897099
command-line	cmd
do note that this is dangerous anybody who can get you to pull changes into your repository can now insert arbitrary hooks into common-hgrc and you will execute them on the next mercurial cmd even a safe cmd-line hg status

897107
twitter	tweets
can i fetch the tweets from twitter if i know the tweets s id

897120
webrequest	webclient
many upload classes is not using like webclient webrequest webresponse

897129
twitter	tweets
if you know the status id you can get the tweets by scraping the page getting the html and parsing it or more securely through the twitter api

897135
configuration	environment
in configuration environments you have scripts for each environment that allow you to apply environment-specific settings

897141
environment	building
i also need to be able to building the package under a windows environment since some tools in my building chain are windows-only

897156
dbd	dbi
you will need to use dbi and you are probably best using the dbd odbc provider from cpan

897162
getter	setter
this is a little confusing behavior for those who know java-like getter setter where you have to define them for every class member you want to access

897162
getter	setter
when it s comfortable to use java-like getter setter - you may write something like this

897162
getter	setter
and then use this code by defining custom getter setter

897170
value	field
the solution is to declare all field transient but then you have the issue of how to store the value

897176
put	get
simply put i want to call public static-methods decorated with webmethod attributes inside my code-behind c# file from jquery.ajax to get some json and other simple stuff in different functions

897180

to clarify a little more i m not looking for a way to process .csv files i m looking for a bit of code that can logging into gmail yahoo mail hotmail aol and pull out the users address book

897183
.net-framework-version	.net
when you want to install the exe on the client machine you should be installed .net framework on that mc because applications and controls written for the .net-framework-version 2.0 require the .net framework redistributable package version 2.0 to be installed on the computer where the application or control runs

897192
webrequest	webclient
many upload classes is not using like webclient webrequest webresponse

897193
input-field	checkbox
the easiest solution is probably to do something like the network password field in vista have a checkbox that toggle between a normal input field and a password field and choose a sensible default or if the login is not sensitive anyway just use a plain input-field

897197
jquery	.post
i m too new to .post a link but if you google library for simple drawing with jquery you may find what you re looking for

897214
instances	self
self is bound to foo in this code block so k is an instances methods of the eigenclass of foo which makes it a class methods for foo

897243
contains	elements
it contains cross-platform user-interface elements

897249
ref	out
the code below generates a warning cs3006 overloaded methods mynamespace.sample.mymethods int differing only in ref or out or in arrays rank is not cls-compliant

897251
constructor	private
this information needs to be stored in the message reader in some way and my approach was to set a private final arrays from the constructor

897257
glut	fltk
fltk provides modern gui functionality without the bloat and supports 3d graphics via openglâ and its built-in glut emulation

897258
type-safety	generics
the type-safety generics were supposed

897281
opensuse	ubuntu
they also have packages available at sites such as getdeb for ubuntu and packman for opensuse

897304
required	checked
to checked if you have successfuly uncommented required driver

897306
hide	show
hitting the hide link will toggle it to show and make the content of the password field starred

897306
hide	show
if so the hide show toggle would be an opportunity to describe why one should hide their password

897310
void	main
secondly the return-type of main must always be int never void

897311
lighttpd	apache
this works with apache and lighttpd out of the box and no rewrite rules are needed

897312
key-value	key
also note that when the form is loaded in the load event it still works correctly and the there i can save the primary key-value which is the primary key contains in the first record

897320
pascal	delphi
both work fine with delphi up to version 2009 and with free pascal

897328
selected	cell
seeing as you ll be putting it in that tiny cell i assume you wont be needing the selected your currency headline

897331

in the following code i set up a change handler on a selected box to show and hide some follow up questions based on the value of the selectedion

897343
radio-button	selected
i need to open a new windows from code-behind on postback if a specific radio-button is selected

897345
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if however you are using the webforms engine but using a asp.net-mvc style folder structure

897346
hide	show
basically give classes to indicate what to show and hide and then there is no tracking required

897364
rewrite	rule
so can anyone suggest a rewrite rule for creating above url

897378
fdt	swc
if you re using fdt you have an option to auto add the swc as arguments

897380
contains	elements
you access at the arrays that contains pointers to other arrayss in his 5th positioning get the pointer let fpointer his name and then access the 6th elements of the arrays referenced to that arrays so fpointer 6

897383
show	next
it makes no sense to show an autofield to the user as it s an autoincremented primary key -- the user can not change it and it will not be available before saving the record to the database where the dbms selectes the next available id

897384
output	mode
on windows you have to open the file with an ofstream not a wofsteam in binary mode and write the output just like it is done in the original post

897414
contains	elements
so if the arrays contains elements of type t a reference to the arrays has type

897442
file-access	filesystems
php lays behind apache and has file-access on filesystems level using fopen-like or include-like etc.

897443
command-line	cmd
the main power of building from the delphi cmd-line compiler is standardization - you explicitly identify the options on the cmd line in the .cfg files etc and the compiler follows the options provided exclusively

897445
show	next
i have a page which should show a form with checkbox postback if it is checked or not store the result in the database and then on next loading of the page show the checkbox as checked and updates it as unchecked as necessary

897447
base-class	inherited
then created a base-class which it inherited from ipagedlist

897448
updatepanel	gridview
according to me using an updatepanel wrapped around a repeater datagrid gridview will be a much more easier-to-implement approach

897451
input-field	selected
what is not explictily mentioned but what my personal rule was is that you should be able to selected the tweeted message in your browser copy it to the clipboard and paste it into a text input-field of your decoder so it can display it

897462
base-class	inherited
then define the methods and operators in a base-class with a protected constructor and define point and vector as leaf subclasses of this base-class so that they inherited its functionality

897470
json	xml
this could be json or xml if you want javascript to parse out the response and generate the list or the html content itself to be added to the page

897477
macports	fink
i m trying to avoid the macports fink route

897491
implements	abstract
in this pattern your base updates does all the work calling helper methods in order and your derived classes implements those protected abstract helper methods

897494
having	select
i am having a status field which has 3 options 1 activated 2 rejected 3 pending.if user select rejected status then he has to enter reason for rejection else that reason field should be hidden.or when user choices rejected i should redirect it to some other form so that i can send email using the rejection reason

897517
webserver	upload
the straightforward way to do this is to generate the content of the file write it on the file system and upload it with curl to the webserver

897525
factors	primes
has a factors among all the preceding primes

897531
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in webforms i used to create weebservices and pagemethods to be able to call json results with jquery so is this needed anymore with asp.net-mvc

897540
linux	minix
if you re still put off by the linux kernel then there s always the minix kernel.

897568
windows-server	windows
a colleague has a batch script program which needs to to run on a windows-server in console mode so that it has access to a windows interactive session

897575
32-bit	64bit
most commonly it is used with reference to compilation for architectures that are not binary-compatible with the host -- for instance building risc binaries on a cisc cpu platform or 64bit binaries on a 32-bit system

897587
configuration	logging
examples of topics to brush up on include office integration workflows import export mirroring configuration settings logging url rewriters page providers extending the wysiwyg editor language handling search controls caching.

897592
configuration	logging
following the advice from the developers i am now ignoring it by changing my logging configuration in conf jboss-log4j.xml

.when	ready
.when a new resource is created and it needs to do some lengthy processing before the resource is ready how do i send that processing away into the background where it won t hold up the current request or other traffic to my web-app

897619
apache-mina	mina
probably the mina network application framework as well as apache-camel for messages router are the good start point

897625
jquery	dojo
for further details on javascript frameworks see so question â which javascript framework jquery vs dojo vs â

897634
boolean-expression	operators
c# designers decided to require a boolean-expression as the condition for if while etc. and not allow casting of types unless they explicitly declare an overloaded operators which is discouraged to boolean to reduce the chance of errors

897718
.net	wcf
i have a .net 3.5 sp1 wcf service running under iis 7 on a windows 2008 machine

897718

897718
credentials	security
no credentials are available in the security package

897724
databound	gridview
i have an asp.net 3.5 page with a gridview databound to a generic list of objects

897733
hash	md5
one more thing relying on md5 hash alone for identifying files is not safe you re better off using the file name as the identifier which is guaranteed to be unique within the folder

897733
hash	md5
there are collisions in md5 two distinct files could have the same md5 hash the probability is small but existent

897750
contains	any
this returns results that match any of the search terms i would like to modify this so each result contains all of the search terms

897754
msbuild	nant
i would like to move to a more powerful build-system such as nant or msbuild

897754
msbuild	nant
how is the developer experience using nant msbuild

897756
attributes	properties
this would require me to add an attributes on every proptery in my classes where i want to invoke the dirty flag logic when the properties is set

897773
authentication	login
this will redirect to the login page and behave just like the usual authentication attribute

897782
.net	wcf
i can t use wcf as the project is developed using .net 2.0

897809
32-bit	64bit
i m fixing a bug with windows-vista 64bit of a 32-bit application when i try to use the function wow64disablewow64fsredirection ... the compiler says undeclared identifier...

897824
click	mouse
when click on a node in a teeview using ownerdrawall it does not get selected until it receives a mouse up which is a different behavior from the standard mode and obviously not correct

897831
http	ssl
if you use http the whole communication after establishing the connection will be transfered encrypted over ssl

897846
excel-vba	vb6
here is a code snippet from excel-vba should work in vb6 with some tweaks

897854
msbuild	nant
use cruisecontrol.net to automate your build process.msbuild is easier to hook up than nant msbuild is found in .net folder.sgear has plugins for cruisecontrol.net there are task plugins you can write and download for msbuild..

897862
bazaar	git
than in bazaar or git

897862
bazaar	git
mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference

897868
post-increment	pre-increment
try it with both pre-increment and post-increment and tell us

897870

897886
profiling	debugging
use a profiling to debugging your application

897904
required	checked
no you can t kill the backgroundworker thread you can only try to cancel it as you noticed but it required some integration from the background-thread itself to stop the work the worker code should periodically checked the cancellationpending property to see if it has been set to true

897925
duplicates	contains
nsset is used when you frequently wish to test for membership of an object but don t care about the ordering and don t need the collection to contains duplicates objects

897929
msbuild	nant
at this point msbuild and nant seem even in a lot of respects

897929
teamcity	nant
nant has plug-ins for most all source code control providers - including vault - and has hooks for most build tools such as cruisecontrol.net and teamcity

897929
msbuild	nant
generally the nant or msbuild files encompass a lot of functionality you normally wouldn t run during the normal quick compilation

897935
type-safety	generics
the matcher class doesn t seem to require it since junit calls the matches method which is not typed with any generics and just looks like an attempt to force a type-safety which doesn t do anything as the matcher will just not in fact match and the test will fail regardless

897955
any	set
the working set is the set of pages that are physically in memory at any one time

897961
compact-framework	.net
our application is built using the .net compact-framework 2.0 and running on windows mobile 5 6 devices

897971
2checkout	payment
and 2checkout seems to mention they accept payment from paypal account

897973
contains	any
you re saying that expected can contains class objects that represent any class that implements serialization

897979
arrays	loops
then loops through the arrays and split again on the reserved character you are using for

897994
contains	elements
if the list only contains a few elements then no big deal

897994
contains	elements
if the list contains thousands of elements you re going to want o 1 lookups into it

898000
deployment	install
in fact most deployment will automatically go away and grab it for the user if it is not install

898003
lookup	any
either way the best way is to avoid doing any lookup altogether

898011
coverity	klocwork
i have not had direct experience with findbugs or pmd but have met plenty of people who have compared them with klocwork and coverity

898011
coverity	klocwork
not surprisingly klocwork and coverity which cost money tend to be more solution oriented that can also scale better to work with teams has a more efficient easier to use user-interface and tends to be less noisy

898011
coverity	klocwork
many companies see value and choose coverity or klocwork for a longer term solution although i see also running findbugs and pmd

898041
hide	show
if they need to edit again just show the textarea hide the div

898079
.net	wcf
or i can communicate with my host using wcf using the sendactivity provided with .net 3.5

898082
attributes	properties
i was considering to make a custom attributes to decorate my properties so that the code that would fill my object from the ad would not need to have the mapping hardcoded but much rather i could just decorate the properties to automatically fill the object

898125
order	join
if the ids in your two tables h and p can have duplicates then you will have to join the order table right in the all_order_items view

898126
mouseleave	mouseenter
however jquery 1.3 doesn t support blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change and submit events as live events

898134
union-all	union
if you delete rows from a_orders as you insert them to h_orders so a given order would not be in both tables it would be quite a bit more efficient to use union-all instead of union

898139
background-color	transparency
most sites where you see such functionality accomplish it with styling - you can style a text input box to look like plain text by removing the border and setting the background-color to transparency

898141
vmware	esx
i ve read about the vmware-cmd tool but believe that is only available with vmware esx not workstation

898148
.when	ready
.when i am ready to authentication i use a response.redirect to route to logon.jsp

898148
http	ssl
if i am using http ssl is this a likely situation

898161
content-disposition	content-type
you could write direcly to the response.outputstream and set the right content-type and content-disposition header

898165
attributes	properties
i like to use attributes for this kind of concern because it helps make it clear in the code that the properties is being used in a certain way

898165
attributes	properties
i tend to find that using attributes helps code maintenance because i don t have to hunt down changes if the properties is removed or modified

898168
basichttpbinding	was
i was using basichttpbinding for streaming transfer when i change binding to nettcpbinding service start to throw exception.

898187
xml-serialization	ixmlserializable
these complex types would be compatible with xml-serialization but they don t implement ixmlserializable themselves

898198
webforms	asp.net
is asp.net mvc destined to replace webforms

898198
asp.net-mvc	webforms
and a few answers were that if the website were public internet to use asp.net-mvc but if it were internal to use webforms

898198
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i do not want to use webforms not that i think i cannot or that it is somehow bad. in this question i am asking specifically about asp.net-mvc and why it would matter for the location of the website public or private.

898231
embedded-resource	resx
however if i change the build action on the resx file to embedded-resource the resources aren t available even though they re in the dll that gets built

898239
value	field
additionalfielddata fielddataid pk entityid fk fieldid fk fieldvalue this is the table relating the entities to the their respective value for any additional field added by the customer

898239
value	field
since i want to easily search across these i will simply require that all additional field have string value

898255
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram with in-place schema editing

898261
webforms	asp.net
to me the advantage of asp.net webforms is that you can develop them more quickly than asp.net mvc

898261
webforms	asp.net
if you have invested a few years to slim down asp.net webforms you can probably use them for internet applications

898263
asp.net-mvc	webforms
so developing it with asp.net-mvc can be overkill instead of slapping together something with webforms

898268
parallels	vmware
i ve started looking into whether vmware or parallels can somehow be brought into this but there s not much that can be done without hacking the os

898270
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc requires a little bit more work to do some of the same things as webforms but you have more control over what is output to the client

898270
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know there are some websites that i have worked on with webforms that required a lot of hair pulling that simply wouldn t have happened if i used asp.net-mvc

898270
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it is easier for me to deal with jquery ajax requests when using asp.net-mvc as opposed to webforms

898283
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc provides a better separation of concerns than webforms however it does come with some overhead that is harder to justify on smaller projects

898283
asp.net-mvc	webforms
neeless to say webforms can and has been used on large projects as asp.net-mvc can be used on smaller projects

898305
solaris	aix
we have steps that execute across win32 linux64 linux32 hp aix solaris and even steps that are pushed across the world for remote execution

898305
solaris	aix
each of the steps can be setup to run in parallel or series so when hp aix solaris and linux are all doing the same thing they can all run in parallel and the win32 follow-up will wait until everything finishes before continuing

898308
gettext	poedit
i know the use of gettext poedit and wonder if something like that can be used

898313
registration	login
i wrote a custom auth backend to allow people to login using their public name or their email address and i enforce the uniqueness of both of those at registration time

898351
any	set
is there any way to set a background view on a uitableviewcontroller

898360
authentication	login
if so the authentication cookie may be expiring after leaving the app inactive for a long time and if you click the select button you re redirected to the login page but the login page itself may be having a problem that causes a redirection loop to occur which causes most browsers to display the this page cannot be displayed message after a couple of runs of the loop

898360
selected	button
instead of a select link button place a link with the url of the other page and pass the id of the selected item as a url parameter

898394
contains	elements
when it comes time to query the elements i m forced to use fully-qualified elements names because that xml document contains an xmlns attributes in its root

898431
conditional	operators
for example ternary operators conditional

898432
double	int
if i declare a static variables of a fundamental type char int double etc. and give it an initial value i imagine that the compiler simply sets the value of that variables at the very beginning of the program before main is called

898439
windows-xp	windows
if your application needs to work on windows-xp 32-bit or windows 2000 you should use loadlibrary and getprocaddress as canopus suggested because wow64disablewow64fsredirection and wow64revertwow64fsredirection were not added until windows-xp 64-bit and server 2003 sp1 according to the documentation

898457
defined	declare
your constructor declare and defined a local static-variables which just so happens to have the same name as the class static member variables

898457
defined	declare
then when you try to link against the class member in the other methods the linker discovers that it is declare but not defined so it gives up

898467
right-to-left	hebrew
arabic and hebrew are right-to-left and may need radical changes to layout

898477
specifications	w3c
xml perhaps...im not sure if i would be within the bounds of the w3c specifications with my data to do so

898483
freebsd	osx
if most frequently means the actual number of calls in some run of the program dtrace could be the tool you are looking for assuming you have a solaris freebsd or osx box for development work

898490
shell	bash
it is also in my default shell pdksh and bash the linux default shell for the most part

898492
stretch	styles
is there a way to dynamically generate the length of the button based upon the length of the text so i probably would just have to create one styles like button and i can apply that to any button and it would shrink or stretch based on the length of the text

898494
formatting	import
i have a report that was originally built in report builder and then import into visual-studio to add some other formatting to it

cherokee	apache
i used to use mod_geoip but recently dumped apache for cherokee which has its own geoip logic

898527
any	set
i can t say i ve had any performance problems with either but cherokee is definitely easier to get set up

898531
image-processing	imaging
the java2d libraries part of the standard jre and the java advanced imaging jai library can t link thanks to stackoverflow being retarded provide other ways to do image-processing directly on image data rapidly without having to roll your own operation every time

898536
having	select
this issue you are having is due to the client s handling of the base select html

898540

898555
web-applications	enterprise
i am going to change my working sphere from enterprise web-applications written for concrete business process to public web sites that will be accessible to all users around

898578
json	xml
the wiki for json also says use the xmlhttprequest method which might get around your limit but you would still need a proxy to avoid cross-domain scripting limitations and use a more sensible mime-type like html xml binary etc

898592
json	xml
also it would be better to use json rather than xml

898592
json	xml
json is usually a smaller payload than xml and many tests have show that it is easier for the browser to load it in

898597
value	field
i have to insert value from one table to another table which both having two fields first field name is id and and second field name is flag

898618
any	set

898631
internet-explorer	doctype
by default internet-explorer uses doctype switching to determine quirks v

898631
x-ua-compatible	compatibility
use of the x-ua-compatible tag overrides compatibility view on the client

also if you ever want to put any other control in your tooltip it won t be focusable since a tooltip itself can get focus

898665
comma	words
is the words college being considered as a repeat or do the comma signify a completely different words

898671
xcopy	cmd
you should be able to write an xcopy cmd to copy the files you need to the right location

898677
put	get
also i have noticed that visual-studio unit test projects sometimes put a deploymentitem attributes on each of the test methods pointing to your target dll and if you switch between debugging and release visual-studio can get confused if the dll is no longer in the expected location

898696
asp.net-mvc	webforms
im very ho using the current version of asp.net-mvc to build for example data entry systems with lots of tabular data inline editing sorting paging filtering etc is quite a lot of work when compared to using webforms

898696
asp.net-mvc	webforms
however if the website is more concerned with presenting content to the end user typical websites blogs e-commerce apps portals asp.net-mvc provides many advantages over webforms

898698
user-input	output
if i understand correctly you want to save sereval user-input strings your example output is a bit misleading because you show only numbers

898724
hide	show
when an admin fieldset is given the class collapse it is rendering with a show hide link install by collapsedfieldset.js which collapses or expands it

898730
contains	any
because of this i wouldn t want my local copies to contains any special characters that the ide interprets as this is an indent please use a tab or a space here as you feel is appropriate

898736
any	set
perhaps have your initial asp.net page perform the first postback with the file on the server-side then stream the resulting page back to the user taking care to set any cookies that were given to you to ensure the session is passed on to the user since it originally belonged to the server-side asp.net code posting the file

898739
selected	cell
you can do this in writer by selected the cell s and going to

898763
subtraction	modulo
integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

898767
python	java
while some ide s support such reformatting of code eclipse intellij for java wing for python vs2007

898769
value	field
â this way you re testing whether the modified string would be too large to fit rather than just checking the individual sizes of the existing value and the addition and you ll not fall afoul of the new paste code in os 3.0 which could add more than a single character to the text field at a time

898772
mime	rfc
if you deliver your .js files using some other mime type for example application x-javascript or text javascript compress that instead or change the mime type used to deliver .js files to the rfc standard

898784
python	perl
forget sharpsvn there are perl and python bindings that work as well or you could just use the svn command line in bash

898784
revision	svn
if using the command line you ll want to search the directory tree for the equivalent file then use the svn log command to get a list of revision numbers for an individual file

898784
revision	svn
you ll also want the svn diff command using the -r option to compare your file with the revision in the repo

898788
selected	cell
tap a tab a table view gets displayed selected a cell a new tab bar view gets loaded

898793
malloc	free
it s not impossible but it s pretty darn close if you re using the standard malloc free new delete calls

898793
any	set
will run the program with dmalloc and you can set flags to wipe memory so you ll know whether any memory has been deleted

898816
command-line	cmd
or just use the cmd-line cmd

898852
itemtemplate	textblock
itemtemplate is a simple datatemplate with a textblock

898858
export	report
such tools let you to design a printing report from your data and let you to either print the report or export it to formats like html doc pdf and so on

898863
dacl	acl
the simplest way to create a dacl is to use convertstringsecuritydescriptortosecuritydescriptor which takes a string in a format called sddl specifying the acl

898864
directory	folder
everything else in this scenario has stayed the same essentially a new website with a static ip-address was created pointing to a new folder where all of the files from the virtual directory were xcopied to

898867
implements	sealed
when implements a sealed class that doesn t use unmanaged resources you simply implement a dispose methods as with normal interface implementations

898876
xapian	sphinx
and the people who can t use sphinx for some reason have opted for xapian

898886
hash	md5
as per chad s post to crack attempt 4 all one has to do is crc32 loads of passwords and then reverse the function he s coded up leaving you with a salted md5 hash and the salt which you would then test for validity

898886
salt	md5
simply test this pair by calculating md5 password+salt where password is the password you are trying and salt is the salt you have calculated by reversing the algorithm

898886
hash	md5
if the md5 equals the first 32 characters of the hash you ve cracked the password

898901
installation	uninstall
i need some way to cancel the installation after validator.exe has been copied and executed maybe call uninstall but i couldn t do it

898903
linked-tables	adp
either an adp or mdb with linked-tables should allow you to do what you want easier sorting reordering columns etc to manage data

898907
firefox	safari
i think some of the nightly builds of safari and firefox can do this but i suspect this isn t what is being asked about

898911
any	set
i ve been watching in profiling but that hasn t given any clues except for occasionally seeing set no_browsetable on set no_browsetable off statements occurring before and after the sp runs

898946
msbuild	nant
found a useful thread on nant vs msbuild here

898973
toast	alert
unfortunately the alert created doesn t allow new lines for the toast popup in windows

a tip try including human-readable documentation such as descriptions concepts getting started usage tips etc in the wadl document s doc element by including html elements using the xhtml namespace

898984
m2eclipse	maven
m2eclipse maven plugin

898988
lazy-evaluation	maybe
the lazy-evaluation list versioning sorta of works by luck maybe by design but that s beyond my current ability to determine - the active-pattern matching it uses while it s constructing and iterating causes the lists to calculate value before the required recursion gets too deep so it s lazy-evaluation but not so lazy-evaluation it needs continuations to avoid stackoverflow

899013
nested	assign
it s still very confusing having nested wildcards but hopefully that makes sense as to why it helps to understand generics by looking at how you can assign generic references to each other

899035
hide	show
the easiest way to manage all this is to create a class that derives from uiviewcontroller and have it implement a show and a hide delegate methods

899035
hide	show
but with a standard show hide interface it should make it easier to manage the flow between screens

899058
double	int
this presumes that your double fall within the range of an int

899061
hide	show
if all your manager is asking from you is to show and hide some elements or fade in and out a couple of images or request some data via ajax and display it then learning jquery and its api is perhaps all that you need

899063
subclassing	base-class
you can create templates methods in a base-class but they have to call methods that exist in the base-class and are overridden in subclassing

899064
google-chrome	safari
css3 supports rotation however at this time only google-chrome and safari support css3 rotation with webkit

899064
google-chrome	safari
in the future or with safari or google-chrome you can do this

899070
any	set
i have verbose set to true but it doesn t want to display any details about my unit tests

899078
lexer	lex
a tool like lex will yield a more efficient lexer because it combines the regexes into one state machine

899089
font-size	height
of course by changing my font-size the box scales with the height of the line it is on

899100
vbscript	jscript
i want to be able to run vbscript or jscript on a server using cscript.exe to manipulate sharepoint through the object model

899117
command-line	cmd
i might try using the cmd-line versions first the convert or composite cmd for example to see if you can make them do what you want

899138
python	java
since java doesn t allow passing methods as parameters what trick do you use to implement python like list comprehension in java

899179
python	java
has tons of tutorials from basic to advanced using opengl from various languages and systems from c to c# and python to java

899205
compression	streaming
write the code to output the documents yourself the delphi streaming classes and compression support should be sufficient

899213
multiplication	addition
a simple example expression involving numbers addition and multiplication this illustrates operators precedence

899215
tetris	pacman
you may want to start with a simpler project such as recreating something like tetris pacman or even pong so you can get an idea of all that goes into creating a game

899226
put	get
a good habit that some c programmers get into is to put rvalues on the left-hand side of comparisons so that the compiler will generate an error if you accidentally use the assignment operator instead of the comparison operator

899227
contains	any
also any file contains null in

899227
filehandle	eof
a null file or a file at eof when testing a filehandle

899230
web-services	api
its api is also heavily geared toward web-services which would seem to be overkill in your case

899249
postgresql	mysql
mysql versus postgresql adding a last modified time column to a table

899266
contains	any
it also answers martin harris concerns - the code on your machine wouldn t contains any special characters just white space between tokens

899268
value	field
the timestamp data type gives you a binary value that automatically gets updated every time your field changes but it won t give you a nice date time value

899270
javascript	dom
my advice learn javascript learn about handling events in different browsers inserting in to the dom and then start using jquery

899300
for-loop	arrays
a for-loop is idiomatic and easy to read especially if you know the size of the arrays user-defined macros are non-standard

899317
webforms	asp.net
i m trying to use asp.net webforms to submit an email but i can t seem to make it work at all

899318
sqlplus	prompt
when one of the parameters is missing the sqlplus prompt for the user-input

899352
any	set
any other difference that may exist are likely a result of a commmand line option being different such as a conditional flag that may be set in the ide settings

899354
margins	padding
otherwise browsers that are a little pickier about such things will refuse to apply borders to your br elements since inline elements don t have borders padding or margins

899357
contains	any
with the addition of the text this is a link as your example didn t contains any text within the a element.

899359
google-chrome	safari
pelms made some further investigations and pointed out that ie8 on win7 and google-chrome 2 safari 4b allows you to style br somewhat

899375
ubuntu	linux
i recently jumped from mac to linux ubuntu and have been missing bbedit

899375
gedit	jedit
after months of bouncing back and forth between gvim and gedit and finding jedit kinda clunky i believe geany is the answer for me

899380
command-line	cmd
if i activate the feature through an stsadm cmd on the cmd-line it always fail but if i do it through the sharepoint user-interface sometimes it fails and sometimes it doesn t

899381
sql-server	ms-access
gp stores data in sql-server and ms-access is being used to access the table data

899382
value	field
considering that xml data comes from a table table and is stored in a column field use the xml methods extract value with xml.value project nodes with xml.nodes use cross apply to join

899382
contains	elements
you can ditch the nodes and cross apply if each field contains exactly one elements person

899390
simpletest	phpunit
i ve looked at several unit-testing frameworks phpunit simpletest and phpt

899412
populate	row
update from and join in the cross apply to split each row and populate the new columns

899412
contains	elements
drop the old column that contains the multiple data elements

899413
any	set
is there any way to access the full set of elements from inside or pass them in as a variables

899414
instances	private
let s start with another behavior even if you declare a methods variables as private another instances of the same class can access it

899414
base-class	superclass
so please explain to me why the base-class superclass can t access private protected variables from its sub-class

899414
subclassing	superclass
i know that the superclass should not know about its subclassing but in my example it makes sense no

899414
instances	private
based on the answers i want to know also why isn t accessing another instances s private variables from the same class considered a violation of encapsulation

899415
web-config	app-config
the way that we do it is to include the connection string in our web-config file app-config works as well

899437
linked-list	queue
if you are using linked-list for a queue you might consider using the deque interface and arraydeque implementing class introduced in java 6 instead

899437
linked-list	queue
than linked-list when used as a queue

899444
tunnel	vpn
a far easier path do you really need a vpn or is there a way you can tunnel over ssl

899455
sql-server	ms-access
sql-server data is typically accessed in ms-access using linked tables which are odbc oledb connections

899458
subclassing	base-class
the whole point of a base-class is to provide for the subclassing but like an over-protective parent what you re suggesting would be too much

899470
margins	padding
you would have to set the padding or margins on the left side of the h4 tag appropriately to push it back out into view again

899473
triggers	insert
you can write a triggers to run every time an insert update is made on a particular table

899500
app-bundle	info.plist
it should be set in info.plist but this is certainly in your app-bundle

899501
google-chrome	firefox
it has been tested in ie 6 7 8 firefox 2 3 3.5b4 safari 3 4 for windows opera 9.6 10 alpha and google-chrome version 2 and it didn t work in any of them

899518
contains	set
if you export all of the frames to individual images you can make a uiimage view set the animationimages property to an nsarray contains all of your frames as uiimages

899531
python	c++
i have experience with c# python barely and visual basic but i am looking into using c++ and breaking away from .net in general before it completely sucks me in

899533
stderr	stdout
note that s closing from 3 up to keep stdin stdout stderr open

899535
children	nodes
this selected all a tags that are children of the nodes with id snav sets all of their disabled attributes to true and sets the specified returning false function to be called upon the click event

899535
.when	ready
the last part a call to with the specified function runs the function .when the dom is ready to be worked on and is a synonym for .when passed a function

899542
object-reference	instances
when i execute the statement below i get a runtime error object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

899574
instanceof	typeof
javascript-garden typeof vs instanceof

899581
superclass	inherited
as well a base-class superclass doesn t know when it has been inherited from

899581
base-class	inherited
to allow a base-class to know when it has been inherited you would have to be able to modify the base-class when inheriting from it

899598
difference	count
they ve figured out the difference and you can count on their reason

899618
expression	evaluation
and all rows for the n columns would have their respective evaluation of the arithmetic expression

899619
python	perl
and perl python javascript and others

899622
selected	cells
to convert a text cell to a number selected the cell and then selected format cells from the menu bar and then on the number tab click general

899629
double	int
it throws an error with primitive-types such as int or double since a cast cannot convert from a string to a numeric type

899642
wxwidgets	mfc
another plus or minus is that it is not modeled after some popular not-that-strictly-oo libraries like mfc wxwidgets go this way but shows an may be the best example of really good large-scale c++ ood so this may be helpful also the sources come for free

899650
emacs	vim
you should also look into vim and emacs as both have extensive sets of add-ons targeted at just what you need

899666
put	get
take a break get yourself a coffee put a breakpoint on the line logger.error... and try again

899694
attributes	properties
what i ve meant with split the tag within linq was generating a collection of strings for each post element so the expected result would be a generic collection of post elements with its attributes as properties where the tag properties is itself another collection of strings with its items being each tag

899709
web-config	app-config
back before i converted everything to use fluent nhibernate and dependency-injection my company s nh libraries were configured to use multiple database and it was configurable through app-config well web-config in this case

899733
hide	show
this starts becoming a nightmare of its own when you want to hide and show certain textfields

899745
value	field
edit i noticed now that the second selector calls the first one but the only thing the second one does is change the value of the overrideselect field

899751
constructor	private
you can use a private constructor thus

899762
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
how can it benefit from the inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged notifications so minimal work is required when implements the models business-objects

899782
gridview	listview
i have do create a menu list of actions which would be easier if made with a control that accepts a datasource like listview or even gridview with templated collumns

899803
javafx	swing
it should be possible to use a swing javafx flex gui by switching out this presentation layer and without the need to change anything on the layers below

899808
flex	jsf
assuming adequate skills in both jsf and flex but not too skilled at ajax javascript and assuming java as the language for the application and using a db which is a good choice or both have equal set of pros cons

899820
constructor	object
for example you could declare a constructor for your custom class accepting an object and initializing it s members with the object properties

899833
contains	any
you can nest to any level arrays of structures contains arrays structures contains arrays of structures etc etc

899837
value	field
i have tried to use mysql table value returned from a subquery as field names before and wasn t successful

899837
value	field
i could never get mysql to accept a recordset value as a field name

899854
triggers	insert
do you really need to log the statement that ran most people log the changed data insert and deleted tables within the triggers

899855
triggers	insert
mssql has virtual tables named insert and deleted which contain newly-insert and or newly-deleted and or newly-updated data records which you can access from a triggers .

899858
internet-explorer	firefox
i have a servlet which is returning a csv file that is working over http in both internet-explorer and firefox

899862
selected	cell
problem i still see the default pretty blue gradient background being drawn behind my cell in the transparent areas when it is selected or highlighted being pressed

899862
selection	highlight
goal to prevent the blue gradient background from appearing but still be able to inspect the cell.isselected and cell.ishighlighted properties from within to determine how to draw my own custom selection highlight

899862
selection	highlight
setting has the desired effect of preventing the pretty blue gradient selection background but also prevents the cell.isselected and cell.ishighlighted properties from being properly set which means i cannot do my own custom selection highlight drawing

899862
selection	cell
setting and in the cell s -init or -prepareforreuse methods does not prevent the blue gradient selection background

899868
ildasm	cil
you can use ildasm to disassembly the assembly into cil code and use ilasm to reassemble that cil code and sign it with your own key

899887
multiplication	division
multiplication is faster than division so the second methods is faster

899891
business-objects	data-access
you should be creating data-access objects daos which are called by the business-objects

899900
data-access	ado.net
i have over the past few projects used a base class which does all my ado.net work and that all other data-access classes inherit

899906
arrays	loops
i ve got a loops to put images standy2 through to standby7.png into an arrays

899908
value	field
do you want an arrays of each value in the tag field

899926
controller	routes
the only important part left to my answer is that controller methods that are not actions should not be public or at least your routes should protect them

899926
protected	public
in the controllers tier helper methods defined on applicationcontrollers should be marked as protected -- if they were private the other controllerss would not be able to access them but if they are public ruby-on-rails will treat them as actions

899926
methods	extend
because i use it often and coming out of my java days i favor protected for all helper methods to give freedom to anyone usually myself who wants to extend the class -- unless i m really really embarrassed about one then i mark it private

899929
multiplication	division
if the latter yes floating point multiplication is generally faster than division
