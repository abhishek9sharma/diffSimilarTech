python	php
i m currently looking at the python framework django for future db-based web apps as well as for a port of some apps currently written in php

20047
profiling	trace
i attached the profiling set up a trace profile using this excellent article on troubleshooting deadlocks and captured a bunch of examples

20049
sql-server	sqlcommand
if you are querying a sql-server database version 7 and up you should replace the oledb classes with corresponding classes in the system.data.sqlclient namespace sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader as those classes have been optimized to work with sql-server

20058
silverlight	wpf
higher-reaching concepts would probably include wpf maybe silverlight as well linq or your orm of choice as well as the vista bridge and related bridging code if your project includes desktop apps at all

20068
python	ruby
i ve also heard good things about scripting languages ruby and python especially for getting kids to learn how to program

20083
python	ruby
what i think the future is for teaching children to program is some sort of dsl built on top of a language with friendly syntax these would include arguably ruby python and scheme whose purpose is to provide an intuitive environment for constructing simple games say tic-tac toe or hangman

20097
attributes	properties
what i normally do is make sure all the xml-serialization attributes are on the concrete class and just have the properties on that class call through to the base classes where required to retrieve information that will be de serialization when the serialization calls on those properties

20114
checkbox	button
click the validation button and uncheck the checkbox for checking validity

20133
32-bit	16-bit
i had one bit flipped wrong so instead of going to 16-bit mode i was going to 32-bit mode with segments that happened to have a limit of one meg

20148
innodb	myisam
i ve read a bunch of stuff on the web about the difference between myisam and innodb and myisam seems like the obvious choice to me for the particular database tables that i ll be using for this task

20154
pointers	stack
c s context is based on the stack and the registers of the cpu so to create a block closure you need to be able to manipulate the stack pointers in a correct and reentrant way and store restore registers as needed

20165
haskell	c++
take the big jump to lisp haskell or similarly abstracted languages or should there be some simple object oriented languages maybe even c++ be thrown in or would that more hurt than help

20170
qbasic	basic
one of the things that got me started with programming as a kid in bbc basic and then qbasic was the ease of writing graphical programs

20170
python	java
the closest i ve seen to that sort of simplicity recently are the pygame library for python and processing a set of java libraries with an ide

20192
cassini	iis
there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier

20195
postgresql	mysql
mysql quietly truncates varchars that exceed max length whereas postgresql complains - quick workaround is to have these columns as text instead of varchar and use triggers to truncate long lines

20195
boolean	int
boolean fields are compared using is and is not operators however mysql-compatible int 1 with and is still possible

20207
deployment	install
i m packaging up a .net 2.0 based web app for deployment through a windows install based package

20219
debugging	trace
the pdb files are debugging symbols only - the difference in the yellow screen of death is that you ll get line numbers in the stack trace

20262
webforms	asp.net
this product has been around for 5 years or so and uses asp.net webforms

20263
profiling	trace
microsoft sql-server profiling is a graphical user-interface to sql trace for monitoring an instance of the database engine or analysis services.

20263
profiling	debugging
i find using sql-server profiling extremely useful during development testing and when i am debugging database application problems

20304
vbscript	basic
vbscript isn t visual basic

20347
required	checked
even if you required code review does not mean it can t be checked in

20354
configuration	logging
php s system logger using the operating system s system logging mechanism or a file depending on what the error_log configuration directive is set to

20368
environment	execution
this early execution environment is highly implementation defined meaning the implementation of your particular bios

20408
svnadmin	dump
svnadmin dump c svnrepositorio repositorio backups bktmpsubversion subversiontemp.dump

20418
attributes	properties
for example i might declare an attributes called displayorder so i can easily control in what order properties should appear in the user-interface

20418
design-time	designer
tells the designer not to list this in the available properties in the properties windows at design-time for example

20426
children	nodes
for interior nodes items.tot needs to be the sum of it s children

20426
any	set
set a triggers on the items table to update the parent of any row that is updated

20426
any	set
set a triggers to schedule an update of the parent of any row that is updated

20444
svnadmin	dump
svnadmin dump c svnrepositorio repositorio backups bktmpsubversion subversiontemp.dump

20478
contains	any
i used an enum contains the sql keywords selected insert ... and basically parsing each line iterating over the enum to determine if any sql was present

20482
attributes	properties
in most cases you will use reflection at runtime to alter behavior based on the presence of an attributes or its properties

20483
implements	extends
however apply that interface to the extends class and the methods only needs implements in the extends class

20485
implements	abstract
most of the problems with multiple-inheritance don t apply to abstract base classes so most modern languages these days disable multiple-inheritance yet call abstract base classes interfaces and allows a class to implements as many of those as they want

20489
abstract-class	subclassing
dr interfaces defines a list of methods that need to be followed think api while an abstract-class gives some basic common functionality which the subclassing refine to specific needs

20503
extends	final
the only thing you can t extends is a final class

20508
attributes	properties
the editor mentioned above also looks for custom attributes on properties that describe the property and how to edit it

20513
any	set
because you want to query a set of keywords against the card description and find any hits

20533
aquamacs	emacs
aquamacs and closer to the original emacs

20552
text-editor	editor
i use eclipse as my primary editor for python but i always keep subethaedit handy as my supplemental text-editor free trial 30 euros to license

20568
aquamacs	emacs
aquamacs - emacs for os x emacs in a shell windows is also an option

20607
strtotime	getdate
strtotime and getdate are two functions that can be used to get dates from strings and timestamps

20631
getter	setter
alt + s r to generate getter and setter

20641
hash	md5
a cryptography hash such as sh1 or md5 allows you to verify that file you have has been downloaded correctly and has not been tampered with

20642
hash	md5
sha1 and md5 hash are used to verify the integrity of files you ve downloaded

20646
xsd	xml
xml schema defines base 64 binary as a primitive datatype which you can use in your xsd

20654
hash	md5
with a has md5 sha-1 one input matches only with one output and then if you down load the file and calculate the hash again should obtain the same output

20665
attributes	properties
so for example visual-studio can query the attributes on a 3rd party control to figure out which properties of the control should appear in the properties pane at design time

20666
hash	md5
to go along with what everyone here is saying i use hashtab when i need to generate compare md5 and sha1 hash on windows

20688
debugging	trace
i don t remember the right name we were able to use this as a debugging tool selecting only functions that we wanted to trace at a given time

20728
deployment	install
we have the standard dev test production environments and need to be able to create deployment for each of these that install and update separate from one another

20734
data-structures	tree
i ve seen binary tree and binary searching mentioned in several books i ve read lately but as i m still at the beginning of my studies in computer science i ve yet to take a class that s really dealt with algorithms and data-structures in a serious way

20746
instances	private
also you can only access a private methods from the same instances

20752
waitpid	fork
of course shell do more than that like piping input and output but you should be able to accomplish the basic using fork execve and waitpid

20771
decrement	increment
in particular only assignment call increment and decrement expression may be used as statements

20795
aquamacs	emacs
if you ever plan on making a serious effort at learning emacs immediately forget about aquamacs

20795
textmate	emacs
that might sound well and all but once you realize that it completely breaks nearly every standard keybinding and behavior of emacs you begin to wonder why you aren t just using textedit or textmate

20795
macvim	vim
alternatively if you want to use vim on os x i ve heard good things about macvim

20806
build-process	msbuild
with a good build-process using msbuild you should be able to accomplish squashing the pains you have felt

20811
oracle	mysql
what is the best way to automate copying the needed tables from oracle to mysql

20821
click	mouse
not even with some mapping overlay for detecting mouse click on it

20828
msbuild	nant
i ve used nant to run the overall build strategy but pass parameters into msbuild to compile and create the deployment package

20828
msbuild	nant
basically nant calls into msbuild for each environment you need to deploy to and generates a separate deployment output for each

20828
environment	building
this is how we handled multiple production environment as well -- we had separate instances of our application for the us canada and europe so each building would end up creating nine deployment three each for dev qa and prod

20845
python	perl
i believe perl s stat and readlink and python os.stat and os.readlink are both wrappers for the system calls so this should translate reasonable well as proof of concept code

20858
ms-access	oracle
could you just copy the oracle tables and then set them up as linked tables in ms-access

20859
realpath	symlink
you may try using realpath to get what the symlink points to then trying to determine if it s a valid file using is file

20860
16-bit	8bit
so how bytes get converted from 8bit values to 16-bit java unicode chars will vary not only between operating systems but can even vary between different users using different codepages on the same machine

20861
mbunit	nunit
i would like to do some integration-testing of a web service from within nunit or mbunit

20866
boolean	int
a bitset is usually implemented as an arrays of int the boolean are packed into those int

20866
boolean	int
so the first 32 boolean bits in your bitset will only take up a single 32-bit int but to read each value you have to do some bitwise operations first to mask out all the values you don t want

20873
put	get
having a tags table and a map table makes it pretty trivial to generate tag clouds such since you can easily put together sql to get a list of tags with counts of how often each tag is used

20887
data-structures	tree
as another poster said tree are core data-structures for databases and indexes of all kinds

20947
hosts-file	hosts
127.0.0.1 is your loopback address also known as localhost if set in your hosts

20948
getter	setter
the worst thing you can do is add comments to obvious methods like getter and setter when they don t do more than what they should - get or set the named field

20950
variables	boolean
if you find yourself doing this it may be better to refactor so that the complex boolean logic is extracted to another method or at least introduce a variables with a name that makes it clear what the logic means

20966
put	get
on the other hand most people would love to get 5-10 pages of simple class diagrams with some basic descriptions of how the system is put together

20967
javascript	dom
actually the code i had pasted previously was the generated dom after all javascript manipulation

20995
contains	any
for instance blend errors when trying to render any xaml contains an ivalueconverter this is problematic

20999
entity-relationship	diagram
i d definitely recommend gliffy.com for simple entity-relationship diagram it s an online flash based tool so cross platform

21030
python	ruby
all cocoa development is best done with objective-c or one of the many automatically generated bridges to dynamic languages such as python or ruby

21137
mbunit	nunit
i would have thought that templates be readily available for nunit xunit mbunit et

21143
mbunit	nunit
mbunit and later versions of nunit also contains project templates for unit tests

21149
ironpython	ironruby
the ironruby guys have got some internal builds of asp.net-mvc to work with ironruby and ironpython 2 and ironruby have a lot of code in common with the dlr

21149
ironpython	ironruby
i m not sure if they ll support ironpython ironruby when asp.net-mvc is release but it s definitely worth keeping your eye on anyway - the old asp.net forms-based development model is old busted and the sooner it goes away the better

21221
python	c++
there are also a lot of little libraries that you might not get in other languages and would have to write yourself how a c++ developer writes python

21285
fckeditor	wysiwyg
well it depends what platform you are on if you are looking for server-side functionality as well but the defacto badass wysiwyg in my opinion is fckeditor

21302
required	checked
checked for required files

21302
dictionary	arrays
two arrays instead of a dictionary enforces the order

21372
licensing	gpl
if you re licensing a technology i say gpl

21413
csv	xml
this solution does not need any csv or xml libraries and i know it does not handle any illegal characters and encoding issues but you might be interested in it as well provided your csv input does not break the above mentioned rules

21418
data-structures	dictionary
consider how much having solid well designed generic data-structures such as list stack dictionary hash etc. included in common frameworks has improved the state of development in modern languages

21442
click	mouse
you could use some javascript to catch the right mouse button click but that s really about it

21448
32-bit	64bit
to get this to run as a scheduled job on a 64bit server i understand that i need to set the step as a cmdexec type and call the 32-bit version of dtexec

21505
keyword	term
if we can get a computer to be smart enough to identify that things tagged subversion have similar content to things tagged svn presumably we can parsing the contents so why not skip tags altogether and match a search term directly to the content autotagging which is basically mapping keyword to results

21514
administration	credentials
so for example i would connect to somesystem with appropriate credentials and fetch back a list of local administration including somesystem administrator somesystem bob domain alanh domain domain administration

21531
16-bit	x86
so if the smallest unit is 16-bit long what in x86 would be called a word then a 32 bit word representing the value 0xffff0000 could be stored like this

21531
16-bit	8bit
so if you have 8bit endianness it means that every word consisting of 16-bit will be stored as

21584
credentials	security
if you are running on the desktop then using the active user s security credentials should not be a problem

21613
pure-virtual	base-class
a base-class with a pure-virtual function is not be initializer

21619
rhino-mocks	nmock
i ve used rhino-mocks and nmock

21620
buffering	streaming
you may need to make sure that produces line buffering output it flushes its output streaming after each line

21636
children	tree
you need some form of identifier to see the structure of the tree and grab all of a nodes children and a list of the parents path to a leaf to update

21644
memcached	apc
you can avoid stating the same file repeatedly by caching the results via memcached apc or some other in-memory caching system

21668
aquamacs	emacs
in much the way that aquamacs makes an os x-friendly version of emacs the emacsw32 project makes emacs out-of-the-box work just like a windows text editor

21792
arrays	map
note that map is going to modify your source arrays as well

21825
wamp	php
i would suggest if you are going for a php and mysql install to instead use wamp

21882
implements	abstract
it may not serve well on the client side unless of course the client is obtaining the cached data from a server of some kind but if you abstract your usage of memcached to a specific interface you could then implements the interface with another caching system

21983
system.web	.net
i don t think there s a technical limitation as such on shipping system.web as part of your app though it s slightly odd that they ve put that notice in on the .net 3.5 page

22001
c-preprocessor	macros
iboutlet is a null-defined macros which the c-preprocessor removes at compile time

22005
json	xml
you could write a proxy to provide the information in json or html too but having xml as the main source is definitly worth the time and effort while building the app

22015
wordpress	elgg
anyway have anyone tried to implement his own openid solution within the context of an intranet where there are many different applications wordpress elgg media wiki ..

22074
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the methods and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the methods

22083
instances	private
if by purist you mean most encapsulation then i typically declare all my fields as private and then use this.field from within the class itself but all other classes including subclasses access instances state using the getters

22105
variables	boolean
if you are using delphi 2007 try removing the line from the project source file that sets the application.mainformontaskbar boolean variables

22135
python	java
i am using coldfusion but a solution to this problem can be in any language java python php etc

22140
binaries	install
we tell our clients to install the binaries on their unix servers under the same directory-structure that we compiled it under

22140
installation	environment
is there a way of compiling apache so its installation location s can be specified dynamically using environment variables

22185
access-control	authentication
usually implementing ntlm on an internal site is as simple as unchecking enable anonymous access in authentication and access-control in the directory security tab of website properties in iis

22185
dialog	pop-up
if that is cleared then your web application users will see a pop-up ntlm dialog

22191
authentication	login
if you are trying to do the intranet no zero login thing with iis integrated authentication

22210
binaries	install
i think the way to do get around this problem is to develop a . configure make scripting that your client uses to install specify and compile the binaries

22212
value	field
i just want to have an aggregated field and fire an event everything it s value change

22219
python	java
however one big difference between the java and python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case no circular references objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date

22219
jython	pypy
of course if i run jython or ironpython or possibly pypy then the garbage collector won t necessarily run until much later

22222
contains	any
it s very similar to what mono posted but doesn t contains any ie 6 specific hacks and after checking doesn t seem to work at all

22226
erlang	scala
but i would not call scala intentionally similar to erlang

22257
python	java
check out the dbdeploy there are java and .net tools already available you could follow their standards for the sql file layouts and schema version table and write your python version

22259
png	gif
i want to allow users to upload avatar-type images in a variety of formats gif jpeg and png at least but to save them all as png database blobs

22262
return-value	arguments
5 a return statement in main has the effect of leaving the main function destroying any objects with automatic storage duration and calling exit with the return-value as the arguments

22271
png	gif
it uses imagecreatefrom jpeg gif png and resize and converts the image and then output to the browser

22318
jcifs	ntlm
i m developing a website which will be used in the corporate intranet which uses jcifs and ntlm to automatically authentication the users without asking them to log on

22318
authentication	login
we ve had some success by getting the users to change their login option to automatic login using current username and password tools internet options securty tab select local intranet custom level all the way at the bottom user authentication login but we are still having a few users who are getting username password prompts

22347
32-bit	64bit
a toolkit i was using did not behave well in a 64bit environment and i wasn t able to find a way to dynamically force the assemblies to bind as 32-bit

22354
implements	final
the final piece of the puzzle is a batch operation feature that i implements to kick off a workflow and updates another metadata field

22376
environment	building
i agree with joseph my experience with clickonce is its great for the vast majority of projects especially in a corporate environment where it makes building publishing and deployment easy

22376
versioning	upgrade
implementing the forced upgrade to ensure users have the latest versioning when running is so much easier in clickonce and a main reason for my usage of it

22379
logfile	tail
i m wondering how you can implements a program similar to tail -f in c++ a program that watches for and processes new lines added to a logfile

22400
.when	ready
selected takes file descriptors as arguments and tells you .when one of them has changed and is ready for reading

22412
dictionary	arrays
php s arrays doubles as both a list and a dictionary

22416
arrays	map
then you have an absolute plethora of arrays functions available to map filter walk etc the structures or convert flip reverse etc

22429
firefox	safari
is it possible to embed an inline search box into a web page which provides similar functionality to the ie7pro inline search or similar plugins for firefox safari

22455
interface-builder	iboutlet
fyi in this particular case the reason the iboutlet even exists is simply so that interface-builder can parsing the source file and glean bits of understanding from it

22455
interface-builder	iboutlet
it s a clue well a bit stronger than a clue that the variables preceded by iboutlet should show up as an outlet in interface-builder when designing your uis

22459
memset	malloc
as you can see i m not trying to use memset with a size larger that what s originally allocated with malloc

22493
authentication	login
in xp as long as i had authentication in some way on the server for example directing explorer to server.dmzdomain c and entering valid credentials into the login prompt ssms would use those cached credentials to connect

22509
webforms	asp.net
i have an asp.net webforms application 3.5 sp1 that i m working on and attempting to enable gzip fpr html and css that comes down the pipe

22519
webserver	upload
i have a folder in my webserver used for the users to upload photos using an asp page

22556
enterprise	platform
is amazon web-services a realistic platform for enterprise development

22559
json	xml
i would get a framework like prototype or extjs that has alot of data loading functions built in for xml and json plus you ll get more predictable results as the frameworks have event handlers to make sure your xmlhttprequest succeeded or failed

22594
convention	standards
with autoload a php5 addition if you choose to use oop which i do almost exclusively you only need use some standards file naming convention and i would recommend restricting a single class per file and php will do the rest for you

22596
failover	san
the best solution for this is usually to provide the shared area on some form of san which will be accessible from all servers and contains failover

22598
webforms	asp.net
should i jump right to asp.net mvc html javascript or learn webforms first

22641
failover	san
a shared san with failover is a great solution with a great high cost

22641
filesystems	fileserver
the problem with a simple shared filesystems is the lack of redundancy what if the fileserver goes down

22653
webserver	upload
when a file was upload this backend service sync d the data in the file system folders making it available to be served from either webserver

22658
directory	folder
one of the things about subversion that irks me is that it puts its own folder in each directory of a project whereas git only puts one in the root directory

22660
selected	checkbox
in the general tab ensure the topmost checkbox is selected then click ok

22660
any	set
now any .net assemblies that are loaded from a location beneath the url you specified will have the internet permission set applied to them

22674
windows-xp	windows
from a desktop application developer point of view is there any difference between developing for windows-xp and developing for windows vista

22691
profiling	trace
it gives you stack trace on any error and you can enable profiling easily

22695
remote-debugging	debugging
remote-debugging is obviously more tricky to get it to work correctly you might have to map the remote url with a php script in your workspace than a local debugging setup which is pretty easy to configure if you are on a mac or a linux desktop

22722
contains	any
while my answer may not contains any concrete steps to help this is always where i start

22730
hide	show
for example as i am typing this answer i like the way it show a real-time preview of the answer with an option to hide preview - i would definitely want to use similar type of interaction while building a user forum interface

22768
quirks-mode	doctype
i m not saying incompatabilities with the doctype are the issue but quirks-mode is something to rule out before trying anything else

22792
versioning	upgrade
we need a db compare tool to generate diff scripting to be able to upgrade a db from one versioning to another

22806
arrays	loops
arrays and the foreach loops when dealing with an associative arrays

22806
arrays	loops
as for do...while loops i use those when i have to do more than just flip through an arrays

22811
arrays	loops
with a foreach loops a copy of the original arrays is made in memory to use inside

22816
eclipse-rcp	swt
i know the following libraries for drawing charts in an swt eclipse-rcp application

22829
put	get
allowing multi-tag search such that the user can put subversion svn or subversion svn well from programmers to programmers in the search box and get both

22873
scheme	lisp
lisp scheme

22873
common-lisp	lisp
practical common-lisp - a good introduction to lisp with several examples of practical use

22873
common-lisp	lisp
paradigms of artificial intelligence programming case studies in common-lisp - an approach to high quality lisp programming

22880
http	ssl
is the best answer to use ssl http encryption for the entire web site and you have the best guarantee that no man in the middle attacks will be able to sniff an existing client session cookie

22892
innodb	myisam
switching between myisam and innodb is trivial so load some test data and fire jmeter against your site and see what happens

22900
selected	cell
selected the entire column and right click and selected format cell selected text from the list of options

22912
malloc	free
we ve had pretty good luck by writing our own malloc and free functions

22912
malloc	free
in production they just call the standard malloc and free but in debugging they can do whatever you want

22912
base-class	inherited
we also have a simple base-class that does nothing but override the new and delete operators to use these functions then any class you write can simply inherited from that class

22912
realloc	malloc
if you have a ton of code it may be a big job to replace calls to malloc and free to the new malloc and free don t forget realloc

22912
memset	free
memset the memory with a marker on allocation to find usage of uninitialized memory and on free to find usage of free d memory

22912
printf	strcat
another good idea is to never use things like strcpy strcat or sprintf -- always use strncpy strncat and printf

22931
scheme	lisp
if you want to learn lisp scheme read sicp

22932
ip-address	hostname
also this is a good example why you should always always use dns hostname instead of the ip-address directly

22966
httphandler	httpmodule
you will need to learn the asp.net http pipeline and how to implement the ihttpmodule and the ihttphandler interfaces to create your own httpmodule or httphandler class to handle your routing

22988
textarea	textbox
the main difference between this textbox and the others is that this is a multi-line box for inputting notes which i believe is rendered as an html textarea tag instead of an input tag in asp.net

23006
ip-address	hostname
the geek also this is a good example why you should always always use dns hostname instead of the ip-address directly

23048
easymock	jmock
when i tried learning about jmock and easymock i found the learning curve to be a bit steep though maybe that s just me

23080
xsd	xml
if the original file is modified outside an xml application or if no xsd schema is applied there could be the case where you have an uneven number of students and classes

23096
any	set
what do you do if you are given a pile of crap and seem like you are stuck in a perpetual state of cleanup that you know with the addition of any new feature or code can break the current set because the current software is like a house of cards

23101
32-bit	64bit
it s long_ptr parameter allows you to store a pointer for 32-bit or 64bit compilations

23109
sql-server	oracle
sql-server - only oracle comes close to this none of the free rdmbs can even hold a candle to it

23109
perl	php
c# - performance wise its far better than either of the big three p s in lamp perl php and python

23120
lgpl	gpl
imho there are very few licenses that are worth knowing and using among them gpl which i personally don t like lgpl bsd and ms-pl and of course the creative commons licenses but these aren t suitable for software

23127
sql-server	mysql
i can t really compare mysql to sql-server yet because i haven t done too much with the latter yet

23177
ruby	php
it supports html css javascript php xml ruby ruby on rails and more..

23185
haskell	lisp
it includes examples in lisp haskell and other languages

23190
binary-search-tree	tree
for those who havent seen my previous questions i am using a binary-search-tree as the structure to contain the sparse arrays points and a driver function to traverse the tree as necessary returning whatever the function is designed to do

23193
haskell	ocaml
i posted a bunch of links to haskell and ocaml references that are books with examples et cetera that seem right up your alley

23193
purely-functional	ocaml
further down the road get a hold of purely-functional data-structures as it ll get into the hard-core deep design and considerations you have to take into account in functional languages --it uses ml which ocaml derived from

23203
haskell	scheme
i really like thompsonâ s â œhaskell the craft of functional programmingâ because itâ s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme

23206
security	owasp
owasp keeps a list of the top 10 web attacks to watch our for in addition to a ton of other useful security information for web development

23216
python	php
i can never remember the differences in regular expression syntax used by tools like grep and awk or languages like python and php

23219
keyboard	mouse
sounds like maybe if it s a keyboard or mouse windows grabs it exclusively

23220
put	get
for each of those urls try running a get post put or delete http methods with different parameters so that you can ensure that you re only giving access to what you want to give access to

23229
perl	php
mastering regular expressions devotes the last four chapters to java php perl and .net

23232
perl	tcl
for my own future reference i ll offer the regexp syntax summary page which contrasts the syntax for grep egrep emacs perl python and tcl

23232
python	perl
as expected perl supports the greatest variety of operators but python looks equally capable if not more so

23241
double	int
i think that what makes pointers tricky to learn is that until pointers you re comfortable with the idea that at this memory location is a set of bits that represent an int a double a character whatever

23273
haskell	ocaml
it loses points for being about standard ml when ocaml f# and haskell are seemingly more popular

23287
factors	primes
what is the best approach to calculating the largest primes factors of a number

23287
factors	primes
i m basing this assumption on it being easier to calculate the small primes factors

23287
factors	primes
edit i ve now realised that my approach is futile if there are more than 2 prime factors in play since step 2 fails when the result is a product of two other primes therefore a recursive algorithm is needed

23322
tortoisecvs	svn
i think that using cvs with tortoisecvs and eclipse s would be nice as well though i prefer the way svn handles revisioning

23335
fortran	pascal
okay most early languages are procedural not only asm like c pascal and fortran i heard

23335
haskell	lisp
in functional school we would have nearly functional some considered them to be impure lisp family and ml family and many purely functional haskell erlang etc

23335
perl	ruby
by the way there are many general languages such as perl python ruby

23371
if-statement	loops
but an obvious way would be with if-statement checked in the iteration loops

23376
rar	zip
we tried zip in the past but once the database files crossed the 4gb boundary we had to use rar zip is 32-bit only

23382
desktop-application	web-applications
what are the different approaches for creating scheduled tasks for web-applications with or without a separate web desktop-application

23415
ruby-on-rails	django
taking a look at something like ruby-on-rails or django might change how you look at designing or building your apps

23445
contains	set
each set contains less than 100 items most likely max out at 20

23457
prolog	lisp
try prolog or lisp and see what you can do with those

23481
archive	corrupt
the zip file produced can not be updates via winzip or win-rar -- each indicates the archive is corrupt

23489
python	ruby
i don t think it is enough like capistrano for ruby or fabric for python

23511
hash	md5
i understand that it uses a function referred to as md5crypt but i can t seem to find a description of the algorithm beyond that at some point it uses md5 to create a hash

23605
python	ruby
hype be damned i ve yet to be as productive writing a web app than i am with ruby on rails though pylons in python land is nice

23645
required	checked
you might want to checked those few options out which may be required by a ruby-on-rails environment in which case they should be compiled

23658
notepad++	vim
a fast loading text editor for when your ide is too much vim notepad++

23658
cygwin	gnu

23658
python	perl
scripting tools perl python zsh all those gnu base packages in cygwin

23669
export	report
crystal microsoft reporting services will give you out of the box handling of things like report scheduling export to excel and pdf and separation between application and report design

23676
python	ruby
ignoring ruby python and all the other stuff for a moment

23700
latitude-longitude	location
the formulas are only the first part of the puzzle though if you need to make this work for arbitrary cities you ll need a location database to get the latitude-longitude from

23703
websphere	ibm
for example for all the people who dislike the stop-the-world approach of the default sun java vm gc behaviour there are vm such as ibm s websphere real time which allows real-time application to run on java

23730
32-bit	64bit
although it is about 64bit normal 32-bit installation would follow most of the same steps

23739
arrays	loops
with a foreach loops a copy of the original arrays is made in memory to use inside

23777
triggers	insert
in the past i have used triggers to construct db update insert delete logging

23785
host	root
the proxy could be implemented to generate a new cert for each new ssl host it is asked to deal with and sign it with a common root cert

23785
hostname	proxy
in the op s scenario of a corportate environment the common signing cert can rather easily be installed as a trusted ca on the client machines and they will gladly accept these faked ssl certs for the traffic being proxy as there will be no hostname mismatch

23804
versioning	upgrade
thus you may want to upgrade your mysql 3 server to 4 - this compatibility mode allows for the export your database or individual tables to create a sql file that can import into a mysql 4 versioning server should work in 5 also

23809
http	ssl
i think you should just use ssl and rely on an http client library that does caching ex wininet on windows

23811
revision	updates
updates the svn external to refer to a specific revision of the library

23816
revision	svn
svn export latest revision of the remote path

23816
revision	svn
attach metadata in the form of svn properties about the remote path and revision

23835
for-loop	loops
for-loop and while loops are entry condition loops

23835
arrays	loops
at the beginning of foreach loops the internal pointer of the arrays is set to the first element of the arrays in next step it is set to the 2nd element of the arrays and so on till the arrays ends

23835
arrays	loops
in loops block the value of current arrays item is available as value and the key of current item is available as index

23857
inno-setup	nsis
inno-setup or nsis whichever seems easier to you

23933
reflection	runtime
i found that due to reflection the specific type stored in obj1 is resolved at runtime and the type specific datatemplate is applied as expected

23939
textmate	vim
for python stuff a good text editor textmate on os x g vim on linux programmers notepad on windows vcs i m mainly using git currently

24035
unsigned	integer
in fact your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold 4 billion unsigned 2 billion signed before the stack is going to over flow fibbonaci 46

24046
firefox	safari
in ie and firefox you see the alert box again in safari you do not

24053
firefox	safari
i think it is because firefox and ie when going back are retrieving the page from the server again and safari is not

24065
put	get
people seem to get the concept better you put it in those terms

24073
webforms	asp.net
i have used asp.net mvc for a few projects recently and its like a breath of fresh air compared to webforms

24119
valgrind	gprof
once thatâ s done the shell is your command interface to interact with the various tools â debuggers gdb profiling gprof valgrind etc

24119
any	set
you set up your project build environment using make cmake snakemake or any of the various alternatives

24119
version-control	git
and you manage your code with a version-control system most people use git

24142
onmouseover	onload
likewise if you re going to display any user-inputted information onto a webpage make sure you ve stripped any scripting tags or anything else that might result in javascripting execution such as onload onmouseover etc

24148
getter	setter
your application isn t going to take any real-world performance hit either way but using a class lets you use getter and setter methods and is generally going to be better for code encapsulation and code reuse

24148
methods	extend
and when later on you need to add other methods to manipulate these you won t have an architecture to extend

24156
g++	gcc
you should however know all the important parameters for g++ and ld the gcc linker tool that s invoked automatically except when explicitly prevented

24174
anjuta	gnome
i hear anjuta is pretty slick for gnome users

24270
principles	lsp
few people use oop in any rigorous sense few people adhere to or understand principles such as lsp

24299
ironpython	cpython
you can also access the .net through ironpython a microsoft implementation of cpython

24313
firefox	safari
it worked great in every browser i tested it in ie6 7 firefox safari opera

24322
telnet	irc
telnet onto an irc server and witness the simplicity of the protocol first hand

24362
nhibernate	ado.net
here are some very simple examples ado.net hibernate nhibernate logging frameworks various language collection types the asp.net stack the jsp stack etc.

24372
sql-server	mysql
for example qt makes it very easy to connect to mysql ms sql-server and a bunch of others and change the database driver connection type at runtime - with just a few lines of code

24414
keydown	keyup
anyone know of a way to capture keyboard events keyup keydown in portable ie under windows-mobile

24454
ruby	php
i heavily prefer cakephp for php django for python rails for ruby

24516
haskell	ocaml
i m trying to parse a grammar in ocamlyacc pretty much the same as regular yacc which supports function application with no operators like in ocaml or haskell and the normal assortment of binary and unary operators

24542
conditional	operators
i sometimes run into situations where i want exactly one of two conditions to be true xor so i just throw the operators into a conditional expression

24549
firefox	safari
it s supposedly being ported to firefox and safari but that s been happening for a while now

24558
value	field
prefer initialization in declaration if you don t have a constructor parameter that changes the value of the field

24558
value	field
if the value of the field changes because of a constructor parameter put the initialization in the constructor

24569
checkbox	button
when you select your tables click on the advanced or options button and select the checkbox called preserve primary keys

24577
order	add
with a nonclustered index you ll add the records in whatever order they come in and then build a separate index indicating their desired order

24578
webforms	asp.net
our monorail stuff uses the brail view engine while asp.net mvc comes stock with a webforms like view engine

24581
msbuild	nant
look into build tool nant or msbuild

24582
asymptotic-complexity	big-o
small reminder the big-o notation is used to denote asymptotic-complexity that is when the size of the problem grows to infinity and it hides a constant

24591
msbuild	nant
nant and msbuild are the most popular tools to automate your build in .net and you can find a discussion on there of the pros cons of each in the stack overflow question best .net build tool

24595
emacs	vim
i have really tried to use emacs and vim but i don t have the time to learn them

24602
screens	tablet
to some extent it really depends if you want only a tablet no video feedback on the device or a screens having video feedback which i find nice but is also a bit pricey...

24613
kate	kde
kate kde syntax-highlighing

24638
firefox	safari
there is currently no way to programmatically disable the safari spellchecker as there is in firefox and ie7+ so most rich text editors choose to let safari do its own thing by leaving the browser in control of the context menu

24641
subclassing	inherited
inherited - subclassing - tends to

24645
extends	sealed
quite the contrary i have been in the situation more than once where i want to extends a class but couldn t because it was sealed

24645
implements	extends
i exposed a minimal interface to interact with the client api and it would have been awesome to extends the client api class and then just add an implements clause with my new interface

24648
linux	bsd
i was thinking of learning by getting to know either linux or bsd kernel

24661
implements	extends
i exposed a minimal interface to interact with the client api and it would have been awesome to extends the client api class and then just add an implements clause with my new interface

24682
linux	bsd
it is a microkernel while linux and bsd are a monolithic kernel so what you learn may not be 100 translatable to be able to work with linux or bsd but you can still gain a lot out of it without having to process quite as much information

24682
linux	minix
as a side note if you ve read just for fun linus actually was playing with minix before he wrote linux but it just wasn t enough for his purposes

24707
tapestry	jsf
i ve used tapestry 3 wicket echo and jsf fairly extensively

24707
wicket	spring
that goes doubly so if you are using your own db code instead of hibernate or some other framework i was never completely happy with wicket hibernate or spring integration

24707
tapestry	jsf
in the end i d recommend just taking a look at tapestry wicket and jsf and just picking the one that feels the best to you

24732
virtualbox	vmware
aside from the good books already mentioned opeating system design implementation is particularly good get a hold of a 1.x release linux kernel load it into vmware or virtualbox and start playing around from there

24745
value	field
your query was looking for rows where the tag was both fruit and food which is impossible seeing as the field can only have one value not both at the same time

24813
msbuild	nant
does anyone have a good way to build msi vdproj projects using msbuild or nant

24820
ironpython	ironruby
we use wix to automate msi builds for ironpython and ironruby

24845
credentials	account
if a user fails to provide proper credentials more than 3 times the ip address is blocked or the account is locked

24860
moss	wss
if you re just re- starting out in sharepoint development there s a lot of value in just using wss 3.0 and not yet using moss 2007

24876
value	field
when one assigns a value to an object s value-type field the clr copies the value to the spaces allocated within the object for that particluar field

24876
value	field
notice the clr is being told to stfld the loaded value of 20 in the stack to the loaded embeddvalues numberfield field location directly into the managed heap

24908
malloc	free
to fix you need to call free for everything that is obtained with malloc after you finish using it

24909
revision	updates
though the later may be more updates for .net revision

24910
double	int
for primitive-types int double ... the operators are built in so the compiler will probably be able to optimize your code

24912
linked-list	tree
another good example would be an implementation of a data structure say linked-list or binary tree

24941
simpletest	phpunit
tips on gui s for phpunit would also be appreciated but my main focus is simpletest for this project

24969
getter	setter
if it is completely trivial getter setter etc do not test it unless you don t have confidence in the code for some reason

24990
configuration	environment
you might need to tweak configuration and environment variables a bit

24995
scala	java
java has scala and .net has f#

24995
scala	java
classes can be written in scala then extended in java for example

24997
return-type	arguments
methodss cannot be genericised in the same way that a type can so the only option for a methods with a dynamically-typed generic return-type -- phew that s a mouthful - -- is to pass in the type as an arguments

24999
scala	java
since scala compiles into java bytecode and f# compiles into .net bytecode made to run on their respective virtual machines

25008
base-class	inherited
the only legitimate use of inherited is to define a particular case of a base-class like for example when inherit from shape to derive circle

25008
base-class	inherited
also due to lsp liskov substitution principle one can use derived class where base-class is expected and this is actually imposes the greatest impact from use of inheritance code using base-class may be given an inherited class and it still has to work as expected

25011
memcached	apc
i ve heard great things about memcached through irc but have never heard of apc - what are your opinions on them

25033
contains	any
a string contains the contents of the line not including any line-termination characters or null if the end of the stream has been reached

25035
vb.net	vb6
were they in vb6 i think i would consider upgrading them to vb.net just for maintainability

25041
display	height
i tried setting the css style attributes of display inline for the div but firefox seems to then revert to span behaviour anyway and ignores the height attributes once again

25045
display	height
since you re display it inline the height should be set at the height of your line-height attributes

25049
display	width
you can only change the height and width of a span element when it is set to display block

25051
display	height
the problem is that display inline can t get a height associated because being inline it gets its height from its the content

25056
memcached	apc
memcached is nice if you have clustered servers and youtube-like load but i d try out apc first too

25077
hash	md5
but i am confused as to how both files came out to the same md5 hash

25079
memcached	apc
i ve heard great things about memcached through irc but have never heard of apc - what are your opinions on them

25079
memcached	apc
actually many do use apc and memcached together .

25092
temporary	copy
it s not entirely correct to say that the compiler can t optimize away the temporary variables copy in the postfix case

25092
temporary	copy
so while it s certainly the case that the postfix version could be slower it may well be that the optimizer will be good enough to get rid of the temporary copy if you re not using it

25100
host	root
depending on how your host is set up you may be permitted to place a php.ini file in the root of your home-directory with extra configuration directives

25105
unix	bsd
unix and bsd courses courses and videos

25105
linux	bsd
and of course the bsd man pages which are an excellent resource as they are maintained to a far greater extent than your average linux man-page

25105
unix	bsd
not quite related but i ll also recommend the video history of the berkeley software distributions as it gives a nice introduction to the bsd parts of the unix history and culture as well as plenty of hilarious anectodes from back when

25110
any	set
you can set any element to display inline-block to allow it to receive a height or width

25110
quirks-mode	firefox
keep in mind that inline-block does not allow you to set text alignment inside the element on firefox if running in quirks-mode

25111
any	set
i got the gui to come up bit it refused to recognize any projects that i had set up

25111
environment	building
if all else fails i m going to just have to building something as we program inside chrooted environment since our production is chrooted

25116
python	java
does python have a file object that is intended for binary data and is memory only equivalent to java s bytearrayoutputstream

25124
jquery	dojo
we provide the plugins for many of the more commonly used libraries including yui jquery prototype dojo and ext javascript

25132
user-input	output
ross but wouldn t it be better to sanitize user-input when it s entered to keep my output logic free from such issues

25146
rollback	commit
anyway if the client is not there to commit at the end of the job the changes should be rollback by the server

25150
rollback	commit
anyway if the client is not there to commit at the end of the job the changes should be rollback by the server

25158
hide	show
use one form and hide and show controls

25170
hide	show
the methods i often use is actually to pre-setup all my controls on individual panels controls and then show and hide these panelss as i need them

25170
hide	show
and if you show or hide the panels the controls on it do the same

25171
internet-explorer	firefox
internet-explorer developer toolbar nowhere near as handy as the firefox one but at least it gives you a decent dom inspector

25171
firefox	safari
i also install safari and opera but mostly just use them for testing and benchmarking since their dev tools aren t as robust as firefox and they aren t as buggy as ie

25176
apache-cordova	cordova
both microsoft and adobe admit that html5 is the way to go whether with air or cordova or visual-studio

25186
required	checked
my first guess would be that selected email from tclient where timezoneid in 1 4 9 will be faster as it required only single scan of the table to find the results but i suggest checked the execution plan for both queries

25187
markup	xhtml
for the same reason document.write isn t allowed in xhtml you shouldn t write your xml markup as a string

25196
actionscript	mxml
flashdevelop hooks up nicely with the flex compiler which is available for free it compiles both mxml the language flex applications are written in and actionscript 3

25203
mocking	tdd
when you introduce mocking into your arsenal for tdd it dramatically makes testing easier to abstract away the parts that are not part of the system under test

25204
base-class	inherited
and now in your unit test you can also inherited from a very simple base-class that does your setup rollback work - or keep this on a per unit test basis

25213
python	lua
come to think of it though it feels more like lua than python

25241
httpcontext	httpmodule
how do you unit test a httpmodule in asp.net given that httpapplication and httpcontext do no implement an interface

25248
value	field
one possible solution would be to have the time field empty until it was replaced by a newer value when you insert the deprecation date instead

25256
httpcontext	httpmodule
essentially you need to remove the httpmodule s reliance on httpapplication and httpcontext replacing them with an interface

25259
ruby	php
the development environment i am using is ruby on rails but if there are some other platform-specific solutions .net php django i would love to see those too

25275
ruby	php
i am not familiar with ruby on rails but the following is untested php code

25279
perl	ruby
i don t much about ruby or rails but in perl this is what i would do

25284
postgresql	oracle
in the book sql performance tuning the authors found that the union queries were slower in all 7 dbms that they tested sql server 2000 sybase ase 12.5 oracle 9i db2 etc. postgresql pa32 vq union dq sql+performance+tuning source gbs_search_s sig acfu3u18uyzwyvhxr2i3uuj8kmpz9rpmia#ppa33 m1

25292
administration	account
if i understand your scenario correctly it could help running the scripting with a domain account which is administration on your remote machine or better has the right to start and stop the service

25293
union-all	union
always use union-all unless you know why you want to use union

25303
vb.net	vb6
if what you are trying to do is allow searches for a tag say vb also find things tagged as vb6 visual basic visualbasic and vb.net wouldn t those values be set as synonyms in the db s thesaurus rather than query parameters

25324
pointers	stack
for this discussion a primitive value is any that can be stored on the call stack rather than stored as a pointers to a value on the heap

25324
python	ruby
for what it s worth python ruby and javascript all have exclusively boxed values

25325
runas	cmd
quick followup question - can you use the runas cmd from an msbuild script

25343
keyboard	mouse
does one exist or are all products based on recording mouse and keyboard presses

25365
linked-list	nodes
appendlinkednodes finds the last nodes in the linked-list and appends a new nodes to it

25367
selected	textbox
i would like to be in control of updating the textbox so i know when there has been a true change in the event the same date was selected

25371
silverlight	wpf
that is the correct approach in wpf but not in silverlight

25451
authentication	impersonation
i looked in iis 7 and in the authentication section it says anonymous authentication enabled asp.net impersonation disabled basic authentication disabled forms-authentication disabled

25469
hide	show
show and hide these panels as i need

25475
integer	numeric
numeric integer | float | infinity | pi

25516
pentaho	talend
if you want to do some more complicated operations to the records like filtering or joins you could consider using an etl tool pentaho mapforce and talend come to mind

25540
templating	markup
its templating functionality involves creating a component and putting all common markup in that

25546
scp	ssh
any possibility of using the sync framework over sftp scp ssh

25552
solaris	linux
i m currently building a java app that could end up being run on many different platforms but primarily variants of solaris linux and windows

25566
time-complexity	big-o
how might i write an even worse big-o sort without just adding extraneous junk that could be pulled out to reduce the time-complexity

25581
firefox	safari
if you learn css to the point where you can code most things without having to look up the reference if you re still looking up reference regularly you don t really know it and can t claim to complain i think and then develop for firefox safari it s a pretty nice place to be in

25581
firefox	safari
leave the pain and sufirefoxering of ie compatibilit to the end after it works in firefox safari so your mind will attribute the blame to ie where it damn well belongs rather than css in general

25614
jdom	xom
i ve used jdom in the past and have looked briefly at xom and dom4j

25644
command-line	cmd
create your own function to execute an os cmd through the cmd-line

25652
display	height
how can i determine the correct frame height so that the view display one line of text in the current default font

25657
decrement	increment
taking a leaf from scott meyers more effective c++ item 6 distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and decrement operations

25661
gtk	sdl
i m searching for a methods that allows me to have a drawing area in the gtk windows and at the same time being able to manage both gtk and sdl events

height	frame
get the font used by your text view create a string that serves as a reasonable example of what will be in the text view and use that to inform your frame height

25673
display	height
the frame height will need to be some number of points larger than the actual rectangle the string would be display in.

25701
jdom	xom
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom

25755
tokenize	parsing
when is encountered the tokenize would put the rest of the compiler in objective-c mode. the objective-c parsing would be responsible for returning the compiler back to regular c mode when it detects the end of the objective-c code

25784
attributes	properties
they become part of the methods signature available from the runtime which do can look at to determine how to best serialization a transaction. there are also the attributes within properties declarations copy retain assign readonly readwrite nonatomic getter and setter

25784
attributes	properties
those are only valid within the attributes section of a properties declaration

25798
defined	declare
constant strings on the other hand are typically declare and defined using syntax like this

25820
reflection	runtime
in runtime meaning you ll have to use reflection to read every class get its attributes and inject the appropiate call and for that matter i think you couldn t use the reflection.emit methods as i think reflection.emit wouldn t allow you to insert new code inside an already existing methods

25827
project-management	project
most of the heavy lifting operationally has been handled by the tech director and one project manager who is moving out of project-management into product development

25844
json	xml
i don t think so i really like json but the tooling is still not up to xml so i guess we have to wait and see

25846
32-bit	64bit
so i have used the details located at but i m unsure how to make this the 64bit version of apache as it seems to still install the 32-bit version

25855
udp	mtu
for linux according to the udp man page the kernel will use mtu discovery it will check what the maximum udp packet size is between here and the destination and pick that or if mtu discovery is off it ll set the maximum size to the interface mtu and fragment anything larger

25892
boolean	int
several new data types including long long int optional extended integer types an explicit boolean data type and a complex type to represent complex-numbers

i m not remaining willfully ignorant of it but over the years when i ve dipped into other things i ve spent my time playing around with javascript php and a lot of python

25958
perl	php
several server side languages were developed php perl asp... which allowed the server to process the web page before sending it back to the client

25969
oracle	mysql
although this is entirely feasible for many database engines i always seem to struggle to remember the correct syntax for the sql engine of the day mysql oracle sql server informix and db2

25983
xerces	jdom
if you want to benefit from an xsl transformation engine like xalan or an xpath engine like jaxen or saxon i would recommend sticking to the more popular framework available like xerces jdom

25983
xquery	xslt
of course if you need blinding speed and do not care about xpath xquery or xslt you can surely find yourself something that is much faster and or resource-hungry

26021
archive	backup
when searching for data in our backup archive where the data is stored in bzipped text files but has basically the same structure i noticed that it is significantly faster to untar to stdout and pipe it through grep than to untar it to disk and grep the files

26021
decompression	on-the-fly
with approximately 100-300 rows in data for each row in quickdata and searching for the desired timestamps on-the-fly during decompression and decoding of the blob field

ruby	php
i have some experience in php and c# but i don t mind and i would even like to use this as an excuse learning some new thing like python or ruby

26046
distributed-database	bigtable
and if the database gets really big -- as in nobody could ever afford that much memory even in 20 years -- you need clever distributed-database systems like google s bigtable or hadoop

26047
delphi	c++
obfuscator for delphi c++

26059
python	ruby
i don t mind and i would even like to use this as an excuse learning some new thing like python or ruby

26059
ruby-on-rails	django
while neither ruby-on-rails nor django are especially useful for writing games they re still great

26061
aspect-ratio	scale
scale to something small like 64x64 or 32x32 disregard aspect-ratio use a combining scaling algorithm instead of nearest pixels

26068
solaris	ubuntu
i haven t used ubuntu as a server but had a good experience with mod_wsgi on solaris

26068
lighttpd	apache
you may not want to server all files using apache and use lighttpd lighty to server static files

26079
constructor	private
all of the docs i ve read say to make the class constructor private so the class can t be directly instantiated

26080
postgresql	mysql
edit i should mention that i ve only used this syntax with access sql 2000 2005 express mysql and postgresql so those should be covered

26091
alter-table	insert-into
if you do end up doing an insert-into selected be sure to temporary turn off indexes with alter-table x disable keys

26097
constructor	private
__construct would only be called if you called it from within a method for the class containing the private constructor

26116
python	java
java has biginteger and bigdecimal and python automagicaly switches to an object similar to java s if a number gets out of the range of an integer or whatnot

26127

if you size your elements and space the content within using padding you can make many layouts work great in ie6 7 firefox safari and opera without any hacks

26133
subtract	add
design your own class structure containing multiple higher order datatypes like double or int64 variables and define basic math operations for them using operator overloading in c++ or via methods named add subtract multiply shift etc

26148
data-access	nhibernate
but as there s a significant startup penalty they all use nhibernate for data-access as they get busier exactly what we don t want to be doing is restarting them more frequently

26148
shutdown	restart
at the moment the services are being restart daily with an option to input any number of hours of the day for them to shutdown and restart which patches the problem but cannot be a long-term solution once they go onto the production machine and start to become busy

26162
boost	stl
this is also used in the stl and in many libraries including boost

26162
boost	stl
edit i ve amended the code to reflect boost stl conventions as pointed out by daniel in his comment.

26228
checkbox	button
the tools that visually-impaired people use to access the web need the label s to read-out the meaning of checkbox and radio button

please consider case insensitivity white-space and use of single-quotes instead of double-quotes around the href tag

26350
scheme	lisp
for lisp and scheme hell functional programming in general there are few things that provide a more solid foundation than the little schemer and the seasoned schemer

26364
ncover	fxcop
msbuild is responsible for updating from svn on every commit compiling and running fxcop and ncover nunit

26378
pointers	stack
one negative to add is that pointers to the stack are no longer valid when the function returns so you cannot return a pointer to a stack variables from a function

26392
compact-framework	.net
he wants a framework that pushes the model-view-controller design pattern davidg mvc isn t just the name of an asp.net framework in a winforms project using the .net compact-framework

26394
design-time	designer
then you have built-in support for using the settings designer if you want at design-time or at runtime to use

26397
ford-fulkerson	dijkstra
dijkstra and ford-fulkerson algorithms on graphs i like the fact that the second one has many applications

26397
factorization	primes
the number field sieve for integer factorization very complicated but quite a nice theoretical result this also goes for the aks algorithm which proved that primes is in p

26399
compact-framework	.net
all that said i don t know if such a framework exists for the .net compact-framework i just wanted to point out that mvc does not mean webapp

26418
javascript	dom
a selector engine is a javascript library that lets you select elements in the dom tree using some kind of string for identifying them think regular expressions for dom elements

26418
selected	checkbox
to selected all checked checkbox in the login form in the document

26431
zend-studio	eclipse-pdt
just for clarification zend-studio uses their own debugger while the eclipse-pdt project you have the option for xdebug or zend s debugger

26468
transient	entity
this is basically the catch-all methods as it converts a transient object into a persistent one save updates the object if it is existing update or even handles if the entity is a copy of an already existing object copy

26542
design-by-contract	type-systems
in lieu of more expressive type-systems i would absolutely use design-by-contract on military grade projects

26579
wordpress	blogs
some blogs provide a generator meta tag - wordpress - you could find out if there s any exceptions to this

26602
hide	show
which code decides to show hide the button that leads to the action is irrelevant

26602
hide	show
that leaves us with only one drawback of doing show hide logic in javascript - the html sent to user is bigger than necessary

26602
hide	show
having show hide logic in php does have a minus though

26602
hide	show
so if you already have a scripting that runs when your document load for other reasons i would seriously consider having show hide logic there

26679
callback	methods
also i made sure to pump windows messages in the fire_myupdate methods because sometimes javascript code would callback into c++ land by calling methodss on the activex control

26682
instrumentation	profiling
it has several types of profiling built in performance memory windows handles exception tracing static analysis etc. and instrumentation the code to get the results

26715
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think i get the asp.net-mvc model and i like the look of it compared to webforms but still getting my head round how you would build a large project in practice

26721
scrollbar	popup
when creating scrollable user-controls with .net and winforms i have repeatedly encountered situations where for example a vertical scrollbar popup overlapping the control s content causing a horizontal scrollbar to also be needed

26782
autoscroll	panels
if your controls are inside a panels try setting the autoscroll property of the panels to false

26842

there s a guide on apple s web site porting unix linux applications to mac os x that talks specifically about how to make autoconf and make and other similar build systems fit into the mac os x universal binary scheme

26856
32-bit	64bit
it s not linux. in fact virtually none of the software that ships with leopard runs 64bit by default and most of the applications included with leopard only ship 32-bit

26863
directory	folder
deleting the visual-studio 9.0 folder in my application settings directory

26869
sql-server	mysql
if you aren t going for pure sql-server support i wouldn t go for pure mysql support instead

26879
firefox	opera
however when the content gets larger opera and firefox show a scrollbar at the left so you can scroll to the content not on the screen

26882
selected	checkbox
my asp.net page will render different controls based on which report a user has selected some reports require 5 drop downs some two checkbox and 6 dropdowns

26910
default-value	arguments
at processing time it will accept -q or --query as options store the arguments in an attributes called query and has a default-value if you don t specify it

26910
arguments	default
this will by default parsing the standard arguments passed to the scripting sys.argv 1

26912
hide	show
i have ran into issues using the ajaxcontroltoolkit on repeated fields and usually side with using a lighter weight client-side option up to and including rolling your own show hide methods that can be reused just by passing in an dom understood id

26929
perforce	cvs
perhaps after years of using a centralized model in one format or another perforce subversion cvs i just found distributed source control difficult to use

26942
swing	swt
don t know if it works with swt as well because i used only swing in my apps

26965
boost	stl
if you look into stl boost mfc atl and many open source projects you can see there are so many assertion statements and that makes project going further more safely

26967
http	ssl
i think you should just use ssl and rely on an http client library that does caching ex wininet on windows

26968
msbuild	nant
in the asp.net work for me the easiest way i do it which allows me to hit either msbuild or nant depending upon the project was to roll my own exe that takes an argument which i pass in with a bat file fired by cc.net

26969
rollback	commit
it s so nice being able to commit and rollback locally

26973
cvs	git
at my workplace we switched to git from cvs about two months ago the majority of my experience is with subversion

27000
indexoutofboundsexception	nullpointerexception
on the other hand nullpointerexception s and indexoutofboundsexception s might actually often be appropriate

27001
external	root
the external libraries should be not be built into the system root as they may cause conflicts

27005
revision	accurev
where teamware would have had completely seperate copies of everything at each client including all the revision of all files under accurev this is maintained in the central database and the local client machines only have the flat file current version of things for editing locally

27017
progress-bar	progress
your command-line tool will at best print out some kind of progress information - newlines a textual progress-bar a bunch of output .

27020
macros	vba
can anyone help me with a macros or some vba code

27033
.when	ready
.when i m ready i push it out to the servers

27033
.when	ready
.when they re ready to go i just merge them together

27034
radio	click
basically when you look at the connect preferences windows in firefox click the proxy modes radio button causes various form elements to enable|disable

27035
firefox	safari
this is supported in opera and firefox and i recon in safari but haven t tested

27043
selected	cell
if you selected the conditional formatting menu option under the format menu item you will be given a dialog that lets you construct some logic to apply to that cell

27043
selected	button
you can selected the add button and make the condition as large as you need

27075
default-value	dbnull
if the value is dbnull it will return null if its a reference-type or the default-value if its a value type

27090
perl	php
it doesn t really apply to any managed or interpreted environments such as .net java python perl php etc which web apps are typically written in so your only risk is the web server itself which is probably written in c or c++

27132
put	get
last in first out lifo means that the last thing you put in is always the first thing you get back out - if you push 2 items on the stack a and then b then the first thing you pop off the stack will be b and the next thing is a

27132
global-variables	call
recursive functions are also a cause for this but if you re writing recursively ie your function call itself then you need to be aware of this and use static global-variables to prevent infinite recursion

27132
function-calls	main
you should look at your call graph a tree that show from your main what each function-calls to see how deep your function-calls go and to detect cycles and recursion that are not intended

27132
local-variables	function-call
don t break your programs up too far into smaller and smaller functions - even without counting local-variables each function-call consumes as much as 64 bytes on the stack 32-bit processor saving half the cpu registers flags etc

27134
sharing	share
my concern is that a dvcs makes it easier to not share your work since you don t have the drawbacks of not sharing your work you get with svn

27140
put	get
do you put the contents first so that the user has to listen to them every time or do you put them at the end so that they can get to the content first

27160
csv	tsv
from my experience even just excel makes a pretty good tool for quickly whipping up graphs of perfmon if you relog the data to csv or tsv

27163
order	add
in order to intercept it you would need to add another httphandler in front of it that intercepts all uncaught exception-handling

27222
javascript	dom
i am wonder if there is any good php libraries that handle dom manipulation similar to how javascript deals with dom manipulation

27242
jquery	.post
jquery is a part of just about every web app i ve made since i initially wrote this .post

27254
mootools	extjs
it could be that prototype or mootools or extjs are as good as jquery

27256
jquery	dojo
to put some names out there prototype script.aculo.us jquery dojo yui ...those all seem to have active users and contributers so they are probably worth reading up on to see if they meet your needs

27292
revision	svn
i implemented svn for a while which was great as a semi-solution for backup as well as revision control easy reversion of temporary or breaking changes etc

27292
directory	folder
unfortunately svn places .svn hidden directory everywhere which cause problems especially when other developers make folder structure changes or copy move website directory

27294
base-class	inherited
each task inherited from this base-class and include the code necessary to create itself from the passed in xmlelement as well as serialization itself back out to an xmlelement

27303
silverlight	wpf
binding transforms is possible in wpf - but i m getting an error when setting up my binding in silverlight through xaml

27304
export	csv
your best bet is probably just to export the data to a csv file which is plain text and reasonably easy to generate

27337
silverlight	wpf
wpf silverlight can t convert between those two types

27415
32-bit	16-bit
32-bit will be enough to store int16_max ã 997 do the sum on values 1000 times larger then divide back to your 16-bit scale

27430
weblogic	resin
it support many servers not only weblogic including tomcat jboss resin jetty and websphere

27435
postgresql	mysql
i am working on a web application using python django and would like to know whether mysql or postgresql would be more suitable when deploying for production

27439
postgresql	mysql
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

27440
postgresql	mysql
better performance can be bought with more ram and cpu and more appropriate database design and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-x than agonizing over which to pick mysql or postgresql and specialist tuning from expensive dbas

27443
postgresql	mysql
if you are writing an application which may get distributed quite a bit on different servers mysql carries a lot of weight over postgresql because of the portability

27443
postgresql	mysql
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

27445
postgresql	mysql
i haven t used django but i have used both mysql and postgresql

27445
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a little more scalable it doesn t hit the brick wall as fast as mysql as data size client count increases

27454
constructor	private
but since b s parameterless constructor is private instantiating b with your process will fail at runtime

27463
http	ssl
443 when used for http relies on ssl not ssh for its encryption

27472
profiling	trace
i have run profiling over the query and the trace doesn t look any different when i run it in management studio versus in my code

27481
16-bit	8bit
since you are using an 8bit processor you can probably only handle 16-bit results not 32 bit results

27481
multiplication	multiplying
multiplyinging by 3 can be done by simple shifts adds if no multiplying instruction exists or if multiplication only works with 8 bit operands

27503
put	get
you should be able to take this and do some mild pruning of it to put in your username password dbname to get it up and working for you

27508
directory	folder
red gate s sql compare product not only allows you to do object-level comparisons and generate change scriptinging from that but it also allows you to export your database objects into a folder hierarchy organized by object type with one objectname .sql creation scripting per object in these directory

27529
postgresql	mysql
hard to compare mysql and postgresql

27529
sql-server	postgresql
better to compare postgresql to sql-server

27587
64bit	x86
both 32 and 64bit x86 and 64bit powerpc

27598
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere 6.1 it s supossed to support jsr 160 javatm management extensions jmx remote api

27610
web-config	app-config
add this to your app-config web-config inside

27621
shell	bash
on the unix bash shell specifically mac os x leopard what would be the simplest way to copy every file having a specific extension from a folder hierarchy including subdirectories to the same destination folder without subfolders

27622
debugging	trace
the trace macros can be used to output diagnostic messages to the debuggingger when the code is compiled in debugging mode

27630
protected	public
public dispose calls protected dispose true - deals with both managed and unmanaged resources

27638
macros	let
additionally the aforementioned parsing process can be extended through reader macros that let you customize the way your compiler turns text into s-exps

27638
common-lisp	lisp
btw when i say lisp i mean common-lisp

27642
boost	stl
so no stl or boost

27644
binaries	install
i think the way to do get around this problem is to develop a . configure make scripting that your client uses to install specify and compile the binaries

27649
security	owasp
the open web application security project owasp have a few suggestion for sanitizing your input

27653
parentheses	lexical
you start paying more attention to the syntactical constructs you create via s-exprs and macros and less to the lexical form of the text of lists and parentheses

27655
webserver	host
my webserver is host to an obviously religoious artifact i m also heavily confused by the situation

27674
firefox	safari
in our project sharpwired we re trying to create a download component similar to the download windows in firefox or safari

27691
sql-server	oracle
oracle sql developer is very good and also works with sql-server

27707
svn	rcs
look up svn ignore and .gitignore - these features allow you to have extra files in your checkout that are ignored by your rcs when doing a status operation or whatever

27711
linqdatasource	gridview
i m having a problem obtaining the total row count for items displayed in a gridview using paging and with a linqdatasource as the source of data

27728
wamp	php
if you re on windows and don t want to mess around with setting up a server on your own you could get a package like xampp or wamp though bear in mind that those carry the extra weight of php and mysql with them

27735
revision	svnadmin
perform an svnadmin dump filtering out the revision where you accidentally committed the file and perform an svnadmin load

27749
fclose	fopen
due to annoying backwards-compatibility concerns dos applications being single-tasking assume that nothing can delete a file out from under them that they can fclose and then fopen without anything going amiss

27752
family-tree	genealogy
you may wish to checkout how some genealogy sites do this to get a family-tree

27764
reflection	runtime
since obsolete warnings occur at compile time and since the reflection needed for serialization occurs at runtime marking that methods obsolete won t break serialization but will warn developers that the methods is not there to be used

27782
javascript	dom
there s john resig s project bringing the browser to the server browser dom environment written in javascript that runs on top of rhino

27785
expression	brackets
just as a small small note hometoast s expression doesn t need to put brackets around the s for http since he only has one character in there

27786
easymock	jmock
i started using mocks through jmock but eventually transitioned to use easymock

27796
constructor	object
you also need default constructors for nhibernate but i want to force people to not use c# 3.0 object initializers so that classes go through constructor code

27818
eclipse-pde	pde
in using the eclipse-pde each plugins has a manifest but no build.xml as the pde does that for me

27853
scrollbar	popup
whenever i show a modalpopupextender on my sharepoint site the popup shown creates both horizontal and vertical scrollbar

27863
children	nodes
path is indexed and will allow you to quickly do a query that picks up a nodes and all its children without having to manipulate ranges

27889
continuous-integration	nant
i am trying to get specunit to run in a continuous-integration build using nant

27902
binaries	install
switch to the install directory opt apache2 and tar and gzip up the binaries and configuration files

27921
webserver	upload
as part of the upload process we need to a store the image on the webserver s hard drive and b store a thumbnail of the image on the webserver s hard drive

27968
shell	bash
we just couldn t find anything commercially available to do this and so charlie sat down and wrote this in bash shell scripts and it was running on hp-ux

28003
sql-server	mysql
i have done something like this in mysql but can t find any info on sql-server

28039
arrays	loops
how about loopsing over all arrays t of n integers n-tuples of integers are countable so this is doable though it s an infinite loops of course and for each of these

28039
arrays	loops
to check that two arrays a and b of length n contain the same elements how about the following recursive algorithm loops over all couples i j of indices between 0 and n-1 and for each such couple

28059
subclipse	svnkit
i used the updates url and i install the javahl adapter the subclipse project itself and the svnkit adapter beta

28093
bubble-sort	quicksort
quicksort until i got to college i had never questioned whether brute force bubble-sort was the most efficient way to sort

28115
boolean	int
if you re converting anything other than simple types like int or boolean you d need to write your own function methods for the type that you re trying to convert otherwise php will just print the type such as arrays googlesniffer or bidet

28130
python	lua
if it will be used frequently and if it will be extended in the future i would almost recommend adding either python or lua into your code

28137
finite-state-machine	automata
if you want to write your own search for formal automata and or finite-state-machine grammar

28142
library-project	libs
you can create a control libs-project that will generate a control libs dll for you

28220
constructor	private
if this is for xml-serialization and nhibernate where you want the parameterless constructor to be accessible as is the case in the example you referenced then use a private or protected parameterless constructor for serialization or a protected constructor for nhibernate

28226
32-bit	16-bit
however since it looks like you have 16-bit vs 32-bit fields you re probably stuck converting on each call or writing wrappers for all functions of one of the libraries

28228
command-line	cmd
edit what i forgot to say in my original reply was that you need to think of the vi command-line in bash using the cmd you enter when you are in ex mode in vi after you ve entered the colon

28228
command-line	cmd
once you get used to it though you have all sorts of cmd available entering esc my_command will look back through you r history most recent first to find the first occurrance of the command-line containing the text my_command

28241
constructor	private
the head version has the traditional singleton pattern private constructor getinstance etc

28241
constructor	object
the branch version has no constructor is a public abstract class and modified all the methods on the object to be static

28241
constructor	private
the code that used to exist in the private constructor is moved into a static block

28254
order	add
create an fxcop rule and add fxcop to your integration build in order to check for this

28256
parentheses	operators
operators and parentheses

28256
parentheses	operators
using this methods however leaves me with everything having the same precedence - it s evaluated left to right regardless of operators although precedence can be enforced using parentheses

28256
bison	yacc
it s simple enough that i don t see the need for yacc or bison

28272
bison	yacc
note that using a grammar does not at all imply using a specific tool a la yacc bison ...

28276
parallels	vmware
vmware is beefer and sucks more of the system s performance away by default also seems to perform somewhat better than parallels but can have serious graphical problems depending on your setup particularly if you try to use unity mode

28283
any	set
if you have any trouble you can natively boot into your virtual-machine if you have set it up as a bootcamp partition on the mac

28286
cos	sin
if you want it to be really really general such as be able to parsing mathematical functions as well like sin 4+5 cos 7 3 you will probably need a parsing tree

28316
display	width
however for sites a little less demanding on the reading level even blogs or retail sites where you re simply display an individual product having a fixed width allows you to keep things more concise

28317
keyboard	mouse
i also made sure that some of the mac os keyboard and mouse shortcuts were not registered in vmware fusion to stop strange things happening

28319
kerberos	ssl
decryption support for many protocols including ipsec isakmp kerberos snmpv3 ssl tls wep and wpa wpa2

28319
csv	xml
output can be exported to xml postscriptâ csv or plain text

28325
virtualization	virtualbox
for virtualization i d try sun s virtualbox

28325
windows-xp	windows
i use it in windows-xp and windows vista and it works great i expect performance would be similar running on a mac

28345
google-docs	spreadsheet
google-docs spreadsheet web 2.0 colours - found this recently and it s been very helpful

28354
parallels	vmware
i am quite happy with parallels but i m not sure i wouldn t use vmware fusion the next time

28389
command-line	cmd
in ksh in vi mode if you hit v while in cmd mode it will spawn a full vi session on the contents of your current cmd-line

28411
http-post	post
we have two options here curlopt_post which turns http-post on and curlopt_postfields which contains an arrays of our post data to submit

28452
conditional	operators
the first is basically c# s ternary conditional operators and the second is its coalesce operators return result unless itâ s nothing in which case return alternative

28452
conditional	operators
like in c# vb s conditional if operators short-circuits so you can now safely write the following which is not possible using the iif function

28467
python	c++
i m not clear on what your requirements are for passing types between c++ and python but you can do that easily by either exposing a c++ type to python or by using a generic boost python object argument to your c++ api

28467
python	c++
you can also register converters to automatically convert python types to c++ types and vice versa

28467
python	c++
in this case image is a c++ object exposed to python an image with float pixels and op is a python defined function or really any python object with a #95

28470
getter	setter
i would advise using setter getter instead

28505
implements	final
a little nit picking for completeness you d probably declare the class as final too since you wouldn t want someone subclassing this class and implements its own public constructor

28505
constructor	private
forgive me if the compiler catches the overriding of a private constructor but i don t think it does

28558
constructor	private
the other stuff using final and private constructor is useful to know from a theory perspective and even more useful to know if you want to distribute api-quality code to other programmers but in the case of this particular example all the keywords are doing is adding bytes to your class file s size

28564
lgpl	gpl
basically only the gpl required that the whole product is gpl and lgpl implies that the parts specific to that library be open sourced

28577
e-commerce	product
i need to store product for an e-commerce solution in a database

28634
cygwin	gnu
you might want to try learning c using the gnu gcc compiler from within the cygwin environment in windows

28664
python	ruby
i m thinking ruby or python see a related question specifically for python would be best for this but i m open to using any language really and would actually probably prefer an application language like c c++ java c# in case this project goes off

28668
python	perl
it s not my first choice but i d use perl instead of python if there was a perl-y solution at hand

28672
cygwin	gnu
the gnu gcc compiler from within the cygwin environment in windows

28692
python	perl
it has been a really long time since i did anything with filemaker pro but i know that it does have capabilities for an odbc and jdbc connection to be made to it however i don t know how or if that translates to the linux perl python world though

28693
contains	any
any when meta-type â classâ the persistent type is a string contains the class.fullname

28698
continuous-integration	nant
there is a continuous-integration build script hook into nant so that i can automate the upgrading of my database

28700
python	ruby
it stands as much of a chance to be installed as python or ruby

28742
access-control	authentication
this means that the standard apache authentication methods can be used for access-control

28743
virtual-memory	paging
basically this mechanism uses the os s virtual-memory paging system to map your buffering directly to disk

28758
activerecord	datamapper
in his book on patterns martin fowler points out that activerecord tends to break down under conditions where your model is fairly complex and suggests a datamapper as the alternative

28758
activerecord	datamapper
whether your datamapper classes contain raw custom sql or calls to a data abstraction layer api or even access an activerecord pattern themselves doesn t really matter to the controller code that is receiving a nice populated user object

28820
vbscript	jscript
i d like this to be a little more friendly for the admins who are familiar with scripting in vbscript jscript etc

28827
expression-blend	silverlight
expression-blend code-named sparkle - visual user interface builder for windows presentation foundation and silverlight applications

28833
silverlight	wpf
these are tools that bridge the developer designer gap for building rich internet applications with silverlight and wpf

28833
expression-blend	designer
in many cases a designer will build something visually different from a windows application and expression-blend allows them this freedom

28838
vbscript	jscript
there is definitely not a vbscript engine i ve ever heard of nor jscript

28844
expression-blend	designer
the gist of the software is that expression-blend enables designers and programmers to work seamlessly together in letting the designer create the graphical user interface

28844
expression-blend	wpf
using expression-blend in combination with wpf this is no longer necessary

28844
user-interface	drawing
expression design is basically a vector drawing program that can be used to design smaller components that are then used within expression-blend as parts of the user-interface

28849
toupper	tolower
what steve says is right but i guess that if your code had to support several languages you could have a factory methods that encapsulates a set of methodss that do the relevant toupper or tolower based on that language

28850
expression-blend	designer
in reality if you re performing both roles you ll end up having your project open in both expression-blend and visual-studio switching back and forth between them depending on whether you re doing designer tasks or developer tasks

28857
margins	padding
the box width is given by the sum of the left and right margins border and padding and the content width

28878
domdocument	domxpath
in php i m using domdocument and domxpath which closely corresponds to c# xmldocument

28885
solaris	aix
however having done a lot of development on ancient versions of solaris aix and hp-ux just recently - yes these platforms are still alive in the fortune 50 i can tell you that if you really care about portability you should use templates as little as possible

28894
environment	building
now my first inclination is to assume that that there is something wrong with my environment but i also want to ask anyone with deep knowledge on system.diagnostics.debugging and the debugging building option in general what i may be misunderstanding here

28933
configuration	environment
the closest thing to a scripting environment on windows-mobile is the configuration service provider interface

28934
output	mode
i believe that system.diagnostics.debug.write will always output to an attached debugger even if you ve built in release mode

28934
debugging	trace
writes information about the debugging to the trace listeners in the listeners collection

28947
any	set
when you compile without the debugging flag set any call to writedebugging will be removed as was assumed was happening with debugging.write

28962
defined	declare
i read the article too and it led me to believe that when debugging was not defined that the conditionalattribute declare on system.debugging functions would cause the compiler to leave out this code completely

28962
debugging	trace
that is the system.diagnostics.debugging functions must have conditionalattributes for debugging and for trace

28962
debugging	trace
it seems then that my original assumption was correct that system.diagnostics.debugging or system.diagnostics.trace statements are actually not included in compilation as if they were included in #if debugging or #if trace regions

28974
performance-monitor	perfmon
sql-server starting with 2000 will install performance counters viewable from performance-monitor or perfmon

28992
data-access	ado.net
easier you don t have to learn t-sql to do data-access nor do you have to learn the data-access api ado.net necessary for calling the sprocs

29004
csv	xml
sometimes i need to quickly extract some arbitrary data from xml files to put into a csv format

29023
csv	xml
use a command-line xslt processor such as xsltproc saxon or xalan to parse the xml and generate csv

29042
vbscript	basic
as lassevk pointed out vbscript is not visual basic

29042
host	root
the wscripting object is the root object of the windows scripting host

29044
python	c++
mysql + writing custom db code in c++ or python or whatever seems like a rather heavy-handed solution

29046
postgresql	oracle
if you want to build a web site you really need a database server engine like ms sql postgresql mysql oracle or their brethren

29053
firefox	safari
the extra comma in the arrays is being ignored by safari and firefox while ie treats it as another object in the arrays

29053
firefox	safari
most people say that ie is correct but then safari is also doing the same thing as firefox

29060
document-database	couchdb
view building on the 160 000 000 document-database took roughly a week but since then we upgraded to a larger amazon-ec2 instance and we are also getting ready to update to couchdb 0.10.x from 0.9.1 as this release include a lot of performance improvements in view building

29092
cross-domain	xss
similarly even though the cross-domain restriction on xmlhttprequest isn t 100 successful in preventing all xss exploits you d still never dream of removing the restriction

29124
licensing	gpl
if you use a gpl tool like bison you probably don t need to worry about licensing issues since the c code generated by bison is not covered by the gpl ianal but i m pretty sure gpl tools don t force the gpl on generated code binaries

29124
cos	sin
my only warning against skipping the parsing tools or just using the shunting-yard algorithm or a hand rolled recursive decent parsing is that little toy languages 1 may someday turn into big actual languages with functions sin cos log and variables conditional and for loops

29124
multiplication	exponent
3 snippet of a haskell parsing using parsec a four function calculator extended with exponent parentheses whitespace for multiplication and constants like pi and e

29130
perl	ruby
another option for perl would be web scraper which is based on ruby s scrapi

29144
version-control	cvs
i ve always used subversion or cvs for version-control which use a merge methodology

29163
linux	unix
secure programming for linux and unix

29174
simplemodal	jquery
i m using jquery and simplemodal in an asp.net project to make some nice dialogs for a web app

29177
mouseleave	mousemove
i have found a blog post describing one mechanism but it involves a good deal of manual bookkeeping including status flags mousemove events manual mouseleave checking etc

29199
hosts-file	hosts
i mapped the remote hosts in the hostss-file to 127.0.0.1

29204
windows-xp	windows
copy the windows-xp regedt32.exe to the windows 2000 machine

29204
windows-xp	windows
using a windows-xp machine connect to the windows 2000 registry remotely file connect network registry

29205
firebird	mysql
sqlite mysql and firebird are free database back ends

29235
superclass	subclass
if you don t declare your own constructor in the subclass trying to instantiate it will throw a fatal-error because it tries to call the superclass constructor

29235
instances	private
in the case of a db connection when you re presumably returning in php anyway a mysqli instances or the resource returned by the mysql_connect function or some other link to some other rdbms as long as you mark the instances private there s no threat of somebody subclassing it and tampering with the link

29242
stderr	stdout
edit clarification i am looking for code that i can easily drop in to my own programs to write to stderr stdout log files or other such output streams

29267
.when	ready
imo the subversion methods is easier because you don t have to bother with a source control client in order to modify files -- you go ahead and modify with reckless abandon and then compare what has changed on disk with the server .when you are ready to check in

29274
getter	setter
they are all emulated by using getter and setter

29313
32-bit	64bit
i mentioned 64bit because at low levels struct from 32-bit to 64bit do not get properly handled

29318
sql-server	oracle
i haven t used oracle s table clusters myself but i understand that its index table clusters are very much like ms sql-server s clustered indexes

29319
put	get
if you put .tostring to a variables query variablesiables you get the sql

29346
credentials	security
if i can do that i ll be able to ask the use up front for their credentials and then dynamically apply the security and give them meaningful error messages if access is denied.

29358
nvidia	ati
for something that s not crazy expensive go with either a nvidia geforce 8000 series card or an ati 3000 series card

29375
function-pointers	member-functions
given that i d say it s the language s support for writing good oo code that makes it an object oriented language. i would never bother with using function-pointers members in struct in c for example for what would be ordinary member-functions

29375
constructor	object
expanding on this one could say that python is not object oriented either with the mandatory self reference on every step and constructor called init whatnot

29406
log4net	nlog
i think of all of the various wrappers and helpers i ve seen for nhibernate log4net and code i ve read from projects like nlog and nettopologysuite and i see so many good approaches but honestly i m at a loss where to start

29423
environment	building
i have codeigniter so our staging environment building itself

29425
credentials	account
it was a permissions issue and i eventually found that only sql-server account not windows could use the linked server because i think then the driver was loading using the credentials of the sql instead of impersonated ones

29461
groovy	java
i m working on getting an introduction to groovy presentation ready for my local java user s group and i ve pretty much got it together

29461
groovy	java
most of the people are experienced java developers but i m pretty sure they have little to no groovy knowledge

29461
groovy	java
what are the best things i can cover in a 1 hour time frame that will help me effectively communicate to these java developers how useful groovy could be to them

29463
bitwise-and	bit-shift
in the case of shifting 0xbc by r bits you can calculate the overflow by doing a bitwise-and and the shift using the bit-shift operators

29491
value	field
also a possible value for the dwflags field is flashw_stop to cause the flashing to stop

29507
perl	php
create a perl python php script to do the job for you

29524
python	java
edit lubos hasko suggests having a little java program to deserialize the objects in front of python but the problem is that for this to work your little java program needs to load the same versions of all the same classes that it might deserialize

29524
put	get
on the other hand it s possible to log arbitrary exception-handling and if they get put in the stream as well my point stands.

29529
python	java
for example json scroll down for libs has libraries for python and java so you could in theory use java library to serialize your objects and python equivalent library to deserialize it

29529
stream	send
send output stream to your python application and deserialize it

29531
value	field
i can seem to figure out how to declare a static field and i can set its value later but i can t seem to get the above effect

29532
arrays	loops
here s a simple solution which loops over the arrays copying the low-order nibble of the next byte into its high-order nibble and the high-order nibble of the next-next +2 byte into its low-order nibble

29536
parentheses	macros
if you decide to use macross or are using c on a future project you should add parentheses around the b in the macros expansion i don t have enough points yet to edit other people s content

29545
put	get
once you get the count to 0 via the attributes you then put in a rule that new checkins may not introduce fxcop violations

29557
mstest	nunit
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

29562
ubuntu	debian
my main goal is to create a .deb package for debian ubuntu users but i don t understand make configure files

29562
shell	bash
this one has some interesting discussion it s also how i found the ubuntu guide about concatenating a zip-file and a shell script to create some kind of universal executable anything with python and bash that is

29563
mstest	nunit
we are in fact moving away from nunit to mstest

29564
data-structures	dictionary
they usually work by stripping the data formats down to the bare minimum number string sequence dictionary and that s it and thus requiring a bit of work on both ends to represent a rich object as a graph of dumb data-structures and vice versa

29564
python	java
libraries that implement json yaml asn.1 and xml are available for both java and python and pretty much every programming language known to man

29567
python	java
if you want to work with other languages it also has bindings for java and python

29573
python	ruby
why not ruby python or whatever which are all runnable on the jvm

29573
if-statement	loops
don t show me syntax that java can already do if-statement loops etc or if you do make it quick

29582
python	java
well i am not python expert so i can t comment on how to solve your problem but if you have program in .net you may use ikvm.net to deserialize java objects easily

29609
findstr	cmd
you might want to check out the windows findstr cmd for searching input text with regular expressions

29622
put	get
you also have to get your game rated by the esrb which will put you back another 2500

29624
contains	elements
i have a form elements that contains multiple lines of inputs

29630
startup	launch
if i put the templates file in the office startup folder it will launch everytime i start word

29640
swing	gwt
it allows you to design user interfaces for swing swt and even the google web toolkit gwt

29648
configuration	logging
if you use a logging framework like log4net they often provide simple configuration file based ways of redirecting input to file or database

29654
datagridview	databound
i m developing a winforms application .net 3.5 no wpf where i want to be able to display foreign key lookups in a databound datagridview

29654
datagridview	databound
i d like to have a databound datagridview where each row represents an orderline displaying the line s product and producttype

29654
order	add
users can add or edit orderlines direct to the grid and choose the product for the order line from a comboboxcolumn - this should then update the producttype column showing the producttype for the selected product in the same row

29677
.net-assembly	ildasm
what should i do if i want to release a .net-assembly but wish to keep its internals detailed in the manifest private from a utility such as ildasm

29680
credentials	ntlm
whenever the user provides invalid credentials the ntlm dialog box pops up in internet-explorer

29680
credentials	ntlm
i don t want the ntlm dialog box to be displayed when the user provides invalid credentials

29680
authentication	login
instead the postback by the login button in the authentication form should be executed

29681
csv	xml
files xml files and csv files as

29688
callback	methods
is there not anyway you can run the process async and specify a callback methods to occur once complete and then keep the page in a we are processing your request.. loop cycle

29694
value	field
i keep mysql s auto_increment as unsigned-integer field of various sizes in order to make use of the full range as i know there will never be negative value

29694
unsigned	integer
ms sql does not support the unsigned attributes on all integer types so i have to choose between ditching half the value range or creating some workaround

29705
put	get
basically you get data from somewhere your outgoing articles do something to it aggregate and put it somewhere else your aggregates table data warehouse etc

29717
attributes	properties
add the following attributes to the properties in your control

29726
firefox	opera
someone has done it in ie6 but it does not work in firefox or opera afaik

29733
python	ruby
however i would very much like to use several components written in either python or ruby either pygments or coderay as a source code formatter

29733
python	ruby
does anyone know a good implementation in either ruby or python

29752
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
you can use either a sortedlist or sorteddictionary both sort by the key or a dataview

29758
sql-server	mysql
i would tend to go with the grain most of the time using mysql in a lamp team and sql-server in a ms team since either of these products is capable of doing everything necessary even in a high-load environment

29760
installation	upgrade
installation upgrade runs.

29769
ssas	ssis
are you sure you aren t mixing up ssas analysis services and ssis integration services

29769
ssas	olap
ssas is not an etl it is an olap tool

29770
emacs	vim
the first is rope a python refactoring library that comes with a vim and emacs plug-in

29770
emacs	vim
also plugs into vim and emacs

29775
configuration	installation
all in all we are looking for a way to ease the deployment installation and configuration pain

29777
command-line	cmd
i have a solution in visual-studio 2005 professional edition which in turn has 8 projects.i am facing a problem that even after i set the cmd arguments in the project settings of the relevant project it doesnt accept those cmd-line arguments and it shows argc 1 inspite of me giving more than 1 cmd arguments

29784
ssas	olap
but if you want to understand ssas olap and reporting using this framework it s a good start

29792
sql-server	oracle
if not then oracle ms sql-server sybase and others are probably out although if you re not building a commercial app then there may be some wiggle room

29792
postgresql	oracle
i have worked with oracle ms sql server mysql postgresql sqlite and sybase that i can think of

29801
value	field
prior to using hibernate or other orms when i would do sql directly in jdbc or odbc i would put all the sql statements as either public field of an object with a naming convention or in a property file also with a naming convention for the value say prep_stmt_xxxx

29801
triggers	insert
the views would either map directly to a table or allow you to triggers of a dummy table that does the real updates or insert etc

29802
revision	svn
i notice that here in the beta there is an svn revision number in the footer and that s ideal for an application that uses svn over one repository

29804
difference	factors
do you still think the factors of 2 difference is something you should worry about

29820
deep-copy	object
you want to return a deep-copy of the object but you don t know if it is cloneable

29822
any	set
i cant find any debugging settings set anywhere

29831
benchmarking	profiling
and if after all this your profiling and benchmarking reveals that the lexical_casts are an unacceptable bottleneck that s when you should consider doing some macros horror

29836
networkx	igraph
as already mentioned networkx is very good with another option being igraph

29852
revision	svn
with that setup the svn revision number of the metarepository could possibly be used for versioning the complete system

29852
revision	svn
in another case i include the svn revision via svn keywords in a class file that serves no other purpose to avoid the risk of keyword substitution breaking my code

29852
revision	updates
an inconvenience with both approaches is that the revision number is not automatically updates by changes in the externals approach 1 or the rest of the code approach 2

29855
perl	c++
my understanding is that wxwidgets is for a number of programming languages c++ python perl and c# .net but that does not include c

29856
32-bit	64bit
in the past i have run apache and mysql to match this install in 32-bit mode even stripping out the 64bit stuff from apache to make it work

29862
value	field
the basic way of handling this is to grouping by your fixed field and selected a max or min for some unqiue value a datetime usually works well

29900
webserver	host
you ll probably need to be able to run python scripts on your webserver to host either of them

29923
bazaar	git
at the place where i work we decided to move from svn to bazaar after evaluating git and mercurial

29923
bazaar	git
bazaar was easy to start off with simple commands not like the 140 commands that git has

29923
bazaar	git
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it

29934
firefox	opera
the firefox model opera uses the handy variables input .selectionstart and selectionend

29972
teamcity	nant
i use teamcity with an nant build script

29989
graphviz	doxygen
doxygen is really excellent for this although you will need to install graphviz to get the the graphs to draw
