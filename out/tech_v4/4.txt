revision	svn
svn will internally create a pointer to the source location at that revision

40025
postgresql	oracle
for example if you are writing an open source web application chances are that you need to support mysql and postgresql at least if not mssql and oracle

40034
edmx	dbml
i haven t tried it myself but huagati dbml edmx tools is recommended by other people

40034
edmx	dbml
huagati dbml edmx tools is an add-in

40090
arguments	default
is it true that the only way to handle default function arguments is through function overloading

40107
constructor	object
i do not want to be able to pass in object to the constructor only other enums

40117
httphandler	httpcontext
httpcontext exposes the current instance for the request under the httpcontext.current property however the current context can also be passed in httphandler in the processrequest methods

40122

i m trying to get a firefox plugins to read data from a http-get parsing the results and present them as links in a bookmark-like drop-down menu

40132
selected	checkbox
i ve got a situation where i have a main form that pops up an advanced configuration form that just has half a dozen matched checkbox and combo boxes to selected some advanced options the checkbox to enable disable the combo to selected a media if enabled

40238
difference	count
the most common but nonetheless incorrect answer to the question posed at the top is that mutexes and semaphores are very similar with the only significant difference being that semaphores can count higher than one

40239
convention	standards
incidentally the convention i use for enums is singular for standards plural for flags

40259
ncurses	gtk
is there any user-interface library that can be to buser-interfaceld both a text user-interface ncurses and graphical user-interface gtk

40276
constructor	object
unless it s more than 1 argument i always use arrays or object as constructor parameters and rely on error checking to make sure the required parameters are there

40277
dialog	pop-up
the designer even included detailed explanation of some subtle behavior in pop-up dialog that would appear when hovering over mock links

40284
arguments	default
in a language that supports default methods arguments php for example you could do this in the methods signature

40284
value	field
of course you could also set default value when you declare the field if you deem it appropriate to do so

40289
getter	setter
then make getter and setter functions for each property so that the default value could be changed

40299
constructor	object
particularly with wpf object you ll find that .net classes tend to favor parameterless constructor and will throw exceptions if the data has not been initialized to a desirable state before calling the method

40311
installation	environment
i added a custom install action to my installer to add one of my installation directories to the system path environment variables

40322
administration	account
if i login with a local administration account i can see and use it fine

40327
command-prompt	cmd
i think when you launch a new cmd process from the run dialog for example you get a fresh copy of all environment variables but if you launch the command-prompt a different way then you do not

40328
environment	restart
says that for system environment variables which path is one of requires a restart although i have a feeling that logging off and on may be enough

40339
filehandle	pipe
we had to create an arrays of pipes where our code would get filehandle for the input output of each pipe

40344
filtering	sorting
however this is slow for very large tables and sorting and filtering is cumbersome

40344
filtering	sorting
opening a large table is much faster this way and access has easy-to-use right-click filtering and sorting

40350
selected	button
click on the selected button and selected the type of code you want to debugging then hit ok

40367
environment	building
replacing tools that quickly in a live environment is all too likely to result in lengthy and confusing downtime if anything goes wrong in writing and building the tools--especially when subtle cross-platform issues creep in

40378
csv	xml
it can export to xml or csv files that can be imported in another browser or computer

40410
integer	zero
a semaphore is an object containing a natural number a integer greater or equal to zero on which two modifying operations are defined

40439
csv	xml
this exports to xml or csv format

40499
primitive	int
for primitive arguments int long etc. the pass by value is the actual value of the primitive for example 3

40548
dictionary	map
also note that hashtable extends the dictionary class which as the javadocs state is obsolete and has been replaced by the map interface

40630
double	int
in general java has primitive-types int bool char double etc that are passed directly by value

40637
macros	vba
update i should have added that i would prefer not to use any vba macros

40663
xsd	xml
i m trying to find a way to validate a large xml file against an xsd

40678
saxparser	domparser
instead of using a domparser use a saxparser

40705
scripting	shebang
at the beginning of all my executable python scripting i put the shebang line

40705
utility	manual
maybe some distribution utility is required to prevent the manual tweaks

40708
selected	checkbox
keep send source of current page and send screenshot of current page checkbox selected

40726
.net	wcf
you can certainly create restful web services in asp.net 2.0 for example but there are no high-level apis to do all the donkey work for you as provided by wcf in .net 3.5

40743
required	checked
however if you don t have a scenario that required esql i would be hesitant to rely on it over linq because it will be much harder to maintain no more compile-time checked etc

40753
hard-drive	floppy
you really can t even be sure that the pc was started from a hard-drive - it s perfectly possible to boot windows from a floppy

40757
perl	ruby
unlike lisp or perl or ruby c cannot preserve elements of a stack frame once you exited that frame

40783
right-to-left	hebrew
however just as arabic hebrew etc right-to-left language users will expect left-to-right progression in some contexts embedded english fragments and so on there are situations even on the web where top-to-bottom layout is preferred

40785
macros	vba
you can reduce the problem of needing the user to accept macros each time by digitaly signing the template in vba ide tools | digital signature... and select a digital certificate however you will need to get a certificate from a commercial certification authority see

40828
exception-handling	try-catch
wrapping that in a try-catch in that class caught the exception-handling

40852
vb.net	vba
i think when it comes to excel .net development vb.net is the way to go especially if you re not that familiar with the object model you can record vba in excel and easily convert it to vb.net instead of poring through the lackluster documentation

40854
attributes	properties
see defaultvalue attributes is not working with my auto properties

40863
silverlight	wpf
so basically have you rethought the design of your business apps as you move to web wpf silverlight designs because for us at least - in winforms we kept things fairly functional and uniform or are you trying to keep that known ui

40865
constructor	object
unfortunately the constructor does not take a securestring or a credentials object

40894
arrays	map
hashmap an implementation of the map interface that uses hash codes to index an arrays

40929
value	field
call it related have it be a lookup into the title field of the tasks list and allow multiple value

40934
scheme	lisp
i recall there being a scheme or lisp too

40964
any	set
in any case you should never rely on something like that even more so if you are asking your users to set up the variabless just imagine how much aggravation and confusion a simple misspelt variables would produce

40966
javascript	dom
i have a javascript function that manipulates the dom when it is called adds css classes etc

40967
python	ruby
which can interpret and run javascript and one presumes other scripting languages such as groovy interactively sort of like the python shell or irb in ruby

40997
plugins	add-on
i wonder whether plugins add-on will ever be a big focus for google-chrome

41003
google-chrome	firefox
perhaps a bit anecdotal but comparing runs between firefox and google-chrome showed a significant difference in benchmarks

41010
zend-framework	codeigniter
the zend-framework or codeigniter

41029
internet-explorer	firefox
i ve compared it to firefox and internet-explorer using this link was

41029
internet-explorer	google-chrome
212ms in google-chrome 341ms in firefox 3 and 2188ms for internet-explorer 7

41033
contains	any
i would lean toward using this technique where the options are contains in one object and use either attr_writers or option parameters on methods calls to pass relevant options to any additional objects

41033
any	set
this way any code contained in external classes can be isolated from the options themselves -- no need to worry about the naming of the variables in the main routine from within the thingy class if your options are set with a attr_writer or thingy.process true call

41049
.when	ready
the proper way to run your code .when the page is ready is wait for the element you need to change is ready available

41053
data-access	nhibernate
use a robust data-access strategy provided by tools like nhibernate or linq to sql

41069
directory	folder
here the first argument is the windows that owns the dialog box the second is the title of the windows and the third is the default path to start at you need the at the end otherwise it ll start a directory higher with the user s home folder selected

41100
sql-server	oracle
off the top of my head the major differences between sql-server and oracle are

41100
sql-server	oracle
sql-server database oracle schema

41135
base-class	inherited
this has support for a soap formatter a binary formatter and a base-class you can inherited from that all implement a common interface

41171
background-repeat	background-image
i tend to have a css class which sets the background-image to a little animated gif with appropriate padding and positioning remember to turn background-repeat off and then add and remove that class using a couple of javascript helpers called when the ajax call is started and when the response callback runs

41176
firefox	opera
can t say that for firefox or opera

41179
internet-explorer	firefox
i believe that hta is an internet-explorer only technology or that the firefox equivalent is broken

41201
display	height
update after viewing your link your height issue as display is because the floats are not being cleared

41206
expression-blend	designer
i think it would not be difficult to get a good designer up to speed on expression-blend to whip up some good xaml designs that your team could use to come up with a really good product

41228
3des	aes
later edit note that standard encryption algorithms from the same category for example 3des and aes - both being symmetric block cyphers are of comparable strength

41283
directory	folder
if you absolutely can t rename the folder because other software depends on it another technique is to go ahead and rename the directory to end in .noindex but then create a symlink in the same location pointing to the real location using the original name

41316
windows-mobile	windows-ce
on windows-ce 5 which is the base for windows-mobile 6 the storage cards get mounted at the root file system as storage card storage card2 etc

41328
.when	ready
after that other developers can ask for the latest updates .when they re ready to retrieve them

41351
.when	ready
you could maybe create the file with a temporary name data.xml_tmp and .when it s ready change the name to what it is supposed to be

41396
configuration	environment
i didn t actually understand your question completely but i store my connection settings in a configuration files usually one for each environment like dev production etc

41411
phpmyadmin	vbulletin
refers to past vbulletin and phpmyadmin exploits which were caused by improper eval usage

41439
value	field
the related column is a lookup field into the title column of tasks and allows multiple value

41446
json	xml
although i usually prefer to use rest services with json or xml there are some tools i am currently integrating that works only using soap

41446
versioning	upgrade
i already created a first versioning of the client in javascript but i m parsing the soap envelope by hand and i doubt that my code can survive a service upgrade for example seeing how complex the soap envelope specification is

41448
similarity	distance
concretely to solve the problem of word query similarity i have had good results with using edit distance a mathematical measure of string similarity that works surprisingly well

41459
reflection	runtime
reflection like you re thinking about -- fully descriptive metadata available at runtime -- just doesn t exist for c++ by default

41479
double	int
there is a real concern about type-safety here - for example if we were to place the results of that query into an overloaded methods that accepted ienumerable int and ienumerable double the caller might inadvertently pass in the wrong type

41479
strong-typing	types
variables does maintain strong-typing but the question is really whether it s dangerous for the types to not be immediately apparent on definition something which is magnified when overloads mean compiler errors might not be issued when you unintentionally pass the wrong types to a methods

41499
value	field
the problem i hit is that i added a new static field that was initialized with a system property value getproperty

41502
push	pull
considering just parsing and ignoring the question of whether they perform validation there are two main flavors tree-basedâ think domâ and streaming event-basedâ think sax push and stax pull

41502
stax	sax
tree-based parsing are generally considered easier to use although stax has been heralded as a huge improvement in ease-of-use over sax

41515
value	field
if i read the spec correctly the automatic serialversionuid shouldn t change if you change the value of a static of transient field

41521
checkbox	button
one is the usual click button and the other is a toggle button that acts similar to a checkbox

41524
revision	svn
it will be duplicated for each branch tag in your revision control system remember in most svn system copies are cheap

41533
perl	ruby
they also provide a free and open source java client for geonames webservices library library for other language also provided ruby python perl lisp...

41536
web-applications	scalability
contains a link to an article on scalability and flexible directory structure for web-applications focus on php though

41538
contains	any
with the identical contains sequence including characters if any from the original directive

41541
bmp	png
however i m not entirely sure that the bmp file format supports transparency - so you would have to save the file as perhaps a png file instead

41545
emacs	vim
there are quite a few vi clones vim and also various emacs implementations gnu emacs vs

41547
authentication	login
i have imagined a very simple authentication mechanism where people just enter their email address and gets sent a unique login url that sets a cookie that will always identify them for future requests

41555
authentication	login
i think this should just be a case of calling authentication and login based on the contents of your cookie

41589
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
in .net threadpool threads won t return without setting up manualresetevent s or autoresetevent s

41617
sql-server	mysql
however what you can do is use this to migrate to sql-server express free download and then migrate from sql-server to mysql

41632
hashtable	set
if we cannot be sure about the correctness of the input set sorting and counting or using a hashtable counting occurances with the integer itself being the hash key would both be feasible

41634
double	int
that isn t quite true - if a methods is overloaded to both ienumerable int and ienumerable double then it may silently pass the unexpected inferred type due to some other change in the program to the wrong overload hence causing incorrect behaviour

41638
base-class	inherited
the rest of the example is rather generic it has two domain classes which inherited from a base-class a setup file to instert some data and the repository to provide the activerecordmediator abilities

41643
32-bit	64bit
the os is a several-year old 32-bit fedora distro not possible to upgradable to 64bit for the foreseeable future

41659
properties-file	web.xml
this might sound a little bit uncommon but i d like for this component i m working on to be able to be packaged with one of our webapps and also be versatile enough to be packaged with some of our command-line tools without requiring a new properties-file just for my component - so i was hoping to piggyback on top of other configuration files such as web.xml

41665
bmp	png
is there any way to convert a bmp image to jpg png without losing the quality in c#

41668
imagemagick	magick++
imagemagick can manipulate about anything and has interfaces for a dozen of languages including the magick++ api for c++

41682
perl	c++
i ve used c++ namespaces the same way i do in c# perl etc

41707
value	field
if you need to add more field later all you need to change is the code that converts the tuples to a dictionary and the code that actually makes use of the new value

41717
webforms	asp.net
currently my sites are running the traditional asp.net 2.0 webforms and it works ok for us so my other option is just to stick with what i know and make the move to asp.net 3.5 with the integrated ajax stuff

41720
webforms	asp.net
it works closer to the base of the framework than normal asp.net webforms

41720
asp.net-mvc	webforms
so by using asp.net-mvc and understanding it you will have a better understanding of how webforms work

41720
asp.net-mvc	webforms
so start with asp.net-mvc and you will easily be able to move in to webforms if needed

41722
webforms	asp.net
you will always have to worry about code breaking when moving from webforms to mvc however the asp.net mvc team has done a great job to minimize the problems

41723
dictionary	arrays
this will first create an arrays jobid val1 label val2 username val3 and then convert that to a dictionary

41726
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms is a completely different abstraction over the base framework than asp.net mvc

41726
webforms	asp.net
with mvc you ve got more control over what happens under the covers than with asp.net webforms

41732
asp.net-mvc	webforms
imo there are more pitfalls in normal webforms scenarios than with just asp.net-mvc

41752
sql-server	oracle
different databases support microsoft sql-server oracle access

41752
data-access	nhibernate
it supports generation of data-access layers that use nhibernate as their persistence framework

41765
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i suggest you directly jump to asp.net-mvc and skip webforms

41774
revision	updates
right click on the trunk folder and choose either checkout if you want to updates from svn later or export if you just want your own copy of that revision

41796
syntax-highlighting	code-folding
i m looking for a quality winforms component that supports syntax-highlighting code-folding and the like

41804
constructor	object
and lock this object in the constructor

41805
bison	yacc
re lex yacc bison

41820
constructor	private
make the constructor private

41836
fatal-error	crash
that is they will work fine for about 37 pages requests and then fail about 42 pages requests resulting in an require call to cause a fatal-error effectively crash the site

41837
value	field
i have defined a id value for each image and i also have other indices on the field

41847
isnull	nvl
nvl replaces isnull

41884
value	field
if updating varchar or blob field you may add a cost of page splits during update when the new value surpasses the length of the old value

41925
triggers	insert
as an update here is what i m doing now i still store numbers exactly as they were entered in a varchar field but instead of normalizing things at query time i have a triggers that does all that work as records are insert or updated

41928
exception-handling	try-catch
finally i enclosed and this is dirty my apologies lines 1417 to 1474 with a try-catch block swallowing the exception-handling

41931
put	get
i ve used simple sine wave generators mixed together with some phase and amplitude noise thrown in to get signals that sound and look interesting to humans when put through speakers or lights but i don t know what you mean by interesting

41932
google-chrome	firefox
i have compared mozilla firefox 3.0.1 and google google-chrome 0.2.149.27 on sunspider javascript benchmark with the following results

41951
order	add
you can add pointers to the elements of the arrays to a tlist then call tlist.sort with a comparison function and finally create a new arrays and copy the values out of the tlist in the desired order

41961
constructor	object
in a sense constructors can be considered to be thread safe because the reference to the object being constructed is not visible until the constructor has completed but this doesn t do any good for protecting a static variables

41969
linux	unix
what about unix linux

41969
gnome	kde
is there a standard way to do this or do i have to special case gnome kde etc and manually run the appropriate application nautilus konqueror etc

41986
put	get
don t be put off by the in java part if you don t know java as the concepts and their implementation are well enough explained that you get the gist without needing a detailed understanding of java

41996
value	field
we have a sharepoint-list setup with history enabled so the comments field keeps all the past value

41999
gnome	kde
there might be an function that launches the default for kde or gnome in their respective toolkits but i haven t had reason to look for them

42021
python	ruby
and the package includes three implementations python ruby and javascript

42025
similarity	distance
levenshtein distance looks at two value and produces a value based on their similarity

42039
gnome	kde
i know gnome does and it s important to do this in kde since there are two possible file managers konqueror dolphin that may be in use

42047
metaphone	soundex
i would suggest using metaphone not soundex

42061
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it is a compromised asp.net-mvc framework for webforms

42068
google-chrome	firefox
with json.parse data i see similar error messages unexpected token â µ in google-chrome and unterminated string literal in firefox and ie

42085
ip-address	proxy
some would say you could allow one vote per ip-address to help address this but i ve played plenty of games where malicious users with a nigh-infinite number of proxy defied ip-address-based security

42126
any	set
i don t see any defines in odbcss.h that i could set to avoid this

42144
xsd	xml
i believe that you can also select the xsd with the data definition for your xml file

42168
configuration	logging
the library loads a central configuration file so you never need to change your code to change logging

42178
command-line	cmd
when i need to do this sort of thing i use a batch file to call ftp on the cmd-line and use the mget cmd

42203
sql-server	mysql
i m using sql-server 2005 but feel free to answer for others as well like mysql

42225
traffic	packets
the down side is it may increase overhead for all other network traffic that wants only a few kb for a network packets but is now forced to send recv in 64kb packetss

42246
put	get
the question is how to get just the updated files out of subversion so that they can be physically transported through the firewall and put on the deployment server

42275
fieldset	labels
you should use labels inputs fieldset legends and css to layout your forms

42283
codedom	.net
you can use .net codedom to generate code to execute and use the web service described by the wsdl

42300
svnadmin	dump
you could try playing around with the svnadmin dump command that ships with the subversion binaries

42314
margins	padding
you will then need to add a padding or margins to the bottom of your #sidebar and #content to match the height of #footer or when they overlap the #footer will cover them

42315
put	get
you could use position absolute following to put the footer at the bottom of the page but then make sure your 2 columns have the appropriate margin-bottom so that they never get occluded by the footer

42321
specifications	w3c
they re a pretty reliable way to indicate that content has changed w3c specifications wikipedia

42329
display	width
i tend to give the label a fixed width or display it on the line above

42405
perl	c++
understand for c++ should be able to help you it builds a database that you can access from perl

42421
contains	elements
i ll add to jimmy you also need to have to declare absolute or relative positioning to the elements that contains the footer

42487
sql-server	oracle
we use it to talk to sql-server via odbc and oracle via oci

42502
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have to agree with both of you i am not really like this simplistic webforms style that seems to be integrating its way in to asp.net-mvc

42504
relational-database	schema
note that you should get a perf boost with a star schema in relational-database as well and oracle probably has analytic functions in pl sql anyways

42507
ftp	scp
could you write an svn hook script that uses some methods maybe scp or ftp to send the files over to the remote location at the time they re committed

42513
g++	gcc
if you have access to gcc g++ then the -m option will output the dependency list

42532
contains	set
get the number of words contains in the new question which match the words the set of questions already posted on the website

42536
protected	public
i d also add a protected constructor to myclass to prevent the compiler from generating a public default constructor

42537
children	tree
the structure of the dom tree resides in the nodes itself having a node pointing to its children

42537
children	tree
you have an immutable tree that is basically a set of nodes pointing to its children

42551
32-bit	64bit
you can be half way through writing or reading a 64bit integer or float on a 32-bit cpu and another thread can jump in and change it out from underneath you

42552
jms	jmx
also if the jms broker supports jmx like activemq does you can use jconsole to post message and do a lot more

42553
command-line	cmd
you have to do it from the cmd-line with the cmd tf destroy

42558
constructor	private
it seems impossible to declare the constructor private or protected as is normally done with the singleton pattern.

42566
ip-address	hostname
i m in the process of maintaining a ruby-on-rails app and am looking for an easy way to find the hostname or ip-address of the box i m on since it s a vm and new instances may have different hostname or ip-addresses

42582
webforms	asp.net
the default aspx view engine seems to make the most sense to me coming from an asp.net webforms background

42583
stderr	stdout
if your exe happens to be a console app you might be interested in reading the stdout and stderr -- for that i ll humbly refer you to this example

42610
ruby	php
i am looking for a powerful meta-language to describa behaviour for an application i intend to use in offline mode google-gears + javascript and server side sqlite + php ruby java etc and looking for a good format to describe the model s behaviour which can be easily converted to the target languages

42631
export	csv
we use views for all of our simple data export to csv files

42665
triggers	insert
scope_identity is the last identity inserted using the current sql connection and in the current scope -- that is if there was a second identity inserted based on a triggers after your insert it would not be reflected in scope_identity only the insert you performed

42669
triggers	insert
most of the time this works fine but sometimes a triggers will go and insert a new row that you don t know about and you ll get the id from this new row instead of the one you want

42672
sftp	scp
what would be the best way to do an scp or sftp copy in a unix environment using c

42681
linux	osx
for example we use a third party sqlite dll which actually contains native code in it which we have to swap out if we want to run on osx linux

42686
contains	elements
this contrived methods returns true if the two given collections are equal or if either one of them contains the given elements otherwise false

42690
python	ruby
any opinions on which of the two iron ruby or iron python would be more useful in the long run

42697
python	ruby
i would personally learn ironruby because i prefer the way ruby works over python and since it s one of the same then choose which language you prefer

42698
fadeout	fadein
while john sheehan s approach works you run into the jquery fadein fadeout cleartype glitch in ie7

coding-style	readability
your programmer should be able to realize when no progress is being done in a task and ask for help before the allocated time for the task is out so in theory the correctness of the solution should not be the focus in the code review as much as the way the solution was reached the coding-style in case your company has them in place readability and documentation

42701
freebsd	osx
i don t see them on my default install of osx but it does exist on my freebsd build server

42702
ironpython	ironruby
without getting into the relative merits of the languages which would be an entire pissing contest in itself ironpython stable 1.1.1 beta 2.0 is further along in development than ironruby alpha

42724
strict	let
also if it s okay to let someone else do the distributing for you google appengine and amazon-simpledb are extremely cheap distributed-database services though they re both in beta right now so strict limitations are imposed

42736
ip-address	hostname
you should be able to use etc hosts to define the local hostname to resolve to the ip-address for that machine

42743
.net	wcf
wcf is microsoft s new .net do-all extensible communications framework meant to replace functionality previously available in dcom .net remoting and asmx web services

google-chrome	safari
ie8 seems to me to be more of the same from microsoft who just can t seem to grasp the ui goodness and overall speed of safari firefox and now google-chrome

42802
click	mouse
wm_lbuttondown would be a mouse click what i want is a button click button as in a hwnd button not a mouse button

42804
google-chrome	browser-tab
i was reading googlebooks on google-chrome where they talk about why they decided to spin up a process to host browser-tab every time you created a new tab.

42838
web-config	app-config
you can store the connection string in web-config or app-config file and encrypt the section that holds it

42839

i have used a combination of cruise control.net nant and msbuild to compile and swap out configuration files for specific environment and copy the files to a build output directory

42841
web-config	app-config
encrypt and decrypt of connectionstring in app-config and or web-config

42842

42888
children	tree
you have an immutable tree that is basically a set of nodes pointing to its children

42888

42902
postgresql	mysql
you can use sqlite mysql postgresql or any other dbms with a c language binding

42908

editor s note the above works with gnu readlink and freebsd pc-bsd openbsd readlink but not on os x as of 10.11

42918
absolute-path	symlink
given symlink a that points to b which in turn points to c this will only report b and won t ensure that it is output as an absolute-path

42924
oracle	mysql
products like oracle ms sql server and mysql are vast ecosystems that rarely cross-pollinate in practice

42924
oracle	mysql
at my workplace we use oracle and mysql but we could probably switch over to 100 oracle in about a day if needed or desired

42924
oracle	mysql
so i care a lot about the shiny toys oracle gives us with each release but i don t even know what version of mysql we are using

42941
duplicates	contains
if an option list cannot contains duplicates entires the distinct call is unnecessary

42941
contains	sorted
sorted or hash collections could be used to improve the lookup time of the contains call though it should not make much difference for a moderate number of items

42949
python	php
languages like python and php let you develop in less time and get a functional codebase faster most of the time

42951
restart	reload
you can even reload the files at run time without restart the application in most cases

42951
python	ruby
dynamic languages are generally less verbose and more readable have you ever looked at a given algorithm or program implemented in a static language then compared it to the ruby or python equivalent

42955
haskell	scala
there s the scala interpreter the ghci and hugs interpreters for haskell and of course sql has been both statically typed and interpreted for longer than i ve been alive

42957
push	pull
for example if you design a door well you should never have to add labels that say push and pull. if you want them to pull put a handle

42961

42998
any	set
from the ide this can be set from the property page of any cpp file

43037
json	xml
if your core requirement is a data-interchange format lighter than xml then you might want to consider using json instead of yaml

43043
python	java
i am way more productive in python than in c or java and not just because you have to do the edit-compile-link-run dance

43043
scheme	prolog
hell i d rather code in scheme or prolog than php

43084
sequences	unique
hence your xs any and the sequences that it defines should have a unique namespace

43112
jfreechart	jgraph
i have not used birt or jgraph however i use jfreechart in my swt application

43112
jfreechart	awt
i have found the best way to use jfreechart in swt is by making a composite an awt frame and using the awt functionality for jfreechart

43112
swt	awt
gilbert does not know swt well and it is made for awt

43112
jfreechart	awt
my two biggest problems are as awt events bubble up through swt there are some erroneous events fired and due to wrapping the awt frame jfreechart becomes substantially slower

43117
python	ruby
for me the advantage of dynamic languages is how much more readable the code becomes due to less code and functional techniques like ruby s block and python list comprehension

43122
linux	unix
this should also work in unix linux

43122
child-process	spawn
it looks like the proper c way is to spawn a child-process get a file pointers and all of a sudden my head hurts

43170
triggers	insert
the performant approach is to create an insert modify delete triggers which maintains an entirely different table which contains node-ancestor pairs for all ancestors of all nodes

43180
linux	bsd
i know lots of people will probably recommend i look at linux or bsd

43209
haskell	python
a closer equivelent to haskell would be python

division	modulo
in modular arithmetic a modulo is simply the remainder of a division and the remainder of -2 divided by 5 is 3

43788
communication	messages
objects actors in uml terminology can communication with each other by means of messages

43788
communication	messages
i think of messages as of attempt to communication with some object

cherrypy	django
i personally use a mix of web frameworks by using cherrypy for my web server stuff form parameters session handling url mapping etc and django for my object-relational mapping and templates

43838
nofollow	noindex
you could accomplish this by puting a noindex nofollow meta tag in the html every page but the home page

43845
export	report
if you already have an excel sheet that has the formatting you want just export the data from access into excel for the report

43856
having	select
the control library would then somehow render the form in html without me having to create an html table select the appropriate standard web-controls and all that

44143
python	php
i would prefer a solution in .net python or php but can t find anything

44167
quirks-mode	doctype
in fact any space before the doctype will throw ie6 into quirks-mode

44183
union-all	union
also if you know the contents of table1 and table2 will never overlap you can use union-all in place of union instead

44189
select	union
you can use a union select

44190
javascript	dom
i am looking for a simple javascript example that updates dom

44195
union-all	union
union will be slower than union-all because union will filtering out dups

44196
union-all	union
in oracle at least there is union and union-all union-all will return all results from both sets even if there are duplicates where as union will return the distinct results from both sets

44225
enumerator	any
they don t boil down to the same code in any way really which you d see if you wrote your own enumerator

44226
revision	svn
if you want to use this on a sub-directory of the repository you will need to use svn log to discern the first revision in which that directory existed and use that revision instead of 0

44229
for-loop	loops
unless performance is critical i prefer the foreach loops over the for-loops

44230
javafx	swing
standalone apps may use swing the java ui toolkit or in the future javafx which is supposed to make swing obsolete and may do so in a few years

44248
data-structures	linked-list
might perform better is with data-structures like a linked-list where random access means traversing the list

44278
directory	folder
in addition to the other answers there s a nice powertoy for xp called open command windows here. it adds an option to your right-click context menu when you click inside a folder to open a command windows using that directory as the starting path

44292
methods	extend
in java the thing to do would be to extend stringcomparator override the compare methods making the us and canada special cases then sort the list or arrays passing in your new comparator as the sort algorithm

44337
python	ruby
moving to ruby or python or whatever i no longer get dispatch from the compiler based on type

44341

windowss calls the wh_cbt hook with this hook code when windowss is about to set the focus to any windows

44357
any	set
between any two points in your data x 0 y 0 and x n y n add up y i + 1 - y i for and call this t travel and set r rise to y n - y 0 + k for suitably small k

44367
compareto	equals
not that performance usually matters with 99 of the times you need to do this but if you had to do this in a loop several million times i would highly suggest that you use equals or because as soon as it finds a character that doesn t match it throws the whole thing out as false but if you use the compareto it will have to figure out which character is less than the other leading to slightly worse performance time

44380
keyboard	mouse
either participant can choose to share their screen and the other participant can request control of the keyboard mouse vnc style

44401
button	popup

44436
value	field
i would assume that the browser has some issue with the scripting attempting to set the value of a password field

44436
value	field
edit actually i just did a quick test and firefox has no problem setting the password field s value with code such as

44442
value	field
i m not sure why it s being cleared maybe javascript does not allow password field value to be modified

44443
postgresql	oracle
i guess i was wondering if postgresql or mysql have any obvious advantages in these areas i am primarily familiar with oracle

44470
revision	updates
every time i publish the application in clickonce i get get it to updates the revision number by one

44523
put	get
to get around this you could put a wrapper around the dll and use it to delegate the calls to the user-interface thread by using the invoke methods of the form

44524
authentication	login
if you use active directory you could have each app use ad for authentication login could then be seamless

44556
data-access	nhibernate
he even mentions the fact that this architecture would enable you to later swap out subsonic for some other data-access layer such as nhibernate or linq to sql

44560
subtract	add
well if you know the current page it s pretty trivial to just subtract the number by 1 and add it by 1 then check those numbers against the bounds and display the first and last page always then if they aren t in sequence add the ellipses

44575
mkdir	chmod
it s useful for the chmod and mkdir functions in unix land but aside from that i can t think of any other common uses

44582
logging	trace
i think always always always add logging when there is an exception including the message and full stack trace

44607

44619
logout	login
i was having a heck of a time figuring out how to login and logout using response objects from ruby-on-rails

44635
vbscript	vb.net
you can try wmicodecreator it generates vbscript jscript vb.net and c# code

44638
pylons	django
i d say compared to django that pylons allows you to interchange ints internal parts easier than django does

44638
pylons	django
harder to replace parts not that much of an issue in pylons more so with django

44644

the best comparison is c# vs ruby because both languages support accessor methods which work syntactically just like class instance-variables

44750
virtualization	parallels
parallels desktop for mac for virtualization

44778
concatenation	comma
what would be your preferred way to concatenation strings from a sequence such that between each two consecutive pair a comma is added

44781
boolean	int
as ricardo reyes suggested if it contains non-string types such as int floats boolean none then do

44794
parsing	comma
is safer and quite pythonic though the resulting string will be difficult to parsing if the elements can contain comma -- at that point you need the full power of the csv module as douglas points out in his answer.

44803
macros	vba
from within a vba macros or vsto add-in we re trying to access the metaproperty on the document to set get the user name

44804

44864
any	set
where there are no widths set on any elements and what i want is #inner1 #inner2 and #inner3 to appear next to each other horizontally inside #outer but what is happening is that #inner1 and #inner2 are appearing next to each other and then #inner3 is wrapping on to the next line

44872
display	outline
specifically the information - display block size and outline - outline block level elements options

44916
pascal	delphi
method references in delphi object pascal

44921
ildasm	cil
this is actually quite easy to verify by writing various c# switching statements some sparse-matrix some dense and looking at the resulting cil with the ildasm tool

44926
display	width
what would be perfect in this case for example would be something in firebug that when hovering over an element s size in the layout panels would display a tooltip that says something like width constrained by outer element x

44939
digits	zero
the only caveat to this is that the mtime must be epoch time and padded with zero so it is 16 digits

44971
methodology	waterfall
having worked on a lot of waterfall projects in the past and a lot of adhoc and agile projects more recently there s a number of design artifacts i like to create although i can t state enough that it really depends on the details of the project methodology team structure timescale tools etc

44981
order	join
on some databases notably oracle the order of the join can make a huge difference to query performance if there are more than two tables

44981

has someone successfully overridden the scoring of document in a query so that the relevance of a term to the field contents can be determined through one s own function

45011
sequences	unique
for when you don t want a fixed size increment sequences aren t really what you are after all they really guarantee is that you will be getting a unique number always bigger than the last one you got

45013
versioning	staging
to elaborate a bit further on the difference in appearance basically it appears as if the versioning of the site on the staging server is zoomed in by about 10

45035
linux	unix
not coincidentally it is also the format of the unix date command at least on linux and i believe in other implementations too - though to be pedantic date.tostring pads one-digit day numbers with a zero while unix date does not

45040
3des	aes
so using system.security.cryptography aes or 3des in cbc mode without rolling your own checksum can be dangerous

45045
submitchanges	datacontext
when execution submitchanges to the datacontext after updating a couple properties with a linq to sql connection against sql-server compact edition i get a row not found or changed. changeconflictexception

45045
value	field
i have confirmed that the proper primary field value have been identified in both the database schema and the dbml that generates the linq classes

45066
conditional	operators
you can do this in one line using the conditional operators and the fact that you can cast null to a nullable type two lines if you don t have a pre-existing int you can reuse for the output of tryparse

45072
subclassing	base-class
what happens is that the base-class provides virtual methods which are either protected or private and these virtual methods are the hooks for subclassing to provide the piece of information or action that the base-class does not know and cannot know

45072
base-class	subclass
i would say no because if that subclass couldn t get the job done in the first place then it should never have derived from the base-class

45072
subclassing	inherited
sealing these subclassing also discourages deep levels of inherited which works well for gui frameworks but works poorly for business logic layers

45076
controllers	routes
using this you can have the controllers of the same name under any part of the namespace so long as you qualify which routes belong to which namespaces you can have multiple namespaces per routes if you need be

45077
specifications	w3c
for example it is generally recommended to assign explicit widths to floated elements -- the w3c css2 specifications states that floats need to have an explicit width and does not provide instructions of what to do without it

45101
push	pull
i have found that generally the most performant and stable way to push pull large amounts of data of a device over activesync is to use a socket

45127
implements	abstract
the purpose of an interface is to define an abstract pattern that at type must implements

45158
noscript	iframe
this is a total hack but you could use an iframe inside the noscript tag to trigger an http get on a url to tell the server that a user doesn t have javascript enabled

45170
windows-mobile	windows-ce
if you want to target a relatively standard version of windows-ce either target the standard sdk set of components or go for a windows-mobile platform

45182
web-applications	scalability
performance scalability and a framework that provides a much better foundation for the stateless world of web-applications for a start

45184
ruby-on-rails	django
and you could always go to ruby-on-rails or django if you re interested in self-contained web development stack but a lot longer learning curve

45186
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you even have the choice of webforms or asp.net-mvc

45188
webforms	asp.net
if you like asp and want to move to asp.net skip webforms and learn mvc

45202
configuration	environment
these environments have numerous configuration that slightly vary from environment to environment

45213
perl	c++
at work our code base is c++ and perl and we talk to a mysql database

45213
perl	c++
for our interface we have some fairly thin custom classes wrapped around the basic mysql client libraries for our c++ code and the dbi module for our perl scripts

45231
forwarding	port
there are instructions on how to set up your router to port forwarding request on this page

45236
nhibernate	ado.net
this started as an attempt to break out of the norm at work to use ado.net datareaders datasets and we now have a few projects using hibernate nhibernate

45237
forwarding	port
there may be something you have to do on myoutsideserver to allow forwarding of the ssh port

45239
google-chrome	firefox
today i started testing on webkit and google google-chrome and discovered that not only are the styles inconsistant with both firefox and ie but javascript is not executing at all probably due to a syntax or parse error

45241
google-chrome	safari
just so you ve got one less browser to worry about google-chrome uses the same rendering engine as safari

45241
google-chrome	safari
so if it works in safari it should work exactly the same in google-chrome

45241
google-chrome	safari
google google-chrome uses webkit for rendering which is the same rendering engine as appleâ s safari browser so if your site is compatible with safari it should work great in google-chrome

45254
forwarding	port
also i m pretty sure you are fine to use a regular user as long as the port you are forwarding in this case the 8022 port is not below the restricted range which i think is 1024 but i could be mistaken because those are the reserved ports

45254
forwarding	port
it doesn t matter that you are forwarding it to a restricted port because that port is not being opened the machine is just having traffic sent to it through the tunnel it has no knowledge of the tunnel the 8022 port is being open and so is restricted as such

45274
environment	building
we then use a series of scripting to robocopy the building to other environment

45275
pointers	stack
java to prevent buffer overflow and pointers stack whacking exploits

45278
forwarding	port
using ssh to establish temporary port forwarding

45278
forwarding	port
you can port forwarding all the way around the world this way

45278
forwarding	port
check out the section called forwarding anything simple port forwardinging for info

45287
any	set
however it is much more efficient if you create lets say 500 button because you know that only 500 button will be visible on the screen at any one time and introduce a mapping layer between the button and the items which dynamically reassigns the button to different items every time the user does something which would result in changing the set of button which should be visible like moving a scrollbar for example

45291
contains	any
if that file contains any class module definitions then your other code will now be able to use them

45291
contains	any
if the file just contains code which is not in any modules it will get run as if it were in the same place as your require call like php include

45291
methods	extend
there s also extend which works like include does but instead of adding the methods as instance methods adds them as class methods like this

45299
forwarding	port
in ubuntu you can install firestarter and then use it s forwarding service feature to forwarding the ssh traffic from a non standard port on your machine with external access to port 22 on the machine inside your network

45347
webforms	asp.net
also check out asp.net mvc or if you re set on webforms the new system.web.routing namespace in asp.net 3.5 sp1

45370
webserver	nginx
you also may want to go with a webserver like nginx

45387
postback	ajax
in my last job we ended up rewriting the complete asp.net stack forms controls validation postback handling ajax library etc... - the reason i was given was that the asp.net controls were not accessible enough not were any of the third party controls that were assessed for the project

45401
lighting	shading
what i mean with lightweigt is that it doesn t need shading lighting advanced camera s

45403
any	set
it s fast to set up and dont require that you yourself do or know any server issues

45405
push	pull
the fact that you never connect your repository to anyone else s to push and pull changes doesn t mean that tool won t be right

45415
contains	any
of course the assembly contains tests that i can run from any runner like nunit one testdriven or resharper

45419

can integrate with most of ides visual-studio ankhsvn or visualsvn -- more info or eclipse subclipse -- here someone asked about that

45440
version-control	git
many devs recommended distributed version-control like git or mercurial

45448
internet-explorer	quirks-mode
see quirks-mode and internet-explorer box model bug

45448
quirks-mode	doctype
until i learnt about doctype declerations getting ie to work properly was a real pain because ie runs in quirks-mode by default

45481
contains	elements
how can you do a streaming read on a large xml file that contains a xs sequence just below root elements without loading the whole file into a xdocument instance in memory

45483
margins	padding
the way they achieve default visuals is often different as well such as whether or not they use padding or margins to achieve the indentation in bulleted lists

45497
webforms	asp.net
i have used asp.net webforms to make ui front-end to collection of command line application written in legacy language restful-ish web service and bash scripts

45499
push	pull
that code sample tries to turn xmlreader style code into sax style code - if you re writing code from scratch i d just use xmlreader as it was intended - pull not push

45512
bubble-sort	quicksort
i m sure there s a codinghorror article about this. also many algorithms have degenerate cases where the code does more than is necessary using quicksort on nearly order data could be slower than a bubble-sort with an early-out check

45512
profiling	debugging
always profile release optimised builds profiling debugging code is pointless

45518
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
therefore if your methods wants to explicitly disallow null as opposed to just happening to have a null value raise a nullpointerexception you should throw an illegalargumentexception

45519
pythonmagick	imagemagick
convert the image to .ico format using the python interface to imagemagick pythonmagick

45520
bmp	ico
just change the extension to ico from bmp and you re ready to go

45533
freebsd	osx
be aware that proc is not easily available on unix based systems though freebsd osx

45541
contains	any
in my opinion it is much better to completely avoid having any types that directly contains both disposable references and native resources that may require finalization

45549
selected	listbox
listbox class whose html looks like this sets the width of the selected

45553
any	set
the browsers don t have any proxies set or anything like that

45557
postgresql	mysql
regarding untrusted languages i heard a podcast from josh berkus a postgres advocate who discussed an application of postgresql that brought in data from mysql as part of its processing so that the communication itself was handled by the postgres server

45591
ip-address	proxy
even if you are using ip-address if there s a nat proxy between client and server you may have to accept that anything coming through that proxy is trusted i m assuming that external untrusted clients don t come through that proxy

45592
simulator	platform
locate iphone simulator architectures.xcspec in developer platform iphonesimulator.platform developer library xcode specifications and open in a text-editor

45596
having	select
by the way vb having the same underlying architecture allows much more flexible select case statements the above code would work in vb and still produces efficient code where this is possible so the argument by techical constraint has to be considered carefully

45600
contains	elements
when i used it everything seemed to be working fine but later i found that i can t control any input elements contains in the dialog i.e can t type into a text field can t check checkbox

45606
spring.net	ninject
for the rest i think spring.net castle windsor ninject and structuremap aren t that far apart anymore

45607
joomla	drupal
for some reason joomla does not suit you try drupal

45610
font-size	width
you can design your site so when you increase the font-size all the layout scales nicely with it the only site i can think of that does this is www.geektechnique.org - press the or ctrl+scrollwheel and the layout changes width with the font-size

45613
for-loop	arrays
the imagesarr variable can be iterated through with a for-loop and elements like can be accessed so why is it not seen as an arrays when calling the reverse method

45616
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is actually a little different to safari it uses a completely different javascript implementation and problems have been reported with both prototype and jquery

45627
decrement	increment
we have used a bit of a silly way in the past having a counter increment for every memory allocation call and decrement while freeing

45631
value	field
you can then either have a field which stores a type value or you can imply what type of person you re dealing with by what field are filled in

45664
selected	button
right click on a project selected add- existing item- add as link press on small arrow on add button

45667

45671
packaging	building
it s a build and assembly framework which takes care of the resolution of dependencies the fetching from various repositories building and packaging of the product

45681
png	gif
if a to implement a website with user profiling logins extensions gallery s etc s a newbi then a cms like joomla etc are good but else if you presently have only static content then its good to go with good old html about jpeg i though presently its better to use png or gif as its less bulky

45732
contains	any
i m interested in any object that implements the same interface which has a public collection called thecollection that contains types of ipolymorphiclol

45734
managed-code	native-code
with ngen you still need to have the .net install but using a tool as such all your managed-code is compiled into native-code so you can deploy it to machines without the framework presence

45740
order	add
in order to change the positioning you will have to remove the dom nodes and add them all again at the right positioning

45775
connection-pooling	pool
you can do it in two statements as long as they re consecutive statements in the same connection this will be safe in php with connection-pooling because php doesn t give the connection back to the pool until your scripting is done

45775
any	set
this form returns a result set just like a selected statement and is also handy for returning any kind of calculated default value

45783
msbuild	nant
we have been trying to use msbuild and nant deployment scripting with limited success

45786
apache-felix	bnd
the apache-felix bnd maven plugins will auto-generate your manifests or at the very least help you

45799
python	ruby
written in python since ruby is a no-no why

45835
google-chrome	safari
of course you could go the other way and only count requests from things you know are web browsers covering ie firefox safari opera and this newfangled google-chrome thing would get you 99 of the way there

45858
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses webkit the same engine as is used by safari omniweb icab and more

45866
google-chrome	safari
as has been mentioned google google-chrome has the same rendering engine as safari iphone etc. webkit which passes acid3 so there should be minimal issues if you follow the standards

45866
google-chrome	safari
google google-chrome currently uses a slightly older version of webkit than safari

45889
asterisk	pbx
asterisk is a sip pbx and may or may not work for you depending on exactly what you re trying to do

45899

google-chrome uses a new javascript engine so you ll have to test your javascript using google-chrome as well as safari

45904
alt	src
img width 100 height 100 alt fpo lady src uploadedimages temp_photo_small.jpg

45905

that should be quite possible with a regular expression though i suspect there may be some additional complexities if your urls start contains encoded versions of characters outside the ascii character set

45908
selected	button
right click on a project selected add- existing item- add as link press on small arrow on add button

45917
order	add
in order to add attributes xsl wants

if you replace your isnull and nvl nonsense with coalesce it ll work in t-sql and pl sql

45929
value	field
delete from table where field value will delete only one row in memory tables even though they where multiple rows

45945
quicktime	qtkit
hopefully we ll get all the features of the quicktime c apis in the next versioning of qtkit whenever that may be

45954
binary	hex
i m working on a utility which needs to resolve hex addresses to a symbolic function name and source code line number within a binary

45954

the mips binaries are in elf format using dwarf for the symbolic debugging information

45954
binaries	objdump
i have compiled an objdump with support for mips binaries and it is working

45955
contains	any
the use of the in the attributes is called an attributes value templates and can contains any xpath expression

45963
malloc	free
are you using new delete or malloc free or both

45963
malloc	free
finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility

45978
revision	updates
the client will take care of reading the properties to see what revision s need to be merged in and then updates the properties with the newly-merged revision s

45983
revision	svn
svn export supports an argument to let you check out only the files that changed between particular revision

45983
revision	svn
assuming it s svn revision xxxx

45997
perl	php
my make setup allows me to build rpm s for everything php libs php websites perl modules c apps etc that make up my app

46005
iostream	boost
boost iostream already has a mapped_file source but the problem was that it was mmap ping whole files which limits you to 2 wordsize

46005
iostream	boost
under the covers of boost iostream i implemented a source which is more or less another view of the interaction between std streambuf and std istream

46005
iostream	boost
boost iostream has some of the work done for you and it also provides hooks for filtering and chains so i thought it would be more useful to implement it that way

46008
perl	php
write the process as a server-side script in whatever language php bash perl etc is handy and then call it from the process control functions in your php script

46008
command-line	cmd
i tested this quickly from the cmd-line using sleep 25s as the cmd and it worked like a charm

46014
put	get
a put request could be used when creating a new record put the data at a url which doesn t currently exist but in practice just posting is probably a better approach to get started with

46017
perl	php
there is also a perl module and a php project to do this

46026
updating	updates
if you need access to the regular apps dlls and such but they also need updating you can run the updater from a secondary location with already updates dlls so that they are not in use in the original location

46032
sql-server	oracle
also sql-server integration services i know you are using oracle has a component which does fuzzy matching on strings allowing you to find a near match rather than a straight one-to-one match

46053
mbunit	nunit
i like the sound of combinatorial tests in mbunit i ve tried the abstract base class interface test technique with nunit and although it does work you d need to have a seperate test fixture for every interface a class implements since in c# there is no multiple-inheritance - although inner classes can be used which is pretty cool

46061
keyboard	mouse
i also found that you can paste text into the textbox using the mouse - it just won t accept keyboard input

46079
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms .net 1.1

46084
windows-xp	windows
is it possible to remote-debug a visual c++ 6.0 application running on a windows nt machine from a developer workstation running windows-xp

46127
rollback	commit
that will hold the lock until you either commit or rollback the transaction

46128
profiling	debugging
the other great thing about this technique is that if you re looking in sql profiling you can see the query you generated and debugging it much easier than seeing a stored proc call with 20 parameters come in

46158
thickbox	jquery
this technique is used in cody lindley s thickbox written for jquery

46163
internet-explorer	firefox
for example you can t write conditional comments that target firefox but are ignored by internet-explorer

46165
export	report
you can then have ssrs export the report to about 10 different formats and send to the client including pdf excel html etc

46165
report-designer	crystal-reports
crystal-reports has a similar product thats more expensive but has a better report-designer

46204
hash	md5
it would seem that an md5 hash would work fine

46210
short	base
if they are very short then a unique id can be generated by considering the characters as digits in base 36 26 + 10 that form a n -digits number where n is the length of the string

46218
cacls	cmd
if you can run scripts it might be as simple as runing the cacls cmd on the vm

46218
cacls	cmd
perhaps just have your deployment script read in a configuration and run the appropriate cacls cmd

46219
selected	button
tag and a submit button how do i determine in ie6 and above if a file has been selected by the user

46220
key-value	key
i m not sure what nsunknownkeyexception means or why the class is not key-value coding-compliant for the key

46241
hash	md5
using a credit card number you could perform a hash on it md5 or sha1 or something similar

46247
32-bit	64bit
if you want to handle 72 possible values per character uppercase lowercase numerals punctuation... and you need 10 characters then you ll need 62 bits - two 32-bit integers or one 64bit if you re on a system that supports 64bit computing

46247
32-bit	64bit
cast the pointer of the string to a 32-bit unsigned integer arrays and compare the string 4 bytes at a time or 64bit 8bytes at a time on a 64 bit processor

46255
getter	setter
extract an interface from the helper class add a public getter and setter to the original class to inject the helper class used through its interface and then inject a mock versioning of the helper class into the original class to test how the original class responds to exception-handling from the helper

46290
versioning	upgrade
this can be useful in maintenance or upgrade scenarios where you have an updated versioning of your type that won t work in some old code but you need to upgrade it to the new versioning

46294
simpletest	phpunit
i ve used both phpunit simpletest and i found simpletest to be easier to use

46296
bazaar	git
i m not familiar with bazaar but git doesn t track file renames

46314
endpoint	uri
for an iis-hosted service that is an .svc file just set the address of the endpoint to a relative uri and make sure that your visual-studio or wsdl.exe generated client specifies the endpoint s name in its constructor

46378
contains	elements
now x is an xmldocument contains one elements myconfig which has your serialization custom configuration in it

46410
button	popup
although it is not the best solution and hitting the right session across multiple browser windows is rough we put a countdown timer on our page included a button that just went back and hit the server to restart the session and also provided the user with a javascript popup the user s favorite part of the solution with a message saying that the session was say five minutes from timing out and to hit the ok button to restart

46410
button	popup
then the button would hit the server to restart the session restart the timer on the base page close the popup and the base page didn t need to be refreshed at all

46444
python	java
it apparently handles c++ c java objective-c python idl corba and microsoft flavors fortran vhdl php c# and to some extent d

46465
dsa	rsa
you normally don t want to use public key encryption rsa dsa for the bulk data encryption due to its large computational time

46492
dataadapter	oledb
once your oledb connection is made you can easily create your datareader dataadapter and process as needed

46504
digits	zero
put 3 digits at the front and 2 at the back of the sequences zero pad so the length of the crc is consistent

46508
put	get
the only way i know of to get a reasonably accurate estimate that is it to break the project into individual tasks and get the developer who will be doing the actual work to put an estimate on each task

46523
any	set
because there isn t any need to generate html entities for all the applicable characters that is what htmlentities does according to the documentation if it s already in your character set

46537
handler	service
to kind of piggy-back on what mike stone was suggesting what i would do is encrypt it on the server-side and have something on the server-side that will decrypt it and return it back as json jsonresult in asp.net-mvc framework web service http handler whatever

46544
bazaar	git
in a dvcs like bazaar or git the merged revision ends up with two parent revisions

46547
static-classes	base-class
static-classes cannot inherit from a base-class nor implement an interface at least in .net they cannot

46558
hide	show
what i ve done is obfuscate it when it s rendering and hide it then use javascript to fix the obfuscation and show the link

46583
cvs	git
first i highly recommend using source control like subversion cvs or git

46586
control-structure	goto
even the advanced continuation control-structure in scheme can be described as a sophisticated goto

46597
control-structure	goto
goto is still useful in some languages or circumstances where no appropriate control-structure exists

46599
nested-loops	loops
you can use it for breaking from a deeply nested loops but most of the time your code can be refactored to be cleaner without deeply nested-loopss

46607
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
bubble-sort or insertion-sort

46655
put	get
ruby-on-rails utilizes post get put and delete but it apparently has to do some fakery for put

46663
hotmail	gmail
answers with any of using hotmail yahoo or gmail are acceptable

46667
environment	building
if that s the case building them and ensuring that they are versioned will give you an easily reproducible environment

46704
selected	button
edit the response i selected answers the question i asked however i like the answer that uses bind because it also shows how to distinguish the grouping of radio button

46709
boolean	int
when designing a database to use mvcc multi-version concurrency control you create tables with either a boolean field like islatest or an int versionid and you never do any updates you only insert new records when things change

46727
testng	junit
i have info on my migration from junit to testng here and here

46731
versioning	upgrade
to me it s important that the consuming projects explicitly know which versioning of the common library they are consuming and for them to take a deliberate step to upgrade that versioning

46784
ibatis.net	ibatis
if you went this way you might want to look at a more pure mapping solution like ibatis or ibatis.net

46804
configuration	environment
there would be some configuration involved and its hard to know if this would work in your particuar environment but thats the only solution that i know of which is even reasonably cross-server compatible

46808
compression	streaming
data is include as a simple streaming and many processing environments such as web browsers may not support using containers such as multipart alternative or message rfc822 to provide greater complexity such as metadata data compression or content negotiation

46828
global-assembly-cache	gac
you have to sign an assembly before it can be install in the global-assembly-cache gac where it can be shared by multiple applications

i have a search field on a form and rather than have a label next to the search field i d like to show some grey text in the background of the search field itself search terms for example

46866
sendmessage	message
look for the win32 api sendmessage function and the em_setcuebanner message

46874
authentication	login
also if you already have some kind of authentication mechanism in place you could trace who is using a particular service based on login

46880
hosts-file	hosts
if it will be specific machines just use the hosts to prevent them from getting out to the web

46884
.net	wcf
.net 3.0 or 3.5 contains wcf and is a solid performant communications subsystem with good security

46884
.net	wcf
.net 3.0 is just .net 2.0 with additional libraries wcf wf wpf

46912
contains	set
the official way to do this is to call map.entryset which returns a set of map.entry each of which contains a key and a value entry.getkey and entry.getvalue

46926
comparator	sortedmap
sortedmap will return entries based on the natural order of the keys or a comparator if provided

46932
put	get
i could put a spy on this webpage and if you have it open i get to see what other websites you have open

46948
children	tree
i imagine you d want something like a tree with a list of children as described here

46976
perl	awk
but agreed splunk would work pretty well as would an over-long and unmaintainable perl script or a series of awk s sort s uniq -c s etc

46978
exception-handling	try-catch
for portability one thing to try is using try-catch blocks for most vanilla exception-handling and then set a terminate handler set_terminate_handler to have a minimal hook available for catastrophic exit conditions

46978
environment	execution
your execution environment may be bizarre or corrupt when you enter these functions of course so be careful of how much you presume a sane environment

46988
wordpress	mediawiki
my company uses wordpress and mediawiki internally and we use http_auth access control to create a single sign on

46988
wordpress	mediawiki
then install the httpauth extension for mediawiki and the http authentication plugin for wordpress and configure

47000
hash	md5
as long as it s a hash function be it string.hashcode md5 or sha1 collision is unavoidable unless you have a fixed limit on the string s length

47018
python	ruby
any dynamic languages of course -- python ruby smalltalk javascript etc

47033
show	next
if you want to take the next step of identifying the functions and data-structures to focus on for footprint reduction the --size-sort arguments to nm can show you

47042
winmerge	svn
the easy way to fix many svn errors is to move the whole directory away via the os update to get another clean copy of it and then merge in anything you changed with some other tool winmerge or the like

47083
persistence	stateless
in addition since it s fairly common to make the wcf service code stateless it s pretty easy to scale out the actual wcf code by adding additional boxes which means the overall performance of your system is much more likely to be limited by your business logic and persistence layer than it is by wcf

47086
decrement	increment
you will still have to pick some magic numbers for the initial sleep time and the increment decrement amount but i think this algorithm could be tuned to keep a thread running at fairly close to a determined percent of cpu

47113
perl	php
today most languages platforms java .net php perl etc. can work with almost any dbms sql server firebird mysql oracle postgressql etc. so i wouldn t worry for one second

47116
put	get
do a reverse google lookup meaning put their answer into google as soon as they click submit and see if you get exact matches

47120
order	join
i would assume what is happening is that sql is being forced to pull everything from one table into memory in order to do one of the join

47120
order	join
sometimes reversing the order that you join the tables will also help things

47125
punctuation	words
if you get to design the entire course try to have some online homeworks as well so that you can build a profiling for each student such as a statistical analysis of how often they use certain common words and punctuation

47126
reliability	robustness
all the usual caveats regarding error-handling robustness reliability

47128
order	join
since both join match on the first table changing up the order won t effect the accuracy of the results

47128
order	join
as a practical matter the query optimizer should be smart enough to compile to use the faster option regardless of which order you specified for the join

47186
value	field
the http put methods ie webdav... will only put the document in the library but not set field value

47186
value	field
to update field value you can call lists.updatelistitem after the http put

47209
mootools	extjs
i ve used extjs and mootools as frameworks in this kind of area

47209
mootools	extjs
if you don t need all the extjs widgets i d say well away from it in future and look at something like the mootools dynamic sortables demo

47225
sql-server	oracle
there is no real constraints on rdbms oracle ms sql-server or the stack it would run on lamp asp.net java and there obviously won t be a silver bullet for this

47236
emacs	vim
cscope does this in a standalone xterm and also can be used inside your favorite editor - it has great emacs and vi vim support

47252
windows-shell	winapi
also you can write windows-shell related code using managed c++ it allows to mix winapi with .net code

47274
methods	extend
i think for complex data types you should extend them by specifying a todb methods which holds their own implementation for creating tables in the db and this way it becomes auto-recursive

47309
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to install godi on linux ubuntu

47324
web-applications	web-services
for more in depth information there is always the owasp guide to building secure web-applications and web-services

47346
put	get
oh and we have this methods too that allows you to put in a whole url string without having to get the querystring out of it

47352
exception-handling	try-catch
the visual-studio debugger wasn t showing an exception-handling and i ve wrapped everything in try-catch blocks just in case but i hadn t thought of trying windbg.

47362
cvs	git
it s leaps ahead of cvs and subversion and very similar to git although somewhat simpler to use

47379
profiling	trace
best way is to fire up profiling start a trace save the trace and then rerun the statements

47393
triggers	insert
triggers allow you to perform a function in the database as certain events happen eg an insert into a table

47413
value	field
it s common to have a table where for example the the field are account value and time

47413
grouping	sorting
unfortunately the last keyword in a grouping gives you the last physical record in the database not the last record by any sorting

47422
web-testing	selenium
selenium grid can run your web tests across multiple machines in parallel which can speed up the web-testing process

47429
search-engine	seo
seo search-engine optimization is another reason

47434
punctuation	words
remove-first-words finds the first words boundary of sequences then takes that section of characters including spaces and punctuation and removes it and returns new sequences

47434
punctuation	words
add-first-words finds the first words boundary of sequences then takes that section of characters including spaces and punctuation and adds it to reverse-sequences and returns new reverse-sequences contents

47459
search-engine	seo
the reason most sites use it is probably seo search-engine optimization

47472
variables	boolean
i could just have easily declared a boolean break variables and used it as part of the conditional for each loop but in this instance i decided a goto was just as practical and just as readable

47476
control-structure	goto
even the advanced continuation control-structure in scheme can be described as a sophisticated goto

47476
control-structure	goto
every control-structure can be implements in terms of goto but this observation is utterly trivial and useless

47519
ubuntu	linux
the system in question is ubuntu 7.04 but that is irrelevant as i m looking to fix it for at least the majority of if not all linux users

47535
value	field
have googled and seen instructions for default value work for other field types but i want to add number

47537
python	ruby
does anyone know if there is a c# console app similar to the python or ruby console

47559
python	ruby
c# may have the reflective power to have a python or ruby style console but the .net framework libraries are geared toward compiling c# not dynamically interpreting it

47591
double	int
int and double

47591
cgpoint	cgrect
cgrect cgpoint cgsize and cgaffinetransform structures

47615
double	int
the + operator can work between a string and a string char int double or float data type value

47617
put	get
all objects with a finaliser get put on a special finalise queue by the garbage collector where the finalise methods is invoked on them so it s technically a performance hit to declare empty finalisers

47644
python	java
it s not python but it teaches c java style programming in a fun robot-programming kind of game

47659
m2eclipse	maven
once you associate your project to maven and update the dependencies using m2eclipse any change to pom.xml are reflected to entire project even java version definition causes it to be compiled in right jre if you have it installed and properly configured into eclipse.

47665
exception-handling	try-catch
to make our lives easier we also have a safedispose methods in our infrastructure which calls the the dispose methods of its argument within a try-catch block with error-logging just in case although dispose methodss are not supposed to throw exception-handling

47674
m2eclipse	maven
in other words m2eclipse is more friendly to the maven way

47676
jndi	jdbc
for development localhost we might be running tomcat and when declared in the context section of server.xml tomcat will hang jndi datasources on java comp env jdbc in the jndi tree

47676
jndi	jdbc
problem in weblogic the jndi lookup is appds whilst in tomcat it seems that that i must provide the formal java comp env jdbc appds

47676
configuration	environment
so that means we end up with two different spring configuration files we re using spring 2.5 to facilitate the different environment

47680
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
another plugin for sphinx is thinking-sphinx which has a lot of positive feedback

47710
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
you should be using illegalargumentexception iae not nullpointerexception nullpointerexception for the following reasons

47710
communication	messages
are you trying to communication a more specific error messages

47712
itextsharp	itext
itextsharp and itext are opensource and free pdf-generation libraries for .net and java respectively

47721
stripes	spring
we re using spring for dependency injection and stripes has excellent support for that

47733
mocking	tdd
out of these tools resharper and picking a good mocking framework are critical for doing tdd

47735
firefox	opera
alas unlike the opera and firefox developers the ie developers have never read the spec and even the latest most secure ie7 will redirect the post request from domain a to domain b without any warnings or confirmation dialogs

47744
debugging	trace
it explains how to add debugging symbols handy for reading stack trace and how to instruct gdb to attach to a running python process

47816
assign	add
and then add a step to your build that assign all the property value i use external buildfiles and include them and uses the expandproperties filtering to generate the actual css

47824
selected	button
this selected box is populated by a set of radio button

47827
web-crawler	seo
the seo guy mentioned that semantic valid html gets more points by web-crawler than jumbled messy html

47864
button	popup
basically i got an updatepanel with a textbox and a button and when the user types in html into the textbox a javascript popup with a error message saying not to modify the response popup

47884
build-process	msbuild
i simply wondered whether people thought it was worth learning to use the msbuild syntax in order to customise the build-process for a .net project or whether it is really not worth it given the ease with which one can build a project using visual-studio

47890
convention	standards
50 is the magic number here because it s not set through standards or convention it s a number that you made up for reasons outlined in the spec

47903
udp	tcp
how much more efficient is udp over tcp

47929
udp	tcp
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp windows size and round-trip time rtt

47932
any	set
we re still in the early stages of this but it s looking good so far however we do have to make sure we create any tables that are required and populate them with test data - however we ve reduced the workload somewhat here by creating a generic set of helper functions that can do a lot of all this for us

47932
python	php
obviously our experiences have centred around a c++ development environment however i m sure you could perhaps get something similar working under php python

47943
defined	declare
you declare all the public defined variables and function-prototypes that you want other programs to access in the header

47965
credentials	account
account credentials and session tokens are often not properly protected

47966
mocking	stubs
sometimes you don t want expectations on every methods you re calling so some mocking frameworks will allow partial mocks that are like mock stubs hybrids in that only the expectations you set are enforced and every other methods call is treated more like a stubs in that it just returns a value

47966
mocking	stubs
sometimes it s just easier to make a stubs by subclassing the class you are testing than refactoring everything to make mocking easy or even possible

47972
groovy	java
i m researching and experimenting more with groovy and i m trying to wrap my mind around the pros and cons of implementing things in groovy that i can t don t do in java

47989
lgpl	gpl
is there a risk of legal trouble if you include gpl or lgpl licensed icons in a closed source software

47990
bitwise-and	bit-shift
to check a bit-shift the number x to the right then bitwise-and it

47990
complement	negation
to make this independent of 2 s complement negation behaviour where -1 has all bits set unlike on a 1 s complement or sign magnitude c++ implementation use unsigned negation

48001
superclass	subclass
simple superclass name qualified subclass name

48001
implements	abstract
abstract object is important whether the abstract object is implements as an

48012
ruby	php
i decide the new fancy stuff is whack and go find something else to learn php and ruby and python were all fun to play with but i couldn t use it much with my existing asp stuff

48015
emacs	vim
i came from emacs to vim when i realized how organized vim s documentation is and how chordable many of the features are

48015
textmate	emacs
textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris

48053
integer	modulus
i read somewhere once that the modulus operator is inefficient on small embedded devices like 8 bit micro-controllers that do not have integer division instruction

48065
emacs	vim
for background i m also a long-time vim user but i learned emacs about 2 years ago and now use them interchangeably

48065
emacs	vim
there are still some things that i find easier in vim block-select mode simple macros recording diff mode and things that are easier in emacs line alignment file buffer management windows screen management

48078
subtraction	division
have you considered doing a division multiplication and subtraction to simulated the mod

48093
division	modulo
all the assembly i have seen x86 68000 implements the modulo using a division

48103
division	modulo
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo

48103
subtract	division
processors with multipliers have interesting division routines using the multiplier but you can get from division result to modulus with just another two steps multiply and subtract so it s still comparable

48103
number-theory	modulus
still there is a small branch of number-theory devoted to modular arithmetic which requires study if you really want to understand how to optimize a modulus operation

48103
division	modulo
so in that vein here s a very low-level look at the math of modulo for an example of x which should show you how simple it can be compared to division

48128
protected	public
if i come up with a good solution i ll remove any ip protected code and put it out for public use

48148
adplus	dump
can somebody suggest a good free tool for analyzing .net memory dump other than adplus windbg sos

48170
google-chrome	firefox
all three worked well in ie 7 firefox 3 and google-chrome

48184
websphere	ibm
ibm s websphere mq site

48210
solaris	linux
while the performance packs offer the ability to use the native platform s media library they re only offered for linux solaris and windows

48215
having	select
trying to make a make generic select control that i can dynamically add elements to but i am having trouble getting functions to work right

48219
webserver	nginx
nginx is great but if you don t fancy a whole new webserver apache 2.2 with mod proxy balancer will do the same job

48223
reflection	runtime
it may be just me but the way i d get into this is by creating a code generator - using reflection at runtime is a bit costly and untyped

48228
value	field
you can send a post request to the website providing value for username password field

48236
g++	gcc
gcc g++ 4.2

48244
required	checked
and let s not forget about all the additional overhead imposed by parsing manifests checked if the image required a compatbility shim checked whether software restriction policies apply yada yada

48248
linux	bsd
it works with many operating systems win32 posix linux bsd

48257
moss	wss
i applied the moss infrastructure upgrade w o applying the wss one before it -- uh help

48265
google-chrome	safari
its based on the open sourced engine - webkit which is used in apples safari and googles google-chrome browsers.see this blog for details

48273
reflection	runtime
code compiles fine tests even run but under special circumstances which the tests didn t cover the program blows up runtime because of my refactoring in one of the objects the reflection code poked into

48273
reflection	runtime
example 1 reflection in or mapper you change the name or the type of the property in your object model blows up runtime

48282
mstest	nunit
look at unit tests - they re loaded by reflection at least in nunit and mstest

48297
required	checked
my approach has always been to have to os crontab or the windows task scheduling load a specific url at some interval and then setup a page at that url to checked it s queue and perform whatever tasks were required but i d be interested to hear if there s a better way

48297
contains	any
so that maintenance service it just runs you know it s like you know a half page of code that runs that maintenance service and it never has to change and it doesn t have any of the logic in there it just contains the tickling that causes these web pages to get called with a certain guaranteed frequency

48305
delphi	c++
it s c++ language support is not 100 but it more than makes up for it by having a great two-way rad ide and the ability to use a huge library of existing delphi components

48344
selected	button
click on the selected provider button

48365
perl	php
i m not interested in php or perl or web development

48369
void	main
static void main string arguments

48405
mstest	nunit
i haven t tried it - but i would advise clients who have a large investment or who have a strong preference for it over the mstest tool in nunit who are interested in implementing tfs to continue with nunit as opposed to trying convert all their existing tests

48449
.when	ready
that unfortunatey led to complexity .when it came to task acceptance since a product wasn t really ready for release until the end of the qa s iteration

48451
dictionary	map
use map if you need something like a dictionary

48486
sql-server	oracle
microsoft sql-server ce and oracle lite

48487
.when	ready
i use this one only because sandcastle didn t seem to be ready yet .when i needed it codedoc

48487
internet-explorer	firefox
edit - i used internet-explorer at that job just realized the site doesn t seem to work in firefox

48492
oracle-xe	oracle
in light of your clarification i d evaluate both oracle-xe and oracle 10g lite before the others

48515
linux	bsd
build it yourself running something like linux or bsd

48515
python	perl
the benefit of this is that it makes it easy to do the dynamic part of your question it s just a matter of a few well-placed shell python perl whatever scripts

48525
linked-list	hashmap
always start with arraylist and hashset and hashmap not linked-list or treemap

48540
linux	osx
i have used this both in linux and also in osx

48550
msbuild	nant
i am trying to publish an asp.net asp.net-mvc web application locally using the nant and msbuild

48558
contains	set
rather than using nested queries in a massive case statement you want to pass in a single parameter contains a list of tags you want to selected from the database and return a record set of items

48570
callback	methods
basically it involves passing a reference to the object and the name of the methods on it that will serve as the callback taking the response as an argument and then use eval to call the methods when need be

48594
classname	inherited
then you have to point inherited to the classname of the codebehind

48597
classname	inherited
your aspx page markup should have inherited point to your code-behind classname not the actual class that it is inheriting

48606
runas	cmd
if you want to change the identity and launch a separate process you will have to use runas cmd

48642
command-line	cmd
how can i write the cmd in the cmd-line so that it does this

48660
innodb	myisam
and myisam works differently from innodb

48670
arrays	loops
we then need to loops through and allocate an int for each spot in the arrays

48704
buffering	streaming
createfile - the createfile function creates or opens a file file streaming directory physical disk volume console buffering tape drive communications resource mailslot or named pipe

48745
udp	tcp
think of it this way if a packet goes missing would you rather just get the next packet as quickly as possible and continue use udp or do you actually need that missing data use tcp

48759
instances	private
you might find you have lots of private methods that could be static but you always call from instances methods or each other

48760
subtraction	addition
if you had a math class you might have a few static-methods to deal with addition and subtraction because these are concepts associated with math

48761
firefox	safari
firefox ie and opera probably safari too all send the if-modified-since header when they receive content with a last-modified header attached so this works fine

48772
sql-server	postgresql
i have never hand-coded object creation code for sql-server and foreign key decleration is seemingly different between sql-server and postgresql

48804
attributes	properties
static-methods should deal entirely with abstract properties and concepts of a class - they should in no way relate to instance specific attributes and most compilers will yell if they do

48857
dbd	dbi
dbi is great but the quality of the dbd modules can vary

48882
spaces	output
if the output stream is buffered the spaces characters will not be sent immediately thereby not performing an adequate test

48900
expression-blend	silverlight
microsoft has positioned expression-blend versions 2.0 and 2.5 for designing the ui of silverlight 1.0 and 2 applications respectively

48903
actionscript	mxml
flex actionscript 3 and mxml for ui definition

48903
search-engine	web-crawler
ajax -- content is native inside browser based on standards searchable by browser and search-engine web-crawler subject to any standard user-interface practices the browser and operating system have established

48922
jndi	jms
in some cases the third-party software may just be an implementation of an standard api java does this a lot with jdbc jms jndi ...

48942
windows-vista	windows
i used the solution described in registerhotkey user32 modified to my needs of course for a c# windows forms application to assign a ctrl-key combination within windows to bring up a c# form and it worked beautifully even on windows-vista

48974
python	ruby
ruby and c# both easily let you create accessors by specifying getter setter methods for an attribute much like in python

49011
json	xml
i have a rest data service where i want to allow the users to create new items with http put using different formats like json xml csv

49060
double	int
type-inferred constants can only be scalar values - things like int double etc

49060
pascal	delphi
to explain why historically typed constants in early delphi and its predecessor turbo pascal are writable and thus essentially initialized global variables we need to go back to the days of dos

49060
pascal	delphi
a lot of people took advantage of this since turbo pascal and delphi did not at that time have initialized global variables as a feature

49063
perl	ruby
if you can get away with using python ruby groovy or perl vs

49122
groovy	java
you can also add grails groovy to an existing java jsp project so it doesn t require a huge commitment or paradigm change

49122
groovy	java
groovy grails is simply ruby rails for java people

49122
spring	grails
finally if you can find a good diagram that shows how grails is built on top of spring hibernate quartz sitemesh and groovy i think people will understand that there is a treasure chest waiting to be unlocked

49129
32-bit	64bit
the size of the parameter on 32-bit systems will be 4 and on 64bit systems compiled with -m64 will be 8

49131
udp	tcp
so the answer to your question depends a fair bit on whether you are using udp or tcp as your transport

49131
udp	tcp
this applies to both udp and tcp

49133
getter	setter
the reason for this is that daos should only be responsible for holding properties of the real world objects they are modeling and only have getter and setter methods or just direct property access

49135
groovy	java
interaction between groovy and java code basically a non-issue

49135
groovy	java
compiling groovy code to java .class files

49135
groovy	java
one thing i like doing with groovy is implementing an interface defined in java as a map from method names to closures

49137
python	c++
i would like to call python script files from my c++ program

49138
hash	md5
in sql-server would a varbinary 16 be the most efficient way of storing an md5 hash

49152
message	alert
since you didn t specify if you are trying to do this in a webpage you should look at triggers the javascript alert my message

49163
json	xml
wcf 3.5 pre-sp1 was a fairly weak restful platform with sp1 things have improved in both uri templates and with the availability of atompub support such that it s becoming more capable but they don t really provide any elegant solution for supporting say json xml atom or even something more esoteric like payload like csv simultaneously short of having to make use of url rewriting and different extension method name munging etc

49168
perl	c++
i would like to call perl script files from my c++ program

49172
perl	c++
c++ wrapper around perl c api

49182
hash	md5
based on the documentation on msdn and my experience binary is better since the md5 hash does not vary in size

49185
put	get
without knowing what your tag is actually doing presumably its its outputting something in the body section then there is no way that it will be able to get at the head to put the declaration there

49195
python	php
the first language i learnt was php but i have more recently picked up python

49197
having	select
if you use a plain form with a select and a submit your urls will end up having

49208
debugging	trace
or you can use flashdevelop that has both intellisense and can debugging trace your code

49215
.when	ready
as well as ensuring that third party code or libraries that you depend on are always available to you it should also mean that code is almost ready to build on a fresh pc or user account .when new developers join the team

49217
cout	cin
i m feeling your pain i also learned php first and i m trying to learn c++ it s not easy and i am really struggling it s been 2 years since i started on c++ and still the extent of what i can do is cout cin and math

49220
set	bag
i ve consulted the nhibernate reference material but i can t seem to figure when to use set bag and the other nhibernate collections

49225
required	checked
as the project required different versioning of external libraries you will want to updates checked in the newer versioninging of these libraries

49227
perl	php
you will recognise a lot of things from php and you will be surprised how much php and perl python etc do for you

installation	building
i once got a project that could building - but without an installation file and reg keys you couldn t make any alterations to the third-party control layout

49232
3des	rsa
ok forget the last answer i can t read you are working with 3des keys not rsa keys

49233
json	xml
in this case you can indicate the format of your put request s content by setting the content-type header to application json or application xml

49236
temporary	copy
if you need data you can copy it in the ondrop store it in some temporary location then in the wm_app range message pass the index to the data in temporary location

49237
python	php
the benefit is you can learn the lower level syntax without having to learn pointers since memory is managed for you just like in python and php

49260
web-config	app-config
an answer here suggested that one can simply modify the app-config web-config file - whih would work for asp.net but this is a winforms application

49265
web-config	app-config
if i understand your problem correctly you simply change the database s connection string in your app-config web-config

49281
silverlight	wpf
thamir khason presented a excellent session about wpf xna silverlight at tech-ed.

49281
silverlight	wpf
on his desktop using wpf to host xna and ons his mobile phone using silverlight all playing against each other

49282
binary	octal
as noted in answer by joseph pecoraro you might want to watch for strings that are valid non-decimal numbers such as those starting with 0x for hex and 0b for binary and potentially more tricky numbers starting with zero that will be parsing as octal

49315
aes	des
you can go with a tripple des implementation which will give you 112 bits key often referred to as 128 bit but only 112 of them are actually secure or as previously stated you can use aes

49319
python	c++
embeding the python interpreter inside your c++ app will let you run python programs using your application run python scripts

49319
python	c++
in the past i have used swig to generate python interfaces to c++ code

49319
python	c++
it was not clear from your question whether you wanted the python scripts to call your c++ program or whether you just wanted the c++ to call python

49349
selected	button
userclosing - the user is closing the form through the user-interface user-interface for example by clicking the close button on the form windows selected close from the windows s control menu or pressing alt+f4

49377
logging	trace
did you enable trace logging in sharepoint

49377
logging	trace
you can activate it by going to the central administration website operations diagnostic logging trace logging

49379
value	field
many people do suggest obfuscator but they just do renaming of classes methods and field with tough-to-remember character sequences but what about sensitive constant value

49405
installshield	inno-setup
any install like wise installshield inno-setup etc will probably do

49431
click	mouse
user holds the mouse a second or two over the item rather than mouse click but i cannot find a way to do this

49443
asterisk	pbx
also they allow for concurrency an asterisk box - a free pbx some custom made flash client and a custom made sip client on the server

49454
value	field
this creates an onchange event on the selected box that redirects you to the url stored in the value field of the selecteded option

49455
python	c++
what i would like is either an explanation of how to do this or any code that i can read ideally python c or c++ but anything readable will do that does this so that i can understand what i m meant to be doing

49458
order	add
in order to stop writing code to explicitly remove or add controls etc i turned to visual inheritance to solve the problem - in what i thought was a neat clean and logical oo style - turns out that half the time inherited forms have a hard time rendering themeselves in vs for no good reason etc - and i get the feeling that developers and to some extent microsoft have shunned the practice of visual inheritance - can you confirm this am i missing something here

49459
svnadmin	dump
assuming you have the necessary privileges to run svnadmin you need to use the dump and load commands

49460
exception-handling	error-handling
as of error-handling i think that you should control exception-handlings on all layers rather than relying on some general exception-handling handling piece of code

49465
packets	ping
the other problem is that most of the routers in china just drop the packets and don t respond to ping etc so you can t find out their ip addresses

49483
svnadmin	dump
if you have a berkley db backend if you re not sure of what your backend is or if you re changing svn versioning numbers you re going to want to use svnadmin to dump your old repository and load it into your new repository

49483
svnadmin	dump
using svnadmin dump will give you a single file backup that you can copy to the new system

49483
revision	svn
if you don t have filesystem access there may be other third party options out there or you can write something to help you migrate essentially you d have to use the svn log to replay each revision on the new repository and then fix up the metadata afterwards

49500
rewrite	rule
i dont know how to get the subdomain name to use in the rewrite rule

49511
svnkit	svn
this was done using extensions that pull information from svn using svnkit and by linking to bugzilla to extract work assigned to a developer or work remaining for a release

49521
perl	c++
i m currently writing a library for embedding perl in c++ but it s not finished yet

49540
.when	ready
the start-sleep as suggested by blair conrad can be replaced by a call to waitforinputidle of the server process so you know .when the server is ready before starting the client

49541
ms-project	mpxj
the other integration i worked on was integrating to ms-project but the integration was a little messy requiring upload of .mpp files and then using mpxj to extract project information from the .mpp file

49575
getter	setter
if there s no hope of changing the canonical names you could alias the getter and setter manually

49576
pascal	delphi
at the time i was programming windows 3.0 using borland s turbo pascal 1.0 for windows which later became delphi

49582
environment	building
in our current database development environment we have automated building procceses check all the sql code out of svn create database scripting and apply them to the various development qa databases

49597
revision	updates
i use that on my projects to updates my database on the fly while keeping track of revision

49604
ingres	mysql
limit 10 works for mysql and others ingres uses

49630
hide	show
i m using javascript to hide an image and show some text thats hidden under it

49630
hide	show
but when the text is shown if you scroll over it it fires the mouseout event on the containers that then hide the text and show the image again and it just goes into a weird loop

49645
variables	boolean
this may not be the best solution but you could set a global boolean variables that would be accessible to both methods that would just specify if the last action was hoverin or hoverout

49645
variables	boolean
you could use this boolean variables to determine if the code should run or not

49666
hash	md5
i d suggest you take the pieces of information you want in the key and hash it with md5 and then just take the first x characters where x is a key length you think is manageable

49672
enterprise	licensing
for enterprise software sold to technical people you can use a fairly complex licensing system and they ll figure it out

49674
crypt	hash
we keep it simple store every license data to an xml easy to read and manage create a hash of the whole xml and then crypt it with a utility also own and simple

49682
32-bit	64bit
the only complications are addressing more than 4gb of memory space dealing with pieces of code you can t cross-compile to a 32-bit architecture 64bit object files for which you have no source etc and general 64bit migration issues platform specific code such as checking for 0xffffffff instead of -1

49687
mouseover	mouseout
and catch the mouseover and mouseout events on this div instead

49687
mouseover	mouseout
because it has no child elements you shouldn t get spurious mouseover and mouseout events propagating to it

49687
mouseover	mouseout
what i believe happens is that when the cursor moves from a parent element onto a child element a mouseout event occurs on the parent element and a mouseover event occurs on the child element

49698
mouseover	mouseout
i m not sure if this would fit with the rest of your styling but perhaps if you changed the css on the text div so it was the same size as the image or fixed the size of the outer div then when the mouseover event fired the size of the outer div wouldn t change so much as to cause the mouseout event

49699
syntax-highlighting	textmate
they provide plugins for subethaedit and textmate to handle syntax-highlighting but i primarily use vi

49702
quicksort	heapsort
with an arrays i d use either quicksort or possibly heapsort and just change the comparison to use texample.sortorder the swap part is still going to just act on the arrays and swap pointers

49702
linked-list	arrays
if the arrays is very large then you may want a linked-list structure if there s a lot of insertion and deletion

49710
remote-debugging	debugging
miguel had a post about debugging mono running on linux with remote-debugging on visual-studio

49714
version-control	git
from what i understand and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy you might want to consider a dvcs distributed version-control system like git or mercurial

49726
value	field
you ll see why in a second. the value of this field is a checksum of the packed bytes from the other field

49731
perl	ruby
for a number of reasons many of the dynamic languages ruby python perl don t have static analysis tools that are as strong as those available in static languages

49732
web-applications	enterprise
most of the work i do is with what could be considered enterprise web-applications

49736
authentication	login
http authentication information is sent on every request not just to login

49737
value	field
dynamically set the field of some configuration object equal to the value in that file

49737
python	ruby
when using python __getattr__ function which is sort of like method_missing in ruby smalltalk i was working with a class with a whole lot of statistics such as late_total

49746
.when	ready
therefore they want time to install a new versioning in a test area beat it up and deploy on a saturday only .when they re good and ready

49747
updating	updates
i ve written 2 reasonably large scale apps in .net so far and both of them have needed an updating facility to automatically updates the application when i roll out new code

49747
publishing	enterprise
i ve found the enterprise application block updater a bit too complex for my needs and i ve found click once frustrating when it comes to publishing

49767
windows-xp	windows
programs that use the queryperformancecounter function may perform poorly in windows server 2003 and in windows-xp

49767
processor	cpu
if you can limit your code to one cpu setthreadaffinity you can use rdtsc assembler instruction to query performance counter directly from the processor

49773
macros	vba
this example will extract code from the current document it lives in - it itself is a vba macros and will display itself and any other code as well

49774
required	checked
if your product required the use of the internet then you can generate a unique id for the machine and use that to checked with a license web service

49778
having	select
if you stick with this rule i don t see the problem of having select permission

49806
click	mouse
if i have several of these windows open at once and i click one with my mouse when they disappear they cause my application to lose focus it switches focus to the app behind the current one

49809
python	java
i already know php python java and some c pointers and memory management are not so good so i m going to be able to do it if i can find a good tutorial to cover the key parts of it does anybody have a link to a good tutorial for it or better yet for someone switching from one of those languages to .net

49821
webserver	upload
in the php world it s even worse because an attacker could upload a malicious php script and later access it via the webserver

49824
python	java
besides the dynamic nature of python and the syntax what are some of the major features of the python language that java doesn t have and vice versa

49828
python	java
python is not java

49828
python	java
java is not python either

49836
progress-bar	progress
i use it if i have and need a progress update so i can display a meaningful progress-bar

49837
python	java
from a personal perspective python has the following benefits over java

49850
key-value	key
as reflection is relatively easy in java i sometimes use it for simple data key-value maps where i have a small fixed set of key

49859
getter	setter
there is some additional language elements like properties think getter and setter and the ability to overload operators

49862
value	field
in reply to the update in the question i would say that the label option should be selectable but either make it do nothing on submission or via javascript don t allow the form to be submitted without a value being selected assuming it s a required field

49900
required	checked
however now we have a change that required us to build 2 jar files for this project then checked both into vss

49911
python	java
it s only at python 2.2 but still very useful if you need an embedded interpreter that has access to the java runtime

49918
value	field
the undo stack simply remembered the primary keys field names and old value every time a record was changed at the end of each command

49925
union-all	union
what is the difference between union and union-all

49927
union-all	union
the basic difference between union and union-all is union operation eliminates the duplicated rows from the result set but union-all returns all rows after joining

49928
union-all	union
union removes duplicate records where all columns in the results are the same union-all does not

49928
union-all	union
there is a performance hit when using union instead of union-all since the database server must do additional work to remove the duplicate rows but usually you do not want the duplicates especially when developing reports

49934
32-bit	64bit
on my os x box the kernel is a 32-bit binary and yet it can run a 64bit binary

49945
forwarding	port
in order to do this i have my home router set up to forwarding port 22 back to my home machine which is firewalled to only accept ssh connections from my work machine and i also have an account set up with dyndns to provide dynamic dns that will resolve to my home ip automatically

49949
32-bit	64bit
in fact you d need to have either all 64bit kernel extensions or as is the case now all 32-bit ones

49951
32-bit	64bit
the cpu can be switched from 64bit execution mode to 32-bit when it traps into kernel context and a 32-bit kernel can still be constructed to understand the structures passed in from 64bit user-space apps

49951
32-bit	64bit
it doesn t really matter whether that pointer in the ioctl was 64bit or 32-bit the kernel does not dereference it directly in either case

49951
32-bit	64bit
so mixing a 32-bit kernel and 64bit binaries can work and vice-versa

49951
32-bit	64bit
the thing you cannot do is mix 32-bit libraries with a 64bit application as pointers passed between them would be truncated

49953
double	int
java has basic types which aren t objects which is why many classes in the standard-library define 9 different versions of functions for boolean byte char double float int long object short

49953
arguments	default
default and keyword arguments

49953
python	java
in python you have tuple assignment so you can say but in java you d need to either resort to mutable out parameters or have a custom class with 2 fields and then have two additional lines of code to extract those fields

49953
python	java
java has much better performance than python and has way better tool support

49953
python	java
sometimes those things matter a lot and java is the better language than python for a task

49953
python	java
i continue to use java for some new projects despite liking python a lot more

49954
cobertura	emma
you could also use code coverage tools like cobertura or emma for java analysis

49965
union-all	union
union and union-all should work on all sql servers

49972
global-assembly-cache	gac
global-assembly-cache gac
