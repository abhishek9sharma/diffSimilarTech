any	set
now that eclipse can use an ant scripting to build instead of just creating its own build environment from an ant scripting then ignoring any changes to it i found some online guides and set it up

80030
substring	ends-with
the expression means match any substring starting from the beginning of length 1-200 that ends-with a space. the result is in result and the match is in matches

80043
windows-xp	windows
windows-xp was actually faster than windows 2000 in many respects

80071
void	main
public static void main string arguments throws ioexception

80071
void	main
public static void main string arguments throws ioexception

80084
callback	methods
i have found that this causes problems in code because if you use a methods within a javascript object as a callback function you can t tell whether this refers to the current object or whether this refers to the calling object

80103
output	mode
how can i determine if my displays are in clone mode without using either copp computer output protection protocol or opm output protection protocol on windows

80104
base-class	inherited
im not entirely up-to-date with vb but in an oo language we would have a monster base-class and inherited to create a pikachu

80105
installation	packaging
are there any good java installation packaging systems out there

80108
derived-class	base-class
it throws notimplementedexception if you attempt to clone an instance of a derived-class that hasn t overridden the clone methods of the base-class

80113
pointers	stack
freeing a block from stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointers

80113
pointers	stack
stack is faster because the access pattern makes it trivial to allocate and deallocate memory from it a pointers integer is simply incremented or decremented while the heap has much more complex bookkeeping involved in an allocation or deallocation

80119
callback	methods
as soon as callback methods are called from other context i m usually using something that i m call callback context

80122
apache-config	.htaccess
you can put this in a .htaccess or in your main apache-config

80122
apache-config	.htaccess
it is always more secure and faster to put this kind of stuff inside your apache-config and not .htaccess if you can help it -- .htaccess slows performance because apache is constantly scouring the filesystem for .htaccess files and reparsing them and it s less secure because these can be screwed up by users.

80139
void	main
public static void main string arguments throws ioexception

80142
malloc	free
the reason for this distinction is that the original free store was implemented with a data structure known as a binomial heap. for that reason allocating from early implementations of malloc free was allocation from a heap

80146
dbix-class	dbi
the mailing list and the book both have a preferences for templates toolkit as do i and dbix-class we continue to use class dbi but you can use pretty much anything you like

80147
launch4j	onejar
for deployment on windows i have had good results using a combinations of onejar and launch4j

80147
environment	building
it did take a little while to set up my building environment properly ant scripting mostly but now it s fairly painless

80157
installshield	nsis
on windows i prefer nsis from nullsoft only because it s less objectionable than installshield or installanywhere

80163
shutdown	exit
sometimes it goes berserk and doesn t shutdown correctly when you exit visual-studio

80176
erlang	scala
two solutions i really like are join calculus jocaml polyphonic c# and the actor model erlang scala e io

80225
put	get
most write a check to a consultant and get their annual and or lifetime certificate to some club so that they can put a graphic on their website or a label on the box their product comes in

80225
versioning	upgrade
your business model is from selling versioning upgrade and tech support and as far as software developers any old robot will do that can write the same code in the same way

80225
verilog	vhdl
i had the pleasure of learning both vhdl and verilog and becoming productive in both within a week from what was almost a dare from such a hardware engineer despite my diploma saying electrical engineer my job title is software engineer

80242
python	java
then you would use your client javascript svg html css to query your server that could store these into a database and the server would be written in an objected-oriented language like java or python

80276
environment	building
you might also want to look at psake - a powershell based building environment

80278
lookup	any
i ll lookup the extjs doc to see if there re any leads to a solution

80281
multiplication	division
also i ve found that it is best to have macros or functions for multiplication and especially division or you quickly get unreadable code

80311
principles	srp
test driven development done right should make developers highly aware of design pitfalls like tight coupling violations of dry don t repeat yourself violations of srp single responsibility principles etc

80314
firefox	safari
it generates completely separate javascript for each major browser family ie firefox safari etc.

80321
python	perl
postgres allows you to use languages like perl and python inside the database but the interaction between the language and the database is nowhere near as clean and easy as it is in plpgsql

80346
malware	website
the preview generates much faster for the client and it hermetically seals the client s session away from things which might bust it in the target website -- poorly behaving javascript and or malware can cause really bad things when you open them even in an ajaxy window-within-a-window

80354
asp.net-mvc	webforms
best mock framework that can do both webforms and asp.net-mvc

80376
32-bit	64bit
some platforms have 9-bit 32-bit or 64bit bytes

80399
linux	unix
for x linux unix there s x11 guitest

80458
exception-handling	error-handling
when used in java both exception-handling types are runtimeexception-handling subclasses and error-handling is highly aspect oriented

80466
silverlight	wpf
using wpf you can build desktop and then almost 1 1 port it to silverlight and target the web

80470
directory-structure	filesystems
i m trying to find out what the performance of a large directory-structure would be if deep directory were to be accessed on a shared nfs filesystems

80478
callback	methods
since a callback is invoked as a function and not as a methods that s why you re seeing what appears to be inconsistent behavior

80478
constructor	object
when invoked as a constructor a new object will be created and this will be bound to that object

80485
protected	public
edit2 maybe you can map it as a protected ilist string and convert to public ilist eaction just as i do with a simple property

80522
contains	elements
xsl text can only contains text nodes and is an elements node not a string that starts with less-than character

80529
bubble-sort	quicksort
tdd could easily lead you to a suboptimal n 2 algorithm and scads of passing tests that allow you to refactor to a quicksort like a bubble-sort

80531
vba	vb6
with vba vb6 you can just declare a byte arrays and assign a string value to it and it will be converted for you

80548
internet-explorer	opera
this is not a problem in opera or firefox only internet-explorer

80566
virtual-keyboard	focus
you cannot very easily keep a keyboard focus on a windows when the stylus has to trail out of the focused windows to push a key on the virtual-keyboard

80577
anjuta	cdt
i have tried netbeans eclipse cdt codeblocks geany anjuta kdevelop and finally settled for kdevelop since that was the closest i could get to vs+va-x

80580
compact-framework	.net
they target .net compact-framework too.

80585
g++	gcc
it uses the standard compiler debugger gcc g++ gdb on linux and the ms compiler debugger on that platform

80609
python	ruby
i prefer java or xslt -based solutions ant will do fine but if there s an easy way to do that in rake ruby or python please don t be shy -

80619
constructor	private
the java c# way would be to use a class of static functions with a private constructor

80627
where-clause	sql
the best solution i have ever seen is to pregenerate a table with days and its type to sql database row per day 365 rows per year and then perform simple count query with proper selection where-clause

80634
ubuntu	linux
note that i m using firefox3 on linux ubuntu 8.04 where the tools- java console menu option does not appear for some reason

80697
tostring	equals
each time i have to reverse-engineer the tables and so i lose every customization i made on the mapping .hbm.xml files like adjusting the identity columns picking the fields used in equals and tostring

80703
double-quotes	single-quotes
if you are using windows you need double-quotes instead of single-quotes

80708
python	ruby
nothing about java python ruby and

80733
revision	svn
we migrated our svn repository with a tool that we wrote and just took the head revision of our starteam projects

80733
perforce	cvs
watch out for differences between single-file checkins cvs and multi-file changesets perforce

80746
driver	kernel
the windows kernel debugger may also be useful to see if the ps 2 driver has some alternate channel

80756
windows-xp	windows
unfortunately i have to use windows server 2003 on my 32 bit workstation due to memory constraints of windows-xp

80756
windows-xp	windows
can this be changed so that windows 2003 servers acts exactly as windows-xp

80833
svnadmin	dump
i ve tried the svnadmin dump load thing but it was a pain

80853
arguments	default
the line is stored in _ which is also the default arguments for many instructions in this case print and regex matching

80859
short	base
in short this means i can t use the trick of going through the activerecord base connection

80866
signals	sigpipe
the writing processes should consider whether to handle the sigpipe signals that is given when you write on a pipe where there is no reading process

80874
void	main
public static void main string arguments

80874
void	main
public static void main string arguments

80875
hardlink	symlink
how do you create a hardlink as opposed to a symlink or a mac os alias in os x that points to a directory

80876
value	field
value the value of this field

80882
arrays	loops
you ve put in an arbitrary 1000 into loops condition but you get my drift if you wanted to go through all the items in the arrays

80910
directory	folder
i include the java virtual-machine inside the application folder in a jre sub directory to ensure that the right java version will be used

80912
svnadmin	dump
to permanently delete monster files from a svn repository there is no other solution than using svnadmin dump load

80935
.when	ready
.when you have your scripting ready just run the scripting in the background while you code

80951
value	field
follow that path to it s logical extreme and you ll end up with one gigantic table with field like key and value and thousands of self-joins in every query

80975
graphviz	doxygen
tools like doxygen used with the graphviz options can generate dependency graphs for include files.

80989
browser-plugin	opera
when running in a browser the application is wrapped in a thin layer as an activex control for ie and as a netscape browser-plugin for firefox mozilla netscape opera

81005
silverlight	wpf
your two main choice are silverlight wpf flex air

81018
where-clause	sql
if you do the filtering by an sql query you would use the filter interface to compose a where-clause

81019
.when	ready
.when you are ready to write the counter just seek back to the start of the file

81022
unix	aix
in the kornshell ksh on aix unix version 5.3 with the editor mode set to vi using

81028
dbix-class	dbi
the management of the development of class dbi and dbix-class in perl

81070
swing	gwt
though with client side there s no clear single answer just look at the comments on this thread there are many options java applets swing javafx ajax gwt air flex silverlight .net etc which all have strengths and weaknesses

81070
any	set
my recommendation for the communication between the client and your c++ server would be to expose your c++ application as a set of restful resources - then at any point in time you can easily write other kinds of clients in any language technology or framework

81082
debugging	exit
then when debugging with vs2003 or greater you will be told of any leaks when your program exit it tracks new delete

81092
hosts-file	hosts
you can override the ip-address for a dns name in your hosts c windows system32 drivers etc hosts

81096
hosts-file	hosts
you can change the ip the dns name points to using your hosts

81101
hosts-file	hosts
edit your hosts located at systemroot system32 drivers etc

81130
hosts-file	hosts
personally i wouldn t try any fancy network reordering or modifying the hosts but just use the ssh tunnel to checkout a fresh copy of the repository on the machine again

81167
base-class	inherited
you would choose virtual instead of abstract when you want some default functionality in your base-class but you want to leave the option of overriding this functionality by classes that inherited from your base-class

81167
implements	abstract
in this case there s no default behavior for the getarea methods in the shape class so you would implements it as abstract

81167
implements	abstract
implements a methods as abstract will prevent you to instantiate a shape object

81171
implements	abstract
an abstract-methods or property both can be virtual or abstract can only be declared in an abstract-class and cannot have a body you can t implements it in your abstract-class

81174
selected	textbox
i want to have a textbox that the user can type in that shows an ajax-populated list of my model s names and then when the user selected one i want the html to save the model s id and use that when the form is submitted

81182
pylons	django
actual choice is a matter of personal taste although none of these two i consider lightweigth pylons might seem lighter but in fact is not and recently django gathered some additional weight - most likely you will not fit even small application like personal blog in 20mb resident memory

81192
deep-copy	object
if not another possible solution is to implement a batch operation where you include a reference to the old class and new class in different namespaces hydrate the old object perform a deep-copy into an object of the new class and serialize the new object

81223
alloca	malloc
btw i would discourage the use of alloca since stack tends to be much more limited than heap use malloc instead

81224
lighttpd	apache
i don t think that s possible right now since mod_dav_svn is an apache module and afaik there is no lighttpd module available

81230
value	field
the value of the added field will be dbnull

81238
directory	folder
edit dizzler was still getting in probably wasn t indicating referrer in all cases so instead i moved all my mp3s to a new folder disabled directory browsing and created a robots.txt file to hopefully keep it from being indexed again

81239
base-class	inherited
if you want a control user-controls from which you can inherited even if you have no logic in the base-class you don t want it abstract because otherwise you won t be able to use the designer in the derived classes

81252
display	height
well after more than 4 hours of debugging i have found that the datagridview row height was too small for the checkbox to be painted so it was not display at all

81257
command-prompt	cmd
open an administrator cmd-prompt and do this cmd

81260
environment	building
some of the other excellent suggestions might be better for buildings in a non-eclipse environment oss probably should make a nice building using ant

81268
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
i have been sick and tired googling the solution for doing case-insensitive search on sybase ase sybase data column names are case-sensitive

81274
constructor	object
so the constructor is only being run once for each object but to give you the interactivity it s creating objects silently in the background without telling you about it

81286
basichttpbinding	was
this was used with basichttpbinding and it works pretty well with moss bdc as well as other applications which use the basic binding

81295
.net	wcf
i m stuck at .net 2.0 vs2005 for the time being so i presume wcf is out of the question otherwise interoperability isn t a problem as i will have control of both clients and services in the system

81315
display	height
the grid just increases the row height to display all the text taking care of word wrap and linefeeds

81329
arrays	loops
the following seems faster on the other hand because it simply assigns the same function reference to the arrays elements throughout loops

81329
arrays	loops
if you were to create the anonymous function before entering loops then only assign references to it to the arrays elements while inside loops you will find that there is no performance or semantic difference whatsoever when compared to the named function version

81330
enterprise-architect	visio
the versioning of visio that comes with vs enterprise-architect has a forward-engineer feature that will generate sql

81339
.net	wcf
clarification the .net wcf services translate exceptions to faultcontracts by default but you can change this behaviour

81343
bash	zsh
if you want to increase your bash zsh prowess

81345
subclassing	superclass
one superclass knows how to rip apart the class hierarchy but relies on its subclassing to actually do something useful with it

81348
expression	evaluation
be an expression evaluation to true technically in evaluates to result of the assignment which is 1 true in this case and thus

81360
ref	out
although possible to use out parameters and pass a variables as a ref to the auto generated functions it isn t a very clean solution

81362
lotus	ibm
ms office outlook connector for ibm lotus domino v2.0.4007.0

81377
file-access	filesystems
like the remote storage service and other utilies that depend on file-access statistics to optimize your filesystems norton defrag

81379
selected	listbox
and as mentioned there will always be exactly one item selected in a drop down listbox are different i believe and this defaults to the top one if none are explicitly selected

81397
visitor-pattern	visitor
you could use a visitor-pattern it allows to iterate over your hierachy doing different operations depending of the node the visitor is currently processing

81401
primitive	int
the various primitive wrappers int are immutable so there s really not a more concise way to do what you re asking unless you can do it with something like atomiclong

81409
boolean	int
no you must be thinking of the operator which yields a boolean expression of type int in c and indeed bool in c++

81410
wordpress	blogs
these work fine in most circumstances including self-hosted wordpress blogs

81418
perl	ruby
it is possible to write a recursive parser in server-side -- perl uses qr and ruby probably has something similar

81441
credentials	ntlm
unlike basic where the 401 challenge happens in-band of the user request - such that the credentials appear in the headers ntlm handshakes are done on a separate port - then forced onto the thread context by unmanaged code

81441
credentials	ntlm
you tried pulling apart the asp.net ntlm module in vs2008 or reflector to see what it does to extract the credentials

81442
javascript	dom
although it is not primarily for javascript debugging it can be useful to also add the ie developer toolbar which allows you to easily and dynamically inspect the style and other properties of your page s dom

81455
quadtree	octree
however to answer your original question about octree quadtree 2 n-trees in n dimensions you start with a hyper -cube that contains the area of space that you are interested in

81472
authentication	login
i have a login form where the system will authentication the user so he she can access certain restricted pages

81484
ftps	ftp
this file will contain edi electronic data interchange information to a mailbox inovis.i have configured the system to open a ftps connection and using the put command i write the file to a folder on the ftp server

81491
compatibility	platform
it s not an officially supported platform but one of the cincom guys was telling me that it should be able to run under a linux compatibility mode

81495
contains	any
i envisage each plugins being packaged as a jar file contains the implementing class plus any helper classes it may require

81512
scriptaculous	sortable
i have three unordered lists that have been created as scriptaculous sortable so that the user can drag items within the lists and also between them

81526
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
admittedly this can be a bit of overkill sometimes but it not hard to set up improves reliability and reduces the chances of the author incorrectly remembering whether true means yes do to comparison in a case-sensitive manner or yes do to comparison in a case-insensitive manner

81527
cos	sin
calculate the size of the chord sin of cos -1 of ratio of normals length to radius of sphere

81530
ftps	ftp
when you are on a windows machine talking to a unix ftp server ftps or ftp - doesn t matter - the protocol is the same the server will replace any cr lf -combination with lf before storing the file and consequently do the translation in reverse in case you get the file from the unix server

81574
eruby	erb
as jordi said though it depends what context you want to run this in - if you re literally going to use templatess like the one you listed eruby would probably work better but i d guess you re actually going to be passing variables to the templates in which case you want erb

81587
any	set
is it possible to get any defaults set up in sql-server that will make this simpler

81624
shallow-copy	deep-copy
do you want to perform a shallow-copy or a deep-copy

81628
any	set
selected any of the grouping is optional so you could pick set a or b or both

81644
terminate	timeout
if i run this after locking the table on the database i get the message that the timeout is hit but i don t know how to then get the mysql_query line to terminate

81654
boost	stl
the stl and boost symbols are name-mangled because of the namespaces they re in

81671
eclipse-rcp	swt
i would like to display an rtf document in an swt actually eclipse-rcp application

81675
contains	any
prohibit any machine specific path to be contains in any ide specific file found in source control

81686
directory	folder
the app itself writes some files and creates some directory to its app folder

81723
implements	abstract
in my abstractnodetype top level for nodetypes i have ab abstract createinstances methods that will once implements by the subclass creates the correct node instances

81728
double	int
the java language always promotes arguments of arithmetic operators to int long float or double

81732
virtual-machine	vmware
i ve got a virtual-machine running on a server that i can t stop or reboot - i can t log onto it anymore and i can t stop it using the vmware server console

81765
contains	elements
if you look at the api for map get operations usually return null when the map does not contains the requested elements

81765
put	get
the best way of doing it natively is to get into a final variables check for null and put it back in with a 1

81779
directory	folder
in nt4 you can create that folder in your installation directory and in windows 98 and below it doesn t matter anyways due to these systems not having a permission system anyways

81784
mbunit	nunit
on the other hand if you mix up code and its tests in a single project you end up with binaries related to your unit test framework be it nunit mbunit or whatever else and your own binaries side by side

81789
environment	building
i ve also documented how to setup a bare minimum building environment

81817
scala	java
if you don t like that you could look into groovy or scala jruby or jpython both are languages for the jvm compatible with java and which allow such extensions

81826
shutdown	exit
so in a server shutdown scenario don t expect exit codes

81826
debugging	exit
that would make it impossible for debugginggers to debugging exit code

81892
32-bit	64bit
most frustrating if you make the switch to native 64bit development with 32-bit back port

81922
msbuild	nant
once that is done you should either be able to exclude the test dlls from your production deployment or even better but higher maintenance create an nant or msbuild for production that compiles without the references to the test dlls

81923
virtualbox	vmware
if it doesn t you might seriously want to consider vmware or virtualbox as these do have this feature and it s really useful for things like this

81936
syncfusion	telerik
i have used telerik syncfusion and infragistics third party controls and i would rate them in that order

81938
json	xml
fwiw we re using jersey as its packed full of features wadl implicit views xml json atom support has a large and vibrant developer community behind it and has great spring integration

81938
spring	seam
if you use jboss seam you might find resteasy integrates a little better - but if you use spring for dependency injection then jersey seems the easiest most popular active and functional implementation

81951
export	csv
i did it by export to csv and then importing with whatever utility is available

81953
enterprise	platform
start with siebel bookshelf and specifically integration platform technologies siebel enterprise application integration

81965
google-chrome	firefox
if you were using firefox and were talking about javascript within an extension to manipulate and theme the windows google-chrome then this would be a different story

81972
abstract-class	subclassing
but did i just sell part of my soul for implying knowledge of subclassing into the abstract-class

81973
solaris	aix
has anyone used ruby in 64-bit environments in various platforms hp ux solaris aix etc. in a commercial production environment that heavily relies on database

81983
difference	datediff
datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds

81990
base-class	subclass
consider the case-when you ll need to add another subclass - you ll also need to update the base-class accordingly

81993
virtual-machine	vmware
using the vmware console i suspended the errant virtual-machine

82016
sftp	ftp
if you have ftp sftp access you could just go ahead and upload phpmyadmin yourself

82018
any	set
sreg is the older of the two and specifies a set of fields that can be requested and sent with authentication whereas ax allows requesting of any attributes

82035
command-line	tasklist
you can use command-line windows tools tasklist and taskkill and call them from java using runtime.exec

82041
constructor	object
i m not talking about inversion of control containers and frameworks to assemble plugin architectures just passing dependencies into the constructor of the object under test

82041
any	set
this led to brittle tests that required lots of painful set up and would fall over as soon as i started any refactoring

82055
groovy	java
however if you re predominantly a java or groovy developer you may prefer it

82074
observers	destroy
of course if the data pumping thread has just asked for the address of the observers it might find it s sending a message to a destroy object

82099
windows-xp	windows
i am using msmq 3.0 on windows-xp and windows server 2003

82111
json	xml
rendering html versus xml versus json of your resources is normally pretty easy with frameworks like jax-rs and implicit views - plus its easy to work with restful resources using a web browser

82128
teamcity	nant
alternatively since we actually use nant to drive the build process we use jetbrains teamcity is there a way to get nant to tell me the time taken for each step

82165
annotations	mapping
jax-rs lets you create rest resources using pojos with simple annotations dealing with the uri mapping http methods and content negotiation all integrated nicely with dependency-injection

82169
teamcity	nant
how would i go about build the setup project using nant so i can include it with the build report on teamcity

82202
python	ruby
ruby and python

82202
delphi	c++
also there are more libraries for delphi than for qt but this is mitigated due to the fact you can just use a c or c++ library in a qt project and also because qt is so fully featured you often don t have to look any further

82211
delphi	c++
i considered java c++ delphi among others before starting with this six years ago

82215
derived-class	base-class
it s when you want to call the derived-class from within a private base-class through a virtual function in this case derivedfunction

82215
derived-class	inherited
now if you want to derive from the class derived and you want to use base service from within the derived-class say you want to move derived somefunction to the derived-class the easiest way to accomplish this is to change the private inherited of base to protected inherited

82215
protected	public
personally i like to make all inherited public so as to avoid wasting time with should i make inherited relation protected or private discussions

82220
value	field
i want to add another field which is a calculated value field that needs to be the date provided by the user + 30 days

82220
value	field
what formula do i need to pass to the calculated value field to achieve that

82240
any	set
you can change the debugging to release or any other build configuration you ve set up

82265
annotations	mapping
one thing you ll gain from using annotations instead of an external mapping file is that your mapping information will be on classes and fields which improves maintainability

value	field
how can i build the lists in a way that i configure the choice field once and use it in multiple lists so that in the future if i add a value to the choice i add it only once

82270
annotations	mapping
to the best of my knowledge you can do most of the stuff as annotations but the more complex mapping are sometimes expressed more clearly as xml

82282
shell	bash
you have all the basic bash shell commands for example grep cut sed and awk at your disposal

82282

progress-bar	progress
i m using the progress-bar control in a wpf application and i m getting this old windows 3.1 progress blocks thing

82373
constructor	object
raii is correct a successful call to the constructor should either result in a fully initialized live object or it should fail and all failures at any point in any code path should always throw an exception

82373
constructor	object
it will still have the potential to throw exceptions they still have to be handled and they virtually always have to be called immediately after the constructor anyway except now you have 4 possible object states instead of 2 ie constructed initialized uninitialized and failed vs just valid and non-existent

82374
children	nodes
child nodes selected all the children of the context nodes whatever their nodes type

82374

instead i would create a method that performs the functionality that you need in the empty constructor and returns the new object

82473
attributes	properties
when i see a get-only properties on an interface i read it as any implementation would expose this attributes bar .

82495
rollback	commit
i was checking out intel s whatif site and their transactional memory compiler each thread has to make atomicity commit or rollback the system s memory like a database would

82555
document	element
css is a methods of styling html document whether this is a table element or a div

82555
duplicates	elements
however and i generally disapprove of this methods since it duplicates existing functionality it is possible to use elements to build a table like structure

82599
python	java
is it java grails python rails coldfusion something else

82601
configuration	installation
if you re using the standard svn installation the svn connection will work on tcpip port 3690 and so it s basically impossible to connect unless you change your network configuration you said only http traffic is allowed or you install the http module and apache on the server hosting your svn server

82602
contains	set
i would say it is possible to drop to flash if you detect that the item is dragged on to the that contains the flash stuff and you set your dragged objects to have a z-index higher than the flash

82634
groovy	java
it depends on your skills with ruby and or groovy whether you have legacy java systems to deal with and where you want to deploy your applications

82634
groovy	java
grails works because we can mix and match groovy with the existing java solutions

82637
python	java
however i would choose a light solution like python or rails over java or coldfusion

82645
session-cookies	cookies
i ve seen a few tomcat valves which seem to intercept the creation of session-cookiess and create a replacement cookies with the correct .example.com domain however none of them seem to work flawlessly and they all appear to leave the existing cookies and just create a new one

82704
webforms	asp.net
use urlrewriteing.net for asp.net webforms or routing with mvc

82715
windows-xp	windows
unfortunately i m stuck on windows-xp and windows server 2003 so that isn t an option for me

82715
handler	service
i found that one solution was to setup a custom handler which would move my message onto another queue or poison queue and restart my service

82721
contains	set
in a sql-server database i have a table which contains a text field which is set to allow nulls

82721
alter-column	alter-table
i can do this no problem via enterprise-manager but when i try to run the following scripting alter-table dbo. eventlog alter-column message text not null i get an error

82734
libxml2	libxslt
the python lxml library acts as a pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries

82761

82803
ms-dos	dos
you can also use mac or dos to respectively convert your file to macintosh or ms-dos ms-windows file convention

82840
innodb	myisam
once thing you could do is write to an innodb copy of the table and then replicate to a myisam copy

83019
iteration	set
lock-in feature set for a short time frame scrum iteration agile

83022
instances	private
i don t think you can create non-zero based arrayss in c# but you could easily write a wrapper class of your own around the built in data structures.this wrapper class would hold a private instances of the arrays type you required

83022
subtract	add
the index function you write could then add or subtract 1 to all index s passed in

83055
key-value	key
it s worth noting that a sorted list stores key-value pairs sorted by key only

83069
windows-mobile	windows-ce
jvm choices for windows-ce in general including pocket pc and windows-mobile

83075
ruby-on-rails	django
i don t think django or ruby-on-rails have gotten quite to that point yet but i could be wrong.

83128
forwarding	port
for each port on the switch list the mac addresses it s forwarding

83129
difference	datediff
the only way to achieve that in sql is to get the timestamp field for two different records and calculate the difference datediff

83158
oracle	mysql
if i m deploying this as a product with potentially multiple backend dbs mysql mssql oracle i d lean to orm

83172
hyperlink	embed

83196
oracle	mysql
type of database mysql db 2 oracle netezza etc.

83199
versioning	upgrade
instead that number is there to allow you to smoothly upgrade your css and javascript files from one versioning to the next

83202
3des	des
des 3des

83229
while-loop	cursor
you might also consider a while-loop instead of a cursor - in my experience it runs faster

83230
text-editor	editor
and then change the radio-button from matlab editor to text-editor and the command for your editor of choice in there

83232
type-safety	generics
it would be nice to use a generics class if only for type-safety

83281
octal	hex
try piping ls into od or another hex octal dump utility to see if they really have the same name or if there are non-printing characters involved

83292
spacing	layout
if you re doing a table-based layout you re unlikely to be using css to control all the spacing and padding in the cells if you were you d almost certainly find it easier to use floating divs etc

83292
spacing	layout
however with a div-and-css-based layout it s much easier to tweak things like the spacing between various blocks and their relative sizes

83298
order	add
in order to do this you should use css and add positioning fixed

83299
linux	unix
the library is written in c and was developed under unix linux and my application will run on windows

83323
heap-corruption	memory-leaks
this catches memory-leaks and also inserts guard data before and after the memory block to capture heap-corruption

83363
configuration	environment
timestamp cache busting in production add this to your configuration environment production.rb

83364
library-project	libs
on the java gnu scientific library-project i used swig to generate the jni wrapper classes around the c libs

83389
internet-explorer	opera
as already mentioned getting everything to work in internet-explorer and firefox opera safari requires judicious use of hacks

83393
order	add
by enforcing relationships fks specify an order in which you have to add delete things which can lead to refusal by the db to do what you want

83398
compact-framework	.net
since i develop for both .net and compact .net i sometimes decompile the full .net assemblies to copy existing functionality to the compact-framework

83402
perl	ruby
similarly if this is not easily doable in ruby but is in another language such as perl for example running on linux then those suggestions would be welcome

83405
json	xml
i got spoiled a bit working with json and am looking forward to something on similar lines for xml

83415
debugging	trace
works well when trying to debugging a piece of code or stack trace also

83443
revision	svn
i want to run svn update -r revision number but can t find a menu option which will let me update to anything besides the head revision

83475
triggers	insert
the delete operation marked the rows for deletion on the clients but the dts operation bypasses the replication triggers so the imported rows are not marked for insert on the subscribers

83476
authentication	login
because currently all i get back from the authentication process is a token granting me access to which ever google service i have specified in the scope but there s no easy way to even get the user s login id gmail address as far as i can tell.

83497
subtraction	time
the benefit is that you can reformat the time however you like including am pm adjustments for timezone addition subtraction etc

83510
iteration	set
have the developers work on a small fixed set of features during a small fixed iteration interval

83512
perl	c++
i am writing a perl script to parse a mysql database schema and create c++ classes when necessary

83512
constructor	object
does it make sense to call all of the get methods in the constructor so that the object has data right away

83516
postgresql	mysql
there s possibly a phobia of stored procedures with mysql partly due to not being overwhelmingly powerful compared to postgresql and even mssql mysqls stored procedures are greatly lacking

83519
bbedit	vim
concerning an ide i use either dreamweaver or bbedit on os x or vim

83527
any	set
on delete set default - if a row in the other table is deleted set any foreign keys referencing it to the column s default

83527
any	set
on delete set null - if a row in the other table is deleted set any foreign keys referencing it in this table to null

83552
extends	final
as everyone else has noted you are not allowed to extends string due to final

83578
oracle	mysql
sorry i don t know mysql but with oracle i would always explicity state the format that i was expecting the format to be in eg dd-mm-yyyy to avoid regional date format problems

83584
json	xml
if your xml is in a simple format you may look at jquery and the xml to json plugin or the xmlobjectifier

83596
bin-packing	np-hard
i think you ve got a bin-packing problem on your hands which is np-hard so i think the only solution is going to be to try every possible combinations until you find one that works

83596
any	set
however any methods you come up with has worst-case-scenario sets of numbers where you will have to try every combination -- or at least a subset of combinations that grows exponentially with the size of the set

83604
entity-framework	nhibernate
if i were using an or m such as nhibernate or entity-framework should i be exposing the entities from the orm directly or should i abstract them the same way i am doing now

83624
syntax-highlighting	code-folding
i like ultra edit because it has syntax-highlighting and code-folding and sftp browser almost any advanced text editors have so it really doesn t matter

83648
boolean	int
according to the php docs strpos and stripos will return an int for the position or a boolean false

83670
datepart	dateadd
use datepart and dateadd to do this

83673
alpha-transparency	alpha
right now what i we have tried is particles with additional local z textures spherical for example and we conduct the alpha-transparency according to the combinations of the alpha value and the closeness by z which is improved by the fact that particle does not have a single planar z

83681
radio-button	input-field
for every input-field radio-button checkbox and textinput you should have

83681
selected	checkbox
if you can t click on the text next to a checkbox to selected it the screen reader doesn t know the text is related to the checkbox

83687
credentials	account
i have a need to display a uitableview containing a user s account credentials

83723
email-validation	validation
i m working on an email-validation check and we need to decided whether to allow user localhost and user example notice no .anything to be validation as a valid email address

83733
margins	padding
this will immediately tell you whether it s a margins problem or a padding problem how wide the element really is etc

83748
knapsack-problem	subset-sum
the subset-sum problem and the slightly more general knapsack-problem are solved with dynamic-programming brute-force enumerator of all combinations is not required

83754
bash	zsh
you can probably do all of these things in bash but my experience with zsh is that if there s something i want to do i can probably find it in zsh-lovers

83778
data-members	constructor
ususally the most costly part of an application is round trips to the database so it would me much more efficient to populate all your data-members from a single query than to do them one at a time either on an as needed basis or from your constructor

83778
constructor	object
have your constructor call a separate init method that queries the database and populates your object s data members

83793
profiling	trace
but personally on linux i have a soft spot for oprofile oprofile this is a system wide profiling which is embedded as a kernel module and periodically trace where you application is spending time

83809
principles	srp
i typically don t expose my business data entities across the wire since i like to adhere to the single responsibility principles srp

83814
firefox	safari
first i develop the site using commonly accepted css to look good in safari and firefox 3

83876
haskell	ocaml
f# stems from the ml family of languages and has a core language compatible with that of ocaml though also draws from c# and haskell

83889
similarity	distance
this code project paper has a string similarity function using the levenshtein distance

83907
similarity	distance
there is the following levenshtein distance algorithm which assign a value to the similarity of two strings well the difference actually that could be used to build upon

83908
contains	set
create a set n not contains and add all points in your set to n

83928
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you can use a stringwriter but it s still writing into a stringbuilder

83946
google-chrome	firefox
a lot of app stylist things don t translate over to firefox well and the webcombo blows up horribly in the new google-chrome chromium browser

83952
windows-xp	windows
a quick note regarding windows vista as a host for vmware server it doesn t work as well with vista as the host os compared to windows-xp as the host

83952
virtual-machine	vmware
the system pretty much locks up while vmware server boots a virtual-machine

83952
virtualbox	vmware
also of note vmware forbids any type of benchmarking to be posted on the internet unless if they authentication the data you will not see any benchmarks that show vmware as slower than tech x the rumor mill states that you can see better performance with hyper-v xvm sun s enterprise version of virtualbox and xen

83955
code-coverage	emma
i use the code-coverage built into intellij-idea based on emma

83975
iteration	set
you can limit the set of points you need to consider at each iteration if you sort points on say their bearing from the city s centroid

83995
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
i ve frequently seen invalidoperationexception or argumentexception when the underlying cause is actually out-of-memory

84001
integer	zero
or more accuractely phrased why would you think that the binary representation of a floating point zero would be the same as the binary representation of an integer zero

84029
value	field
it s possible that the query optimizer might set all field to the same value

84031
oracle	mysql
mysql stored procedures have a particularly horrible syntax oracle and mssql are pretty awful too maintaining them just complicates your application

84034
distance	polygons
what is the quickest speediest algorithim to find the the shortest distance between a red polygons and its nearest blue polygons

84034
distance	polygons
bear in mind that it is not a simple case of taking the points that make up the vertices of the polygons as value to test for distance as they may not necessarily be the closest points

84041
versioning	upgrade
update move to separate spindle or upgrade sql-server versioning as gulzar aptly suggests

84051
checkstyle	javadoc
project src com example foo.java 425 9 warning checkstyle missing a javadoc comment

84054
pointers	stack
the dereferencing via your size_t pointers will in this case return some uninitialized garbage from stack

84075
constructor	object
in the constructor of a phantom reference you specify a referencequeue where the phantom references are enqueued once the referenced object becomes phantom reachable

84075
phantom-reference	weak-references
the initially confusing thing is that although the phantom-reference continues to hold the referenced object in a private field unlike soft or weak-references its getreference methods always returns null

84087
solaris	linux
there is mono which runs on linux solaris and os x

84114
interpreter	runtime
theoretically the language is designed to be compiled into bytecode like java which is interpreter by the common language runtime a mechanism that also allows several languages not just c# to work together and run on the .net

84122
solaris	unix
it s essentially a rewrite of the .net runtime the equivalent of the java virtual machine that works on linux solaris mac os x windows and unix

84132
moss	wss
i install wss infrastructure updates and moss infrastructure updates and now i can t restore the content database on an older versioning

84135
distance	polygons
computing the chet distance between simple polygons

84138
ftps	ftp
maybe you can still use your old deployment infrastructure - just check whether it supports the ftps or ftp ssl

84138
sftp	ftp
you can check details about ftp ftp ssl and sftp differences at page

84138
sftp	ftp
2 sftp or ftp ssl server for windows

84138
sftp	ftps
when you choose whether to use sftp or ftps you have to deploy the proper server

84138
sftp	ssh
i would recommend the rebex file transfer pack - it supports both ftp and ftp ssl and sftp ssh file transfer

84148
moss	wss
there are no supported methods to uninstaller updates in moss or wss

84149
ruby	php
currently i m leaning towards the solution of exposing my java data via a simple servlet that returns json and then rendering the data using php or ruby

84157
sql-server	oracle
going from any data type whether it be a built in type in your database a custom type in c# or a user defined type in sql-server oracle whatever you will have this limitation

84164
base-class	inherited
i m working on a game c# that uses a robocode-like programming model participants inherited a base-class and add strategic behaviors

84168
knapsack-problem	bin-packing
thank you for the pointers to wikipedia - whilst interesting - they don t actually solve the problem as stated as i was looking for exact matches - more of an account book blancing problem than a traditional bin-packing knapsack-problem

84179
solaris	unix
there is one interesting initiative called mono which offers .net support on linux solaris mac os x windows and unix

84180
solaris	linux
conducting a user account cleanup accross solaris and redhat linux systems many of which have a number of samba shares

84187
subclassing	superclass
one very good use case is so you can declare the logger in a superclass and use it in all subclassinges the only downside is that logs from the superclass are attributed to the subclassing but it is usually easy to see that

84203
ruby	php
i m not sure php or ruby are the answer if java isn t fast enough for you

84206
json	xml
we use it to stream xml and json back to the browser for ajax stuff

84207
json	xml
check out restlet for a good framework for exposing your domain model as rest services including json and trivial xml output

84212
private-key	rsa
selected a file from which the identity private-key for rsa or

84232
any	set
i m looking through its menus and don t see any obvious way to set up any custom build steps pre-build post-build pre-link.

84239
distance	polygons
for each vertex in the red polygon compute the distance to each vertex in the blue polygons and find the closest hint compare distance 2 so you don t need the sqrt

84249
log4net	nlog
i do not know about log4net but nlog works perfectly ok with shared file target - multiple-processes can write in one and the same file

84253
similarity	distance
the distance can be used to gauge the similarity of your tracks

84257
any	set
keep in mind that if you return any result set at all from the stored procedure then you need to use these apis as the stored procedure generates 1 result set for the actual execution and then 1 additional one for each result set intentionally returned from the stored procedure

84271
communication	messages
each object becomes a lightweight thread and objects communication by asynchronous messages and pattern-matching

84285
constructor	object
i understand that the object wont have fully initialized until the constructor has run to completion but aside from this are there any other issues

84286
contains	any
is there any tool that can parsing a valid c program and generate a report which contains list of functions global variables #define constants local variables in each function etc

84303
configuration	installation
we just don t want to spend more time on installation configuration than it is going to save us

84307
insertion-sort	shellsort
regarding sorting usually quicksort is hard to beat in performance an optimized one that cuts off recursion if size goes below 7 items and switches to something like insertion-sort maybe shellsort

84307
distance	polygons
thus i guess the question is how to quickly calculate the distance between two polygons after all you need to make this computation 50 times

84307
distance	polygons
minimum polygons distance in 2d spaces

84310
system.data	.net
this provides a .net dll with classes similar to those in the system.data namespace

84320
selected	checkbox
the checkbox property offers a way to selected multiple items in the listview control without using the ctrl key

84320
selected	checkbox
depending on your application using checkbox to selected items rather than the standard multiple selectedion method may be easier for the user

84331
worksheet	excel
is there a macro or a way to conditionally copy rows from one worksheet to another in excel 2003

84331
worksheet	excel
i m pulling a list of data from sharepoint via a web query into a blank worksheet in excel and then i want to copy the rows for a particular month to a particular worksheet for example all july data from a sharepoint worksheet to the jul worksheet all june data from a sharepoint worksheet to jun worksheet etc.

84335
solaris	aix
those run-time libraries handle the memory management calls to the os in a os independent consistent syntax and those run-time libraries are responsible for making malloc and new work consistently between oses such as linux windows solaris aix etc..

84335
malloc	free
calls to malloc and free may occur in any order

84336
children	nodes
if root nodes only supplies a styling data or any other data for itself and it s children then you can place this styling data in a separate structure class and fetch it recursively based on isrootnodes

84364
windows-server	windows
for document management just use windows sharepoint services that comes with windows-server 2003 or 2008

84371
distance	polygons
now you can collect say the 5-10 closest polygons to the red one find the distance center to center subtract the radius sort the list and take the top 5 and then do a much more exhaustive routine

84387
sms-gateway	kannel
take a look at kannel sms-gateway

84390
oracle	mysql
sounds like a good approach to me sorry don t know mysql but in oracle you could set a trigger so that when your main column is updated the length column gets automatically updated

84400
python	lua
often dynamc languages especially python and lua are embedded in programs to add a more plugin-like functionality and because they are high-level languages that make it easy to add certain behavior where a low mid-level language is not needed

84404
command-prompt	command-line
visual-studio 2003 and 2005 and perhaps 2008 for all i know require the command-line user to run in the visual-studio command-prompt

84408
python	java
when i first learned python i worked for a java shop

84408
python	java
occasionally i d have to do serious text-processing tasks which were much easier to do with quick python scripts than java programs

84408
python	java
for example if i had to parse a complex csv file and figure out which of its rows corresponded to rows in our oracle database this was much easier to do with python than java

84408
python	java
more than that i found that learning python made me a much better java programmer

84408
python	java
and as for what makes python easier than java you might check out this question java - python

84420
document	element
so really if there s only one element per document that s going to use the style #title then go with id

84423
python	java
im not sure if this is what you are looking for but we write our main application with java at the small company i work for but have used python to write smaller scripts quickly

84423
python	java
it just seems easier sometimes to sit down with python and write a quick script than mess with classes and stuff in java

84427
void	main
int main void

84437
perl	ruby
i primarily program in java and c# but use dynamic languages ruby perl to support smoother deployment kicking off os tasks automated reporting some log parsing etc

84437
perl	ruby
after a short time learning and experimenting with ruby or perl you should be able to write some regex manipulating scripts that can alter data formats or grab information from logs

84437
perl	ruby
an example of a small ruby perl script that could be written quickly would be a script to parse a very large log file and report out only a few events of interest in either a human readable format or a csv format

84438
distance	polygons
testing the distance between rectangles is easier than testing the distance between polygons and you can immediately eliminate any polygons that are more than nearest_rect + its_diagonal away possibly you can refine that even more

84441
perl	ruby
as for tasks python lua ruby perl are great for small simple tasks like finding some files and renaming them

84441
ruby-on-rails	django
they also work great when paired with a framework ruby-on-rails django lua for windows for developing simple apps quickly

84460
command-prompt	cmd
on that machine the file association is properly set up as far as i can tell double-clicking a .pdf works as does the start xxx.pdf cmd on the cmd-prompt

84500
triggers	insert
yes as mysql doesn t support function-based indexes like add index myindex length text you ll need a new int column and define a triggers to auto-update it after insert and updates

84504
javascript	dom
as well an element you give a specific id to can be manipulated via javascript and dom commands - getelementbyid for example

84504
contains	elements
on the other hand i use classes for those elements that could be used multiple times - for example a div contains an image and caption - i might have several classes each with slightly different styling values

84535
perl	ruby
one big reason to learn perl or ruby is to help you automate any complicated tasks that you have to do over and over

84546
host	root
the above is meant for debugging targets that don t match your host that is why it s important to replicate your root filesystems structure containing your libraries

84546
temporary	copy
if you are trying to override some of the libraries but not all then you can copy the target library directory structure into a temporary place and use the solib-absolute-prefix solution described above

84547
declarative	imperative
i believe that techniques to declarative express side effects in an object oriented framework will allow compilers to decompose imperative statements into their functional relationships

84613
contains	any
additionally the documentation will contains platform-specific remarks and notes on any caveats

84641
event-log	logfile
i cannot find any specific errors in the iis logfile or the event-log

84641
authentication	login
full security auditing is enabled success and failure on every item in the security policy and it shows successful windows login for every user i authentication against the web page which is expected.

84661
order	add
sometimes in pl sql you want to add a parameter to a package function or procedure in order to prepare future functionality

84713
push	pull
i can t speak for anything but .net 2003 parsing where i did some informal performance tests on push vs pull xslt code

84713
push	pull
this is similar to what you are asking apply-template push and call-template pull

84755
usbserial	rxtx
i m using the rxtx library over usbserial on a linux-distro

84756
google-chrome	safari
if anything you should be detecting webkit since as far as page rendering is concerned google-chrome should behave exactly like other webkit browsers safari epiphany

84771
shared-objects	.so
worse with unix elf linking these names will cause cross-linking between shared-objects .so a fooservice fault might be processed by the .soap_getfault for barservice corrupting memory if the fault detail structures are different

84775
value	field
button1 - action set a field value currentview 2

84775
value	field
button2 - action set a field value currentview 1

84838
localization	translation
your question could use some clarification as to exactly what aspects of translation localization you need help with

84839
value	field
i am trying to create an xml file based on data fields from a table and i want to have the nodes named based on the value in a field from the table

84859
usbserial	rxtx
i m using the rxtx library over usbserial on a linux-distro

84859
usbserial	rxtx
one of my biggest problems is that the rxtx serialportevent.output_buffer_empty does not work on linux over usbserial

84860
.net	wcf
forgot to mention we still have to support windows 2000 machines in the field so wcf and anything above .net 2.0 won t fly

84866
promise	future
named pipes doesn t give you the promise of enhancements in future versions of .net

84878
directory	folder
such a handler must be registered in hkcr directory background instead of usual locations like hkcr directory hkcr folder etc

84893
.net	wcf
the wcf and .net remoting are really comparable in performance

84893
.net	wcf
wcf though has much better server throughput than .net remoting

84901
php-extension	xdebug
it utilizes the xdebug php-extension as well

84903
python	perl
i ve had good experience using the test frameworks of both perl and python from testing embedded devices

84907
checkbox	button
does your form have a checkbox toggle button or option button

84934
stream	send
for a tray app you d want a simle protocols to communicate - you might as well use a rest style system to send commands to it and stream xml yuk or a custom data format back

84937
constructor	object
for memory-safety reasons you shouldn t expose a reference to an object or that object s fields to another thread from within its constructor

84940
firefox	safari
just the mainline ones opera firefox ie and safari

84940
firefox	safari
in my experience opera firefox and safari all behave similarly when it comes to basic stuff positioning floats divs etc and it s just ie you ll have to tweak for

84942
postgresql	mysql
sqlinform is an automatic sql code formatter for all major databases oracle sql server db2 udb sybase informix postgresql mysql etc with many formatting options

84943
perl	ruby
it is a lot easier to do text parsing in perl ruby python than it is in java or c# partially because it is a lot easier to use regular expressions

84943
perl	ruby
it will probably take a lot less time to parse the text file using perl ruby python or maybe even vbscript cringe and then load it into the database than it would to create a java c# program to do it or to do it by hand

84943
perl	ruby
it is much easier to create a python perl ruby program to link to a web service and throw some data against it than it is to create the equivalent java program

84943
perl	ruby
but even if you don t is it more fun to spend time cutting pasting or is it more fun to create a perl python ruby script once and then have that generate the code

84943
perl	ruby
however slapping something together in perl python ruby probably would have been worth it

84943
perl	ruby
is it better to do it yourself spend the larger amount of time to make java c# do the task or spend a much smaller amount of time doing it in python perl ruby

84958
32-bit	64bit
we are developing on fedora 9 32-bit and 64bit vista and windows-xp and about half of the developers use one ide or the other

84960
jpql	hql
i really like the ability to write my hql or jpql and view the generated sql real time

84969
archive	backup
7zips all of the backup into a single archive

84971
shutdown	restart
ie restart it 5 times then after the 5th shutdown the whole program and log to file syslog

84974
select	union
in most cases what you really want to say is union all as it does not do duplicate elimination think select distinct between sets which can result in quite a bit of savings in terms of execution time

85006
aspect-ratio	scale
this should scale the image down conserving aspect-ratio so that it is no more than 534 pixels wide and no more than 401 pixels high

85010
restrict	shared
the code is riddled with classes which contains nothing more than public shared attributes variables and methods functions the result of which restrict the application from opening more than one project at a time

85021
solaris	aix
linux windows solaris aix etc..

85021
malloc	free
they re free for instance to make one giant call to malloc and then manage memory within the block however they wish

85034
triggers	insert
is there a way of doing this with out creating an insert triggers

85040
profiling	debugging
the eclipse tptp can be incredibly useful for finding the slow spots in code and for anything else that would requiring debugging profiling or benchmarking

85069
dictionary	arrays
i m assuming that php has an associative arrays commonly called dictionary or hashtable

85069
dictionary	arrays
the most efficient routine would be to run over the arrays once and put the fields into a dictionary keyed on the field name

85069
dictionary	arrays
of course the first pass over the arrays to populate the dictionary would be o n but that s a one time cost rather than paying that same penalty for every lookup

85072
python	ruby
.net allows c# vb j# formerly f# python ruby coming soon and c++

85077
row	col
#theobject.get_item row .get_properties .get_item col .get_count -1#

85080
any	set
any time you need task a to wait for task b to complete then add a state machine state to task a and have task b set that state.

85080
development-environment	platform
here would be my criteria low power excellent debugging ocd excellent development-environment or just eclipse integration low cost good c compiler support and general stability of the debugging platform debugger etc

85082
scriptaculous	jquery
most frameworks yui mootools jquery prototype scriptaculous etc. have sortable list functionality

85085
linkedhashmap	arraylist
i hadn t known the network cost so it makes sense to rework the function to return a linkedhashmap instead of the two arraylist

85117
value	field
then you can just find the form fields by getting the value from newarray field you re filling in

85118
declarative	imperative
declarative imperative object oriented .

85119
turbogears	pylons
what are come good or at least clever ways of running multiple sites from a single common python web framework ie pylons turbogears etc

85150
sqlcompare	redgate
one that i ve always like is sqlcompare by redgate

85158
python	ruby
also for a user accustomed to ruby python etc the ability to generate java bytecode and take advantage of the jdk classes and jit compiler has obvious benefits

85166
.when	ready
getcdrecordableinfo is used to check .when the cd is ready

85186
sql-server	mysql
is there an equivalent schema data export dumping tool for sql-server as there is for mysql with mysqldump

85193
groovy	java
but i think there are also genuine reasons for introducing new languages to the jvm particularly when they will be run in parallel you can use the right language for the right job a scripting language like groovy may be exactly what you need for your page presentation whereas regular old java is better for your business logic

85205
sql-server	oracle
the sql-server express edition ui is much easier to understand than rman or the easier -to-use backup scripts included with oracle xe which requires offlining your database

85215
put	get
get all the projects put on a website and see which gets the most hits..

85223
integer	digits
i m thinking of multiplying the integer part with 10 n where n is the number of digits in the fractional part and then adding the fractional part to the integer part and subtract n from the exponent

85223
multiplying	exponent
then i could use the pow function to compute 10 exponent and multiplying the result with the new integer part

85228
authentication	login
copy database requires that the two servers can authentication with each other which typically means being on the same domain and that the service runs under a domain login

85236
web-applications	enterprise
it s really for enterprise web-applications not consumer-y widgets

85267
python	perl
i d recommend python or perl

85271
turbogears	cherrypy
i use cherrypy as my web server which comes bundled with turbogears and i simply run multiple instances of the cherrypy web server on different ports bound to localhost

85271
forwarding	port
then i configure apache with mod_proxy and mod_rewrite to transparently forwarding requests to the proper port based on the http request

85277
emacs	vim
in the vim and emacs terminal apps the color schemes look horrid

85284
32-bit	64bit
once 64bit gets a little more common you ll need to start building deploying both 32-bit and 64bit versions of the library as well

85327
windows-xp	windows
our cc.net server is on a windows 2003 server and all development happens on windows-xp vista machines

85338
python	perl
both python and perl have excellent string processing capabilities

85372
subtract	add
you can add subtract that to from any date type and you get the right answer

85377
perl	c++
i use the following svn ignore pattern with tortoisesvn and subversion cli for native c++ c# vb.net and perl projects on both windows and linux platforms

85386
safari	opera
the claim in this thinkvitamin article that opera and safari webkit browsers don t cache urls with

85386
safari	opera
what may have confused the author of the thinkvitamin article is the fact that hitting enter in the address location bar in safari and opera results in different behavior for urls with query string in them

85386
firefox	safari
opera and safari behave just like ie and firefox when it comes to caching embedded linked images and stylesheets and scripts in web pages - regardless of whether they have

85402
ienumerator	ienumerable
iterators aren t exactly translatable to the .net way but they are roughly replaced by ienumerable t and ienumerator t

85402
icollection	ienumerable
if you do want to control iteration or make the collection a bit more custom have your collection implement the ienumerable t and or icollection t interfaces as well

85409
svnadmin	dump
if you can catch it as soon as it s committed the svnadmin dump load technique isn t too painful

85413
integer	digits
the first thing to do is to scan the integer representation of the digits for the first set one-bit highest to lowest

85413
scientific-notation	decimal-point
you know the first one-bit positioning the positioning of the decimal-point and the optional exponent from the scientific-notation

85414
virtualbox	vmware
i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox

85414
virtualbox	vmware
how do you port a virtual machine from vmware to virtualbox and keep all the capabilities intact

85416
integer	digits
this could easily be parsing into the integer 1567834 followed by e10 which you d then modify to e6 since the decimal was 4 digits from the end of the numeral portion of the float

85417
machine-code	disassembly
it comes with a decent debugger disassembly that lets you single-step machine-code too

85422
emacs	vim
in addition if there are dev s using emacs or vim you probably want to add and # #

85431
directory	folder
and don t forget to give it rights to all files and folder in your virtual directory

85438
debugging	trace
if you can t use a debugger for whatever reason then compile your application with debugging support and add an exception handler for this particular error and print out the stack trace

85452
solaris	aix
i ve developed on numerous multi-platform c++ apps the largest being 1.5m lines of code and running on 7 platforms -- aix hp-ux pa-risc hp-ux itanium solaris linux windows os x

85452
32-bit	64bit
use the c99 integer types if at all possible instead of long int short etc -- otherwise it will bite you when you move from a 32-bit platform to a 64bit one and longs suddenly change from 4 bytes to 8 bytes

85467
constructor	object
using factories or factory methods for all object creation you can avoid invalid objects without throwing exceptions from constructor

85477
virtualbox	vmware
virtualbox uses a couple of schemes for networking that are a bit different than vmware

85487
ip-address	hostname
how do i perform a reverse dns lookup that is how do i resolve an ip-address to its dns hostname in perl

85500
updatepanel	formview
i have an updatepanel with a trigger pointed to an event on a formview control

85500
updatepanel	formview
when the updatepanel refreshes it needs values from the formview control so that on the server it can use them to query the database

85511
put	get
however if you re timing some hardware for example some algorithm you put in the gpu then time.clock will get rid of this time and time.time is the only solution left

85517
silverlight	wpf
as you may know silverlight does not have the tilebrush found in wpf

85523
lookup	any
for the ipv4 address a.b.c.d lookup any pointers records at d.c.b.a.in-addr.arpa

85532
seam	jsf
my environment is seam 2.0.1.ga jboss 4.2.2.ga and i m using jsf

85536
benchmarking	profiling
however if you re timing the execution of a block of code for benchmarking profiling purposes you should take a look at the timeit module

85540
procedure	records
you can use a stored procedure that returns all the mapped columns in the table for all the records that are not marked deleted then map the linq to sql class to the stored procedure s results

85567
dictionary	arrays
when you don t really need behavior but you need more structure than a simple arrays or dictionary

85570
unsafe	out
unsafe is useful for for example getting pixels data out of an image quickly using lockbits

85614
macports	fink
i would like if possible not to rely on macports or fink though if they can be made to work with the default apache 2 install that would probably be ok

85620
packets	ping
if that doesn t work you could ping the address and then look or if you have access to the raw network using bpf or some other mechanism you could send your own arp packets but that is probably overkill

85630
compact-framework	.net
it should be noted that the garbage collector is different on different .net frameworks - on the compact-framework which runs on the xbox 360 and on mobile platforms it is a non-generational gc and as such you must be much more careful about what garbage your program generates

85634
ifconfig	linux
your best bet would be to parse the output of ipconfig all on windows or ifconfig on linux

85649
click	mouse
since i mostly work on the console i don t like to use the mouse and click on the small task-bar icon hundred times a day

85656
double	int
int double and so on

85664
authentication	impersonation
you just have to be sure that it s authentication using kerberos and not ntlm or some other digest authentication because the digest is not trusted to use as an impersonation token

85674
document	editing
for editing the document i have worked with syncfusions essential pdf and it worked quite well

85701
simpledateformat	date-format
besides tokenizing the raw string and finding the start positioning of the timezone string since i know the format will always be eeee mmmm dd yyyy hh mm aa zzzz is there a way using the date-format simpledate-format date calendar api to extract a timezone object - which will have the same timezone as the string i ve parsing apart with date-format.parse

85709
32-bit	64bit
the .net 1.1 is always targeting 32-bit cpus while .net 2.0 and above can target 32-bit or 64bit according to the processorarchitecture property of the program manifest changed by the platform target option of the visual-studio ide

85709
32-bit	64bit
with the default option any cpu the il code is compiled according to the platform but of course the com call to the axacropdf 32-bit component fails if the platform is 64bit

85715
multiplying	addition
hey juan i d recommend that you use the vector3 class as suggested by several others since it s easy to use and above all - supports all operations you need like addition multiplication matrix multiplying etc... without the need to implement it yourself

85742
nlb	iis
haven t done it yet with wcf but plan to have a local dns entry pointing to our network load balancing nlb virtual ip address which will direct all traffic to one of our servers hosting services within iis

85770
put	get
i get this out put

85781
conditional	parentheses
if you re using an older version ruby-on-rails honza s query is close but you need to add parentheses for the strings that get placed in the in conditional

85789
python	c++
but with languages like python which allow you to embed standard c c++ java inside them or visa versa you can speed up the really critical bits but leave it glued together with the flexibility of a dynamic language

85795
controller	routes
just build your routes as language controller action id

85802
derived-class	inherited
the inherited class solution from scott nichols should work although i will need to derive a class and relationships for around 30 tables - ouch although i need to figure out how to check for a null value in my derived-class discriminator value property

85803
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has the basic of sql and a lot more so if your mysql do not use fancy mysql stuff you will be ok

85803
postgresql	mysql
the mysql one was more stable than the postgresql one

85807
worksheet	excel
i have a web application that is able to open an excel template push data into a worksheet and send the file to a user

85807
macros	vba
when the file is opened a vba macros will refresh a pivot table based on the data that was pushed into the template

85807
versioning	upgrade
it is not in my power to upgrade to a newer versioning of ie corporate bureaucracy

85817
margins	padding
first of all you could try a reset like some other people mentioned here you can do a quick margins and padding reset with this piece of css

85817
margins	padding
most of the layout problems you ll have will probably be caused by internet-explorer s wrong interpretation of the box model you can avoid this by never setting a width and margins or padding at the same time

85817
margins	padding
this might seem annoying but it s not just apply the padding or margins to the content which is inside your element which has a width set

85820
disposable	dispose
now if you call container.dispose it will call the disposable methods also though unfortunately it will dispose of the whole kernel and you will have to add all components back in

85846
any	set
also you need to take care that any cookies are set to be secure so they will only be sent via ssl

85852
subclipse	svnkit
on a recent install i tried the beta drivers i have eclipse ganymede and svnkit pure java svnkit v1.2.0.4502 that you can optionally install with subclipse and they worked pretty much straight out of the box although a colleague found he had to go through a few hoops to make sure eclipse install them and their dependancies correctly

85891
perl	ruby
in ruby perl or python you just intuitively reach for associative arrays hashes dictionaries whatever word you want to use for the smallest things where you might be tempted to create a complex class hierarchy in a statically typed language when the problem doesn t necessarily demand it

85898
perl	ruby
perhaps the only immediate short-term benefit is that developers learn to distinguish the nails that need a python perl ruby -hammer

85916
python	ruby
i m looking for a ruby s equivalent of code like a pythonista idiomatic python

85928
getter	setter
before i start i know there is this post and it doesn t answer my question how to generate getter and setter in visual-studio

85928
getter	setter
in visual-studio 2008 there is the ability to auto generate getter and setter accessors by right click on a private variables - refactor - encapsulate field.

85977
application-pool	iis-manager
either grant that user the level of access to that directory or change the identity that the application s application-pool runs under - in iis-manager determine what app pool is used to run your application then in the app pool section of iis-manager look at the properties for that pool - the tab you want is identity i think this is off the top of my head

85977
administration	account
you can set it to another user account - for example crystal-reports .net requires updates and delete access to c temp - so we have a webmaster user with administration access and use that identity for those applications

86001
click	mouse
later if someone views the pdf in acrobat or foxit just hover the mouse over or click on the little note icons on the page to view the comments

86003
http	ssl
an ssl wrapper pound will decrypt https requests from client browsers and pass them as plain http to the back-end servers

86018
contains	elements
many people dislike storing generated code or compiled code in version-control and it also stands to reason that the public directory shouldn t contains elements that you don t send to the browser

86030
put	get
it took some editing to remove control declarations as they get put in a generated file and conflict with the decompiled base class but nothing a few hours didn t cure

86047
linux	unix
what i m trying to find out is why imake would interpret a word such as unix linux or i386 to a number 1 in the produced make-file

86052
linux	unix
linux unix - .subversion config

86069
message	alert
put a serialization object of data contains the traceback error message into a queue and consume it every x minutes generating reports alert from that data

86083
audio	ogg
convert compressed to to raw audio data and if possible raw audio data to mp3 ogg aac .

86088
show	next
use the command svn status on your working copy to show the status of files files that are not yet under version-control and not ignored will have a question mark next to them

86094
linux	osx
i m not sure if this works on windows it works on osx and linux

86094
git-repo	repo
when you ve got your svn repo cloned locally you may want to push it to a centralized git-repo for easier collaboration

86105
authentication	login
my web application has a login page that submits authentication credentials via an ajax call

86105
dialog	pop-up
i don t want the dialog to pop-up i want want to handle the 401 response in my ajax callback

86105
authentication	login
for example by displaying an error message on the login page. i want the user to re-enter their username and password of course but i want them to see my friendly reassuring login form not the browser s ugly default authentication dialog

86105
authentication	login
the entire reason that i am doing a login form is that our product management team rightly considers the browsers authentication dialogs to be awful

86106
having	select
then in your views you have to know which styling type you re using sass or css by virtue of having to select the public stylesheets foo stylesheet or the public stylesheets sass-out foo stylesheet

86111
aquamacs	macvim
aquamacs and macvim

86144
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
use sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader

86162
floating	margins
try not to use margins left and right when floating elements

86173
python	java
jython and ironpython are useful if you have an overriding need to interface with existing libraries written in a different platform like if you have 100 000 lines of java and you just want to write a 20-line python script

86173
cpython	pypy
pypy is an experimental interpreter compiler that may one day supplant cpython but for now is more of a testbed for new ideas

86189
vbscript	vb.net
there is some truth to this i switch constantly between javascript c# vbscript and vb.net and there is a bit of lost time as i switch from one language to another as i mix my syntax a bit

86201
scala	java
scala link above for example implements functional features while maintaining compatibility with java

86204
configuration	logging
using a configuration file i want to enable myself to turn on and off things like third party logging and using a cache in a c# website

86204
configuration	logging
i have a configuration xml file in which i can assert that logging and caching should be turned on or off it could also be in the web.config that s not the point right now which will result in for example a bool logging and a bool caching that are true or false

86211
daemons	systemd
queue d systemd and daemons either wake periodically and copy or run as services

86212
vbscript	vb6
since the question didn t specify .net this should work in vbscript or vb6

86219
jtapi	tapi
i have used ms tapi in the past but this is windows only and don t want to go the jtapi java route which seems to be the only option on the face of it

86241
sql-server	oracle
i am not that familiar with sql-server but i know with oracle you can specify constraints that you could use to do what you are looking for

86250
configuration	logging
you could use a dependency injection container and have it load different logging and caching objects based on configuration

86250
configuration	logging
if you wanted to enable logging you would specify an active logging object provider in configuration

86256
design-view	designer
when i say design-view i mean that i right+click on the file and choose view designer - this gives me access to the toolbox and tabs for designer split and code-view which is the view i primarily work in

86256
contains	set
pointing vs to an existing set of directory which contains our website

86260
haskell	lisp
i think in addition to your mainstream language you want to have a scripting language high productivity for smaller and one-off tasks and a language with a seriously different cognitive style haskell prolog lisp etc.

86265
32-bit	16-bit
try this microsoft knowledge base article can t run macros that calls 16-bit dll in 32-bit ms excel

86286
windows-vista	windows
be aware that if you are planning to eventually deploy on windows-vista or windows server 2008 many ways that this can be done today will not work

86288
sql-server	oracle
oracle sql-server something else

86303
simpledateformat	date-format
looking at the source for date-format and simpledate-format seems like gettimezone just returns the timezone of the underlying calendar.

86306
enumerator	any
the enumerator will return properties not just of the object being enumerated but also from the prototypes of any parent objects

86310
perl	c++
generally there s a core language c or c++ sql of varying degrees shell scripting and possibly some perl or python code on the periphery

86314
midlet	jsr75
it is quite simple use jsr75 fileconnection and remember to sign your midlet with a valid trusted certificate

86325
stderr	stdout
note the abort message will be written to stderr as opposed to puts which will write to stdout

86327
triggers	insert
you can set up some insert update triggers

86338
instances	self
it seems like if you put all of your logging caching related methods into once class and that class knew whether logging caching was on then you could save your self a bunch of if-statement at each instances

86346
.net	wcf
if you are using the .net framework 3.0 or above i would use wcf

86346
.net	wcf
my personal take is that the wcf approach is more clean as you can do contract-driven services and focus on messages not objects i m making a generalization here based on the default programming models of wcf .net remoting

86346
communication	messages
when all you are doing is sending a messages like you are with wcf it becomes easier to separate your concerns between communication and the classes infrastructure that a single node is composed of

86350
value	field
inside the methods you put field elements that specify the value for each field

86350
value	field
for instance the title field gets the value abcdef

86410
python	ruby
consider using python ruby etc

86417
contains	elements
the workflow is configured with a custom task content type ie the workflow elements contains a tasklistcontenttypeid attributes

86417
contains	elements
this content type s declaration contains a formurls elements pointing to a custom task edit page

86426
python	ruby
would it not make sense to support a set of languages java python ruby etc. by way of a standardized virtual machine hosted in the browser rather than requiring the use of a specialized language -- really a specialized paradigm -- for client scripting only

86426
contains	any
to clarify the suggestion a web page would contains byte code instead of any higher-level language like javascript

86427
ironpython	cpython
ironpython and jython use the runtime environment for .net or java and with that comes just in time compilation and a garbage collector different from the original cpython

86427
ironpython	cpython
a downside in using jython or ironpython is that you cannot use native c modules they can be only used in cpython

86431
export	csv
you may also export the metrics to html for public display or to csv format for further analysis

86431
export	csv
export of metrics to csv or html

86446
contains	elements
because the presentation of the forms is dynamic where the display of some sections is based on the state of the case or the permissions of the user we use sets of stacked divs each contains a table of logically grouping form elements

86456
python	ruby
i don t think however any of these better designed languages will be java python or ruby

86497
scriptaculous	jquery
we can say that we re stuck with javascript but is it really so bad with jquery prototype scriptaculous mootools and all fantastic libraries

86505
specifications	w3c
the data on forms are not part of w3c specifications

86510
sftp	ftps
update winscp now has a .net library available as a nuget package that supports sftp scp and ftps

86515
order	add
i m using cvs on windows with the wincvs front end and would like to add details of the last check in to the email from our automated build-process whenever a build fails in order to make it easier to fix

86534
difference	count
one way to read those lines is to save and compare the line count between changes and read the difference between the last and second last change

86543
contains	any
if you are not doing that and you absolutely do not want any codebehind on the page then you ll have to create a user-controls that contains a calendar control and sets its selecteddate

86548
linux	bsd
i ve heard great things about sun s zfs with raid-z but the linux and bsd implementations are still experimental

86549
httpresponse	httprequest
at system.web.services.protocols.serverprotocol.setcontext type type httpcontext ontext httprequest request httpresponse response

86549
httpresponse	httprequest
at system.web.services.protocols.serverprotocolfactory.create type type httpcontext context httprequest request httpresponse response boolean abortprocessing

86551
version-control	cvs
cvs doesn t group change sets like other version-control systems do

86560
expression	evaluation
lately it has a jit and can also generate bytecode on the fly check out runtime expression evaluation for an example where they use flash to compile user-input math expression all the way to native binary

86614
remote-debugging	debugging
debugging is much more limited particularly problematic for server development is no remote-debugging

86649
python	ruby
languages such as python and ruby use singletons very little because you can use global variables within a module instead

86658
installation	building
i m hoping tim can let me know what s the version and building number on his ssms installation because my current theory is that the problem is just from the specific building that my coworkers and i have on our dev pcs -- the version string is microsoft sql-server management studio 9.00.1399.00

86660
gethashcode	equals
if some other identity comparison is required you have to override both equals and gethashcode

86683
classname	inherited
therefore it s a better idea to reference it by the classname since if you try to take advantage of inherited you ll shoot yourself in the foot

86688
sql-server	oracle
you should note that many large relational dbs oracle and sql-server have xml datatypes to store data within a database and use xpath within the sql statement to gain access to that data

86693
distance	polygons
the distance between the polygons is at most r

86710
document	editing
the document at indicates that some environments do not support editing -

86712
python	perl
if you need to make any more than few non-trivial decisions loops anything go for python perl and modularize

86712
shell	bash
the biggest problem with shell is often that end result just looks like a big ball of mud 4000 lines of bash and growing.

86721
instances	destroy
anyone with a reference to the singleton instances is free to destroy the singleton

86741
strategy-pattern	singleton
so beyond the fact the the singleton will make your code tightly coupled fixable by a strategy-pattern .

86779
linux	unix
if you are doing anything in unix linux macos etc you must read advanced programming in the unix environment also known by the acronym apue by the late w richard stevens

86783
environment	execution
it is a possible security risk it has a different scope of execution and is quite inefficient as it creates an entirely new scripting environment for the execution of the code

86800
wordpress-theming	wordpress
i ve recently embarked upon the grand voyage of wordpress-theming and i ve been reading through the wordpress documentation for how to write a theme

86803
any	set
inside any set accessor or function with state-changing side effects just call the event delegate with a guard for the null no listeners case

86812
children	nodes
how about root nodes with children but no parent nodes nodes with children and parent and leaf nodes with no children and parent

86812
children	nodes
for example a single abstract class that can have child nodes if no children its a leaf if no parent its a root but this can change in its lifetime

86827
value	field
you could also make the value of the combo box into an uneditable text field and then launch a pop-up modal windows to edit that value

86840
command-line	cmd
my suggestion would be to just roll the cmd yourself using the perforce cmd-line as that has to be set up anyway in order to use the java library

86855
streamreader	streamwriter
the first thing you should change are your calls to streamwriter and streamreader to wrap them in a using statement like this

86865
children	nodes
so you have nodes which have children and a parent and you have sectionnodes which are the roots of these special subtrees

86873
deployment	install
windows install deployment

86873
xsd	xml
create xsd schema from an xml document

86881
gethashcode	equals
when two object are the same the equals methods returns true they must have the same value returned from gethashcode

86881
gethashcode	equals
if some other identity comparison is required you have to override both equals and gethashcode

86942
disposable	dispose
another problem with your example is that you should be using the try finally pattern or the using statement to ensure your disposable classes are properly dispose even when there is an exception-handling

86944
postfix-notation	rpn
since rpn is also known as postfix-notation i tried googling convert postfix to infix and got quite a few results

86956
keyboard	mouse
think about the number of mouse keyboard clicks it takes a user to get to something

86958
solaris	linux
sun studio is available for linux as well as solaris

86959
build-process	build-server
normally a build-server handles the build-process and creates builds at regular intervals which are used by testing

86976
alpha-transparency	alpha
you can actually use pure css to get positioning background images with alpha-transparency in ie6 by taking advantage of ie6 s alpha filtering and the css clip property

86977
unmanaged	c++-cli
i ve read in nish sivakumar s book c++-cli in action among other places that you should use the __clrcall decorator on function calls to avoid double-thunking in cases where you know that the methods will never be called from unmanaged code

86977
contains	any
nish also says that if the methods signature contains any clr types then the jit compiler will automatically add the __clrcall

86977
unmanaged	c++-cli
in one sense properties are only accessible from .net languages on the other hand the c++-cli compiler i think just generates methods _get that are callable from both managed and unmanaged code

86991
export	report
then you need to programmatically export the report

86996
order	add
i think you ll need to put something on the left and or right of the split split.setleftwidget widget split.setrightwidget widget or split.add widget which will add first to the left then to the right in order for anything to show up

87006
accurev	svn
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths

87007
32-bit	64bit
in the meantime it has started working properly on the 64bit vista test machine although it still doesn t work on the 32-bit vista machine

87018
contains	lookup
we created a lookup table that holds all the available pick lists and a lookupvalue table that contains all the name value records for the lookup

87021
xsd	xml
given a moderately complex xml structure dozens of elements hundreds of attributes with no xsd and a desire to create an object model what s an elegant way to avoid writing boilerplate from_xml and to_xml methods

87035
traffic	packets
for instances sniff the network traffic rather than monitor it from your server -- have another machine watch the packets fly back and forth and recording statistics about them

87042
switching	screens
you d not be able to capture this unless you switching off the new interface dwm or code specifically for screens capture from the dwm

87062
png	gif
i would like to find a way to take jpeg or gif png images and reduce the amount of colors to 20

87064
order	add
you could also add a sortorder field if you want to manually define the order to display them in

87071
contains	set
where findmeinad is a methods that looks up a user s info in ad and tbpfolderverification.text is a textbox in the form that contains the path i d like to set a particular drive to map to

87141
drawimage	draw
then i use drawimage in the onrender methods to draw the rendering content

87177
spaces	output
i had data in xml that had line feeds spaces and tabs that i wanted to preserve in the output html so i couldn t use p but i also wanted the lines to wrap when the side of the screen was reached so i couldn t use pre

87178
glib	gtk
glib is a portability utility library for c which forms the basis of the gtk graphical toolkit

87210
joomla	drupal
fortunately my hosting account has both .net and php support so i ve been looking into drupal graffiti dotnetnuke joomla community server and more

87211
value	field
if you want you could add a separate value field but i just usually use the id field as the selected box value

87214
keyboard	mouse
you ll normally only get mouse keyboard events to a windows or control when it has focus

87217
order	join
one last thing i would look at is that if you re doing any joins that can be re-ordered try using a hint to force the join order to happen in what you know to be the most selective order

87221
rewrite	rule
product 12 when a rewrite rule exists would be an issue as then you are linking to content in two different ways

87245
webforms	asp.net
in asp.net webforms how do you detect which textbox someone pressed enter

87276
derived-class	base-class
this means when you cast the derived-class as the base-class then the hidden methods becomes visible and is called instead of the same methods in the derived-class

87280
perl	c++
boost is to c++ as cpan is to perl

87288
versioning	upgrade
can be difficult to upgrade and to keep current versioning available

87293

i also took tweakt s advice and bought restful web-services - a very good book if you re building a restful api of any kind

87308
installation	environment
when working with multiple people we create a similar environment for each person and still can work with each of our individual projects at times we will have completely isolated dev environment with individual databases and code at other times i have worked with a shared dev database to resolve issues with dev module installation issues

87308
installation	building
with the wap model i use a methods to dynamically create my installation packages on project building using a post-building event and then i have a test installation that i use to validate that the packages occur

87334
textbox	button
are you looking to see which textbox was being focused so that you can trigger the proper button click event

87334
textbox	button
textbox button combination on a single form and still allow the user to type their query parameter hit enter and have the proper search method get invoked in the code behind

87339
debian	linux
to find some best practices look how linux distro s debian write their init-scripts usually found in etc init.d

87343
increment	reset
you could keep a counter increment it after each frame is rendering then reset the counter when you are on a new second storing the previous value as the last second s # of frame rendering

87348
base-class	inherited
i did it in a base-class that all my pages or a base-class for the masterpage inherited from

87360
protected	public
but otherwise protected should be avoided as much as possible use private by default and public when you must expose the methods

87364
any	set
if any have the status user set right-click on the preference and choose reset

87372
boost-serialization	boost
to be non intrusive you must override the global serialization function that is in boost-serialization namespace so you have in your client code to open namespace boost and namespace serialization

87392
thickbox	jquery
the thickbox plugin for jquery will do what you want

87403
gethashcode	equals
just use resharper to create you equals gethashcode methods

87410
put	get
if you put your regex in parentheses you can get the length and thus the end using

87428
lightbox	jquery
and then the lightbox plugin for jquery

87430
account	api
they login to your account and scrape the contents or use a public api

87435
account	api
i assume they log into your email account either by pop3 a public api or they know the html formatting of webmail systems and read the dom

87438
cygwin	gnu
all the gnu tools amd unix stuff works great on windows if you install cygwin

87454
ip-address	proxy
there s a header that can include information about a proxy-server the user is using and that can also include the user s ip-address in which case the other ip is the one of the proxy

87457
implements	extends
the classic example is the activerecord class from ruby-on-rails if you try to implements something similar in php which would look like this class user extends activerecord and then try to call user find 1 the methods that gets called is actually activerecord find because you haven t overloaded find in user - but without late static binding the find methods in activerecord has no way of knowing which classed it got called from self within it will always point to activerecord and thus it can t fetch your user-object for you

87463
click	mouse
javascript can send information when the mouse stops over an ad without click it

87493
ip-address	hostname
using the ip-address one can resolve the hostname .net provider organization the ip belongs to and rough geographic location

87504
subroutine	scoping
these variables are all read-only and dynamically scoping to the current block. in other words if you want to use 1.. 9 you cannot use a subroutine to do the matching

87516
shell	bash
in a bash shell for example

87519
tostring	equals
similarly even objects with expensive equals methods have inexpensive tostring calls

87519
tostring	equals
for example the java.net.url class has an equalss methods which makes use of an internet connection to determine whether two urls are truly equals but it still has a simple and constant-time tostring methods

87523
frame-rate	fps
but as you point out there s a lot of variation in the time it takes to rendering a single frame and from a user-interface perspective updating the fps value at the frame-rate is not usable at all unless the number is very stable

87523
formatting	printing
though with a moving average if you have consistent formatting printing the instantaneous average fps on each frame would probably be ok

87526
export	report
the reason why i used crystal report is because i had to print the report into lg matrix printer that is basically i had to export the report in text format

87531
create-table	insert-into
sqllite uses create-table insert-into table_name and mysql uses create-table insert-into table_name

87556
hotmail	gmail
maybe gmail hotmail and all others do have api s which users can use....need to look into it more i guess

87587
where-clause	sql
is now causing stack overflow errors when sorting a column with a large amount of data like the text column that contains a where-clause for a sql statment

87602
defined	declare
according to the c++ faq you should declare it normally inside the class definition and then defined it outside the class definition inside the header with the explicit inline keyword

87602
getter	setter
setter and getter are commonly inlined

87621
xsd	xml
it is important for me to have the xml in the structure xsd that i created

87624
ruby	php
the library is available for php .net java ruby coldfusion

87638
xsd	xml
linq to xml is very powerful if you re using .net 3.5 linq to xsd may be useful to you too

87649
perl	ruby
alternatively you can add it to the url and let the scripting language php perl asp python ruby whatever handle it on the other side

87666
directory	folder
i have recently run into an issue where i wanted to add a folder to the directory structure of my project that would become the new root directory for the previously housed files

87689
command-line	cmd
these applications are mainly command-line apps that open a dos cmd shell

87704
python	c++
the use of python as a scripting language we run c++ tests is worthwhile if you re trying to build a series of structured tests

87718
textbox	button
if you re talking about posting a code sample click on the 101010 button above the textbox

87726
libxml2	lxml
my preferred python xml library is lxml which wraps libxml2

87734
ellipse	angle
if there s a function in the mathematical sense that describes an ellipse at an arbitrary angle then i could use its derivative to find points where the slope is zero or undefined but i can t seem to find one

87752
environment	building
step 1 define a property in your nant scripting to tracking the environment you re building for local test production etc.

87752
configuration	environment
step 3 update your configuration target to pull in an appropriate properties file based on the environment property

87756
order	add
that .fla can be passed off to a designer who can add whatever they want as long as they keep the names and nesting order - essentially like skinning an app

87779
exception-handling	error-handling
with checked exception-handling your error-handling stategy is micro-managed and its unbearable on any large system

87788
debugging	trace
somebody will want to debugging the situation so they might want to see the stack trace

87796
order	join
sometimes there are mission critical operations that depend on similar resources in different order or complex join in different queries that step on each other

87802
passenger	webrick
running ruby-on-rails 2.1 either via mongrel webrick or passenger in development mode if i make changes to my views they don t update without me having to kick the server

87821
where-clause	sql
is it possible to use an if clause within a where-clause in ms sql

87837
contains	any
also try the usual stuff make sure you ve upgraded to the latest version check out any development versions that may contains bugfixes etc

87840
updating	updates
if you only want to updates the text simply set the changed subitem s text directly rather than updating the entire listviewitem you ve not said how you re doing your updatess

87842
multiplication	addition
probably the most important thing to remember when performing an extended precision multiplication is that you must also perform a multiple precision addition at the same time

87842
32-bit	64bit
the following listing demonstrates the proper way to multiply two 64bit values on a 32-bit processor

87849
svn	rcs
i am about to move to svn as my rcs of choice after many years using cvs and have a basic question.

87858
internet-explorer	doctype
without the proper doctype internet-explorer renders in quirks mode and so do other browsers to a lesser extent

87861
32-bit	64bit
split the 64bit quantities into two 32-bit words and multiply the low words to the lowest and 2nd lowest word of the result then both pairs of low and high word from different numbers they go to the 2nd and 3rd lowest word of the result and finally both high words into the 2 highest words of the result

87868
integer	digits
just do normal long multiplication as if you were multiplying a pair of 2-digits numbers except each digits is really a 32-bit integer

87892
ubuntu	linux
web site for linux kernel asynchronous i o support here says that sockets don t work but the aio.h manual pages on my ubuntu 8.04.1 workstation all seem to imply that it works for arbitrary file descriptors

87923
perl	ruby
i should probably make it clear that the slashes are the literal regex delimiter in ruby and perl and javascript etc

87933
function-call	inline
and don t forget to remove the inline keyword if you later implement the methods as an actual function-call this will really mess up linking in sunstudio 11 and 12 and borland c++ builder

87984
javascript	dom
you would have to access the javascript dom

87986
error-handling	try-catch
i would like to know how this can be achieved using the error-handling try-catch in sql-server 2005 when an error occurs in a stored procedure nested 2 or 3 levels deep

88018
constructor	object
and if you are initializing a collection object most have constructor that take similar components to addrange although again as you mentioned this may not be an option

88020
ellipse	angle
you could try using the parametrized equations for an ellipse rotated at an arbitrary angle

88020
ellipse	angle
...where ellipse has centre h k semimajor axis a and semiminor axis b and is rotated through angle phi

88047
joomla	drupal
drupal tends to be more developer-friendly than end-user friendly so if you re not a developer it is harder to grasp than something like joomla

88058
32-bit	64bit
even the ia64 cpus the intanium that was intended to replace x86 before amd invented x86-64 that was true 64bit and could only emulate 32-bit unlike x86-64 that can be both is one of the cpus that can be switched to big endian

88058
network-protocols	tcp-ip
almost all network-protocols i know specify byte order to be big endian tcp-ip being the most familiar family

88063
instance-variables	nsobject
if you ve already generated the code for the delegate class or added an nsobject to your nib and set its class to an existing class in your xcode project add an instance-variables to the delegate class

88075
python	lua
luajit is also around 10 times as fast as python and the lua interpreter is much much smaller 150kb or around 15k lines of c which you can actually read through and understand

88079
revision	svn
the solution for me is to svn update the directory even though there are no revision to download or update

88100
udp	tcp
for instance if a preference picks tcp versus udp have your conditional instantiate a tcpprovider or udpprovider which the rest of your code uses with minimal muss or fuss

88114
any	set
technically converting a result set to an xml file is straight forward and doesn t need any tool unless you have a requirement to convert the data structure to fit specific export schema

88114
contains	set
in general the result set gets the top-level element of an xml file then you produce a number of record elements contains attributes which effectively are the fields of a record

88157
value	field
in case a new value cannot be accepted you can cancel data update bringing back the previous value in the field

88166
silverlight	wpf
your desire to create a wpf mapping tool is similar to mine which lead me to ask this question about deepzoom aka multiscaleimage from silverlight

88177
required	checked
without knowing what your rules are it s hard to say for sure but assuming they are something like the password must be at least 8 characters with at least one uppercase letter one lower case letter one number and one special character then it s impossible even with brute force to check sufficient quantities of generated passwords to prove the algorithm is correct as that would required somewhere over 8 70 1.63x10 63 checked depending on how many special characters you designate for use which would take a very very long time to complete

88183
python	lua
the python c api manual is longer than the whole lua manual including the lua c api

88196
getter	setter
also it removes that nasty problem of having two getter and setter for the same actual data

88202
implements	abstract
this allowed us to abstract their database and they could implements logic in the stored-procedures

88215
reflection	runtime
xrtti is a tool and accompanying c++ library which extends the standard runtime type system of c++ to provide a much richer set of reflection information about classes and methods to manipulate these classes and their members

88259
postgresql	mysql
often needed mysql postgresql for example

88282
any	set
with any luck people will start to realize that your nightly build is a useful thing to have and you ll be able to just set up your daily build report as an email that goes out

88312
exception-handling	try-catch
there isn t much documentation currently available however the basic system is that gcc translates try-catch blocks to function calls and then links in a library with the needed runtime support documentation about the tree building code includes the statement throwing an exception-handling is not directly represented in gimple since it is implemented by calling a function

88317
version-control	git
if you re using git for version-control here s an autobuilder that automatically finds the exact checkin that started causing the tests to fail

88320
boolean	int
seleniumserver int port boolean slowresources boolean multiwindow

88327
contains	elements
the stored procedure catch in the outer most layer is transformed into an xml message to be transported to the jdbc call and the root elements by our convention must contains a feedback attributes

88346
subclassing	base-class
the base-class of all exception-handling-handling is called exception-handling and most of its subclassing are descriptive names of the type of error involved such as oserror valueerror nameerror typeerror

88349
ellipse	angle
btw - if you have problems finding the equation of your ellipse try to reduce it to the case that you have an axis aligned ellipse with a center two radii and a rotation angle around the center

88361
checkbox	textbox
i have an asp.net repeater which contains a textbox and a checkbox

88361
checkbox	textbox
i need to add client-side validation that verifies that when the checkbox is checked the textbox can only accept a value of zero or blank

88361
checkbox	textbox
this is an issue because the clientids of the checkbox and the textbox are unknown to me at runtime as they re part of a repeater

88361
checkbox	textbox
pass the textbox and checkbox to the customvalidator somehow doesn t seem to be possible

88368
theorem-proving	theory
i don t have any concrete references but you might want to look into the owicki-gries theory if you like theorem-proving or process theory algebra for which there are also various model-checking tools available

88382
python	c++
i have a pretty good knowledge of programming languages like c c++ java python

88399
emacs	vim
i saw this same question for vim and it has been something that i myself wanted to know how to do for emacs

88403
webforms	asp.net
this is an asp.net app developed in c# using webforms

88414
pygtk	gtk
for cross-platform solutions look into gtk perhaps pygtk

88437
sigaction	signals
setup a signals handler for sigsegv the segfault using sigaction to do this set the so_onstack flag

88497
click	mouse
by the way my brother used the low level api to move the mouse cursor and simulate click so i know what you re asking is probably possible

88514
.when	ready
in fact we do not release it but multiple release together .when something is ready

88523
instanceof	typeof
as others have said you can use typeof or instanceof to see if it s actually a function

88541
getter	setter
lets say i have a business object with getter setter for the properties on the object

88570
apache	vhosts
specifically i m trying to create a group-based http auth for individual directories vhosts on a server in apache 2.0

88571
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
i have been asked to lend a hand on a hobby project that a couple friends are working on they are using sharpdevelop 3.0 beta 2 i think but it might be beta 1 is there any hassle for me to install and use this ide given that i have visual-studio 2008 installed

88578
contains	set
set to a non-zero integer value to do multi-line matching within a string 0 or undefined to tell perl that it can assume that strings contains a single line for the purpose of optimizing pattern matches

88587
index-error	valueerror
except valueerror index-error

88597
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
i actually have vs2005 vs2008 sharpdevelop and visual-studio 6 installed at the moment and there s more compat problems with ms s tools than with #develop

88605
attributes	properties
the only thing i can think to suggest is to take a look at the properties and decorated attributes generated for those classes and associations

88616
motorola	sony
when working with motorola devices i tend to stick to the standard android-emulator or sometimes the sony ericsson android-android-emulator as those are the best i have worked with by far

88632
firefox	opera
for example even .net developers occasionally use firefox maybe even opera

88632
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome are possibilities too now

88632
internet-explorer	opera
it must run reasonably in internet-explorer 6 firefox 3.0 opera 9+ and safari for windows not everything has to be flawless but it can t look downright ugly either

88670
knapsack-problem	bin-packing
then you can move on to integer programming a very valuable tool that presents many natural techniques for modelling problems like bin-packing task scheduling the knapsack-problem and so on

88683
xsd	xml
i typically take the xml document that i m after push it through the xsd tool with the flag to generate a schema xsd and then push the xsd file back through the tool using the flags to get classes that i can import and use in my day to day .net projects

88695
xsd	xml
if you are working in the java world - intellij idea has also extensive xml support including xsd generation and samle xml from xsd generation and with plugins you can get xslt debuggers

88716
inode	mount
verify that every mount point has inode 2

88733
attributes	properties
one approach i ve used was to apply custom attributes to business object properties which described the validation rules

88736
perl	ruby
is there any centralized repository of useful objective-c cocoa libraries as there is for perl ruby python etc

88743
unit-testing	expectations
i m using jmockit for unit-testing with testng and i m having trouble using the expectations class to mock out a method that takes a primitive type boolean as a parameter using a matcher

88772
value	field
if you want to use a continuous form for navigation to records for editing use a subform display the detailed data for editing and use the pk value from the subform for the link field

88783
tokenize	parsing
tokenize or lexxing is the compilation step before parsing

88783
multiplication	addition
this example will correctly do multiplication before addition

88798
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it s going to blow webforms out of the water - we ve already seen how valuable a true asp.net-mvc framework can be in the java world

88802
constructor	object
most object are newed up with the default constructor and must have some properties set before they are ready to run

88810
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the purpose and the goal of both solutions are different and aps.net webforms is more like a platform while asp.net-mvc is architecture framework so the question is a bit odd

88810
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in my opinion asp.net-mvc in combination with good ajax support and correct server side model structure could be the more convenient way to develop sub-range of web application but webforms are not going away and they will have further improvements in next versions

88820
put	get
it does not get put at the end of the queue

88827
webforms	asp.net
great article by dino esposito that is meant to explain asp.net mvc to asp.net webforms developpers

88831
perl	php
anyone has ever programmed a php or perl function to get the ceiling value excel style

88836
tcpdf	fpdf
fpdf tcpdf and php s include pdf libraries allow me to create an image and plop it on a pdf but the more advanced layouts and crop marks are a bit beyond me

88841
constructor	object
object initializers does in no way replace constructor

88843
constructor	object
object initializers help to reduce coding complexity in that you don t need to create a half dozen different constructor in order to provide initial values for properties

88860
constructor	object
constructor should only really have arguments that are required to construct the object

88862
perl	php
i ve had a lot of success with pdflib it s a very powerful library with php and c c# perl etc bindings

88867
vbscript	perl
we already have a pro c program reading from an oracle it calls a perl script which in turn executes some java to extract data in xml format from the aforementioned database for calling a batch file to execute some vbscript ftping the file to some other server

88872
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc is great but won t become a real contender as a replacement for webforms until it includes it s own rich control set

88882
foundation	cocoa
but doesn t apple provide all the foundation cocoa appkit coreaudio qtkit etc libraries that should provide all of the very basic functions you are looking for

88895
openmesh	cgal
as far as i understand your question it seems to me that you do not clearly see the point of libraries like cgal and openmesh

88903
haskell	prolog
i d do it in either prolog java or haskell though

88904
gridex	janus
we re making heavy use of 3rd party controls janus gridex infralution virtualtree and .net magic docking and we do a lot of dynamic loading and rendering of content based on metadata in our database

88908
constructor	object
if you want to enforce the use of a constructor you could set your object s default parameterless constructor to private and leave public only some enforced constructors

88912
value	field
so again without totally understanding the setup you re working with you might also want to try to experiment with various z-index value for the autocomplete field and the surrounding block-level elements

88934
standard-library	boost
the boost version allows a runtime sized bitset compared with an standard-library compile-time sized bitset

88943
webforms	asp.net
well .net has never been able to fully counter the inertia of visual basic 6 i still see a few shops here and there who are just beginning to shift to .net so one has to consider the inertia of asp.net webforms and how it is deployed everywhere at the moment

88960
constructor	private
an aggregate is an arrays or a class with no user-declared constructor no private or protected non-static data members no base classes and no virtual functions

88985
put	get
on the other hand if you don t put any validation in your app you might not have any bad data but you may have users thinking they entered stuff that doesn t get saved

89008
contains	any
this will print any commits where the diff contains xyz

89059
temporary	rvalue
it is forbidden to bound a temporary object which is a rvalue to a non-const reference

89073
ubuntu	linux
it appears that it s in ubuntu linux in the cutils or cdecl package and it s probably available elsewhere

89076
methods	extend
you could also extend jquery with a methods similar to settimeout

89136
linux	osx
rand was different on osx than on linux

89153
windows-server	windows
windows sharepoint services is a free download for windows-server

89160
ip-address	hostname
the argument to helo should be a hostname or an ip-address

89160
ip-address	hostname
foo_bar.example.com is neither an ip-address nor a hostname underscores are illegal in hostname so the error message is correct and there is nothing to fix

89162
defined	declare
if the function is too big for you to suggest inline-ing do it the c way declare in header defined in cpp

89162
member-functions	inline
this has little to do with whether the code is really inline it allows the style of implementation in header as is common for short member-functions

89167
moss	wss
sharepoint is really two different technologies windows sharepoint services wss and microsoft office sharepoint server moss

89167
moss	wss
moss is probably less popular because its not free and having used it for a year i don t see as much value in it as wss

89182
expression	evaluation
most languages do short-circuit evaluation of boolean expression

89212
expression	evaluation
what does an architecture based on the evaluation of expression look like

89215
primitive	boolean
but jmockit s expectation is not using it for matching value it uses it for some kind of parsing to determine the methods call signature type..which in this case the matchers will resulted in boolean type while your methods is primitive type..so it fails to mock it properly

89219
contains	any
you above alluded to the existence of a workspace contains project a but xcode doesn t really have any such thing just a windows representing project a

89222
document	editing
it allows creation of document libraries which are collections of files that can be shared for collaborative editing

89228
command-prompt	cmd
how can i call an external cmd as if i d typed it at the unix shell or windows cmd-prompt from within a python script

89243
stderr	stdout
the advantage of subprocess vs system is that it is more flexible you can get the stdout stderr the real status code better error-handling etc...

89249
binary	hex
here is the table of all the values note that you can add up values to hide multiple drives also the value is binary type but must be entered in hexadecimal so if you add up a few drives get ready for a little hex math

89289
reliability	scalability
extreme scalability reliability concurrency

89313
short-circuiting	equivalent
short-circuiting boolean expression are exactly equivalent to some set of nested ifs so are as efficient as that would be

89313
branch-prediction	cpu-architecture
if b has side effects which the cpu-architecture can t cancel when branch-prediction fails then yes this might require delays which wouldn t be there if both sides were always evaluated

89363
pointers	stack
if you have the machinery for a precise copying gc you could allocate on stack initially and copy to the heap and update pointers if you discover at exit that a pointer to this stack frame has escaped

89386
pointers	stack
stack allocation and probably pointers

89405
value	field
i m guessing that the oracle driver is going to translate boolean value to a varchar field into true and false rather than 0 and 1 but you should verify this yourself

89418
directory	folder
assume i have an images folder directory under the root of my application

89424
alloca	malloc
or if the input vectors are small enough but not constant size just use alloca instead of malloc

89442
wait	hang
a and b do their processing and respond to c with either a ready or a fail reply note that there should be a timeout on c to avoid an infinite wait if one process hang or dies

89454
filtering	sorting
however if your queries are quite similar but you have huge numbers of permutations in your query conditions like complicated paging sorting filtering etc an object relational mapper tool is probably the way to go although the process of overhauling your existing code to make use of the tool could be quite complicated

89520
temporary	copy
the logo temporary is covering the main copy

89573
strict	let
that might help as it s actually using a variables that you ve declared and therefore can control the scope of plus it ll let you use strict without other nastiness that could be muddying the waters

89578
malloc	free
the second makes a number of functions more expensive but has a huge impact on malloc and free

89578
pointers	stack
i make a lot of use of builds that use have symbols zi and link debugging and asserts ddebugging but are still optimized o1 or o2 or whatever flags you use but with stack frame pointers kept for clear backtraces oy- and using the normal runtime library mt

89612
kubuntu	gnome
since you re using ubuntu and not kubuntu i assume you re using gnome

89619
pointers	stack
also even if you do supply -o 123 optimizations that prevent stack tracing will still be disabled stripping frame pointers from stack frames

89619
dwarf	elf
for more info take a look at dwarf the debugging format originally designed to go along with elf the binary format for linux and other os s

89638
internet-explorer	doctype
note that internet-explorer uses a broken box model unless you specify a doctype such as

89668
getter	setter
i write explicit tests for everything except simple getter and setter

89668
getter	setter
if the getter or setter only contains a return blah

89679
dwarf	elf
google dwarf a developer joke on elf

89696
oracle	mysql
using help - check for updates i was able to install the oracle mysql browser extension but there are no connection options for mysql databases

89713
contains	any
the handler for the event should be able to take care of putting focus back onto the appropriate control if needed and it could contains any code needed to notify the user of the error

89714
firefox	safari
grouping #1 is browsers that use webkit safari for example presto opera for example khtml konqueror for example or gecko firefox for example

89714
firefox	safari
ones that are definitely not dead are ie6 starting to push it ie7 ie8 latest opera 9.x latest firefox 3.x latest safari 3.x and others that have about the same capabilities

89714
firefox	opera
firefox 2.x isn t dead either and is needed for win9x users if they don t want to use opera

89716
pointers	stack
as others mentioned the cause is probably a corrupted stack or a messed up function pointers call

89744
associations	model
this happens very easily when manually adding associationss to the designer since the associations arrows in the l2s designer point backwards when compared to data model tools

89752
ms-access	recordset
how can i get hierarchy recordset in ms-access through select statement

89780
subshell	bash
i m using ksh-style subshell here i m not totally sure that it works in bash

89780
perl	awk
that s the nice thing about shell is that you can use perl awk sed grep..

89786
getter	setter
you might want to move the validation outside of the getter and setter

89788
linux	unix
as far as i know proc is specific to linux it s not in unix in general

89790
exception-handling	try-catch
the exception-handling being that the no throw specifier is useful but you should also add the appropriate try-catch block internally to make sure the code matches the specifier

89797
account	userid
this tells you the userid of the user under whose account the process is running

89833
getter	setter
i do except for getter and setter

89850
updating	updates
updates to your database may also be thought of as graph operations updating the quantity in an order line item row propagates the change to the the total in the order row which propagates the change to the totalsales in the customer row and so on

89889
similarity	distance
as described in the referenced wikipedia article the needleman-wunsch algorithm requires a similarity matrix which defines the distance between a pair of points

89910
getter	setter
i do agree about not testing getter and setter

89971
contains	set
have a look at this example which removes from the original string all the characters that are allowed leaving us with a set contains either a nothing or b the offending characters from the string

89994
external	embed
if i embed microsoft.vc90.crt.manifest into msvcr90.dll or the dll loading it and remove the external manifest file loadlibrary fails
