60000
derived-class	base-class
y therefore has a base-class x and a derived-class z

60012
value	field
are you trying to assign the value of an identity field to a variables or something else before you have saved the record

60012
value	field
for whatever reason your app is trying to read the value of the identity field before the record has been saved which is what generates that identity field

60012
value	field
in other words no value exists for the autonumber field until the row is saved

60027
iteration	set
also iteration over a set isn t random

60051
constructor	object
another method i ve seen used is to simply pass a reference to this into the class object you are creating and just catch it with a constructor argument

60062
arrays	loops
loops if you want to loops through an arrays

60075
shell	bash
not sure if they keep track of the tree of process spawning i think it depends on what os you use but since when you kill bash or any shell all running children are also killed i think unix like systems do keep track of this

60078
linux	unix
if you re using linux or anything which implements the unix apis when a process calls fork to create a child process the parent receives the child pid as the return code or -1 if the fork failed

60084
command-line	cmd
download cygwin free and use unix-like cmd at the windows command-line

60085
decimal-point	digits
so basically you want to determine the number of digits after the decimal-point for each number

60094
any	set
i usually break down any project like this into a set of smaller projects like

60105
subclassing	base-class
in all seriousness the best way to avoid repetition is the things covered in your list as well as fully utilizing polymorphism examine your class and discover what would best be done in a base-class and how different components of it can be broken away a subclassing

60137
ubuntu	debian
i haven t decided which one yet but my understanding is that they ll give me a base os install i d prefer debian or ubuntu an ip address a root account ssh and that s about it

60138
32-bit	64bit
the rough estimate version of this issue that i learned is that 32-bit floats give you 5 digits of precision and 64bit floats give you 15 digits of precision

60141
value	field
the trick is that on the client side this custom field shows up as a property of the document the value of which you can easily embed into the document s contents

60155
ubuntu	debian
slicehost referral link if you so choose offers reverse dns multiple ips 2 month ip ubuntu debian along with others

60158
any	set
if you have access to some profiling tools such as those in the team suite edition of visual-studio you can try to set up a testing server and running some synthetic requests against it and see if there s any specific part of the code taking unreasonably long to run

60199
worksheet	excel
the application we are building uses excel as a report writer so we which to add some custom controls to the worksheet to provide a richer experience

60203
memcached	apc
i also use apc and memcached for different things but the other answers i ve seen so far are more for more complete and complex systems

60217
.when	ready
.when your site is ready simply delete the existing files in the folder and replace them with those you want to test.

60227
fflush	gets
also the fflush is necessary because by default sys.stdout only fflushes its output after a newline or after its buffering gets full

60233
contains	set
obviously this would create a new list which contains each member of the set so not great if your set is very large

60242
any	set
project gazelle an open source torrent site provides a step by step guide on setting up memcached on the site which you can easily use on any other website you might want to set up which will handle a lot of traffic

60252
python	ruby
that is to say i use internal iterators map filter and reduce in python speak there are corresponding things in ruby lisp and haskell whenever i can this makes code a lot shorter and more self-contained

60271
firefox	safari
i ve written a couple xul extensions for firefox and now i d like to write versions of them for safari

60283
linux	bsd
on a linux or bsd system this should be vi by default although any editor should work

60285
configuration	installation
essentially i want postgresql without all the configuration and installation

60286
command-line	cmd
there is also a -m msg switch on this cmd that allows you to add the commit message on the cmd-line

60293
gridview	listview
i can load it with listview items fine but when i set the background color it doesn t draw the color all the way to the left side of the row the listviewitems are loaded with listviewsubitems to make a gridview only the first column shows the error

60302
system.out	system.in
however i can t find a way to seamlessly connect those streams to system.in system.out and system.err

60313
tar	cat
you will then have access to cat grep find gzip tar less and hundreds of others

60316
background-position	background-image
you don t use an img tag but an element with a background-image css attributes and set the background-position on hover

60334
word-cloud	tag-cloud
a tag-cloud or word-cloud or weighted list in visual design is a visual depiction of user-generated tags or simply the word content of a site used typically to describe the content of web sites

60353
authentication	impersonation
this is probably a combination of impersonation and a mismatch of different authentication methods occurring

60353
administration	account
again by default only the aspnet account and members of the administration grouping can write to that folder

60374
rollback	commit
whenever a the original caller to the datastore from step 1 is finished it commit rollback the transaction which affects all the database actions which happened during its call using a try catch finally

60375
windows-server	windows
you can save money by picking linux here but i d go for a windows-server if your target platform is windows

60377
xsd	xml
if you have a xsd for your xml then you can import that into your database and you can then build indexes for your xml data

60381
forwarding	port
then setup port forwarding and something like or to make it publicly accessible

60381
webserver	upload
i ve never used cruisecontrol before but i imagine there will be a way to take the build results and upload them to a public webserver as a dumb html file

60381
webserver	upload
basically my suggestion is run the continuous integration server on a spare machine have it upload the results to a public webserver somehow

60382
globalization	localization
globalization and localization demystified in asp.net 2.0

60382

csv	xml
exports metrics to xml or csv

60404
logout	login
stuff like login logout database access web-services javascript libs etc

60404
python	ruby
i use python but i think ruby should do the trick

60427
contains	any
i like to pass the parent as an interface so the class can be contains in any parent implementing that interface or implement the reference as an event function pointer delegate which the parent can hook onto

60443
consistency	acid
use the properties defined by acid atomicity consistency isolation and durability to help decide when this might be the case

60443
rollback	commit
depending upon the size of the unit of work a commit or rollback of a transaction can be resource expensive perhaps negatively impacting the performance of your system unnecessarily or at least with limited benefit

60460
compact-framework	.net
if the ironpython and .net compact-framework teams work together visual studio may one day support python for windows mobile development out-of-the-box

60482
directory	folder
when you start emacs using an ms windows shortcut the default-directory is initially the folder directory specified in the start in field of the shortcut properties

60487
wordpress	mediawiki
have used this for over a year on wordpress ip.board and mediawiki sites and have absolutely zero spam

60490
textarea	pre
try to add the following style on textarea style white-space pre

60496
postgresql	mysql
if you re connecting to a database other than mysql there is a driver-specific second option that you can refer to pg_prepare and pg_execute for postgresql

60496
execute	prepare
then when you call execute the prepare statement is combined with the parameter value you specify

60496
execute	prepare
another benefit with using prepare statements is that if you execute the same statement many times in the same session it will only be parsing and compiled once giving you some speed gains

60504
implements	super
it seems like most of your objectives would be meet by some sort of super source control system which could be implements with cruisecontrol

60526
data-access	ado.net
use the data-access api ado.net to control transactions

60581
attributes	properties
you can exclude fields properties from xml-serialization by decorating them with the attributes

60609
internet-explorer	safari
ideally i would like to automate safari in a similar way to using mshtml for internet-explorer

60609
google-chrome	safari
whilst i ve not yet found a way to automate safari i have found a way to automate webkit inside of google-chrome

60614
internet-explorer	firefox
since it was for an intranet scenario we were able to use browser addons like fireshot for firefox and ie screenshot for internet-explorer

60628
expression-blend	silverlight
this is a preview version of expression-blend for designing silverlight 2 experiences

60649
perl	ruby
simple to implement in c++ as well as the most common scripting languages perl ruby python etc

60662
perl	ruby
it combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between c++ java python php ruby erlang perl haskell c# cocoa smalltalk and ocaml

60672
httpmodule	isapi
i want to implements an isapi filtering like feature using httpmodule in iis7 running under iis integrated request processing pipeline mode

60676
any	set
from the internet the controllerâ s purpose is to respond to the action requested by the user take any parameters the user has set process the data interact with the model and then pass the requested data in final form off to the view.

60677
constructor	object
for added fun consider what happens if you have a static c++ object with constructor destructor declared in a shared data segment

60678
procedure	records
if cross database queries linked servers are an option you could do this with a stored procedure that copies the records from parent child in db a into temporary tables on db b and then add a column for the new primary key in the temp child table that you would updates after inserting the headers

60728
httpcontext	httpmodule
i would suggest storing your custom data in httpcontext or global application object or your database from your httpmodule and then reading that shared value in the aspx page

60794
selected	button
what happens instead now is that the li you clicked the button of gets to be the selected word and the suggestions disappear

60815
postgresql	mysql
i know that postgresql and mysql have the ability to order by a random function so you can use this in sqlalchemy

60821
required	checked
teams that i have worked on before required code reviews before checked in

60836
inlining	inline
excessive inlining of functions can increase size of compiled executable which can have negative impact on cache performance but nowadays compiler decide about function inlining on their own depending on many criterias and ignore inline keyword

60838
windows-xp	windows
kermit 95 internet and serial communications for microsoft windowsâ 95 windows 98 windows me windows nt 4.0 and later windows 2000 windows-xp and ibm os 2 from the kermit project at columbia university offers you text-based terminal connections to unix vms and many other kinds of hosts allowing you to interact directly with their shells and applications to transfer files and if desired to automate interactions and file transfers with its built-in platform- and transport-independent scripting language

60862
order	add
there is a proposal pep 372 to add an ordered dictionary that keeps track of the order of insertion to the collections module in the standard-library

60864
hash	md5
it is important to use a well known hash function such as md5 or sha-1 implemented in a library

60893
linqdatasource	formview
in my application i have textbox in a formview bound to a linqdatasource like so

60906
32-bit	x86
there are also x64 to x86 compatibility libraries available that should make 32-bit programs work for most situations

60910
aquamacs	emacs
however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change

60914
windows-vista	windows
if you have windowss-vista or later right-click on the directory icon in explorer while holding the shift key and then click on the open command windows here context menu option

60922
traffic	packets
when you try to send packets to any address in your private network 192.168.50.0 - 192.168.50.255 your ip stack will look in the router table and see a directly connect network and forwarding traffic via the private nic

60940
hide	show
show hide â font panels

60945
python	c++
your app will use lots of memory python is a memory hog relative to c++

60950
button	popup
you have to turn on mark mode and it s only available from a multi-level popup triggered by the small left hand corner button

60954
command-prompt	command-line
take command is a comprehensive interactive gui and command-line environment that makes using the windows command-prompt and creating batch files easy and far more powerful

60955
shell	bash
- is a process substitution that is a nonstandard shell feature of some posix-compatible shells bash ksh zsh

60958
bazaar	git
git mercurial of bazaar are examples of source code control tools that are not intrusive because you do not need to set up a master server

60978
telnet	ssh
i m using terminals for remote connection via telnet rdc ssh ..

60983
gridview	listview
it also adds great flexibility and functionality to the detailsview formview gridview and listview controls in the form of smart validation and the ability to easily change the display of these controls using templates

60984
perl	awk
i don t use windows - but surely there is something like awk or grep that you can use to find the future timestamped files and then touch them so they have the right time - even a perl script

61017
always-on-top	transparency
create a transparency windows the size of the whole screen mark it always-on-top calculate the regions of your other application windowss and make the non-windows regions of the top windows grey

61025
.net	wcf
there was some ability to enable this in the .net 3.0 release of wcf but with the release of .net 3.5 it was more mature

61029
contains	elements
to centrally align elementss you need to add text-align center to the contains block level elements in this case #selection

61029
order	add
in order for the #make and #model divs to sit side by side with out the use of floats they must be displayed as inline elements so add display inline to both #make and #model note that this will lose the vertical margin on those elements so you might need to make some other changes to get the exact layout you want

61029
hide	show
as selected elements are display inline by default an alternative to the last step is to remove the #make and #model divs and and apply the show and hide classes to the model selected element directly

61044
linux	bsd
however let me be more specific assuming that you re running on a unix-based system such as linux or bsd or mac osx

61050
triggers	insert
triggers are the best tool for annotating data when a table is changed by insert update or delete

61060
deployment	install
we ve found that it accurately reflects the concepts we need separation of deployment code from test code code from data install from code

61061
persistent	transient
in effect you want a transient heap and a persistent heap or heaps that grouping things of similar lifetimes

61080
contains	any
a good place to start is any field that is contains in a where-clause probably should have a index on it

61089
difference	count
a further and perhaps subtle difference is that in some database implementations the count is computed by looking at the indexes on the table in question rather than the actual data rows

61113
python	ruby
or if you want to branch out any of python c# java ruby would be excellent choices

61114
python	ruby
python and ruby seem to have the most traction in the linux unix etc space

61117
python	ruby
having said that python or ruby may be a better compromise between expressiveness and popularity

61124
powerpc	arm
the embedded device will use a mips powerpc or arm cpu but won t have enough cpu power memory or storage to compile its own kernel in a reasonable amount of time

61138
python	ruby
java c# ruby python and javascript are probably the big choices before you

61138
python	ruby
python and ruby take a step away from static typing into a world where you can call and method on any object and fail at runtime if it s not there

61138
python	ruby
performance is the main downfall with python being somewhat faster than ruby as i understand it

61138
python	ruby
to choose between them you d probably choose ruby if you re interesting in web development for the ruby on rails framework community and otherwise go with python

61138
python	ruby
smalltalk - more or less in the ruby and python camp and significantly faster as i understand it

61158
default-value	arguments
this is often useful in functions when you want to give a default-value to an arguments in case isn t supplied

61160
debugging	trace
i would say mimic the diagnostics that .net itself uses trace and debugging

61177
abstract-factory	singleton
some mix of a singleton and an abstract-factory would probably be able to get you the same functionality as today and with good testability but that would add quite a lot of boiler-plate code so it might be better to just try to refactor the static stuff away completely or if you could at least get away with some less complex solution

61192
python	c++
i recommend python as it s not only a sexy language but also very widely used and easy to integrate with c++ through boost.python

61196
methods	extend
you can also extend inherit classes and override properties methods using the prototype chain spoon16 alluded to

61211
webforms	asp.net
an example on the ui side would be asp.net mvc vs webforms vs monorail

61218
bazaar	git
if you want to be super-modern consider a distributed versioning system such as git bazaar or mercurial

61218
bugzilla	mantis
trac mantis and bugzilla are widespread open-source choices

61220
constructor	object
but the dotnet constructor doesn t seem to allow passing parameters to the object constructor and my experiment to get the assembly and with it createinstance from gettype has failed with an unknown zval error

61237
protected	public
i use explicit checks that throw exception-handling on public and protected methods and assertions on private methods

61248
silverlight	wpf
as a side bonus silverlight is based on wpf and starting with either lets you gain the know how for working with the other

61258
linux	bsd
the closest to cross-platform i ve seen is fam which seems to work for linux bsd and irix but i m not how easy it would be to port it to windows and macos

61277
windbg	mdbg
like mdbg or even windbg

61303
profiling	debugging
don t forget to add a check to skip profiling if you are in debugging mode

61317
silverlight	wpf
it seems that silverlight wpf are the long term future for user interface development with .net

61317
silverlight	wpf
but looking at wpf xaml silverlight they seem very large technologies and so where is the best place to get start

61325
forwarding	port
on the router set up port forwarding for each of the computers with vnc for example

61325
hostname	router
lastly i set the router to use a dynamic hostname provider such as dyndns.org so i can always connect using office.dyndns.org 1600n directly to the pc using vnc

61334
cryptography	security
this release of enterprise library includes application blocks for caching cryptography data access exception handling logging policy injection security and validation

61336
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is a stripped down version of wpf so it should have fewer things to learn inside

61336
silverlight	wpf
still silverlight is pretty much a moving target much more than wpf so you ll have to keep up with some changes from time to time the joys of being an early adopter

61380
silverlight	wpf
i have programmed with wpf and silverlight before

61380
silverlight	wpf
but as silverlight is a subset of wpf if you go in too deep and try to switch to writing silverlight applications you ll be scratching your heads looking for that tag you learned to love in wpf but is not available in silverlight

61380
silverlight	wpf
when you master the basic things in silverlight first the extra mechanism trigger whatever features in wpf will simply add to most of what you ve already known

61380
silverlight	wpf
silverlight in wpf differs at the features level not just some missing controls or animations

61380
silverlight	wpf
take the wpf triggers mechanism for example is not available fully in silverlight

61383
python	php
coming from a symfony php and django python background they both have excellent admin generators

61386
expression-blend	wpf
do you expect your wpf developers to know expression-blend

61412
code-coverage	ncover
consider using a code-coverage tool such as ncover to help discover edge cases you have yet to test

61418
return-value	undefined
dcc warning filename.pas 6939 w1035 return-value of function function might be undefined

61438
contains	elements
normal flow is how elements and their children will layout top to bottom for block elements and left to right for inline elements inside their contains block usually the parent

61438
spacing	layout
you will tend to rely on width margin and padding to define the spacing and layout of the elements to the other elements around it be they or otherwise html is mostly semantic at this point

61446
perl	ruby
dynamically evaluated expressions embedded code written in a concise programming language perl python ruby are preferred

61447
textmate	emacs
textmate s snippets are the most closest match but it is not a cross-platform solution and not for emacs

61448
addition	formula
in addition to tools- auditing- trace precedents you can use ctl+ grave accent to toggle formula display

61451
ruby-on-rails	django
does django have anything similar to ruby-on-rails link_to helper

61494
getter	setter
just go private int _age and normal getter setter as you normally would

61503
any	set
the aim of the new automatic properties is to reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write when you just have a simple property that doesn t need any special logic in the get or the set

61522
methods	extend
so can extend this to only return data attributes and not methods by defining your props function like this

61538
specifications	w3c
this link will allow you to validate the link against the rss atom-editor specifications using the w3c specifications but does require you to manually enter the url

61612
integer	numeric
for example ada has a native data type that is a restricted integer where you define an integer variables and explicitly indicate that it will only and always be within a certain numeric range

61664
lexer	lex
also of interest is that he used a continuation passing style lexer parsing instead of the more typical lex or regex based lexers that you ll see in the wild

61692
shutdown	exit
i ve also tried using the exit handler on my main application user-interface windows but it has no way to pause or halt shutdown as far as i can tell

61699
installation	uninstall
until recently we were using inno setup for our installation something i would like to continue doing unless we can get an uninstall option in the start menu thanks giovanni galbo however we now need to gac some external libraries something i suspect is only doable or at least only supported though the .net setup project

61713
perl	ruby
when you start trying to do things that become difficult in shell-script i would strongly suggest looking into rewriting the script in a proper scripting language python perl ruby etc

61719
updating	updates
if you are updating an object that is contains in the list but you don t have the index you will have to call refreshitems and updates all of the items

61734
python	ruby
ruby will expose you to more concepts than python does due to it being more liberal in how it handles things like lambda functions code blocks eval and so on

61746
environment	building
it also is great for comparing test output between building but the distributed master slave stuff is comparatively more complicated because you need a java environment on the slaves too

61750
oracle	mysql
method should work for mainstream engines - mssql2000+ oracle mysql etc

61779
microsoft-dynamics	navision
navision is also known as microsoft-dynamics nav

61795
websphere	ibm
i m looking for a java profiling that works well with the jvm coming with websphere 6.0.2 ibm jvm 1.4.2

61795
yourkit	jvm
i use yourkit for my usual profiling needs but it specifically refuses to work with this old jvm i m sure the authors had their reasons...

61804
postgresql	mysql
i haven t tried it myself but i ve been interested in playing with postgresql as an alternative to mysql

61868
getter	setter
don t go about testing getter and setter

61870
order	add
i d like to add the order total as a property of my order class

61873
file-descriptor	dev-null
here the redirection 2 1 which sets file-descriptor 2 stderr to point to the same stream as file-descriptor 1 stdout gets evaluated before the redirection dev-null which sets file-descriptor 1 to point to dev-null

61873
stderr	stdout
the effect is that what you write to stderr gets sent to stdout and what you write to stdout gets thrown away

61881
scriptaculous	jquery
all of this means that you could use yui jquery prototype scriptaculous in your application but you may find that using a single library makes it a lot easier to maintain things

61891
put	get
the thing that would put me off that idea is that for general use any binary data would get copied over anytime it changed whereas the text content scm systems are based around can easily be updated in the form of diffs

61906
javassist	cglib
the bar member of foo is a proxy object in our case javassist proxy but it can be cglib one depending on the bytecode provider you use that is not initializer

61924
any	set
you can set a simple rule described in your header file that any variables to be accessed external to the class must be accessed via the property or by using custom methods on the class to affect values

61939
order	add
that besides having to add a different column per each possible order and many other flaws

61971
switching	screens
for example only switching bluetooth on when you need it similarly the phone capabilities turn the screens brightness down when it isn t needed turn the volume down etc

61994
python	java
then you should really consider using some type of fixed point arbitrary-precision number package java bignum python decimal module otherwise you ll be in for a world of hurt

62017
asterisk	pbx
i m interested in learning more about asterisk open source pbx so i thought i would try building a hobby system for my home

62037
shell	bash
note you have to compile from a cygwin bash shell to use vcvars32 first run a dos shell then run vcvars32.bat then run cygwin.bat from the directory where you installed cygwin

62045
getter	setter
use getter setter all the time if you started using them from the getgo and or are used to working with them

62045
getter	setter
as an aside i personally find that using getter setter makes the code easier to read and to debugging later on

62062
transcoding	flv
currently the videos are in the flv containers format but transcoding is an option

62069
sql-server	mysql
i myself am a sql-server person so i know what i would be looking for from that point of view with regards to scalability design etc but is there anything specific i should be asking with regards to mysql

62077
csv	xml
we re looking for a transformation library or engine which can read any input edifact files csv xml stuff like that

62079
python	php
i am trying to get some accurate runtime comparisons of php vs python and potentially any other language that i have to include

62097
python	php
you should generally know why you re optimizing code as in a specific task in your existing codebase is taking too long not i heard php is slower than python

62099
python	java
i have done some tests in java and the first run is always slowest due to the jit doing its job and the same sort of hit may exist in php python and any other languages you try

62102
getter	setter
how much costlier are getter setter defined by methodmaker than the native ones overwrite in the module

62104
authentication	login
entering user data to login form catching events loggingin authentication loggedin so i m logged in i don t do anything in these events i don t authentication myself i m only interested in what is fired and in which order

62110
entity-framework	ado.net
does anyone know of any good tutorials on ado.net entity-framework

62165
document	element
if you re trying to change the root element of a document you don t really need to-- just throw out the existing document and replace it

subtract	time
utcnow only means subtract my timezone from the time

62173
compact-framework	.net
i am looking for a 3rd party solution to integrate a qr code reader in windows mobile applications .net compact-framework

62192
compact-framework	.net
did you try this one qrcode .net compact-framework package

62207
testdriven.net	ndepend
i m always amazed that more people don t know about use ndepend - it shows all dependencies at every level of your code and will even draw pretty box and arrow pictures showing how confused your architecture really is together with testdriven.net i can t imagine working without it any more

62220
postgresql	mysql
however the observation of database-locking stands - if you have particularly onerous updates sqlite performance won t match mysql or postgresql

62248
export	csv
i do this for csv export on one of my sites and as far as the user is concerned it just pops up a safe file windows

62264
version-control	git
but i would quite like to use git to do my version-control

62267
parentheses	macros
i do suspect however that to reach the level of lisp expertise to program such macros you will need to immerse yourself in the language to such an extent that you will no longer consider parentheses hell

62282
bug-tracking	mantis
we are now looking at bug-tracking systems again and are seriously considering migrating to mantis and using mantis connect to add additional custom features of our own

62310
font-size	height
if the line height was increased same effect though font-size with less words per line this becomes less of an issue

62336
vbscript	jscript
the short version is to place a vbscript stop statement or jscript debugger at the beginning of the procedure before any statements that you will want to step through

62363
font-size	width
so as the font-size is increased the width of the page increases

62374
bug-tracking	fogbugz
there are perfectly good bug-tracking systems available for example fogbugz

62377
linux	osx
there s a osx distribution of ies4 linux called ies4osx which has worked fine for me without any configuration

62396
perl	c++
to call perl from c++ you need to use the api as someone else mentioned

62396
perl	c++
note that if you want to embed perl in a c++ program you might have to recompile it anyway to have the same compilation flags on perl and on your program

62397
virtual-machine	virtualization
with a lot of manual tweaking you can already run windows on ec2 using virtualization inside a linux virtual-machine

62410
boolean	int
so you could have name string age int active boolean etc

62423
updating	updates
rather than rewriting the entire contents of an xml file when a single element is updates is there a better alternative to updating the file

62433
facebook-apps	facebook
as well i hear that facebook will no longer support their java api is this true and if yes does that mean that we should no longer use java to write facebook-apps

62469
textbox	button
just a textbox a search button and a i m feeling lucky button and the i m feeling lucky button can be done in phase 2

62477
aptana	pydev
according to brief googling no personal experience with this aptana now supports python development via pydev

62512
dynamic-memory-allocation	c++
i would like to find out safe ways of implementing three dimensional arrays of integers in c++ using pointer arithmetic dynamic-memory-allocation or alternatively using stl techniques such as vectors

62513
put	get
having created a typical api using specific calls for specific functions i am considering simplifying the api by using a rest type api get put post delete or crud type create read update delete interface

62542
bug-tracking	bugzilla
i m not talking about bug-tracking software like bugzilla or jira

62563
web-testing	selenium
i ve had lots of success doing web-testing with selenium

62586
access-control	authentication
do put stuff related to authentication access-control in the controller

62593
restart	reload
is it possible to reload a schema file without having to restart mysqld

62625
getter	setter
and do i even need to worry about testing the properties since they are .net s getter and setter

62637
selected	button
selected add as link in the button drop down list

62649
32-bit	16-bit
however we thankfully don t see much 16-bit any more and when 64-bit started to get popular people were more concerned with making it compatible with older software and 32-bit had been around so long that for most compilers an int is just assumed to be 32 bits

62656
contains	any
you could have a directory under tags contains the production versions as at any particular date

62659
boost	stl
using the stl or boost are quite good approaches if you don t know beforehand how many entries you will have in each dimension of the arrays because they will give you dynamic-memory-allocation and i recommend either of these approaches if your data set is to remain largely static or if it to mostly only receive new entries and not many deletions

62669
getter	setter
if you implements some specific functionality in the getter and setter i think they are worth testing

62669
value	field
if they only assign value to some private field don t bother

62671
getter	setter
as i understand unit tests in the context of agile development mike yes you need to test the getter and setter assuming they re publicly visible

62671
getter	setter
since the getter and setter are external visible you need to test them along with authentication and save

62672
getter	setter
it doesn t hurt to write unit tests for your getter and setter

62680
getattr	setattr
then your class is already a dictionaryionary and if you want you can override getattr and or setattr to call through and set the dictionary

62682
value	field
in your case i d focus on your authentication and save methods - and i d write tests that made sure they could handle null value in any or all of those field gracefully

62684
getter	setter
i would test your getter and setter

62693
32-bit	64bit
the c# ecma standard specifically says that int is 32-bit and long is 64bit

62696
getter	setter
this include getter and setter especially in case the members properties are complex classes which requires large memory allocation during their initialization

62700
getter	setter
of course if the getter and setter have no special logic then the tests of the authentication andsave methods should cover them but otherwise an explict test should be written

62715
getter	setter
testing boilerplate code is a waste of time but as slavo says if you add a side effect to your getter setter then you should write a test to accompany that functionality

62727
getter	setter
so if your setter and getter are just propertyvalue value and return propertyvalue it makes no sense to test it

62730
iteration	elements
as far as i can tell the code should work - the usual problem in such code is that removal of elements and ++ on iterator happen in the same iteration the way mikhaild points out

62732
logging	trace
you need to put your own trace logging in to create some chatter

62737
rabbitmq	activemq
beside activemq which should work for your demands you could also take a look at rabbitmq or openamq

62749
getter	setter
really trivial code like getter and setter that have no extra behaviour than setting a private field are overkill to test

62750
getter	setter
testing default getter and setter doesn t seem very useful to me unless you re planning to do some validation later on

62760
getter	setter
i believe it s silly to test getter setter when they only make a simple operation

62762
audio	id3
mp3wrap would be ideal for this - it s designed to join together mp3 files without needing to decode + re-encode the data which would result in a loss of audio quality and will also deal with the id3 tags intelligently

62770
scriptaculous	jquery
so far i see a very large difference the approach using something like ext and others like jquery ui scriptaculous mochikit etc

62771
file-rename	batch-file
i want to include a batch-file file-rename functionality in my application

62779
getter	setter
i hope this means we can move on from getter and setter

62785
library-project	libs
you could ether use a libs like open source audio libs-project and write a tool around it

62786
pointers	stack
on the cell spus there are no stack overflows so theres no need for recursion we can just wipe the stack pointers

62797
any	set
use almost any character in the current code page for a name including unicode characters and characters in the extended character set 128â 255 except for the following

62797
integer	zero
characters whose integer representations are in the range from zero through 31 are not allowed

62805
contains	set
upd2 note that according to the remarks section in msdn the arrays returned from this methods is not guaranteed to contains the complete set of characters that are invalid in file and directory names. the answer provided by sixlettervaliables goes into more details

62821
restlet	spring
for restful web services in java also check out the restlet api which provides a very powerful and flexible abstraction for rest web services both server and client in a container or standalone and also integrates nicely with spring and json

62823
web-applications	web-services
i think javascript implementations in most modern browsers have now reached a reasonable level of maturity and there are a bunch of javascript ui frameworks which let you build very attractive javascript based web-applications using web-services and such regardless of the back-end server platform

62832
perl	c++
the code needs to work on mac and pc and can be in any language though i am most familiar with c++ and perl

62841
windows	ms-dos
additionally windows forbids the use of the ms-dos device names aux clock com1 com2 com3 com4 com5 com6 com7 com8 com9 con lpt1 lpt2 lpt3 lpt4 lpt5 lpt6 lpt7 lpt8 lpt9 nul and prn as well as these names with any extension for example aux.txt except when using long unc paths ex

62847
firebird	mysql
it remains unparalleled in terms of ease of use and speed with regards to its internal data engine and is a great choice of front end for more modern and secure databases like sql server mysql firebird or whatever

62859
command-line	cmd
for example while a scheduled task or executed cmd from the continuous-integration server may be able to start robot as a cmd-line process robot will actually fail to execute the recorded script

62884
g++	gcc
ubuntu includes a package called build-essential which installs gcc g++ make etc

62895
web-deployment	web
an nant build file which calls msbuild to build the web-deployment project .wdproj zips up the resulting compiled web app along with the sql change script and then uploads the zip file to the server

62916
logout	login
login works perfectly but when i try to logout i get this error message from the rubycas-server

62932
dictionary	arrays
let us consider that we are serializing simple classes and may be arrays lists dictionary of simple classes.

62946
environment	building
second question any recommendation for tool that can be customizable i.e allowing suppress specific warnings and used in automatic building environment i.e command-line interface

62951

some of our developers have already upgrade to versioning 2.4.7 though and they get project creation errors when compiling

62972
daemons	systemd
systemd administration commands and daemons

62978
autoscroll	panels
then you need to set the panels to be autoscroll so that it has a vertical scrollbar because the list of labels goes past the bottom of the display panels

63039
setinterval	settimeout
try setinterval or settimeout

63044
getter	setter
i usually don t test setter getter but lets says you make one for user.name which concatenation first and last name i would write a test so if someone change the order for last and first name at least he would know he changed something that was tested

63063
show	next
an alert is a screen that show data to the user and wait for a certain period of time before proceeding to the next displayable

63067
web-services	security
the problem we are seeing is that it expects the requests to be formatted using web-services security so we are doing all the correct signing etc

63084
puts	gets
the multiple gets must be replaced by an equals number of puts before another thread will be allowed to get the mutex

63084
puts	gets
even if the thread gets the mutex and then calls a function that further modifies the object and gets puts the protector mutex around its own operations the operations should still be safe because they re all happening under a single thread

63088
pc-lint	misra
i d second greg s recommendation for pc-lint but the open-source splint is also worth looking at although between them and the compiler s warning system i estimate you ll still only be able to cover 80 of the misra rules - the rest will probably need to be code reviewed by hand

63125
contains	set
in the case of a normal round each scoresheet contains a non-ordered set of m couples m the number of couples entered into the round - exact value determined by the competition organiser

63126
hosts-file	hosts
i blocked reader.google.com by changing my etc hosts this is for a mac

63126
firefox	safari
firefox would work but i don t think i can uninstall safari from a mac

63128
32-bit	16-bit
long as you probably know in c# is 64-bits but in native c++ it ends up as 32-bit or char is unicode 16-bit while in c++ it is 8-bits

63130
selected	cell
i would like to add a datagridviewtextboxcell cell to a datagridviewcell control but as well as being able to type in the text cell as normal it must also contain a ... button that once clicks brings up the openfiledialog windows to allow the user to selected a file

63130
selected	cell
once selected the text cell will be populated with the full file path

63131
getter	setter
right now you have getter and setter but one day you might change them somewhat maybe to do validation or something else

63155
stream	send
when you send more data on that stream anyway the peer rejects it with an rst to let you know it isn t listening

63159
order	join
the latter helps join the former avoids another index or perhaps many should you want your order grouping by country too

63184
annotations	mapping
you can use annotations to define precisely the structure mapping of the xml and your objects

63185
revision	svn
note that this does not remove revision from revision history in svn repository

63187
any	set
if you are iterating through any kind of a result set and performing operations on said results for e.g within a for each and if one particular result caused a problem its rather useful in capturing an expected error via try-catch logging it and moving on to the next result via continue

63206
required	checked
if java application required certain jre versioning then how can i checked its availability on mac os x during installation

63213
getter	setter
as others have stated unit tests for getter and setter are overkill unless there s conditional logic in your getter and setter

63222
getter	setter
for simple modules that may end up in a toolkit or in an open source type of project you should test as much as possible including the trivial getter and setter

63222
getter	setter
adding getter and setter is minimal code and can be handled without much thought

63224
scheme	lisp
then find an interpreter in plain c for the iphone and one in java for android. scheme lisp and javascript could fit the bill

63228
textbox	button
you should be able to make a usercontrol that has a textbox and button on it and embed that in the datagridview

63248
svg	vml
raphael is a javascript framework for manipulating vector graphics either with svg or vml depending on what the browser supports

63363
exception-handling	error-handling
i have made extensive use of exception-handling lately which has greatly simplified my error-handling code

63376
constructor	private
in this way reintroduce is a little bit like declaring a parameterless constructor as private in c#

63387
dictionary	map
you could create a dictionary to map from textinput - node or you could stash the node in the textinput s data property

63397
bug-tracking	redmine
redmine integrates bug-tracking with source control and include wiki basic project-management etc

63399
passthru	exec
i don t have access to phpmyadmin and i preferably don t want to use exec system or passthru

63405
passthru	exec
1 can you run mysqldump from exec or passthru

63414
perl	ruby
it has apis for writing plugins in several langauges python ruby perl as well as its own extension language vimscript

63480
boolean	int
you only need to do the cast if you want the result as a boolean value if you are happy with an int this works

63511
cvs	git
version control - there are lots of emacs bindings for various vcs backends cvs sccs rcs svn git all come to mind

63512
graph-traversal	shortest-path
a lot of it tends to come down to whether or not the candidate knows the shortest-path and graph-traversal algorithms is familiar with cycle types and detection and whether they know the complexity bounds

63523
rescue	throw
if there were a chance of one the variables not being defined at all as opposed to not being an arrays you would want to add rescue nil to the end of the param ... line to keep the eval from throw an exception.

63527
contains	elements
this is prone to casting errors though if the arrays contains non-int elements

63560
vba	vb6
the c# way gives you the right information but the vb way is what users of vba or vb6 will expect

63563
windows-xp	windows
for encoding i am using the windows media video 9 screen codec because it is very efficient for screen captures and because it is available to practically everybody without the need to install anything as the codec is included with windows media player 9 runtime included in windows-xp sp1

63565
value	field
i would also recommend to search for field which all have the same value not just null

63599
lighttpd	apache
we support apache microsoft iis lighttpd and zeus using php 4.3 or later including php5

63628
attributes	properties
code than the original version you d have to use reflection to check for the attributes on the properties and what not

63663
text-editor	editor
the java-based editor jedit is a good example of text-editor architecture complete with plugins support a strong user community and good abstractions

63679
websphere	ibm
there are 2 jvms for winmo mysaifu for j2se and ibm websphere everyplace micro environment for j2me

63682
directory	folder
but subversion s multitude of .svn directory can get in the way for that not just when searching but in some cases like .d folder poorly designed systems might interpret the .svn folder themselves as containing configuration data

63694
double	int
the fraction can be represented by two int or two double or whatnot

63719
openbsd	freebsd
i am using the out of the box dhcp client on freebsd which is derived from openbsd s and based on the isc s dhclient and this is the out of the box behavior

virtual-machine	vmware
we recently migrated the back-end server in our largest office -- new york -- from a msc cluster to a new virtual-machine hosted on vmware s esx technology

63723
web-config	app-config
web-config or app-config i have a considerable source code base and i need to configure at the application scope how rounding will occur whether used in math.round or decimal type rounding.

63739
traffic	vlan
we have an existing load balanced systemd where we have the load balanced nic s going into a vlan to keep the traffic separate and we ve turned off the mac-address to ip mapping in order to reduce the problem

63767
spawn	exit
you ll probably want the new process to end via exit or the like immediately after spawn the scripting

63769
python	c++
i like scite as a basic editor for c++ python on linux

63784
python	lua
i heard that python and lua can be integrated into a c++ app but i do not know how to do this to achieve my goals

63787
joomla	drupal
i talked to a few friends that say drupal is amazing and that it is way better than joomla

63798
attributes	properties
for example you could set up one custom attributes for your properties or aspect how it is called in aop that injects code inside property setters that marks your objects as dirty

63812
alloca	malloc
it s also not portable it crashes on solaris but some alloca implementations might return an error here or call malloc

63813
silverlight	wpf
yeah as other mentioned here silverlight is a subset of wpf

63821
document	element
the b element represents a span of text to be stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance such as key words in a document abstract product names in a review or other spans of text whose typical typographic presentation is boldened

63834
push	pull
guide a friend by phone through installing mercurial tortoisehg creating a repository and setting it up for working together using seperate push his and pull mine repositories - after installing it only once on a windows machine i only run gnu linux

63865
c++	lua
it makes it very simple to integrate lua in your c++ code and vice versa

63865
c++	lua
it is also possible to expose whole c++ classes to be used in lua

63875
integrated-security	connection-string
connection-string integrated-security sspi

63877
ubuntu	debian
there s also the pv command - available in debian ubuntu repostitories which shows you the throughput of your pipes

63878
export	report
i have a report in reporting services and when i preview it the headers for a table wrap but when i export it to excel the don t

63879
groovy	java
you might look at the groovy syntax which is an extension of the java language to support closures right now

63901
author	posts
this second link contains links to other posts where the author show how to use other java classes natively to gain either functionality or speed over cf functions

63904
any	set
in any case just running the compiler will be non-trivial as your build-system probably sets a bunch of preprocessor defines and build variables that need to be set for the compile to succeed

63904
build-system	scons
if your colleague is working on unix he probably has a make scons or cmake-based build-system anyway

63904
scons	cmake
there are native versions of scons and cmake but those will try to use vs so that won t help you

63908
expression-blend	wpf
as a wpf developer i surely see the benifit of knowing expression-blend for many of my previous projects

63908
expression-blend	wpf
so i highly recommend expression-blend for a wpf programmer

63918
javascript	dom
i m a front-end developer and i was looking for opinions about the best all-round online documentation for javascript css html xhtml dom browser quirks and support

63932
python	lua
your best bet is to embed either lua www.lua.org or python www.python.org

63932
python	lua
interfacing to c++ objects will be a bit more work on your end but you can look up how to do this on google or on lua or python discussion forums

63944
administration	account
local system is not recommended it is an administration equivalent account and thus can lead to questionable coding that takes advantage of administration privileges which would not be allowed in a production system since security conscious admins dba s really don t like to run services as admin

63944
credentials	account
run as network service which is also a low privilege account but one that retains the computers network credentials

63944
credentials	account
a disadvantage to using another domain account is the overhead of managing those account especially since each service for each developer should ideally have unique credentials so you do not have any leaks if a developer were to leave

63964
hash	md5
even with really really big spaces like md5 128 bits there are still two strings that can generate the same resulting hash

63972
delphi	vb6
can delphi call win32 dlls and or functions directly like vb6 can

63984
hash	md5
the system.security.cryptography namespace contains multiple classes which can do hashing for you such as md5 which will probably hash them better than you could yourself and will take much less effort

63996
itemscontrol	grid
i would go with chart as an itemscontrol and its itemspanel be a canvas for some light use i would go with grid as itemspanel

64000
stderr	stdout
when launching a process from java both stderr and stdout can block on output if i don t read from the pipe

64043
value	field
then set the default-value to from query and set the dataset and value field to the appropriate value

64081
authentication	login
if you ve got this directive set the browser will dutifully head back to the server looking for a brand new copy of the page which will cause your server to see that the user is not authentication and bump him to the login page

64082
deep-copy	object
otherwise doing a deep-copy is impossible to do safely because the object may also be sharing non-data resources database connections

64083
value	field
you can place the databound field within the body of the report as a hidden textbox and then in the header place another textbox with it s value pointed at the the one hidden within the body

64085
getter	setter
the global class simply consists of static getter and setter like so

64098
pseudo-class	anchor
ie has problems with the hover pseudo-class on anything other than anchor elements so you need to change the element the hover is affecting to the anchor itself

64103
moss	wss
i ve only worked with moss 2007 and sharepoint-designer though - i m not sure about wss

64110
return-value	arguments
in c++ for example methods arguments can be passed by reference so you can assign output values to them in addition to the formal return-value

64110
python	java
in python arguments are passed by reference but in the sense of java not c++

64120
solaris	linux
we are using netbeans as ide win mac linux solaris if you are used to eclipse or visual-studio there is a good chance you will like it

64133
value	field
it will reset any identity field back to the seed value as well

64142
subtract	add
edit fixed definitions of add and subtract for

64142
implements	abstract
another interesting and simple thing to do is implements a mathprovider that operates on an abstract syntax tree

64145
stderr	stdout
just have two threads one reading from stdout one from stderr

64151
order	add
it would add one more layer but might solve your problem if no one finds the reverse layout order switch soon enough

64165
any	set
then we can run any consecutive set of scripting to skip from some existing version to the new version

64182
hide	show
have a different control for each data set and show hide the controls

64183
stderr	stdout
set the redirecterrorstream property on processbuilder to send stderr output to stdout

64186
perl	php
you will find that as you read code written by others it is easier to grok than code in say perl or php

64191
show	next
next show the page header by right click in the report area with the designer

64191
selected	textbox
in the visibility for each textbox selected true for hidden

64192
value	field
there are apis available for getting documents email reading field value from subject and detaching files

64195
default	reset
is what you want basically a class that can reset an instance object to a set of default value

64195
default	reset
how about just providing a reset methods that resets the properties of your object to whatever is the default

64214
hide	show
now the form show to the user in the case of basic operations is simplified to hide away the entries details the account are selected among 5 default by the kind of operation requested by the user intialise account - equity to account spend assets- expenses earn revenues- assets borrow liabilities- assets pay debt assets- liabilities ... i want the entries created from default value

64218
versioning	upgrade
then upgrade to the newest production versioning of ruby-on-rails and view the latest ruby-on-railscasts.com videos

64262
contains	set
if you want to find out if two files contains the same set of lines but in a different order you can use a regular hash function on each line individually then combine them with a function where ordering doesn t matter like addition

64285
order	add
if you add up the ascii values of each character you d get the same result regardless of order

64304
sql-server	mysql
i have not had to move data from sql-server to mysql but i imagine that once the mysql connection is installed it works the same as moving data between two sql-server dbs which is pretty straight forward

64353
environment	building
then if the building fails for any reason including environment inconsistencies it s up to the developer who broke it to fix it

64360
kubuntu	kde
when i cut kill text in emacs 22.1.1 in its own windows on x in kde on kubuntu i can t paste yank it in any other application

64371
accessor	ivar
if you write your own accessor then you just use the underbar ivar in your implementation and keep the non-underbar methods name

64376
getter	setter
so from an api evolution point of view it s usually a good idea to bite the bullet and use getter setter

64378
python	java
bouml is a free uml 2 tool box under development allowing you to specify and generate code in c++ java idl php and python

64378
solaris	unix
bouml runs under unix linux solaris macos x power pc and intel and windows

64380
author	posts
the blog author did an inconsistent job of adding categories to posts so while some of them had legitimate categories in their urls at least half are uncategorised

64412
emacs	kate
from the reference to kate i take it you re on linux or similar and probably using emacs in x one way or another.

64415
linux	unix
is it on linux unix macosx windows ms-dos

64422
processor	cpu
next you need to know that the fourth number in these lines is a measure of idle time and thus the fourth number on the cpu line is the total idle time for all processor since boot time

64422
processor	cpu
edit remember that when you calculate your process s cpu utilization you have to take into account 1 the number of threads in your process and 2 the number of processor in the system

64434
virtual-machine	parallels
i d like to convert a parallels virtual-machine image on my mac into an image usable by virtual pc 2007

64435
increment	reset
note that truncate will also reset any auto increment keys if you are using those

64446
hash	md5
if you get a positive you could compare the actual data to make sure it s not a false positive - though this would be extremely rare you could go with a quicker hash algorithm like md5 or crc instead of something like sha which is slower but less likely to collide just so it s quick and then compare the actual data when you get a hit

64469
vb.net	vb6
i have a vb6 program that someone recently helped me convert to vb.net

64475
python	perl
perl and python both use separate language constructs for lists and maps resulting in more copying and potentially confusing transformations

64494
optional-arguments	arguments
i d say go with optional-argumentss that have sensible defaults unless the arguments list is going to get stupid then create separate functions to call for your cases

64523
jmonkeyengine	lwjgl
there is also at a lower level the lwjgl library which jmonkeyengine is built on which is a set of apis to wrap opengl as well as provide other game specific libs.

64529
versioning	upgrade
everyone should upgrade to the same versioning of nunit

64535
.net	wcf
the best two technologies available for you for the .net client are microsoft web service enhancements wse and windows communication foundation wcf

64543
contains	any
if your switch statement contains any code to actually handle the messages than you would be better off breaking them out

64552
application-pool	iis-manager
instruction for creating an application-pool can be found under help in iis-manager

64573
32-bit	x86
in assembly x86 processors 16 or 32-bit mode

64575
postback	ajax
essentially javascript controls certain timed events that have to be accurate down to at least the second that make it difficult to control with ajax postback etc

64596
rendering	redraw
minimizing and then restoring the windows initiates a redraw event in the browser s rendering engine

64596
subtract	add
subtract the height of the old content node from the current scroll position reseting the browser s scroll to the content node s 0 change the node content then add the new node s height to the scroll position

64596
jquery	dojo
palehorse is right though i can t vote his answer up at the moment - no points an abstraction library like jquery dojo or even prototype can often help with these matters

64600
vb.net	vb6
if you re porting vb to vb.net you should probably go ahead and use the datetime.today property rather than the vb6 compatability code

64604
boost	stl
there is also boost while not a gui library boost is a really great complement to c++ s stl

64605
vbscript	jscript
is it possible to use both jscript and vbscript in the same hta

64605
vbscript	jscript
can i call vbscript functions from jscript and vice-versa

64605
vbscript	jscript
are there any gotchas like the jscript running first and the vbscript running second classic asp pages have this issue

64638
vbscript	jscript
edit the specific gotcha of all jscript being executed first then vbscript is related to how asp processes scripts

64643
shibboleth	cas
there are a number of open source cross-domain sso packages such as josso opensso cas shibboleth and others

64644
emacs	vim
i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim

64682
python	lua
you can use either lua or python

64682
python	lua
lua is more lightweight than python

64682
python	lua
python and ironpython are other choices but based on experience they seem more heavy handed than lua

64696
stubs	tdd
if you want to do real tdd read test first with the red green refactor steps then you also have to start using mocks stubs when you want to test integration points

64727
double	int
for value types int double etc. the function receives a copy of the value

64742
managed-code	native-code
other obfuscation tools that do not produce managed-code assemblies as an output but instead rely on a native-code loader to preprocess their output can also incur an runtime performance hit especially at load time

64759
tiff	png
ideally i d like to be able to place it like the png tiff or jpg objects with the zend_pdf_image object

64768
terminal	prompt
is there a terminal program that show the difference between input standard output error output the prompt and user-entered commands

64768
command-line	cmd
another way would be to have 3 frames -- a large frame on the top for output including prompt and cmd running a small frame near the bottom for standard input and an one-line frame at the bottom for command-line input

64771
innodb	myisam
if it s a myisam table actually this may work with innodb too try issuing a lock table before the delete

64803
silverlight	wpf
however silverlight requires an understanding of wpf which is dramatically different than the html javascript that your app currently uses

64832
np-complete	subset-sum
this sounds like the subset-sum problem which is known to be np-complete

64836
punctuation	words
to reduce the chances of inappropriate or offensive words from being generated in english or in the recipientsâ languages i limited runs of consecutive alpha characters to two with numerals or punctuation characters betwee

64836
punctuation	words
using the just the rules above some offensive words are possible now that some numerals and punctuation are substituted for letters

64844
sql-server	mysql
although sql-server and mysql are both rdbms mysql has many unique features that can illustrate the difference between novice and expert

64844
database-table	mysql
during the interview try asking the candidate to write mysql code to create a database-table or add a new index

64844
innodb	myisam
myisam innodb and memory are the main ones

64844
innodb	myisam
at the least the candidate should mention that myisam issues a table-level lock whereas innodb uses row-level locking

64844
alter-table	insert-into
the candidate should mention master-master replication as well as avoiding the locking and performance issues of alter-table by creating a new table with the desired configuration and using mysqldump or insert-into .

64851
unsigned	integer
how would you write in c++ a macros which tests if an integer type given as a parameter is signed or unsigned

64853
.when	ready
it s faster the designer is vastly improved split view faster context switching it has better support for javascript and .when you re ready to target 3.5 you ll be ready to go

64860
linux	unix
on linux unix os x cygwin

64869
xsd	xml
a schema definition in xsd relaxng or dtd helps various tools that work with the xml because they can verify that the structure of the xml conforms to what you want

64876
versioning	upgrade
it is worth the upgrade for me for the main reason that i can target different .net versioning 2 3 3.5 from the same ide whereas in the past one version of visual-studio supported one version of .net

64883
jndi	jms
you probably need to get a jms connection from jndi like this

64887
implementation	instantiation
most of them allow you to separate instantiation behavior from the implementation of your classes

64896
markup	xhtml
i agree with everyone else that you should try as hard as you can to separate the html xhtml markup from the application logic

64902
post-increment	pre-increment
where you can use pre-increment instead of post-increment

64907
imagemagick	phpthumb

so if the page contains selected elements

64931
php-extension	imagick
imagick is a native php-extension to create and modify images using the imagemagick api

64942
xsd	xml
for a xml document to be queryable using xqquery you do not have to define a dtd or xsd

64942
xsd	xml
the purpose of dtd or xsd is to define the strict structure of a xml document and to allow validation before usage

64953
scheme	lisp
is there something like php s pdo library for lisp or arc or scheme or one of the dialects

64958
base-class	inherited
the only solution i ve come up with is that all new d object inherited a particular base-class be added to a containers when allocated and if there is an error everything in that containers can be deleted

64974
managed-code	c++-cli
if you are willing to use c++-cli for your managed-code instead of c# then you can just consume the native c++ interface definition directly via the header file

64978
sql-server	mysql
sql-server or mysql

64997
exception-handling	try-catch
with the new try-catch addition to tsql in sql-server 2005 we should try to use this powerful exception-handling handling mechanism through our code including database code

64999
lookup	any
if another piece of code calls it from multiple places your singleton can optimize caching for both simultaneously and avoid any double lookup

65010
solaris	linux
deployed on linux solaris windows and developed on a mac

65027
select	union
well you could craft a select statement composed of a lot of union of selects with hard coded results

65072
.net	wcf
.net wcf faults generating incorrect soap 1.1 faultcode values

65104
constructor	object
i agree with jhkiley that passing node object to the edge constructor instead of strings sounds like a good idea

65106
np-complete	subset-sum
i agree with tyler - what you are describing is a variant of the subset-sum problem which is known to be np-complete

65117
lighttpd	apache
if you require authorization for download of the music files and assuming that you run lighttpd or apache in front of your zope looking at a solution based on x-sendfile is probably the best option

65123
selected	button
the columns you want click the ellipsis button to selected

65130
versioning	upgrade
remember that the ssl level is auto negotiated between the server and the client best encryption used first so you don t necessarily need to disable older versioning but you could pop up a message to the user encouraging them to upgrade

65133
any	set
when i run ie under a debugger i don t see anything unusual - the debugger doesn t catch any exception-handling access violations or assertion failures but the problem is still there - i can set a breakpoint in the control s destructor and it s never hit when i close the broswer

65136
implements	extends
if you extends arrayobject or implements arrayaccess then you can do what you want

65183
file-access	filesystems
repositories stored on remote filesystems using file-access are going to be much slower than either svnserve or apache with mod_svn

65208
jquery	dojo
i have tried to use it for a ning social network which used dojo and for magento which uses prototype and i could not get either to play right with jquery

65209
photoshop	layer
i was recently asked to come up with a scripting that will allow the end user to upload a psd photoshop file and split it up and create images from each of the layer

65209
perl	php
i would love to stay with php for this but i am open to python or perl as well

65212

if any of the modifier keys are being held down when that event fires the corresponding property is set to true

65212
keyboard	mouse
this applies to keyboard as well as mouse events onclick etc

65233
any	set
why do you have any expectation that param will be set to the value

65241
python	ruby
write the interface in c++ and use macros to make it look like a standard cpp header file on unix and like an idl file on windows if this does not work out you can always write a python ruby script to generate the idl from the c++ header file

65243
vba	vb6
has anybody attempted to pass a vba or vb6 function via addressof

65252
filesystems	hardlink
in addition because a file may have multiple hardlink into the filesystems each of the names are equivalent so once you ve got just the open handle it wouldn t be clear which filename you should map back towards

65259
triggers	insert
the only problem with using triggers is that it adds to performance overhead of any insert update delete

65279
pc-lint	misra
i use pc-lint on my c++ projects and especially like how it references existing publications such as the misra guidelines or scott meyers effective c++ and more effective c++

65280
thread-dump	jvm
try getting a thread-dump of the jvm kill -3 while these logs are being written to

65282
execution	exit
on top of that any value returned from within the finally block will override the value returned prior to execution of the finally block so be careful of checking all exit points when using try finally

65291
32-bit	64bit
we used to get semi-regular crashes when approaching the 4 gb memory limit under the 32-bit versions we generally use 64bit now

65297
build-system	scons
1 use a build-system that doesn t use timestamps to detect modifications like scons

65305
jquery	dojo
it provides a common distribution network and a loading architecture for jquery prototype script.aculo.us mootools and dojo

65420
ubuntu	linux
pd for the ubuntu part you are in luck they say that ubuntu is our linux distro of choice

65423
reference-type	generics
therefore if you change your example to constrain the generics type parameter t to a non-sealed reference-type such as exception the compiler can determine the specific overload to use and the following code would compile

65431
windows-vista	windows
is there a reliable way to detect whether or not winhelp is installed on windows-vista or newer versions of windows

65440
spawn	exit
if you have a program that basically spawn once compiles a bunch of regexes and then exit you could try re-engineering it to perform multiple tests in one invocation

65472
bazaar	git
any dvcs bitkeeper git bazaar mercurial etc because being distributed will cut down the load on the central canonical scm server

65510
keyboard	mouse
seems a bit longer than some other methods suggested but i like to do things with the keyboard instead of the mouse

65527
.when	ready
there s no cross-browser methods for checking .when the dom is ready -- this is why libraries like jquery exist to abstract away nasty little bits of incompatibility

65531
reserved-words	keyword
also keep in mind that the name you choose must not be a keyword or reserved-words

65549
installation	building
you should also consider that aside from the substantial risk to the installation you may well be building in dependencies upon your changes that are then overwrite in a future patch or service pack

65551
32-bit	16-bit
eg for 2 shorts assuming 16-bit you should use a 32-bit int

65553
adplus	dump
debugging tools for windows has has a scripting adplus that allows you to create dump when a process crashes

65553
show	next
by default windbg will show you next to the command-line the thread were the process crashed

65562
perforce	cvs
- and they ve said that this is the same for all of the companies - when they made the decision to go with perforce it was either that or sourcesafe or cvs - and honestly given those three choices i d go with perforce too

65570
value	field
you get an sql-error if you misspell or rename a field not an empty value from a recordset row

65599
order	add
can you just add an id field to the vertex object and assign it a number in order of construction

65601
order	add
if you create a view using selected and later add columns to your table the view definition and the data returned won t match and you ll need to recompile your views in order for them to work again

65603
protected	public
fxcop will detect public protected methods with no upstream callers

65604
having	select
so if you use all the data try select for simplicity imagine having many columns and doing a join.

numerical	nan
this code works on numerical but not textual values without the commented line you get nan s

65642
arguments	default
can t use the default constructor with no arguments

65652
contains	elements
if the positioning of the elements contains the lorum ipsum is set absolute you can specify the positioning via css

65652
contains	elements
the here and and here elementss would need to be contains in a block level elements

65652
margins	padding
for better presentation your two divs will probably need some padding and margins so that the text doesn t all run together

65688
margins	padding
the benefits of using blend is that certain tasks are extremely fast there - things like picking colors brushes creating animation and layout fixes such as tweaking margins padding

65787
plugins	add-on
and if you are testing in ie then fiddler is a must have add-on plugins

65805
value	field
our current strategy for dealing with this is to have a table for each of the field that can have multiple value

65845
glib	gtk
gnu autounit uses glib extensively which means that linking and such need special options but this may not be a big problem to you especially if you are already using gtk or glib

65847
perforce	cvs
what i like about perforce say compared to cvs is that the branch management is must more sophisticated but still reasonably easy and you don t need to bug a central bureaucracy to create branches labels and the like

65856
vmware	esx
vmware esx esxi and virtualcenter are supposed to be able to support http put uploads since versioning 3.5

65869
hide	show
to show hide particular button

65873
serialization	marshalling
although serialization is used here it is also common for this process to be referred as marshalling

snmp	mib
to continue your example the cdp mib has been published at cisco s a href step 2 mibname cisco-cdp-mib rel nofollow noreferrer snmp object navigator. a

65902
snmp	mib
the oid will change if nothing else to move it into their own enterprise oid spaces but the mib may also change to conform to cisco s snmp practices

65908
dreamweaver	fckeditor
if you re talking about editing components as opposed to stand-alone apps like dreamweaver i ve used cuteeditor tinymce fckeditor ewebeditpro and telerik s rad editor

i m using the vbo extension for storing vertex normals and color buffering glbindbufferarb

65912
firefox	safari
tested in the latest firefox beta and latest safari

65917
packaging	building
i agree with thomas owens on eclipse rich client platform designing coding and packaging java tm applications and would also add eclipse building commercial-quality plugins to the list of rather outdated but still somewhat useful books on eclipse-rcp

65924
communication	messages
the difficult part however is not the communication channel but the messages you pass over it

65925
ubuntu	linux
in linux for example ubuntu it is possible to turn off the wireless adapter without turning of the network capabilities

65932
value	field
if you have some field that simply have a set of value to chose between say 2 4 or 6 windows you can simply use an enum or define a new field-type using user-defined domains depending on which dbms you re using

65938
imagemagick	magick++
using graphicsmagick or imagemagick along with magick++ you can then use imagick

65944
javascript	dom
i find these three are incredibly useful when starting on a blank page mozilla dom reference for general javascript syntax etc w3schools x html reference look up uncommon attributes

65976
export	report
this apps are normally built on php so far i have manually created most of this report and while i enjoy the freedom of building it like i want it usually becomes pretty tedious to calculate subtotals averages export to different formats etc

66001
selected	cell
in addition to the auditing tools the simplest tool and the one i use most is to selected a cell and hit f2 to have all the cell references in the formula and the referenced cells highlighted with colour coding

66006
javascript	dom
clarification i do not mean html dom scripting performed after the document is transformed nor do i mean xsl transformations initiated by javascript in the browser what the w3schools page shows

66007
self-updating	updates
i would have no problems to write the updates logic myself but there the problem is that the users running to self-updating applications have too restricted rights to perform an updates

66016
reliability	robustness
some languages have return codes others have try catch or rescue retry etc. each with its own pecularities in reliability robustness and practical effectiveness in a large grouping development effort

66032
children	nodes
the dom methods getchildnodess returns a nodeslist of the children of the current nodes

66060
sftp	scp
also nice integration with a variety of scp sftp clients

66069
ruby	php
it s open source and is supported on pretty much every os you can think of as well as having language support for c++ c# java ruby python and php

66072
python	perl
open the file using whatever scripting language you prefer perl python and traverse the file until you find a match for your version

66089
implements	abstract
so each field textfield textbox etc. must have an abstract parsing that is then implements by a different class depending on the locale right to left double byte etc.

66093
value	field
it s been a while since i used lucene but my guess would be to add an extra field for sorting and storing the value in there with the stop-words already stripped

66111
communication	messages
for reasons that don t bear explaining i am sending clientmessage from a comand-line utility to a gui app.most of the messages end up having the same contents as the message s purpose is to triggers a synchronous communication process over some side pipe

66112
javascript	dom
a document-ordered node list is the behavior in other implementations of the dom such as javascript s or python s

66122
division	modulo
division and modulo are your friends

66125
callback	methods
the api then at a later moment sends a callback and that methods might then traverse the table using the key which might be -1 in this example the error code

66147
right-align	floating
for instance how would you detect and show that a left-aligned image floating left of a paragraph of text has suddenly become right-align

66164
administration	sysadmin
finding out which users had administration rights on the server itself was fine as was finding out who had the sysadmin role on their login - it was a single line query for the latter

66168
thread-dump	jvm
for any jvm process force a thread-dump

66187
database-migration	upgrade
an increment in this number requires a database-migration and so is a significant change or systems replicate and so changing the database structure requires a careful upgrade process

66221
google-chrome	firefox
modern browsers either don t appear to support sslv2 at all google google-chrome opera 9.52 firefox or have it disabled by default ie7 ie8

66228
protected	public
if you have constants that are only valid to a particular class or one of its subclasses declare them as either protected or public and place them on the top class in the hierarchy

66253
contains	elements
if you re fearing classitus try using an id on a parent or child selector that contains the elements that you wish to style

66282
python	perl
in the bioinformatics development group where i work we re encouraging use of python for new development where perl would have been the language of choice in the past

66307
double	int
such as int and double export

66339
any	set
any time you need a fixed set of constants

66356
punctuation	tokenize
there seems to be a catch-22 in that you must tokenize a field with an analyzer in order to stripes punctuation and stop-words but you can t sort on tokenize fields

66418
optional-parameters	named
numeration types subset types role composition multimethod dispatch type checking basic i o named regular expression grammars optional-parameters named parameters slurpy parameters closures smart match junctions and many other features expected from perl 6

66438
switching	screens
i ve noticed that on some devices when i switching from one canvas to another e.g from the main menu to the game the screens momentarily flickers

66442
xsd	xml
if your need is to store heterogeneous data for example like a cms scenario i would suggest storing xml validated by an xsd in a row

66455
jpasswordfield	jtextfield
even more important i d like to change it globally so the new behavior applies to jtextfield jpasswordfield jformattedtextfield jtextarea jcombobox jspinner and so on

66494
division	modulo
at a basic level what you want to do is define an arrays of image names then take the number of days from a given point in time then modulo remainder after division by the number of images and access that index in the arrays and set the image untested code

66505
implements	abstract
i create an abstract base-class commandbase which implements icommand to contains common code

66508
silverlight	wpf
every industry expert i ve heard on podcasts blogs and interviews recommend learning silverlight first and then gradually moving to wpf which is a huge ui framework

66513
rollback	commit
the dtc will coordinates the two independent transactions so they commit or are rollback together

66525
bison	yacc

66546
implements	abstract
define an abstract property name in the interface to force all implements classes to implement the name property

66574
imagemagick	mogrify
if you can guarantee the presence of imagemagick you can use their mogrify -flop command

66577
swing	awt
jogl provides full access to the apis in the opengl 2.0 specification as well as nearly all vendor extensions and integrates with the awt and swing widget sets

66596
derived-class	base-class
just add the name property to the base-class and pass it ito the base-class s constructor and have the constructor from the derived-class pass in it s command name

66599
common-lisp	lisp
it is a mixture of a common-lisp cookbook and a quality teach yourself lisp book

66602
abstract-class	subclass
obs. do not use a field in an abstract-class that should be initiated in a subclass like david b suggestion

66605
keyboard	mouse
set system preferences keyboard mouse trackpad to use two finger secondary click

66605
keyboard	mouse
set system preferences keyboard mouse trackpad to use two finger screen zoom for magnifying an area in the screen by holding the control key and scrolling up or down

66625
adplus	dump
debugging tools for windows has has a scripting adplus that allows you to create dump when a process crashes

66625
show	next
by default windbg will show you next to the command-line the thread were the process crashed

66647
swing	swt
just keep in mind that swing swt and opengl are generally used for entirely different things

66648
32-bit	64bit
for a 64bit integer it s int64 and for a 32-bit integer the intuitive choice is int or int32

66652
shell	bash
i do it on my own web site for certain pages that are guaranteed not to change -- i simply run a shell script that could be boiled to warning bash pseudocode

66654
quicktime	qtkit
i m trying to convert old quicktime framework code to the 64bit cocoa-based qtkit on os x which means that i can t drop down to the straight c function-calls at any time

66654
quicktime	qtkit
specifically i m trying to find a way to write quicktime vr movies with qtkit as they require some special metadata to set the display controllers

66678
factors	primes
as binaries lack the primes factors 5 all binary numbers can be exactly represented by decimals but not vice versa

66679
abstract-class	base-class
since you are using an abstract-class however what you can do is declare the property as abstract in the base-class which will force the inheriting class it override it

66693
constructor	object
we also got a new way to create object without using new-object -- in fact if you kept your class simple and don t define a constructor you can create object by casting a hashtable although without a constructor there would be no way to enforce that all properties must be set

66724
recording	playing
if its a one person application say a music library where you hold hundreds of titles ratings information usage playing play time then sql lite will scale beautifully holding thousands if not millions of recording hard-drive willing

66738
revision	svn
you could use the svn rev property to get the revision number into your footer

66741
directory	folder
it s the same basic concept but supports transactional backups if the update goes wrong in the middle by storing each checkout in a separate folder and symlinking the latest to your www directory

66745
jar	war
each module is packageable as a jar or a war in the case of the web module and thus allows for easier code reuse we could install the module in the maven repository and reuse it in another project

66770
ruby-on-rails	rspec
whenever i run rspec tests for my ruby-on-rails application it takes forever and a day of overhead before it actually starts running tests

66771
capitalization	capitalize
you may not want to change the capitalization -- different cultures capitalize different words for example in german you capitalize every noun not just proper nouns

66779
ms-access	oracle
oracle has a migration workbench to port ms-access systems to oracle application express which would be worth investigating

66783
ruby-on-rails	rspec
if so it s not rspec s initialization that s slow it s ruby-on-rails

66799
put	get
using this methods could get painful though you could put it all into a shell scripting and it doesn t allow you to pass variables in the same way eg won t work

66801
associations	model
if you weren t fussed about the time sensitive nature of the comments you could make use of cakephp s countercache functionality by adding a comment_count field to the entries table configuring the countercache key of the comment belongsto entry associations with this field then call find on the entry model

66806
base-class	inherited
all your views requiring additional data will then need strongly typed viewdata that inherited from this base-class

66817
ado	jet
if the data store is a jet database it makes little sense to use any form of ado unless you re running your code from a scripting platform where it s the preferred choice

66825

your annotations should be placed on some class probably the one in which you will be creating the query to use the result set mapping

66852
dlopen	dlsym
a standard-ish api is the dlopen dlsym api

66873
perforce	cvs
i ve used bitkeeper clearcase accurev perforce subversion cvs sccs and rcs and out of all of those bitkeeper was far and above the best

66876
groovy	scala
ant is of course verbosity city but it has better support for building java-like languages scala and groovy included

66876
buildr	maven
if you want dependency management for java-like libraries maven is the canonical choice but i personally like buildr a lot better

66883
return-type	arguments
where the second to last arguments is the return-type and the last arguments is a tuples of arguments types

66890
versioning	staging
most payment gateways provide such numbers for testing their services but they will generally only work on the staging test versioning of those gateways

66898
python	java
it s the build system used for vtk among other things which is a c++ library with cross-platform python tcl and java bindings

66900
markup	xhtml
when browsers treat the markup as html and you want your xhtml 1.0 markup for example to validate

66917
python	java
i have used swig to make an interface from c++ to java or python and then used the typical web interface support for those languages

66917
python	java
since java and python have reflection the web services frameworks that exist for them have a much easier time passing data around

66917
python	c++
as a bonus you can test your c++ code from python using these same swig interfaces

66923
ip-address	hostname
how can you find out whether this string is an ip-address or a hostname in java

66924
json	xml
according to yahoo s documentation for geoplanet requests are made in the form of an http get messages which can very easily be made using python httplib module and responses can take one of several forms including xml and json

the generally excellent c5 generic collection library has several different tree-based data-structures including sets bags and dictionary

66934
worksheet	excel
we are automating excel using vb.net and trying to place multiple lines of text on an excel worksheet that we can set to not print

66936
python	java
it is possible that you are misunderstanding just what a classmethod is in python it s a bit different from say a static method in java

66936
instances	self
a normal methods is more-or-less just a function which takes as its first arguments usually called self an instances of the class and which is invoked as .

66937
chown	chmod
another option is that she will do chown nobody and chmod +s on your binary executable and you ll be able to execute it directly

66956
children	tree
if you need to only navigate down the tree then a node class needs a list of children

66963
perl	ruby
chartdirector is available for lots of platforms win linux solaris bsd osx and has an api for lots of languages too perl asp .net java php python ruby c++

66984
flash-cs3	flash-cs4
flash requires you to use a media server note i m still using flash mx but a quick google-search brings up documentation for flash-cs3 that seems to concur - note that flash-cs4 is out soon might change then

66989
ip-address	hostname
that code will validate the ip-address or hostname

67000
canvas	pixel
the one requirement for writing my app is that i have pixel level precision over the canvas

67000
python	java
ideally i would like to write this in python or perhaps java as a second choice

67025
error-code	hresult
anything with a facility of 7 is a windows error-code repackaged as an hresult and you should convert the low word to decimal and look it up in winerror.h

67035
any	set
essentially any time you set a name of an a tag you can then access it by linking to #name-used-in-tag

67057
modifiers	final
a constant of any type can be declared by creating an immutable property that within a class that is a member variables with the final modifiers

67062
np-complete	subset-sum
this seems closely related to the subset-sum problem which is np-complete in general

67068
any	set
google uses a combination of that the local domain you use eg google.it google.hu and any preferences you set with the preferences link in the home page to assign a language to your pages

67089
canvas	pixel
as for java using swt pixel level manipulation of a canvas is somewhat difficult and slow so i would not recommend it

67093
innodb	myisam
this needs to work with innodb which stores things very differently than myisam

67099
xhtml	tidy
you can use tidy to convert it to xhtml and then use whatever xml processing facilities your language of choice has available

67100
any	set
you should have the repository set up so this can happen with a single checkout including any necessary sub folders

67144
javascript	dom
the whole concepts of querying and chainability fit very well with dom manipulation which seems to be the brunt of what people use javascript libraries for

67167
32-bit	64bit
for example can i convert the 32-bit activex control to a 64bit control myself

67174
decrement	increment

67210
www-mechanize	perl-module
i personally like the www-mechanize perl-module for these kinds of tasks

67213
joomla	drupal
if you have to get under the hood and make modifications i m also a firm believer that drupal is a more friendly and elegant system than joomla

67215
getter	setter
also my instinct like yours is to use getter and setter as a signals that a process may be long-running spawn threads or do some other non-trivial work

67215
getter	setter
also if a setter has non-obvious prerequisites in the class i might use a getter or setter instead since people rarely read documentation on properties and properties are expected to be accessable at all times

67217
getter	setter
forget the getter and setter methods

67217
getter	setter
an interesting thing to mention is that properties are ending up as setter and or getter methods s in the assembly

67217
getter	setter
setter and or getter become a property just by a little bit of metadata

67217
getter	setter
so in fact properties setter getter methods

67227
directory	folder
you have the files in your local directory the so called working copy and one in the repository which can be located in another local folder or on another machine usually accessed over the network

67227
any	set
should you at any point wish to go back to the version at which you committed those changes then you can simply revert your working copy to an older revision the name given to the set of changes that you commit at once

67227
cvs	git
note that this is all very cvs svn-specific as git would work slightly different

67259
buffering	capture
you can disable anti-aliasing and capture regions of the screen to a buffering or a file

67259
pyopengl	pyglet
i mention pyglet instead of pure pyopengl because pyglet handles a lot of ugly opengl stuff transparently with no effort on your part

67275
zipinputstream	inputstream
if i don t try copying the file into another inputstream via the outputstream mentioned above and just pass the zipinputstream to my 3rd party library the library closes the stream and i can t do anything more like dealing with the remaining files in the stream

67290
perl	ruby
there have been a number of answers recommending perl mechanize but i think that ruby mechanize very similar to perl s version is even better

67308
modulus	digits
you don t do division modulus to get the digits in production code firstly because it s suboptimal your cpu is designed for binary arithmetics not decimal and secondly because it s unintuitive

67312
multiplication	addition
transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck

67321
contains	set
then you could have a which would contains items and next cell and you could insert emptycell at the end or just have the next reference explicitly set to null

67321
contains	any
the advantages would be that because emptycell contains no member variables it wouldn t require any storage space like the empty in haxe whereas a cons cell would

67378
malloc	free
what i have done to solve this is to override the malloc new free delete operators such that they keep track in a data structure as much as possible about the operation you are performing

67388
tuples	set
tuples are the cheapest kind of containers in python they are also hashable so they can be used as dictionary keys set members etc

67394

paypal - from merchant to paypal and back to merchant with express-checkout

67460
duplicates	elements
also sorted on the operator of the templates argument but does not allow duplicates elements

67475
rule	jess
for example you would not required that general computer users learn python in order to write an email filter. similarly rule languages such as jess are only a partials solution since some simpler user-interface needs to be built on-top of the rule language so non-programmers can make use of it

67489
background-color	transparency
if you re using a browser control there may be a property in it to change the background-color to transparency or to use alpha channel layering

67505
silverlight	wpf
however i would state that silverlight is not rtm yet and wpf is

67505
silverlight	wpf
wpf has a lot of books out on the subject where silverlight does not

67505
silverlight	wpf
just keep in mind that silverlight has a subset of the controls of wpf a paired down .net and does not do synchronous calls

67512
python	java
i m considering switching to a dvorak-based keyboard layout but one optimized for programming mostly java and python ddvorak programmer dvorak etc.

67547
mootools	extjs
performance-wise they are all pretty close however mootools dojo extjs and prototype all run faster in my environment

67562
python	ruby
if you do this type of functional programming all the time you might want to check out f# or maybe even iron ruby or python

67573
contains	elements
as i understand it you wish to see if several strings contains the same elements regardless of order

67585
updating	updates
then when you done updating you put the one you updates online and take the other one down

67590
markup	xhtml
what happens if when html 5 is finally implemented and django is generating html 4 or xhtml markup

67606
debugging	trace
if you are using a debugging flash player you can have the flash player log trace messages to a file on your system

the flicker is probably caused by the app attempting to draw to the screens while the switching of the canvas is still ongoing

67626
google-chrome	opera
works better with opera and google-chrome though

67628
silverlight	wpf
are there any ports to wpf of silverlight s multiscaleimage aka deepzoom

i want to move from winforms to wpf and require something like deepzoom using silverlight isn t an option

67640
emacs	vim
i m not looking for solutions with vim or emacs nor editors like bbedit that support syntax highlighting but a full fledged ide with

67653
contains	any
interfaces are only descriptions of an api after all api stands for application programmer interface they can t contains any implementation and it s not possible to use or run an interface

67653
classname	inherited
if a class is intended to be inherited the convention is to prefix the classname with base

67653
base-class	abc
there is a distinction between a base-class and an abstract base-classes abc

67653
base-class	inherited
an abstract base-class can then describe both an interface as well as an empty partial or complete implementation that is intended to be inherited

67665
quirks-mode	doctype
i believe the easiest way to recreate this bug would be the following html in a page with a declared doctype it works correctly in quirks-mode no-doctype

67670
similarity	distance
one possible approach to this would be to first run each phrase through a stop-word list to remove common words such as a to the etc. then for each of the remaining words in each phrase you could compute the semantic similarity between each of the words in the other phrase using a distance measure based on wordnet

67671
silverlight	wpf
much more resources are available for wpf than silverlight such as books blogs and msdn documentation

67682
firefox	safari
target browsers ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 opera safari

67687
textmate	bbedit
textmate is an editor like bbedit but it has the ability to run commands such as compilation debugging refactoring though it will do so via xcode

67700
flv	mp3
most flv audio is encoded in the mp3 format meaning you can extract it directly from the flv containers

67700
flv	mp3
i d check out libavcodec which handles flv mp3 nellymoser natively and should let you get to the audio

67703
splunk	nagios
from there you can have your syslog feed into zenoss nagios splunk or anything else that syslog can talk to

67706
contains	any
has anyone come up with a good way of performing full text searches freetext contains for any number of arbitrary keywords using standard linqtosql query syntax

67714
session-cookies	cookies
whenever a user is logged in they should be using http and if you re using session-cookiess the cookies should have the secure flag set

the following might be helpful if you are attempting to accomplish this with c++ or python

67767
linux	osx
windows linux mac osx and even beyond

67767
python	c++
wxwidgets is a c++ framework but it also provides python bindings via wxpython

67769
contains	any
the nice thing about django is that it will recognize any models.py file within any level of your directory tree as a file contains django-models

67808
ruby-on-rails	django
django core doesn t have as much html helpers as ruby-on-rails because django contributors assumed that web developer knows html very well

67808
ruby-on-rails	django
it s very easy to write your own template tags in django often you need just to define one function similiar to ruby-on-rails

67808
ruby-on-rails	django
you could reimplement most of ruby-on-rails helpers in django during a day or two

67833
command-line	cmd
one way of going about doing this would be to use nstask in conjuction with the screencapture cmd-line cmd

67878
google-chrome	safari
your example works as expected in google google-chrome safari windows and ie8

67878
firefox	opera
the text breaks out of the 150px box in firefox 3 and opera 9.5

67925
javascript	dom
you can use a simple bookmarklet to add a script tag which loads an external javascript file that can push the necessary elements to the dom and present a modal window to the user

67927
any	set
eclipse should now stop at any breakpoints that you ve set in the projects you added in step 3

67931
javascript	dom
for instance try using the w3c dom more for more than just trivial javascript

67935
session-cookies	cookies
finding the cookies is easy enough session-cookiess all have similar names so just examine the cookiess collection until you find the appropriate cookies

67942
return-value	arguments
normally the c++ compiler enhances function names so that they encode type information about arguments and the return-value

67954
deployment	install
this requires windows-server 2003 automated deployment services which in turn can only be install on windows-server 2003 enterprise edition

67991
sorted	lookup
if you have manly lookup operations then a sorted vector may be more appropriate and then use lower_bound to lookup the element

68078
imageview	textview
each of these tabs is also a view and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label it s almost certainly some other viewgroup maybe a linearlayout but it doesn t matter that contains an imageview and a textview

68208
postgresql	oracle
i m assuming you re referring to indexing tables on a relational dbms like mysql oracle or postgresql

68237
sharing	share
the solution to the problem of sharing data between threads in core data like the enterprise objects framework before it is don t. if you ve thought about it further and you really honestly do have to share data between threads then the solution is to keep independent object graphs in thread-isolated contexts and use the information in the save notification from one context to tell the other context what to re-fetch

68253
perforce	bazaar
clearcase perforce and bazaar

68300
highlight	selected
highlight of other instances of selected text in the same document

68367
emacs	vim
i believe that cscope can be configured to work with vim and emacs although i ve seen people use other editors also

there s a glcanvas that belongs to swt and a glcanvas that belongs to awt

68400
udp	tcp
dev tcp and dev udp

68435
tokenize	parsing
about a year ago i needed some c code to parsing an expression tokenize it for storage and evaluate the results latter

68439
parentheses	braces
if you re going to learn dvorak i would personally avoid plain dvorak as it moves punctuation commonly used in programming such as parentheses brackets braces etc too far away from the hands there are a number of programmer dvorak implementations out there which adjust dvorak for this oversight

68443
ruby	php
this is particularly true for those coming over from languages such as php python ruby or even java

68455
callback	methods

68548
linux	unix
the thing is what i really want to do is programming but my interships were mostly sysadmins jobs with some programming due to my previous experience with linux and unix

68548
put	get
this is not as big as what is being done in the real world but it a fun project and i am having a lot of fun doing it and if i can get it quite advance in the next month i will probably put in on sourceforge

68558
value	field
when you reference a static final field the value of that constant is compiled into any bytecode that references it

68566
scp	ssh
you will need to setup ssh keys to enable password-less logins if you are wrapping system commands like ssh scp or rsync. you can embed a password in a script using paramiko or some other library but you might find the lack of documentation frustrating especially if you are not familiar with the basic of the ssh connection eg - key exchanges agents etc

68566
scp	ssh
note its hard to beat rsync if you plan on transferring files via ssh especially if the alternative is plain old scp

68571
associations	model
with some exception-handling for specific types of associations so it is very likely that if you have only 5 grouping of functionality you might not have 70 model

68610
firefox	safari
in firefox 2 3 and safari everything work fine but for some reason the text doesn t appear centered in ie 6 or 7

68614
persistence	hibernate
i d like to start migrating this application to use a much more expressive transparent and non-invasive persistence strategy and given my company s previous experience with it hibernate 3.x is the obvious choice

the scrolltop property is a available on any dom element including the document body

68673
32-bit	64bit
i ve run into issues like this numerous times when trying to convert a 32-bit app that uses quicktime into a 64bit app

68673
quicktime	qtkit
here s hoping that quicktime x will have a more fully featured qtkit set of apis

68674
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

68679
bazaar	git
for the second question well try some good dvcs git mercurial bazaar and see if any can help you

68681
pointers	stack

68755
modularity	paradigms
from wikipedia aspect-oriented programming aop is a programming paradigms that increases modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns

hide	show
i want to dynamically hide show some of the columns in a nstableview based on the data that is going to be display - basically if a column is empty i d like the column to be hidden

68871
keyboard	mouse
you ll also want to get rid of all your built-in events such as onenterframe and you ll want to take a close look at nontrivial mouse interaction such as dragging and keyboard interaction such as detecting whether a key is pressed

68928
cpu-architecture	mips
depending on the cpu-architecture arguments can be passed in registers for example a0 through a3 on mips or by pushing them onto the stack as in the original x86 calling convention

68935
reference-type	generics
you may also need wish to add the new qualifier to the generics type where t class new to enforce that t is both a reference-type class and has a parameterless constructor

68959
constructor	private
you can optionally use a private constructor to force all references to the class to go through a static property

68961
constructor	object
so instead of the tired old object object you often get with the typeof keyword you can actually get real object types based upon the constructor

69026
environment	building
all of your forms reports tables code queries are available there is a scripting language similar to ms test ok you probably don t remember ms test there is database environment for holding your test scripting and test results and the skills you building here are transferable to your application
