boost	stl
in contrast the worst i ve ever worked with are boost and the c++ stl

100035
protected	public
make that encapsulation public or protected or private that choice of information hiding is still to be made

100037
metaclass	subclass
note that the magic behaviour that initalised gains by having the metaclass init_attributes is not passed onto a subclass of initalised

100037
metaclass	subclass
here is an even more concrete example showing how you can subclass type to make a metaclass that performs an action when the class is created

100047
javascript	dom
the ability to use javascript frameworks like jquery to manipulate the dom

100047
getter	setter
you get to write your server javascript using whizzy new javascript 1.8 features like arrays extras and getter setter

100049
wicket	spring
i have been using spring asp.net-mvc and it is good but wicket has a neat features that spring asp.net-mvc has not server-side state management and encapsulation rich component model no unnecessary xml mapping files - just pure java and html

100053
communication	messages
i posted a question about using messages versus fault exception-handling to communication business rules between services

100056
perl	ruby
perl ruby php etc all have distribution mechanisms built into the language to consume such libraries

100064
getchar	getc
however you should be able to use getc getchar from tango.stdc.stdio - i changed the faq you mention to reflect this

100070
administration	account
my user account is a member of the local administration grouping

100076
google-chrome	firefox
at the end of the day you will still want to install firefox ie6-8 opera and safari google-chrome for testing manually

100125
duplicates	sorted
in fact it might be better to change your insert function so that it performs a sorted insertion that checks for duplicates

100125
duplicates	sorted
then you always have sorted lists that are free of duplicates and merging them is a trivial matter

100146
metaclass	subclass
to create your own metaclass in python you really just want to subclass type

100150
any	set
c++ didn t need a separate language concept of interface because any class might be used as an interface -- just define a set of methods in it make no implementation call it like iexecutable and use

100150
required	checked
some languages called dynamically typed like python don t required to define interfaces at all you just call a methods you need and run-time checked if it is possible if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck it must be a duck

100155
websphere	ibm
so are ibm s websphere offerings

100161
aptana	pydev
i m primarily using pydev aptana and subclipse very little java development

100188
miktex	tex
we used tex miktex and it was perfect because

100198
contains	any
this isn t as simple as just checking whether the file name contains any of system.io.path.getinvalidfilenamechars as mentioned in a couple of other answers already

100198
contains	any
for example what if somebody enters a name that contains no invalid chars but is 300 characters long greater than max_path - this won t work with any of the .net file apis and only has limited support in the rest of windows using the

100199
arguments	default
every asks its arguments for all value but doesn t return anything by default

100200
directory	folder
that will recursively search the current directory for symlinks to particular folder

100209
reasoning	pellet
i have an owl ontology and i am using pellet to do reasoning over it

100228
contains	elements
i tried doing the following but xmlspy complains that the content model contains the elementss elements name dateconstant and elements name dateconstant which cannot be uniquely determined.

100259
solution-explorer	csproj
although you could add them all to a vbproj or csproj so you get them all showing up in your solution-explorer and could use features like project - deploy

100290
enterprise	platform
can somebody in so please provide me with a list of resources about enterprise mashups and technologies related to sharepoint platform

100300
exception-handling	error-handling
exception-handling are not for error-handling imo

100300
exception-handling	try-catch
and try-catch where you actually catch an exception-handling you re able to handle is good or if you do this

100311
contains	set
the only api the imdb publishes is a set of plain-text data files contains formatted lists of actors directors movies etc

100313
duplicates	elements
of course you could place the sub-sequences into grouping to avoid to duplicates an elements in each sequence if you realize you miss one

100315
updating	updates
example i m writing code that updates a variables and i need to make absolutely sure that the gui changes to reflect the change the easiest way is to add an accessor methods aka a setter which is called instead of updating data is updated

100315
getter	setter
from experience the only times you d want to make a member variables public and leave out getter and setter methods is if you want to make it absolutely clear that changing it will have no side effects

100315
getter	setter
also if you re writing a data structure as a way of finding out about how they store data rather than as release code then there s a good arguments that getter and setter will not help and will get in the way of the learning experience

100319
selected	checkbox
each node can have a checkbox so if you populate the treeview onexpand you can let the user selected the files directories he wants to upload

100326
spring	guice
the team got rid of spring in favor of guice but that was more like a political change at least from my point of view and other developers i ve talked to

100334
web-services	api
great web-services coverage for the underlying api will allow you to build external mashups like the one you mention in your question comment

100350
mono.cecil	fxcop
mono.gendarme similar to fxcop but with an opensource licence based on mono.cecil

100350
mono.cecil	fxcop
smokey similar to fxcop and gendarme based on mono.cecil

100365
associations	model
that is until i tried to use some of the model s associations and functions

100369
base-class	inherited
this attributes is not inherited from the base-class and if it is not specified serialization will fail with a serializationexception stating that type x in assembly y is not marked as serializable.

100369
constructor	private
this constructor should be private if your class is sealed otherwise it should be protected to allow access to derived classes

100380
getchar	getc
and i also found both getc and getchar is also line buffering in my development-environment so it could not achieve what i wish i could do

100394
python	perl
for cyclomatic complexity you can try this perl program or this article which introduces a python program to do the same

100407
user-interface	look-and-feel
the problem with these steps in the mentioned link is that the look-and-feel and therefor the user-interface is set globaly in our software

100426
associations	model
if this is not what you re asking for and the model and its associationss actually do exist but cake seems to be unable to find them you ll have to triple check the names of all models and their class names in both the actual model definition and in the associations definitions

100450
value	field
instead of passing it via a query string you should create a hidden form field with its value and then post to your 2nd page which can then grab the posted value and it will be hidden from the user

100477
show	next
add n to the end of the definition to make studio show you the next n items as well

100480
python	c++
prefered languages c++ python

100513
sql-server	mysql
sql-server from 2000 and mysql 5

100520
debugging	trace
java already eases the debugging process a lot by giving you the line number and full stack trace

100526
sql-server	mysql
the following works for ms sql-server 2000 2005 2008 and mysql 5 and above

100532
authentication	login
users should login through webapp2 which will call webapp1 securely for authentication

100555
constructor	object
as well as the standard case of calling a virtual function from the constructor or destructor of an object with pure virtual functions you can also get a pure virtual function call on msvc at least if you call a virtual function after the object has been destroyed

100592
selected	button
also getting the timing of actions such as clicking a button or selected a menu item correctly can be a pain

100596
delphi	c++
a rather comprehensive site explaining the difficulties and solutions involved in using a dll written in c c++ and the conversion of the .h header file to delphi pascal was posted to a mailing list i was on recently so i thought i d share it and invite others to post other useful resources for this whether they be links conversion tools or book paper titles

100607
command-prompt	command-line
open a command-prompt with vc++ command-line tools enabled try cl

100634
arguments	undefined
yes the order of arguments evaluation is unspecified but it is undefined to both read and modify a single variables without an intervening sequence point unless the read is solely for the purpose of computing the new value

100634
arguments	undefined
there is no sequence point between the evaluations of function arguments so f test test++ is undefined behaviour test is being read for one argument and modified for the other

100698
vbscript	vb.net
if your old site is vbscript it s probably easier to go with vb.net

100700
sendmessage	message
sendmessage will return with whatever value is returned from the wndproc that handles the message s_maxgettaskinterface

100706
contains	elements
or if it s in a menu contains within a block-level elements make the a display as block too

100710
messagebox	alert
basically that s show messagebox alert send strings to file or debugview trace

100710
python	lua
there are other automation tools like ranorex i didn t tested it you can even use some scripting language lua python with a library to send messages wm_xxx and another to call winapi.

100738
vb.net	vb6
if this is in vb6 vbscript etc i would first look towards vb.net

100740
quadtree	map
a quadtree is best for when you use a height map for terrain etc

100741
vbscript	vb.net
since you ve done vbscript migration to vb.net is more natural - you can learn the new syntax then move onto the framework and bcl when you are familiar with those you can learn the c# syntax as weel - being bi-lingual is always good

100758
payment	banking
the most important factors in choosing a secure payment clearance service the people who will connect to the banking networks and clear the money for you - will refer to them as spcs is how many widget will you be selling at what cost

100758
put	get
simply put if you buy something on a credit card your card provider is liable for ensure you get what you paid for broadly speaking in most countries does not constitute legal advice etc. and if you have a problem with your purchase they will refund you very quickly and then will go and chase the person that you paid

100760
attributes	properties
you d probably have to loop through the results and reject those with the attributes that you don t want use the attributes properties

100762
tuples	set
otherwise if the object has a __len__ special methods as do container built-ins list dictionary set tuples ... it calls this methods considering a container false if it is empty length is zero

100762
value	field
generally i would recommend to use the first test with non-numerical value to use the test for equality when you want to compare objects of the same nature two strings two numbers ... and to check for identity only when using sentinel value none meaning not initialized for a member field for exemple or when using the getattr or the __getitem__ methods

100795
base-class	inherited
inherited you can t mock the base-class

100802
firefox	opera
opera and ie these days treat getyear as getyear was originally specified for dates before 2000 but will treat it as getfullyear for dates after 2000 while webkit and firefox stick with the old behavior

100802
firefox	opera
this outputs 108 in firefox webkit and 2008 in opera ie

100820
put	get
i managed to get a selection of rowkey objects but can t find out how to get the original objects i put in back

100828
variables	boolean
personally i chose a consistent approach across languages i do if variables or equivalent only if variables is declared as boolean or defined as such in c we don t have a specific type

100838
vb.net	vb6
i wrote basics for years ms-basic gw-basic quick-basic visual basic vbscript and it was very difficult to use vb.net because i always try to write things as i used to do with vb6 or vbscript

100875
expression	evaluation
the difference is that the # symbol specifies a data binding directive that is resolved at data binding time for example when you call page.databind and the sign specifies an evaluation expression just evaluates and prints to the html output when that line is processed

100879
telnet	ssh
spawn command start remote login program telnet ssh netcat etc

100883
derived-class	base-class
presumably you are using the behaviour of the base-class so just test the derived-class as you would normally - calling methods on both the base and derived-class as appropriate for the test

100883
derived-class	base-class
essentially most of the time you test a derived-class as if the base-class is invisible

100919
webforms	asp.net
on the server-side we have asp.net webforms or asp.net mvc

100928
httphandler	httpmodule
however creating your own http module to do something similar is of course trivial -- the onbeginrequest handler could look as follows in this case implementation for a httphandler shown but in a httpmodule the idea is exactly the same

100930
document	element
the populartags element exists in the html document that calls the function

100930
firefox	opera
code for mozilla firefox opera etc

100937
common-lisp	scheme
they are most probably much less mature than any common-lisp or scheme implementation but there are lisp dialects for .net l# and dotlisp

100971
profiling	trace
i would invest in profiling software to trace down the actual cause of the problem

100971
callgrind	valgrind
on linux valgrind which contains cachegrind callgrind + kcachegrind can make working out where all the heavy function calls are going on

100976
http	ssl
if a user clicks on a https link i can block that load in onstarturi of nsiuricontentlistener.but if the user types in say orkut.com i wont know in onstarturi whether its a http url or a https one whether it will use ssl or not

100978
spring	guice
as for spring i would seriously check if guice is a viable alternative and then try to show how spring guice makes development better and easier

100993
web-applications	web-services
i m new to both web-services and rmi and i wonder which is the better way to do remoting between different web-applications when these applications are all written in java that is when different programming languages don t matter which would be the advantage of ws

101033
procedure	records
i want to create a stored procedure with one arguments which will return different sets of records depending on the arguments

101048
contains	elements
that way you are completely sure that your document.getelementsbyid populartags doesn t fail because the scripting is called before the html contains the elements is fully loaded

101048
contains	elements
if that contains non-sequential elements as well you might be facing a problem where the xslt transformation takes place before the objects xml and xsl are fully loaded

101049
spring	guice
there is nothing wrong with this code and you can still use it with dependency injection frameworks like spring and guice

101065
javascript	dom
for instance javascript manipulates dom objects provided by the browser php operates enormous library of c-based functions and so on

101066
any	set
i have set up another question for any task that takes more than a minute or two and so ought to be scheduled into a deployment process

101083
perl	ruby
whereas javascript ruby python perl etc

101114
nested-loops	loops
1 for normal old style small loops - i j k - if you need more than 3 level nested-loops this means that either the algorithm is very specific and complex either you should consider refactoring the code

101130
python	ruby
i mean you can t really say something like python or ruby are scripting languages in this day and age you even have stuff like ironpython and jit-your-favorite-language the difference has been blurred even more

101169
xsd	xml
you can validate that and much more by using an xml schema language like xsd

101194
common-lisp	lisp
when discussing lisp these days it is commonly assumed to be common-lisp the language standardized by ansi x3j13 see the hyperspec and practical common-lisp for a good textbook with implementations such as gnu clisp sbcl cmucl allegrocl and many others

101239
row	col
row and col at first glance this seems more succinct than row_num and col_num and just as descriptive

101239
row	col
irow and icol this conveys extra information since i can mean it s a loop counter while row and col tell you what it s counting

101239
row	col
reads as the row num ber is less than the max imum number of col umn s

101239
row	col
at best reads as the integer loop counter for the row is less than the max imum number of col umn s

101268
default-arguments	arguments
default arguments gotchas dangers of mutable default-argumentss

101270
build-process	msbuild
i want to use vim s quickfix features with the output from visual-studio s devenv build-process or msbuild

101277
init.d	pid
this process always has pid of 1 and controls spawn all other processes in your unix according to the rules in etc init.d

101293
put	get
there are other ways to get the correct resources out of a jar to make sure someone didn t put a duplicate resource on the classpath

101294
linux	bsd
i am more curious about whether there is a demand and i am wondering since the oses we use most today linux windows mac os x free bsd were actually written more than 20 years ago and i am being generous - i mean dual and quad cores did not exist back then buses were much slower hardware was much more expensive etc ... i was just curious with the new technology if we would do anything differently

101310
if-statement	loops
you can append many if-statement to the end of the generator basically replicating nested for loops

101318
gnome	kde
if you are interested in user functionality maybe you should look into participating in existing desktop environment projects such as gnome kde or something

101318
linux	bsd
if you are interested in kernel-level functionality either try hacking on a bsd derivate or on linux or try creating your own system -- but don t think too much about the user functionality then

101334
properties-file	jar
personally i d go for a separate properties-file in your jar that you d load at runtime.

101338
xsd	xml
is it valid to have a choice or group elements when defining an xml schema xsd

101343
pygtk	pyqt
so i would look into pykde pygtk pyqt or python + opengl there are certainly some tutorials on the .net i know of some czech ones but that won t help you

101373
csv	xml
it is very easy to map user input to a database xml or csv file

101373
required	checked
complete required fields one at a time and checked that the warning messages disappear when they are supposed to

101381
binary	hex
that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

101406
space	input
declaring a parameter as a reference just tells the compiler to use the input variables memory space instead of allocating a new memory space during the method call

101428
linux	aix
kernal operating system virtual server instance linux windows server windows home ubuntu aix zseries os 390 et al

101432
hash	md5
for web sites i use supergenpass which derives a site-specific password from a master password and the domain name using a hash function based on md5

101445
postgresql	rdbms
rdbms postgresql is a free relational database with a track record stretching back a couple of decades

101461
decimal	octal
most languages ruby include allow number literals to be written in at least three bases decimal octal and hexadecimal

101499
put	get
of course don t tell anyone which lottery and which draw and put those numbers through a suitable mangle to get the range you want

101507
http	ssl
i would first try to figure out why your application is crashing on http ssl connections

101578
webserver	upload
when i upload the movie to my webserver though it almost behaves as though the moviecliploader.onloadprogress event isn t firing until the very end of the upload because the movie sits there for several seconds downloading with no notification and then there is a sudden burst of activity and my preloader goes from 0 to 100 very rapidly

101598
attributes	properties
you could create a string properties that does the translation to from your timefield field and put the serialization attributes on that instead the the real datetime properties that the rest of the application uses

101623
tokenize	parsing
the first thing i d probably do is separate the tokenize the process of extracting words or other sensible sequences from the duplicate detection logic so that it is easy to plug in different parsing for different languages and keep the duplicate detection piece the same

101628
required	checked
although i haven t used nsis nullsoft scriptable install systemd myself there are install scripting that will checked whether or not the required jre is install on the target systemd

101647
windows-xp	windows
how do you schedule a task in windows-xp to run when you shutdown windows

101656
n-gram	words
basically an n-gram is splitting a words into smaller chunks

101673
selected	cells
is one alternative way of selecteding a range of cells but it s not very user-friendly when you need people to selected multiple ranges of cells on a single form

101673
delphi	vba
the best real alternative i have at the moment is to call a vba form from my delphi add-in but that s far from ideal

101673
delphi	vb6
if there is one it s not easy to find i ve been searching pretty hard and i ve not been able to find a drop-in refedit replacement for delphi vb6 or .net

101673
selected	cells
refedit lets you selected cells without actually selecteding them it uses marching ants around the cells that you choose instead of highlighting them and changing the excel.application.selectedion

101673
delphi	vba
i don t know of a way to do that by manipulating the excel object model through vba delphi or whatever

101701
sniffing	wlan
you will not lose your password for site a if your password for site b gets in the wrong hands due to an evil admin wlan sniffing or site compromise for example yet you will only have to remember a single password

101767
environment	building
i m trying to use cygwin as a building environment under windows

101770
ruby	php
the problem as someone pointed out is the visual basic guys - you know people that came from classic asp experience and never seen any unit testing and or mvc-based java ruby php development

101770
ruby	php
people who came from java ruby php shops who already used to mvc apps will certainly adapt ms mvc framework

101777
contains	any
but is there any pre-set variables that contains the first or second condition of the current if

101789
disposable	dispose
if disposable object is passed to other methods including calling its members when this is implicitly passed the tool should analyse if dispose is not called within or that object is not stored somewhere for later disposal

101789
disposable	dispose
that said naive implementation of checking if disposable object is in fact dispose with using construct or in any other way would yield too much false positives and rendering analysis useless

101798
account	api
we set up an account and got an api key

101801
compact-framework	.net
redfivelabs have implemented the .net compact-framework for the s60 platform

101819
telnet	ssh
i have a setting with ssh no telnet so i can t test if your problem is telnet related but running the following script logs me successively to the different machines asking for a password

101834
oracle	mysql
i ve worked on a variety of systems as a programmer some with oracle some with mysql

101837
selected	button
selected enable this content and click the ok button

101849
display	outline
typing ctrl+o twice in editor when a java type is selected pops-up an outline context dialog that display the members inherited members

101905
minimum	max
the obvious upper bound is max heap size divided by the minimum amount of memory required to service a request but even that is hard to measure in an environment with a garbage collector.

101923
oracle	mysql
its very very robust oracle will do virtually everything it can before breaking your data i ve had mysql servers do really weird things when they run out of disk space oracle will just halt all transactions and eventually shutdown if it can t write the files it needs

101923
oracle	mysql
for a small database i d seriously recommend oracle xe well before mysql

101923
oracle	mysql
mysql has its uses many many people have shown that you can build great things with it but its far behind oracle and sql server and db2 in terms of features.

101927
postgresql	mysql
for small-medium look at mysql or postgresql

101934
oracle	mysql
i have a project that sends data 10m rows 1.2gb of data to three different databases 2 oracle and 1 mysql

101934
oracle	mysql
if you re in a place that already uses oracle for other projects adding on one new database shouldn t be too much of a problem but if you re thinking of setting up a new database server and don t have anything in place already mysql will save you the money

101941
perl	ruby
create a simple perl php python ruby script that serves a bunch of javascript files based on the request

101969
debugging	trace
using this trace method not only would i have to keep adding and removing keywords from in front of variables as i worked on different bugs but i don t think that it would be any real improvement over just adding good logging debugging messaging which is much easier to remove or disable when pushed to production

101984
double-quotes	spaces
the compiler and the coder who added the spaces between the string double-quotes would not agree with that

101988
safari	opera
if every developer had written code for fx safari and opera i think ie had to start following the rules sooner than with version 8

101989
search-engine	web-crawler
i m creating a search-engine which will be evoked during the ejb in session and will use web-crawler thru the dto s and get the snapshot in xml format

102018
bibtex	latex
if you re doing any serious work with latex you ll find make very handy because of the need to re-interpret .tex files several times when using bibtex or tables of contents

102022
required	checked
it is best used for activities that required dependency checkeding but there is no reason you couldn t use make to checked your email reboot your servers make backups or anything else

102022
msbuild	nant
ant nant and msbuild are supposedly the modern alternatives but plain-old-make is still used extensively in environments that don t use java or .net

102041
msbuild	nant
and while more people may be using msbuild ant nant and others tools these days they are essentially just make with a different file syntax

102055
google-chrome	firefox
this works in both google-chrome and firefox but not in ie

102093
wordpress	blogs
i wrote a small php application several months ago that uses the wordpress xmlrpc library to synchronize two separate wordpress blogs

102094
macports	homebrew
there are different cases depending on whether you install mysql with the official binary install using macports or using homebrew

102116
value	field
for single on off checkbox drupal will use the on label specified in the allowed value field

102146
conditional	operators
if conditional and coalesce operators

102146
conditional	operators
vb 9 has the if operators which is much better and works exactly as c# s conditional and coalesce operators depending on what you want

102214
debugging	trace
if you debugging the debuggingger for instance using logger.exe to trace all api calls made by windbg.exe it appears that the debuggingger uses suspendthread resumethread to suspend all of the threads in the process being debuggingged

102261
firefox	safari
firebug works great in firefox which isn t having this problem nor is safari so i m hoping someone might spot something obviously wrong with the way my code will play with ie

102261
firefox	safari
single clicks collapse and expand tables in firefox safari but ie tables require multiple clicks a seemingly arbitrary number between 1 and 5 to expand

102277
checkbox	button
it sounds like you might be better off with radio button or if it s an explicit on off type of situation using a checkbox

102294
network-drive	intranet
just about anything on your local hard-drive is trusted but and supposedly they fixed this for 3.5sp1 even the local intranet is not trusted so most .net desktop apps will fail to even start if they re sitting on a network-drive or share

102325
windows-xp	windows
i know that it work on windows-xp windows 2003 and also windows vista

102349
value	field
for records that are essentially lookup value we use the active bit field

continuous-integration	build-server
i have just installed a build-server with a 64 bit windows-server 2008 for continuous-integration

102380
virtual-functions	member-functions
you can recreate the functionality of virtual-functions in c++ using function pointerss as members of a class and static functions as the implementations or using pointers to member-functions and member-functions for the implementations

102398
priority-queue	heap
i am looking for a .net implementation of a priority-queue or heap data structure

102398
key-value	key
whose key-value is smaller than any other key in the priority-queue

102462
javascript	dom
lots of good answers here about learning ajax or javascript dom as a standalone entity but the cgi ajax module from cpan is the quickest easiest way to set yourself up to have a webpage which uses ajax to update a page on-the-fly using a perl backend

102462
javascript	dom
it requires no knowledge of dom xml json or any language other than perl a little html and the barest hint of javascript

102464
webserver	host
is their a way to access a webserver such as windows-server 2003 installed on a virtual box such as vmware from the host machine

102468
combinations	permutation
dug up some information about permutation and combinations but no luck

102471
vb.net	vb6
title case in vb.net can be achieved by an old vb6 fxn

102476
stream	send
obviously this isn t that tricky file uploads generate unique urls send email stream files

102484
spaces	output
if the output was truncated due to this limit then the return-value is the number of characters not including the trailing 0 which would have been written to the final string if enough spaces had been available

102494
tar	cat
tar cf - directory | ssh username hostname cat output.tar

102494
tar	cat

102515
pdf	xmp
embedding xmp metadata in application files pdf

102516
order	add
i believe you ll need to add the user-controls to the placeholder during the init phase of the page life cycle in order to get the viewstate to be filled in by the load phase to read those values

102521
subtract	add
what is the best way to add subtract and traverse quarters

102544
perl	ruby
i found something that showed me how to do this with perl and ported it over to ruby

102548
exif	xmp
you can use the almighty exiftool perl utility which handles nearly every known set of tags both standard exif iptc adobe s xmp etc and proprietary ones

102561
attributes	properties
it treats attributes access and object properties access as the same thing so because the dom properties for the class attributes is called classname you would have to use that instead on ie

102580
shutdown	restart
shutdown -r -t 0 - restart

102587
checkbox	button
as an example i have a simple login page with the standard username and password text boxes and the log in button and a remember me checkbox with a i can t remember my username and or password hyperlink

102594
updating	updates
in the long run updating old as2 code on projects that are still active and being updates themselves is a great idea as3 is just a better language and avm2 is just straight up faster than avm1

102595
arrays	loops
to produce the results loops through the results arrays printing them or whatever

102605
ip-address	hostname
i would like to use client-side javascript to perform a dns lookup hostname to ip-address as seen from the client s computer

102640
any	set
so essentially does margin collapsing occur when you don t set any margin or padding or border to a given div element

102643
aes	rsa
i would use aes for the bulk data encryption and rsa for encrypting the aes key

102657
scriptmanager	updatepanel
edit - i added a scriptmanager control and wrapped the button in an updatepanel however now i m receiving the following error

102670
ip-address	hostname
i recommend hosting a cgi-bin which looks up the ip-address of a hostname and access that via javascript

102684
32-bit	x86
the processor natively executes 32-bit x86 code

102686
hide	show
ctrl + r show hide results panels

102690
gethashcode	equals
then we can make two instances of some reference-type which are actually equals because of the overloaded gethashcode and equalss

102690
gethashcode	equals
for complicated dictionary keys you must override equals and gethashcode correctly

102716
put	get
you get a root page via a http get parsing it to find urls and put them on a queue unless they ve been parsing already so you need a global record of pages you have already parsing

102717
extjs	gxt
i m working on a project right now that uses extjs gwt gxt not to be confused with gwt extjs

102717
extjs	gxt
anyways gxt is still somewhat immature and lacks a solid community that i feel gwt extjs has

102717
extjs	gxt
however the future is with gxt as it s native gwt and actually developed by the company that made extjs

102717
extjs	gxt
for more information on extjs gwt gxt

102736
margins	padding
the expression collapsing margins means that adjoining margins no non-empty content padding or border areas or clearance separate them of two or more boxes which may be next to one another or nested combine to form a single margin.

102744
contains	set
f# language you could reference the fsharp.core.dll that contains a set of generic immutable

102746
properties-file	jar
you could make a separate properties-file outside the jar for passwords either direct db password or or key passphrase and not include that properties-file with the distribution

102752
getter	setter
the sqldataadapter implements idbdataadapter which has getter setter for all the crud commands

102755
any	set
if you don t set any margins then there won t be any margins to collapse

102756
localization	translation
managing localization and translation using .rc files and visual-studio is not a good idea

102757
value	field
internal field in the system.object class to generate the hash value

102758
compression	streaming
when compression a string streaming the r gets stripped out from r n

102763
select	union
they may preclude indexes from being used although that would be affecting the union select version as well

102788
crypt	md5
a hashing function md5 sha1 crypt etc is not suitable as i would like to be able to decrypt the information as well

102801
data-visualization	charts
i need a framework for generating charts for data-visualization

102825
triggers	insert
to avoid the to_be_deleted where-clause you could create a triggers before the delete command fires off to insert the deleted rows into a separate table

102832
seam	jsf
how do i induce seam jsf to use get and include the query expression as a parameter rather than post the default

102836
gethashcode	equals
don t override gethashcode and equals on mutable classes only override it on immutable classes or structures else if you modify a object used as key the hashtable won t function properly anymore you won t be able to retrieve the value associated to the key after the key object was modified

102862
emacs	vim
on the mac or nix you can use command line or gui versions of emacs or vim

102920
linux	unix
for example if your application server runs on linux unix as root then make the password properties file owned by root with 400 -r-------- permissions

102924
actionscript	mxml
that is also how it is done behind the scenes when the mxml in your example is transformed to actionscript before being compiled

102924
actionscript	mxml
...except that the code generated by the mxml to actionscript conversion is longer as it has to be more general

102972
selected	button
selected the security tab then the edit button and add full control for yourself

102977
google-chrome	safari
because google-chrome uses the webkit to render html you can be assured if it works in safari it ll work under google-chrome however it s rendering engine isn t up to scratch quite yet

102984
pointers	stack
if you want to avoid stack observer objects that just contains a dummy you have to do some kind of bookkeeping but this could boil down to something trivial like an object holding a pointers to the observer object he needs from the list

102995
google-chrome	firefox
i use firefox mostly and have google-chrome for the other websites at work

102997
ncover	fxcop
cruisecontrol.net will be automatically pulling the source from visual source safe ok it isn t subversion but we can deal compiling it and then running it through fxcop nunit ncover and last but not lease simian

103003
contains	elements
this is a special pcl file that does not contains certain elements such as formfeed etc

103005
contains	set
table one contains a set of data that uses an id for an unique identifier

103009
any	set
html lets you set a tfoot element which will sit at the bottom of any data you have therefore you could just set the total separately from the person objects and output it on the page as-is without any computation on the jsp page

103010
google-chrome	firefox
i switched to google-chrome and haven t looked back except for the occasional site which doesn t work properly forcing me to load it in firefox

103016
signals	sigpipe
i could for sure program a signals handler in my program and ensure it terminate but i m more looking for some environment variables or a shell option that would force programs to terminate on sigpipe

103045
javascript	dom
user the javascript xml dom objects to create an xml document client side

103045
javascript	dom
sent it to the server with xmlhttprequest and then process the result again using the javascript xml dom objects

103053
google-chrome	firefox
but i definately now make sure sites i work on render well in google-chrome as well as firefox latest versions of ie safari konquerer and opera

103079
signals	sigpipe
well if there is an attempt to write to a pipe after the reader has gone away a sigpipe signals gets generated

103117
aes	rsa
assuming that you have a safe way of sharing a key whether rsa encryption of it retrieval over an ssh or http link or callling the other developer on a secured phone line any of the major modern encryptions like aes as mentioned by ed haber would be suitable

103117
ruby	php
there should be libraries for php vb ruby etc

103127
environment	building
having a codeigniter building automatically deploy to an environment really doesn t fall under the control of a building-server

103134
uniform	points
the easiest representation i ve seen to work with is a points plotted on the globe on a grid systemd that has its origin through the centering of the earth. thus a nice positioning vector. the problem with this is that while it s easy to use the data getting it into and out of the systemd correctly can be tough because the earth is not round or for that matter uniform

103146
cocos2d-x	tiled
as a companion to pyglet i have used and would also suggest cocos2d-x which adds scene management improved sprites tiled map support and fancy accelerated effects to add a little polish

103166
any	set
is this web app set below any other apps in a website s directory tree

103174
ironpython	ironruby
if you re an ms developer have you found a niche in your world for other languages like f# ironruby ironpython or something similar and what niche do they fill

103188
python	ruby
see ruby or python

103189
version-control	git
i believe that strating point is with distributed version-control system like mercurial or git

103189
revision	svn
you can modify revision history rebase git supports it easilly what is impossible to do with svn

103202
recording	playing
is there a good eclipse plugins for recording and playing back macros

103203
configuration	environment
these passwords won t change because then our partners would have to make coding configuration changes to change them and coordinating password expirations with hundreds of partners for multiple environment would be a nightmare and they don t have to be entered by a human or human readable

103205
any	set
note i ve set this up for the more usual 0-based but given you an optional parameter to start at 1 or any other integer

103258
having	select
it allows the select command to complete without having to wait - usually other transactions to finish

103285
double	int
any other cast will not work trying to unbox an int to a double and will result in a compile time runtime error depending on the situation and what can be detected by static type checking

103290
environment	building
if you are working with a middleware environment like torque or unity3d they include a gui framework to building on

103290
silverlight	wpf
wpf and silverlight look promising for this purpose but so far haven t been set up for game integration

103292
perl	ruby
python perl ruby powershell are great supplements to c# vb.net

103292
perl	ruby
if your boss hands you a text file and says insert it into the database once or twice then any of perl python ruby i m not sure about powershell but i imagine it is not that much more difficult should be fine to parse it

103292
perl	ruby
ms in the future has plans to use powershell a lot more so it is probably easier to justify powershell then say python perl ruby

103292
perl	ruby
it is much harder to argue learning perl ruby python in a microsoft shop

103323
message	alert
gives you an illusion of a team - only the rest of them are pop up message boxes and ding alert

103325
contains	elements
given this xml what xpath returns all elements whose prop attributes contains foo the first three nodes

103332
defined	declare
and others will declare and defined constant variables in the same compilation unit

103367
selected	checkbox
i selected the enable just my code option and verified that the user-unhandled checkbox on the exceptions dialog was selected for all of the exception categories

103372
iteration	tuples
then the argument to your function is a non-const tuples and get will allow you to make the necessary assignments once you ve written the iteration using the information provided in previous responses

103374
global-assembly-cache	gac
but this file isn t normaly available but only install in the gac global-assembly-cache

103384
synchronized	futuretask
in any case as you probably know terracotta gives you the ability to express concurrency across the cluster the same way you do in a single jvm by using pojo synchronized wait notify or by using any of the java.util.concurrent primitive such as reentrantreadwritelock cyclicbarrier atomiclong futuretask and so on

103391
file-access	filesystems
it helps a bit to deactivate the ntfs filesystems feature to keep track of the last file-access

103392
global-assembly-cache	gac
normally i would guess the dll would be registered in the system-wide global-assembly-cache gac so you wouldn t have to know the actual path for it

103399
ssas	ssis
ssis ssrs ssas

103401
tuples	any
there don t seem to be any real ways of packing unpacking tuples except using the typesystem s only variadic-templates handling

103417
document	element
this will search you all a elements in your entire xml document regardless of being nested in a blah element

103445
signals	sigpipe
as daniel has mentioned sigpipe is not a magic your pipe went away signals but rather a nice try you can no longer read write that pipe signals

103517
persistence	hibernate
lazy loading is the big gotcha in asp.net-mvc applications that use hibernate for their persistence framework

103521
cryptography	security
there are good resources out there such as applied cryptography by bruce schneier and security engineering by ross anderson available for free online

103564
subclassing	base-class
for example i have a base-class with 10 subclassing

103564
base-class	subclass
in a single function that takes the base-class i do checks for if the class is an instance of the subclass and carry out some routine

103564
primitive	int
one of the other ways i thought of solving it was to use a type id int primitive instead and use a bitmask to represent categories of the subclasses and then just do a bit mask comparison of the subclasses type id to a constant mask representing the category

103591
cursor	row
doing some tests if you connect to a database even with a slow dynamic language like perl and perform some row by row operation on a dataset the speed will still be much greater than a cursor in the database

103598
safari	opera
others safari opera have adopted support for it but support on older browsers is unreliable

103602
subclassing	base-class
generally the reason why the instanceof operators is frowned upon in a case like that where the instanceof is checking for subclassing of this base-class is because what you should be doing is moving the operations into a methods and overridding it for the appropriate subclassing

103633
contains	set
pascal s rule on counting the subset s of a set works great when the set contains unique entities

103633
duplicates	contains
is there a modification to this rule for when the set contains duplicates items

103634
tuples	set
also from a purist perspective the table should be named person not people as the name of the relation reflects a tuples not the entire set

103637
callback	methods
any uncaught exception-handling are run through whatever callback methods you specify

103645
error-handling	try-catch
generally i believe that error-handling with try-catch finally is always common-sense also for showing only a error-page

103648
http	ssl
i m unclear why transmitting the passwords over ssl -- via http -- is being considered insecure by your audit team

103651
contains	set
a set only contains unique items

103679
arrays	map
jsdiff uses vanilla objects as associative arrays to map a word from the text to another object

103702
duplicates	contains
even though mathematical sets do contains unique items you can run into the problem of duplicates items in sets in the real world of programming

103711
unsigned-integer	int
given an unsigned int 0 is 0 or 360 degrees and the max 32-bit unsigned-integer 0xffffffff is the biggest value just below 360 degrees

103723
library-project	libs
the problem is this - in order to have add a flexbuilder project to the libs path for an application it must be a libs-project

103757
order-of-evaluation	operators
know the precedence of the main operators so you don t have to litter your code with parens to avoid getting the wrong order-of-evaluation

103758
selected	button
then selected add or remove button

103767
duplicates	elements
without duplicates in a set as earlier posters have noted each elements is either in or out of the subset

103767
duplicates	elements
with duplicates in a multi-set you have to take into account the number the number of times each elements is in the sub-multi-set

103768
http-basic-authentication	put
if you only allow http you can take the password out of the document completely and put it into an http-basic-authentication header instead

103768
http	ssl
http basic authentication is simple widely supported and will be much easier for you and your partners to implement than ssl client certificates

103773
contains	any
embeddedresourceprefix is the string path to the embedded resource it will usually be the name of the assembly followed by any folder structure contains the resource mycomapny.myproduct.myassembly.resources if the dll is in a folder called resources in the project

103816
contains	set
because this is a new request for your page the page utilises the text which is contains in your markup as i assume that the label text is being set inside a button handler or similar

103823
web-services	webserver
if you web reference the url for web-services that are on the built-in webserver the port might change

103869
bazaar	git
after getting comfortable with the way svn works then you can get into distributed version control systems like git bazaar or mercurial but i ve seen enough professional developers have problems wrapping their heads around the basics of version control branching merging etc that i d get comfortable with that first before moving to distributed systems

103871
double	int
both of these cast the int value to a double

103895
nested-loops	loops
even though the body of loops is at the start of the listcomp the order of nested-loops and if clauses is still the same as when you would write loops out

103910
union-all	union
be careful to use union-all not a simple union as that will omit the duplicates

103910
having	union
the union and having statements tend to be the most overlooked part of standard sql but they can solve a lot of tricky issues that otherwise require procedural code

103928
json	xml
so if your java server has a point where it can listen to incoming requests and process xml or json your flash client can just make the request to that url

103941
selenium-ide	selenium
if you ve never used selenium watch some of the screencasts for using selenium-ide

103945
display	width
the only problem is that when the text is long the width of the menu is not being adjusted properly and the text is being truncated when display

103960
linux	osx
your best bet if you really need more than 1.2g of memory for your java app is to look at 64 bit windows or linux or osx

103960
32-bit	64bit
if you re using any kind of native libraries with your app you ll have to recompile them for 64bit but its going to be a lot easier than trying to rebase dlls and stuff to maximize the memory you can get on 32-bit windows

103979
any	set
also if you have one main windows and set its icon properly as long as you use that main windows as the parent for any dialog classes they will inherit the icon

103979
any	set
any new frames need to have the icon set on them though

103989
value	field
my current approach uses a map of all tuples field values as keys for lists of each tuples using that value

104023
command-line	cmd
so what happens is when you type the cmd directly into the cmd-line the escape character is not the result of a previous expansion so bash removes it before sending it to the echo cmd but in the 2nd example the was the result of a previous parameter expansion so it is not removed

104057
windows-xp	windows
recently i ve started having a problem with my sql-server 2005 client running on windowss-xp where right-clicking on any job and selecting properties instead brings me to the new job windows

104082
version-control	git
distributed version-control systems dvcs such as mercurial and git enable you to do more complex operations on your repository

104091
duplicates	elements
so you have c 3 4 4 ways of doing it with no duplicates elements

104096
base-class	inherited
have all the exposed classes inherited from a common base-class

104096
dynamic-cast	base-class
when accepting a handle to a function first cast to the base-class then dynamic-cast to the class you re expecting

104113
external	host
if you use an external host make frequent backups of the repository that you keep control of

104123
connection-pooling	pool
one problem with only closing the connection and not the result set is that if your connection management code is using connection-pooling the connection.close would just put the connection back in the pool

104139
javascript	dom
long story short innerhtml is much much faster than dom even on modern javascript engines

104148
triggers	insert
the main culprits in insert slow downs are indexes constraints and oninsert triggers

104151
duplicates	elements
those elements of b which are also in a will have duplicates and the other elements won t

104151
tuples	sorted
if these tuples can stay sorted then the sorting cost is only incurred once

104160
version-control	bazaar
bazaar is a good version-control system

104191
required	checked
so stroustrup would not have wanted to mandate that integers behave in a way which required any explicit checked

104197
duplicates	elements
these are usually relied upon for for instance inserting an elements into a list where no duplicates are allowed and some of your framework stuff may not work if this operator is overloaded in a non-standard way

104207
gethashcode	equals
if you implement iequatable t you should also override the base-class implementations of objectequals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the iequatable t equals methods

104223
double-quotes	single-quotes
r n is not parsing the way i expected when put in single-quotes switching to double-quotes solved my problem

104227
lisp	tcl
it looks like the the actual data for the image is stored by the tcl tk interpreter and not accessible from within lisp

104227
canvas	pixel
of course you could simply render each pixel individually on a canvas object but i don t think you would get very good performance doing that the canvas widget gets a bit slow once you are trying to display more than a few thousand different things on it

104245
shell	bash
if nothing else bash shell still use 0 for true and 1 for false

104251
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
this means that while its okay to read from a hashmap in a multithreading situation i d definitely use a concurrenthashmap if there were multiple writes

104254
user-input	output
today i m trying to use the java.io.console class to manage output and more importantly user-input

104260
xsd	xml
xml - xsd - vb

104264
cassini	iis
all the previous responses are great answers - here s one gottcha with cassini that might require iis on the destkop

104264
cassini	iis
cassini runs in the context of the developer not as the iis user iusr_ iwam or in winxp x64 the w3wp process

104264
cassini	iis
when you move to the server iis something that you would have had access to in cassini doesn t work the same

104288
constructor	object
having non-trivial constructor in a deep inheritance tree can slow down object creation when every creation of a child results in function calls to all the parent constructor all the way up to the base

104292
directory	folder
my project builds fine on my development machine as the source is only two folder deep but tf build seems to use a really deep directory that is causing it to break

104292
directory	folder
currently my working directory is temp builddefinitionpath but now i don t know what wildcards are available to specify a different folder

104316
convention	standards
in code we could then refer to the table in a more for us standards naming convention

104360
directory	folder
once done flex will create a generated directory in your source folder and inside you ll find all teh temporary as files that were used during compilation

104375
if-statement	loops
i have not found anything on try catch performance on google but a simple test with a loops throwing error instead of a if-statement produce 329ms vs 6ms in a loops of 5000

104381
versioning	upgrade
that said almost every computer online has some form of the flash player though it might not be the needed versioning 9 for flex apps it can easily be upgrade through a simple click in the browser

104394
linux	unix
but i guess unix linux whateveros have the same gizmo functions

104394
linux	unix
anyway in unix linux they have the everything is a file

104394
inherited	subclass
having to subclass a winproc when you re more familiar with object inherited is head-splitting and less than optimal

104395
margins	padding
i need some info on how to use margins and how exactly padding works

104395
display	width
for example should i put a line to occupy the whole width of the page no matter what resolution is used to display the web page letting just a small border on each side how could i achieve this

104398
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
be warned that even in single-threaded code replacing a concurrenthashmap with a hashmap may not be safe

104398
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
this answer is intended to point out that even aside from concurrency issues there is at least one api difference between concurrenthashmap and hashmap which could scupper even a single-threaded program which replaced one with the other.

104401
margins	padding
basically an element consists of content surrounded by its padding then the border then the margins

104403
python	c++
i m currently needing to be able to read java and c++ but i can t really program in them and i ve hacked python as well

104406
required	checked
if you do something along the lines of sign hash unique_computer_id+when_to_expire and let the app checked with a public key that your server has signed the expiry date it should required a real hack to bypass

104423
enterprise	legacy
i already did that for a legacy database using enterprise architect

104435
chip	fpga
i started on basic stamps moved up through sx chip and pics into 8051s then 68332s various dsps fpga soft processor etc

104473
extends	final
and sadly since console is final you can t extends it to create a a wrapper around system.in and system.out that does it either

104510
malloc	free
the c and jni code can allocate memory as well malloc free new etc which is outside of the vm s 256m

104516
buffering	streaming
the latter has the disadvantage that the output is directly put into the output streaming unless i m using output buffering which might not be what i want

104549
internet-explorer	firefox
the community version supports only firefox the professional one also supports internet-explorer

104563
document	element
you can define css at three levels external embedded in the document inside a style tag or inline on the element

104580
ip-address	hostname
this is a bit similar to specifying an ip-address versus a hostname

104599
integer	numeric
if the two strings it is comparing are the same at the beginning and end of the string are the same and the middle part that differs is an integer then compare based on the numeric values of those integers

104603
attributes	properties
at the moment i have an attributes set on all of my properties with an iscollection flag set to true on the properties that are collections

104617
udp	tcp
i m using udp not tcp at this time

104618
put	get
i ve been trying to get into f# on and off for a while but i keep getting put off

104620
oracle	mysql
i ve seen a litany of them for sql server a few for mysql and oracle but nothing that supports sql anywhere correctly

104622
snmp	arp
if you haven t already try hp openview trial versioning and apart of using snmp it also uses arp tables to figure out your topology

104627
order	add
add a preprocessing step that normalises your input xml into a particular order and then use

104683
specifications	w3c
magnar is correct as explained by the w3c specifications pasted below

104683
specifications	w3c
w3c css specifications

104727
configuration	environment
scp will do the job but there is one wrinkle the connection to the second remote destination will use the configurationuration on the first remote destination so if you use .ssh configuration on the local environment and you expect rsa and dsa keys to work you have to forward your agent to the first remote host

104742
required	checked
if the crash is due to missing imports from the .bpl files required by your application there is no way short of rewriting the delphi rtl and linker themselves to checked for those packages from within the crashing executable itself

104749
32-bit	x86
i think you may be able to install the normal 32-bit mdac but it will install to the x86 folder

104770
mousemove	mousedown
you can make more than one movieclip dragging at once using events mousedown mousemove and mouseup

104813
shell	bash
this is used in the sh ksh bash shell interpreters within the if while until commands to check conditions

104850
parentheses	braces
i would try using regex but since the guid can be parentheses wrapped braces wrapped none wrapped makes it hard

104855
contains	any
any variables beginning with an underscore is a private member of the class that contains this code

104877
postgresql	mysql
just for completeness since mysql and postgresql have already been mentioned with sqlite use pragma table_info

104890
.net	csla
i read an article by rocky lhotka .net legend inventor of csla etc where he mentioned almost in passing that last year he felt very terribly overwheled by the rate of change

104915
default	reset
many web based email services dont provide any real security either and even if they offer ssl its often not default and you are still relying on the weakness of the email password to protect the user which in turn has a reset mechanism most the time

104942
required	checked
also checked what the required fields-for organizationalperson and person are...you might be missing one

104948
constructor	object
you ll need to associate the parameters with the command object either by constructor or setter injection or equivalent

104952
output	mode
it would be nice if the code-coverage tool compensated for this i suppose by scanning the source and matching it up with the linker output but i didn t find anything to suggest it has a special mode to be turned on

104960
postgresql	mysql
edit i d like to be free to choose from postgresql mysql and sqlite as far as the actual databases go

104966
put	get
make sure all of your passwords are out of source control if you have database.yml mail.yml if you use yaml_mail_config or other sensitive files in source control get them out of there replace them with database.yml.example and put them in the shared folder on your server

104967
tokenize	parsing
the flex scanner tokenize the input and passes the tokens to the bison parsing

104967
tokenize	parsing
second scanner tokenize the server-side script section of the input file from the open tag and passes the token to the parsing which has no need to know about the markup in the file

104967
tokenize	parsing
basically the first scanner only differentiates between markup which is returned directly to the browser unmodified and code which is passed to the second scanner which in turn tokenize the code and passes the tokens to the parsing

104979
linear-programming	branch-and-bound
on my linear-programming course we used at least branch-and-bound

105005
row	col
to disable editing on any cell you need to override the iscelleditable int row int col methods

105010
oracle	mysql
a novice but competent dba should be able to secure mysql much more easily than oracle just because oracle is inherently more complex

105010
oracle	mysql
of course oracle has the enterprise monitoring tools beyond what mysql currently features as far as i ve seen but the dba needs to be able use them to be effective

105067
instances	private
for instances an encryption library might hide the fact that it performs block encryption with a private methods that encrypts only 8 bytes at a time

105067
instances	private
i would write a unit test for that - it s not meant to change even though it s hidden and if it does break due to future performance enhancements for instances then i want to know that it s the private function that broke not just that one of the public functions broke

105082
output	mode
it simply output to buffer when in markup mode and then switches to parsing when in code mode

105082
python	java
it also supports many languages java c# c python actionscript and has an excellent book and a very good website that should be able to get you up and running in no time

105105
binaries	install
oracle even replaced system binaries gcc in usr bin when i install in on an occation

105121
debugging	trace
is there any way to capture the trace statements of your flex app while not running in debugging mode

105147
click	mouse
i figure i d do this with javascript by attaching listeners to click mouse moves and key-ups but i worry about messing with other scripting

105217
order	join
you can selected the member list given the stored order by using an inner join

105246
margins	padding
it s important to note that inline elements cannot be assigned their own width height or vertical whitespace margins padding top bottom

105252
cpu-architecture	32-bit
edit for clarity i have to translate binary data double-precision floating point values and 32-bit and 64-bit integers from one cpu-architecture to another

105266
keyboard	mouse
javascript looking for mouse movement keyboard activity and scrolling

105287
mstest	nunit
although several codeigniter tools such as teamcodeigniterty have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

105287
32-bit	64bit
in my current project we use both and the only big difference we found is that mstest always runs as a 32-bit while nunit runs as either 32-bit or 64bit test which only matters if your code uses native code that is 32 64 dependant

105303
iprincipal	iidentity
another disadvantage i ve run into is on a forms authentication website using custom iprincipal iidentity

105303
cassini	iis
check this blog post for more.the headache on this made me drop cassini and stick with iis

105339
double	int
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

105380
selected	cell
the paramaters to this method include the current value as well as the cell coordinates a link back to the table and wether or not the cell is selected

105391
jar	war
that means that if your project depends on jar a and a depends on jar b jar b will automatically be bundled with your war even though you don t explicitly list it as a dependency in your build configuration

105395
shell	bash
i started with the cygwin.bat batch file that launches the cygwin bash shell and modified it like so

105395
shell	bash
oh yeah when i created the .bat file in a bash shell in cygwin i noticed i had to actually chmod +x test.bat before i could launch it with a double-click

105481
any	set
you can set any attributes on the view class in a similar way

105507
pointers	stack
you ve allocated arr in foo but that pointers value is stored in the call stack

105514
configuration	environment
even better would be to inject the appropriate values for a given environment into the configuration during the build process assuming your build process has some kind of macro-replacement functionality

105514
configuration	environment
this way you can create a targeted build for a given environment and not have to change the configuration every time you do a build for a different environment

105520
difference	zero
most likely the performance difference is either zero or so small it doesn t matter it s just a matter of preference

105532
constructor	private
i don t think they have a place in the constructor or ms should got back and refactor them to allow you to use them in a private fasion

105532
constructor	object
with object initializers you allow the values passed into the constructor to be modifiable

105535
virtual-machine	vmware
i have a vmware virtual-machine that is coming dangerously close to it s primarry hdd s limit and i need to extend it

105542
bundler	gem
first install haml as a gem in bundler by adding this to your gemfile

105545
silverlight	wpf
asa graphics designer i ve used flash on and off over the last few years and silverlight and its big brother wpf over the last 1.5 years

105545
silverlight	wpf
get them a copy of expression blend the gui development tool for silverlight wpf

105546
wamp	php
i created an online programming contest web app called codefire on xampp later i had to switch to wamp where none of the php scripts worked properly.

105556
xsd	xml
is there a simple way to generate sql schema using the xsd file describing these xml documents

105570
cargo	maven
maven can also help you in integration tests on tomcat if you have some since you can start stop or deploy a war using the cargo plugin

105579
any	set
any of these setups can be stable robust and secure if its properly set up

105611
logging	trace
if so you can write your own logging wrapper class that propagates log messages sent to it to several targets like the trace stack and internal memory so that you can access the log from within the app and send it to a server when the user agrees to send a bug report

105611
logging	trace
this sort of a change of course means that you d have to translate all trace commands in your code into calls to the logging system but that can be easily achieved with a regex search replace

105613
contains	elements
so the resulting dataset would contains the lizard and pig elements from this example

105625
groovy	java
if you ve only done groovy so far you ll be surprised how well documented swing and the rest of the java api is and how well everything is integrated

105634
if-statement	loops
have an enum variable to store the current state and implement the processing as a loops over the records with a switch or if-statement to select the action to take based on the current state and the input data

105639
base-class	subclass
you subclass the standard generated directiveprocessor base-class and override

105647
configuration	environment
in fact i d suggest using a different configuration file for each environment

105660
installation	building
if you can afford to building the process that updates these variables things during the installation of your product -- do it

105661
value	field
as a rule of thumb indexes should be on any fields that you use in joins or where clauses if they have enough different value to make using an index worthwhile field with only a few possible value doesn t benefit from an index which is why it is pointless to try to index a bit field

105708
contains	lookup
this methods contains a lot of approximations like using integers and lookup tables instead of floats and floating point divisions

105710
scala	java
i ve been looking at scala which compiles to the jvm and can use the java libraries and f# which is .net but these are young and have some inefficiencies

105710
haskell	scala
is it possible to build a web service using haskell ml or any of the other more traditional functional languages or would it be better to go with scala or f#

105716
export	report
users of my web app need to edit and save as their report and then execute and export them to pdf or excel files

105725
perl	ruby
while solutions in interpreted languages like perl php ruby etc might be easy.

105737
calloc	free
the concept you are missing here is that for every calloc there must be a free

105737
calloc	free
and that free must be applied to the pointers passed back from calloc

105753
digits	zero
it takes the last two digits of the year and pads the left side with zero to a maximum of 2 characters

105788
postgresql	oracle
coming back to postgresql after several years of oracle .

105798
command-prompt	cmd
to run these cmd open up a command-prompt in windows and cd to the directory where the mysql.exe executable is you may have to look around a bit for it it ll depend on how you installed mysql standalone or as part of a package like wamp

105804
user-permissions	administration
you can then use the mysql administration gui download here and update user-permissions so you can log in from other systems on the network

105817
terminate	timeout
if you have solid proof using the query plan that the query can t be executed any faster than that then you should increase the timeout there s no other way to keep the connection that s the purpose of the timeout to terminate the connection if the query doesn t complete in that time frame

105842
directory-structure	filesystems
how about anything involving a directory-structure in the filesystems

105846
digits	zero
with a 3-digits year 207 208 which the author may have assumed to be typos it would return the last digits padded with a zero -- 207 - 07

105855
traversal	parent
recursion is one way to traversal this model when you want to find all parent or all child elements

105898
command-prompt	cmd
to run these cmd open up a command-prompt in windows and cd to the directory where the mysql.exe executable is you may have to look around a bit for it it ll depend on how you installed mysql standalone or as part of a package like wamp

105902
binary-search	quicksort
but recursion is also a nice natural way of creating tree structures on the fly in some way by divide-and-conquer for instance quicksort or binary-search

105930
triggers	insert
triggers code because it must run everytime the data is updated must be efficient and must account for multiple record insert

105955
data-structures	tree
all recursive data-structures linked lists tree graphs etc. are also more easily handled with recursion

105981
moss	wss
the 2 flavors are windows sharepoint services wss and microsoft office sharepoint server moss

105981
moss	wss
while moss only extends upon the wss it does add a large amount of functionality that can be very important and useful to a business

105981
moss	wss
some of the more important features available in moss and not in wss are records management document retention and auditing policies browser based forms infopath forms without installing infopath on client machine and some of the business intelligence capabilities

105981
moss	wss
easy to read list of features not in wss that moss has

106009
value	field
the compiler is free to read the field this.done just once and reuse the cached value in each execution of the loop

106018
extended-ascii	codepages
sometimes there s a manual bit-manipulation hack to convert the character from upper ascii to the appropriate unicode char but since the ellipsis wasn t in most of the widely used extended-ascii codepages that s unlikely to work here

106018
put	get
put your value into a byte arrays then getstring to get the c# native string for the character

106031
python	java
this is easy in languages like smalltalk or python that support lambdas and closures but is still doable in java with a bit of imagination

106045
linux	unix
currently the communication is over unix domain sockets linux is the expected server platform

106052
value	field
if you add a calculated field to a piviot table and make the formula simply be the name of the field you need a duplicates of that allows you to use the same field twice the calculated field does have to be a value field

106056
attributes	properties
in visual-studio 2005 you can set the clrthreadattributes sta compiler option in configuration properties linker advanced to set the threading attributes to sta without needing to create a new entry point

106066
environment	building
so if you are in a microsoft-tool environment as well i can say that i use this very sucesfully to building dynamic sql and yet protect my parameters

106086
callback	methods
in matlab 2008a is there a way to allow a class methods to act as a uicontrol callback function without having to make the methods public

106086
callback	methods
however if i set the methods s access to private or protected the callback doesn t work

106120
double-quotes	single-quotes
r n is not parsing the way i expected when put in single-quotes switching to double-quotes solved my problem

106168
mbunit	nunit
also if you lack a plugins such as testdriven.net you cannot debugging your nunit or mbunit xunit etc. unit tests within the visual-studio environment as you can with the microsoft vs testing framework which is built in

106179
ip-address	hostname
does anyone have a regular expression handy that will match any legal dns hostname or ip-address

106186
data-structures	tree
anything program with tree or graph data-structures will likely have some recursion

106252
stderr	stdout
if by logging you mean system.out.println or system.err.println and if you re sure that your test really doesn t need the logs then you can redirect stdout and stderr programmatically

106281
python	ruby
if they already know actionscript then use flash if they know c# vb.net javascript ruby or python then use silverlight

106286
margins	padding
remember when two elements are vertically adjacent and they don t have a border or padding between them their margins collapse

106318
arrays	loops
in sql on it s own it would probably need to be a big stored procedure but if you read all the records out to the scripting language of your choice you can easily loops over them and split each out into arrays hashes

106331
formatting	import
you might find that depending on how fast your new data is coming in doing the trimming and conversion to numeric on the database side is plenty fast enough once what you re comparing to is properly formatted but if possible you would be better off writing an import utility in a .net language that would take care of these formatting issues before hitting the database

106334
sql-server	oracle
oracle ms sql-server - create a stored procedure that takes the org_id as its input and outputs the concatenated employee names

106336
double	int
i have a arraylist made up of different elements imported from a db made up of strings numbers double and int

106365
code-coverage	ncover
i also like testdriven.net because it integrates nunit for unit-testing ncover for code-coverage and reflector for disassembling the .net

106383
base-class	inherited
suppose i have base-class with public methods a and b and i create derivedclass through inherited

106399
32-bit	64bit
will give x86_64 for 64bit and something else for other 32-bit types in my 32-bit vm it s i686

106405
autotools	gnu
ideally i d like to only have to support one version of the gnu autotools but i get the impression that i m really going to end up having to have a copy of every version lying around

106409
derived-class	base-class
if you don t want consumers of derived-class to be able to access methods deriveclass.a and derived-class.b i would suggest that derived-class should implement some public interface iwhatevermethodcisabout and the consumers of derived-class should actually be talking to iwhatevermethodcisabout and know nothing about the implementation of base-class or derived-class at all

106426
environment	building
common-lisp is one of the few environment where we can not only building our application from the top down but where we can lift the language and environment up to meet us half way

106428
json	xml
this approach would be similar to using json or xml but is more performant since hessian is a binary protocol

106443
any	set
i would recommend lucene - its free its fast it is is pretty easy to set up a powerful index on any content for anyone with programming experience

106469
protected	public
in c++ you simply specify a modifiers before the base-class of private public or protected

106485
keyboard	mouse
increases the productivity a lot and i am keyboard freak who hates using mouse

106491
key-value	key
that example takes a space-separated input of key-value pairs and sorts them based on the second value of course it prints them out in value key format but you see what i m doing there.

106496
code-completion	omnicomplete
what s very neat about ctags is that it can be combined with vim with either the taglist plugins to allow source code browsing or with vim omnicomplete to enable code-completion

106497
pkg-config	cygwin
is your pkg-config a cygwin app

106553
queue	fifo
when creating a mutex semaphore in vxwroks you have two options to deal with multiple tasks queue waiting for the semaphore fifo or highest priority task first

106553
queue	fifo
if you were to use a fifo queue for the semaphore the kernel would have to traverse the queue of tasks waiting for the mutex to find the one with the highest priority

106563
logfile	eof
trouble is that tee seems to insist on waiting for the eof before outputting anything to either stdout or the logfile

106581
toolchain	gnu
some vendors supply their own ide s for development are these a necessity or can we or is it possible to standardise on a gnu toolchain type build-process

106586
low-level	hardware
beyond low-level apis where exception-handling-handling cover errors raised from hardware and the os there is a shady area where the programmer decides what constitutes an exception-handling and what is a normal conditional

106597
32-bit	64bit
so i can manipulate 32-bit 64bit integers and have them behave as they would on the native machine

106599
json	xml
i ve found problems using the datacontract json and xml serializers

106601
command-prompt	command-line
for example if i launch an msi from a command-prompt with process id 4000 i can execute the following command-line to find information about msiexec process

106610
contains	any
the entire class graph shouldn t be a problem provided that any contains objects are also marked as serialization

106627
nsmutablearray	nsarray
are you forced to use nsarray and nsmutablearray for data-structures

106628
debugging	exit
otherwise they should just be used to handle the unexpected and exit gracefully while capturing as much information as possible to help with debugging

106652
attributes	properties
xmlarray attributes on your properties

106668
solaris	linux
i ve used poderosa a .net terminal app to monitor logs on multiple linux solaris servers

106668
logfile	tail
i m wondering what other users do to simultaneously monitor several logs in real-time as in tail -f logfile

106695
contains	any
you ll have problems with collection serialization if objects in the collection contains any reference to other objects in the same collection

106735
having	union
if you don t mind the possibility of having duplicate results then a simple union as mariano conti demonstrated is fine

106751
unmanaged	c++-cli
one other thing to note is that c++-cli assemblies that include unmanaged code will be architecture specific

106765
versioning	upgrade
is there a framework that can be used to enable a c# windows service to automatically check for a newer versioning and upgrade itself

106766
roman-numerals	decimal
i ve read about unit-testing in dive into python and it s pretty clear what i want to do when testing an app that converts decimal to roman-numerals the example in dintop

106770
buffering	streaming
it has always bothered me that the only way to copy a file in java involves opening streaming declaring a buffering reading in one file looping through it and writing it out to the other steam

106771
boolean	int
and not just in java but also in c#. there are times when you need to get or set a value that is guaranteed to be an atomic operation on your given platform an int or boolean for example but do not require the overhead of thread locking

106773
configuration	installation
i don t believe dreamhost gives you access to the configuration file for their installation of phpmyadmin

106787
value	field
basically the value of a volatile field becomes visible to all readers other threads in particular after a write operation completes on it

106826
json	xml
have you considered serializing to json instead of xml

106826
json	xml
in my opinion json is more human readable than xml and json.net gives the option to write nicely formatted json

106838
enterprise	legacy
in many situations the enterprise applications needs to connect to with a number of legacy systems they are not only web pages and with the features availalble on the edition of java that kind of connectivity can be solved

106846
jms	jmx
really what they are looking for is experience and understanding of the java ecosystem servlet containers jms jmx hibernate etc

106847
enterprise	platform
java ee is actually a collection of technologies and apis for the java platform designed to support enterprise applications which can generally be classed as large-scale distributed transactional and highly-available applications designed to support mission-critical business requirements

106861
firefox	safari
it s worth noting that in firefox 3 and safari resizing an image by just changing the height and width doesn t look too bad

106862
linux	unix
i m interested in using it for some multi-level parallel applications mpi + threads in unix mac linux etc. environments

106886
display	height
i want to set the height for the div that represents a particular row to the height of image that is greater of the two images being display in that particular row

106893
hardware	monitor
but you need something else for hardware and general monitor something snmp-aware like zennos or zabbix

106914
base-class	subclass
base-class obj new subclass then

106942
munin	cacti
munin and cacti provide very nice interfaces and pre-built scripting for rrdtool

106968
business-objects	crystal-reports
i would email crystal-reports business-objects

106969
protected	public
private protected internal public give classes variables properties and functions the least amount of visibility they need for everything to still work

106990
protected	public
as some other answers have said in general go for the highest level of encapsulation as possible ie private unless you actually need internal protected public

106996
class-members	inner-classes
everything in c# defaults to the least visibility possible internal for classes and private for class-members and inner-classes

107038
exception-handling	try-catch
we subclass runtimeexception for our own specific exception-handling catching them where applicable directly and as for exception-handling that are thrown by other libraries the jdk api etc we do try-catch internally and either log the exception if something happened that really shouldn t have and you have no way of recovering like a file not found exception for a batch job or we wrap the exception in a runtimeexception and then throw it

107038
exception-handling	try-catch
the reason this is done is that it avoids creating forced try-catch blocks everywhere where you might have four instances of calling a methods but only one can actually handle the exception-handling

107040
variables	boolean
one common example for using volatile is to use a volatile boolean variables as a flag to terminate a thread

107043
subclass	nsobject
the biggest component is that if you re creating anything that s an nsobject subclass and you create it with a xxx alloc methods or if you get it from another copy with xxx copy then you ve got the responsibility to match that with an associated release

107052
value	field
you don t care about field value they re just not important

107053
haskell	ocaml
in functional programming languages erlang haskell ml ocaml f# etc. it s very common to have any list processing use recursion

107077
environment	building
msbuilding t deploy would building deploy to a test environment that was partially shared by the team and partially dev-specific

107096
put	get
when i put the ccommandbar.insertmenubar before i create child dialogs i do not get my ok or cancel soft keys when i put that line after the creation of child dialogs the softkeys show as expected and work great

107115
rollback	commit
you re guaranteed that either all the changes are applied if you commit or everything is scrapped if you query rollback

www-mechanize	lwp
use www-mechanize which is a wrapper around lwp that does the browser integration you want

107131
svg	vml
there are two very nice browser-based vector javascript-manipulable graphics packages which together are virtually universal svg and vml

107131
google-chrome	firefox
svg is supported by firefox opera safari and google-chrome - technically only part of the specification is supported but for practical purposes you should be able to do what you need

107131
svg	vml
vml is microsoft s answer to svg and surprise is natively supported by ie although svg is not

107131
svg	vml
by the way you say that you re asking for an algorithm and i m offering technologies if that s the right term for svg vml

107149
margins	padding
this will positioning the first letter on the right edge of the paragraph then shove it left it by more or less the width of the paragraph then move both the letter and all the padding into the float s large negative margins so the paragraph fits in the margins and doesn t try to wrap around

107152
derived-class	inherited
your derived-class is now strongly dependant on the class it was inherited from

107159
order	join
the ol rule of thumb was columns that are used a lot in where order by and grouping by clauses or any that seemed to be used in join frequently

107171
value	field
you can use the component key as a token in the value field of the entry in the registry table in your msi

107171
value	field
you can set the value field in the registry table to register your assembly to assmb.dll and it will get resolved to the install location of the assembly

107177
decimal	hex
or save some bytes and convert that to decimal or hex

107188
lisp	let
nowadays we let the lisp runtime deal with tags without additional hardware support

107195
click	mouse
mouse moves and click on the title bar

107209
boolean	int
you could represent these connections as an arrays of eight boolean values or much more compactly as an eight bit int

107209
boolean	int
its then easy to use the eight boolean values or the eight bit int to form the filename of the bitmap to load for that grid square

107209
boolean	int
for example your center tile using this scheme could be called bitmap01000011.png just using the boolean values or alternatively bitmap43.png using the hexidecimal value of the eight bit int representing that binary pattern for a shorter filename

107215
base-class	inherited
you don t inherited because the bird does not support the complete base-class contract.

107216
32-bit	64bit
to complete some testing i need to load the 64bit version of an assembly even though i am running a 32-bit version of windows

107227
bubble-sort	quicksort
so take quicksort which is o n log n vs bubble-sort which is o n 2

107227
bubble-sort	quicksort
when sorting 10 things quicksort is 3 times faster than bubble-sort

107230
32-bit	64bit
you are writing code that should work on both 32-bit and 64bit versions of windows

107230
32-bit	x86
whether the resulting assembly can run on x86 machines running 32-bit windows versions

107230
platform	anycpu
if you don t specify a platform the default is anycpu which indicates that the

107234
perl	php
i m not interested in php or perl or web development

107234
put	get
in my head it s as simple as replacing a selected stuff where tag buffer-overflow with selected stuff where tag not in php offtopic funny-hat-friday but i ve not put together any db backed sites that get absolutely pounded on by thousands people

107237
contains	elements
that is not the only way to contains the floats inside a centred elements

107242
webforms	asp.net
as i saw the comments here asp.net mvc use webforms view engine

107279
output	cat
one quick-and-easy way to see non-printing characters and whitespace is to pipe the output through cat -vet

107301
subtraction	addition
each addition or subtraction mean the subsequent prior element in the arrays

107323
linux	osx
i will target chrome as soon as a stable linux and osx client is available

107349
quicksort	mergesort
if you look at the quicksort or mergesort algorithms you will see that they both take the approach of dividing the list to be sorted in half sorting each half using the same algorithm recursively and then recombining the two halves

107358
sunos	unix
i don t know if this advice applies to sunos or any unix

107431
calloc	malloc
instead of doing malloc followed by memset you should be using calloc which will clear the newly allocated memory for you

107444
c-preprocessor	macros
it is best to wrap this in a c-preprocessor macros so that you can turn it off since it is compiler-specific and you might not want all of your builds to export symbols

107446
parallels	vmware
quicksilver is awesome when integrated with parallels vmware fusion to launch windows apps too

107465
private-key	rsa
i d suggest you look into using something like a diffie–Hellman key exchange or even rsa to generate some sort of public private-key that can be passed to your users based on some information

107466
mousedown	mouseup
you can always use the mousedown or mouseup event and check to see if it the selected node

107510
multiplication	addition
you can then take the quaternion product which uses only simple multiplication and addition of the current rotation quaternion and incremental rotation quaternion to get a new quaternion which represents performing both rotations

107510
multiplication	addition
converting the quaternion to a rotation matrix is very straightforward uses only multiplication and addition when you want to display the model in its rotated state using traditional graphics api s

107544
macros	let
let s introduce our own macros that works like that with-ldap-attrs and replace it in our original code

107544
contains	elements
when you call ldap-attrs it ll spit out a list that contains the value of attr that s the comma followed by car first elements in the list cons pair actually and there is in fact a function called first you can use too which receives the first value in the list returned by ldap attr-value

107552
virtualbox	vmware
we have played a bit with vmware virtualpc virtualbox etc creating a virtual build server but we came across a lot of issues when we tried to copy it for others to use having to reconfigure every new copy of the vm

107552
windows-xp	windows
we are using windows-xp x86 x64 and windows vista x86 x64 so i had to rename the machine join the domain etc for every new copy

107557
cvs	git
one of its functions is to generate a changelog entry from your local diff currently supporting bazaar cvs svn git and darcs

107585
authentication	login
sql login is authentication from the asp application to sql 2005 server 1

107613
python	perl
it fills a very narrow niche right between not needing it at all and needing to whip out perl python whatever

107616
python	c++
i m especially interested in python and c++ but all information is appreciated

107619
ubuntu	debian
the following command is probably the only one for which i ve used awk in the last two years it purges half-removed packages from my debian ubuntu systems

107625
perl	awk
even though it might be interesting you can do everything that awk can do using other more powerful tools such as perl

107650
png	ico
i ve used it a lot in my projects since a winform needs an ico file for it s icon while i usually have png or bmp files

107653
perl	awk
of course i could use perl or python but awk makes it so much simpler with a concise single line command

107668
udp	tcp
if you have a situation where a tcp connection is potentially too slow and a udp connection is potentially too unreliable what do you use

107668
udp	tcp
i m interested in the various options here of which tcp is at one end of the scale and udp is at the other

107668
udp	tcp
various reliable udp options are available and each brings some elements of tcp to udp

107679
seam	jsf
template-based frameworks are very good for this but we ve had some good experiences with jsf + facelets + seam too

107691
perl	awk
most awk one liners can be achieved with perl one liners - if you choose to get into a perl one liner mindset

107705
any	set
is there any other way to set some global flag in sys sys.stdout programmatically during execution

107711
gitignore	git-rm
delete them using git-rm and then add .ds_store to gitignore to stop them getting added again

107723
webforms	asp.net
parsing a tree of controls in windows forms or webforms .net windows forms asp.net

107740
ftp	scp
otherwise as far as i can tell they will have to first scp or rcp or ftp or ... your configuration file to a scratch space not overwriting theirs and then do the same queries on the local configuration file

107783
sctp	tcp
update a comparison between tcp and sctp shows that the performances are comparable unless two interfaces can be used

107795
hosts-file	hosts
resolution to be done using the etc hosts

107801
json	xml
i agree that the datacontract-based serialization methods to json xml etc is a bit more complex than i d like

107810
private	self
due to the nature of private keys each segment is useless to by its self

107840
revision	updates
you can use in a file to get latest revision but only after you updates the file

107848
revision	updates
otherwise i would just call a script do updates the revision if the keywords aren t suitable for you

107869
revision	svn
the best way to do this is have a build script for releases that will determine the revision number using svnversion or svn info and insert it into a file

107878
versioning	upgrade
i m re-writing it in .net so i don t want to pay 600+ for an upgrade to the latest versioning of coldfusion nor do i want to go through the very large site fixing versioning incompatibilities

107880
revision	updates
as alexander said one way is to updates the revision as part of the build process

107880
build-process	release
one method of doing this is to take your release builds from an automated build-process triggered from your version-control checkin by using a tool such as buildbot

107880
revision	updates
this causes your buildbot to updates to the most recently checked in revision

107880
revision	svn
makefile would use svnversion or svn info and grep to read the repository revision and write it into a header file before the build takes place

107883
difference	factors
however we often deal with sufficiently small n such that constant factors and so on make a real significant difference

107883
quicksort	heapsort
for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort

107883
quicksort	heapsort
this is because heapsort does a few more comparisons per element than quicksort

107903
build-process	release
having to create archives manually is preventing me from fully automating my release build-process

107937
32-bit	x86
secondly i ran a simple test and it also shows that no memory is leaked at least not on sun s jdk 1.5.0_05 on 32-bit x86 linux 2.6

107949
attributes	properties
which is in your case we got a matching div element and then apply attributes properties matching rules and what not.

107963
internet-explorer	safari
safari and internet-explorer both support the css font-face rule however they support two different embedded font types

107972
any	set
is it possible under any set of circumstances to be able to accomplish this

107981
difference	count
loop through every difference gap that you ve identified and sum up their byte count

107981
difference	count
calculate your percentage of diff by using the total ammount difference byte count and the total byte of the story the one you calculated earlier

107990
sniffing	traffic
sniffing was once on its way out because of fully switched wired networks where you would have to work extra hard to capture anyone else s traffic as opposed to networks using hubs but it s on its way back because of wireless networks which create a broadcast medium once again an make session hijacking easy unless the traffic is encrypted

108002
decompression	gunzip
if any of the file names specified on the command-line are directory gzip will descend into the directory and compress all the files it finds there or decompression them in the case of gunzip

108015
default-value	default
default-value for the default icon

108027
put	get
i have no idea what can cause this but i would try to find out by subclassing qdrag overwrite deletelater well reimplement it but as it s a slot it will get called anyway use this instead of a qdrag and put a breakpoint in deletelater

108030
udp	tcp
if you have a situation where a tcp connection is potentially too slow and a udp connection is potentially too unreliable what do you use

108030
udp	tcp
if you want to get reliability out of udp then you re basically going to be re-implementing some of tcp s features on top of udp which will probably make things slower than just using tcp in the first place

108047
docking	toolbar
we currently use a very old versioning of stingray objective toolkit to provide our mfc extensions like customizable toolbar and docking windows etc

108054
keyword	lexical
lexical analysis should probably be used to separate the input stream into lexical tokens number line-change keyword and so on

108058
file-descriptor	fclose
so i would just use fclose which also closes the underlying file-descriptor

108081
clisp	sbcl
are there any good cross platform sbcl and clisp at the very least easy to install gui libraries

108102
smalltalk	lisp
the thing that i like most about lisp and smalltalk systems is that they feel alive

108137
managed-code	unmanaged
under .net and visual-c++ specifically you can have both unmanaged and managed-code

108169
contains	elements
given a list how would i selected a new list contains a slice of the original list given offset and number of elements

108182
enterprise	platform
.net is microsoft s current enterprise software platform

108189
python	ruby
that same method of console.writeline can be invoked from c# vb.net pascal c++ ruby python f# and any other language that has been made to work on top of the .net platform

108192
signals	sigpipe
this will prevent any socket or pipe write from causing a sigpipe signals

108192
signals	sigpipe
to ignore the sigpipe signals use the following code

108211
assign	add
i want to add a column to an existing legacy database and write a procedure by which i can assign each record a different value

108238
authentication	login
you generally have some options as to how it authentication to the remote server which include logging in as the currently logged in user or specifying a sql login to always use

108262
search-box	highlight
this will also work nicely if the user wants to use the search-box a second time since they won t have to manually highlight the previous text to delete it

108292
reverse-dns	spf
configuring and using sender-id domain-keys spf reverse-dns etc to make sure your email are properly identified

108314
desktop-application	web-applications
i believe that the future development model for web-applications will more akin to the current model of desktop-application development

108333
build-process	msbuild
you could then include this as a post build-process or as an action in an msbuild script

108345
any	set
any number with only one bit set must be a power of two

108358
signals	sigpipe
you cannot prevent the process on the far end of a pipe from exiting and if it exits before you ve finished writing you will get a sigpipe signals

108373
required	checked
if yes you might checked some compatibilities because some technologies required more effort to connect

108378
exception-handling	try-catch
wrap that up in a try-catch block and handle any of the specific exception-handling that come from it

108398
.when	ready
the downside is that release planning and velocity estimation is not as accurate as with scrum but this hybrid xp methodology helps developers focus on tasks .when ready and not waste too much time in meetings

108400
exception-handling	try-catch
are you asking about the overhead of using try-catch finally when exception-handling aren t thrown or the overhead of using exception-handling to control process flow

108421
parallels	vmware
alternately you can buy a href rel nofollow noreferrer parallels a or a href rel nofollow noreferrer vmware fusion a for less than 100

108421
python	ruby
it primarily focuses on objective c though python ruby and other languages can be used to develop native mac applications

108423
http	ssl
keep in mind that the alternative ip and port iis runs on should be reachable to the clients connecting to your server if you only have a single ip address available you should take care to pick an iis port that isn t generally blocked by firewalls 8080 might be a good option or 443 even though you re running regular http and not ssl

108430
click	mouse
in this way you do not have to worry about simulated mouse click on particular pixels

108440
configuration	environment
my current web environment is having capacity issues and so i m looking for best-practices regarding configuration tuning determining bottlenecks security etc

108451
udp	tcp
if you need the reliable in-order delivery of tcp and also the fast response of udp and don t need to worry about congestion from sending large streams of data you can disable nagle s algorithm

108457
exception-handling	try-catch
any time you go to construct one of the previously wrapped classes you must use the system.activator.createinstance methods and wrap it in a try-catch filtering on 7 different exception-handling types

108467
hide	show
it depends on how much encapsulated you want your class to be and what you want to hide or show

108478
rewrite	rule
if you have a naming convention for include files inc.php for example you could redirect .inc.php requests to a 404 for specific folder - in apache rewrite supply r 404 at the end of the rule will return that http status to your client

108493
difference	zero
you also find it used in very math-heavy applications as well it makes a difference if you for example remove all multiplication with zero out of a matrix multiplication if you plan to do such a multiplication several thousand times

108507
xquery	xslt
personally i found xslt easier to learn than xquery

108507
xquery	xslt
xquery is a fantastic tool for selecting pieces of xml from a large repository but we still use xslt to transform our documents

108511
spaces	output
note that overwrite the default spaces and tab delimiters so that the output of the date command gets gobbled all at once

108521
value	field
i need a calculated field in the list items such that if user a created the item the field vaule will be x and if user b created the item fields value would be y

108525
xsd	xml
if the wsdl is designed properly there should be an underlying xml schema xsd to validate the body of the request against

108579
constructor	object
placement new will be extremely cheap if the object type has no constructor

108579
malloc	free
operator new and operator delete are c++ s closest equivalent to malloc and free and as these in the absence of class overrides are called as appropriate by new and delete expressions they can with care

108585
asterisk	pbx
here s one i did for the asterisk pbx a long time ago as an example

108615
perl	ruby
i think you should watch powershell or any other programming language capable to perform scripting tasks easily python perl php ruby

108649
hash	md5
i think jeremy has hit the nail on the head - if you just want to detect if files are different a hash algorithm like md5 or sha1 is a good way to go

108650
google-chrome	firefox
edit in response to chris i have set the partialchars parameter to 1 and the control works in all the other browsers i ve tried which are the latest versions of firefox safari opera and google-chrome

108692
getter	setter
an annotations that says this test t should auto-test all the getter setter on class c because i assert that they are standard

108708
internet-explorer	doctype
to get the css to work properly particularly on internet-explorer make sure you have an appropriate doctype definition in your document

108711
getter	setter
i doubt that autotesting getter and setter benefit your code quality or your coverage either these methods are used from other code and tested there 100 covered or not used at all and could be removed

108711
getter	setter
in the end you ll leave getter and setter in because they are used from the test but nowhere else in the application

108742
versioning	staging
if you wanted you could easily add another staging environment for another versioning without having to change your subversioning layout

108749
command-line	cmd
what i would suggest is look at other command-line interfaces for other cmd on your system paying special attention to the parameters passed

108754
python	ruby
...and java python ruby and others..

108758
getter	setter
so i would try to see if those getter and setter can be removed as suggested before

108758
getter	setter
getter and setter are breaking encapsulation

108768
malloc	free
malloc inside a function call appears to be getting free on return

108791
python	perl
if c s not your bag python has a similar library as does perl

108795
reliability	scalability
these are thing like expectations for reliability security performance scalability configurability etc

108820
cvs	git
it lets you build applications with a svn cvs git like user interface easily your-command -o --long-opt some-action-to-execute some parameters

108832
virtual-machine	vmware
is it possible to clone a virtual-machine using vmware fusion on mac os x

108862
benchmarking	profiling
programming languages have profiling like pear benchmarking

108892
python	ruby
is there anything like the ruby tool autotest part of the zentest package but for python code

108894
contains	elements
for this i like to put elements in the page s contains the urls to use for requests

108900
build-process	release
i have a build-process that i use to generate a header file which contains the svn rev for a given release

108910
system.out	system.in
your command-line interface class should accept an inputstream as it s input and provide an outputstream it can t hardcode output to system.out and input to system.in that it s output will be written to

108925
jar	war
if the former then the war is just a normal jar file and you can execute classes in that just like any other other jar file

108938
sharing	share
i would however like something like asp s application context which instead of sharing data only within a single session will share it with all sessions in the same application

108947
value	field
my thinking on this issue is give the minimum information that points the user to the issue. i have been told by a co-worker that i should be as verbose as possible printing out the value of the database fields for each field i mention verses giving the minimum message that field one needs to be less then field two

108947
convention	standards
i know that there must be some convention or standards for this issue as it reminds me of compiler-errors and warnings

108949
http	ssl
and because it also detects ssl you wont have to worry about weather your resources will be sent over http or https if you ever add ssl support to your server

108959
multiplication	exponent
it is probably the best you can do as a general methods that works for all exponent value but for a specific exponent value there might be a better sequences that needs fewer multiplication

108959
multiplication	exponentiation
it turns out this can be done using just 5 multiplication via addition-chain exponentiation

108979
32-bit	64bit
on many 64bit systems an int is 32-bit and a pointer is 64bits

108980
getter	setter
in the most cases setter and getter do more as only setting and getting an internal field

108980
getter	setter
if you have no logic on the setter and getter then it must be used anywhere in your application

108980
getter	setter
test your business logic and not the getter and setter

108980
getter	setter
the result should also a coverage of the getter and setter

108980
getter	setter
if the getter and setter have no code-coverage then removed it

108982
any	set
in your code where ever you wanted to change any behaviour for a specific set of directoris or running modes check if a environment variables is set or not

108984
postgresql	mysql
the underlying database oracle microsoft mysql postgresql others custom.

108995
realloc	malloc
sometimes even in c++ you have to make profit of the malloc realloc free utils

108995
realloc	malloc
and in c you could override malloc and realloc etc. through templates to achieve type-safety

109009
revision	svn
branches and tags in svn are lightweight - on the server it does not make a full copy of the files just a marker saying these files were copied at this revision that only takes up a few bytes

109009
.when	ready
the idea of this is .when you re working on something disruptive that would hold up or interfere with other people from doing their work something experimental that may not even make it in or possibly just something that takes a long time and you re afraid if it holding up a 1.2 release .when you re ready to branch 1.2 from trunk you can do it in isolation in branch

109017
shell	bash
help ulimit at a bash shell prompt

109026
revision	svn
if you want to show the current svn revision number in the caption bar i would suggest

109032
selected	button
i also have this button labeled bold that i want if someone selected text in the richtextbox then presses the button the selected text turns bold

109061
gedit	gnome
gedit which comes with gnome and has many of these ide features see for example this blog entry

109061
kdevelop	anjuta
these would be lightweight ides as opposed to heavyweights like anjuta kdevelop eclipse or netbeans

109069
clang	icc
to make binaries optimized for the machine you build them on use with gcc clang or icc

109069
clang	icc
see assembly from gcc clang icc and msvc on the godbolt compiler explorer

109069
clang	icc
this source isn t x86-specific or gnu-specific at all but only compiles well for x86 with gcc clang icc

109070
linux	unix
i have heard of mono and that it allows you to write .net apps that run on mac and linux but i want to be able to write a single app that when compiled for windows will run as a service and when compiled for linux will run as whatever the unix equivalent is

109081
seam	jsf
we re working with ejb here and it works quite well with jboss seam and jsf faclets and myfaces trinidad

109083
.net	wcf
does anyone know of any problems with using wcf to expose a soap interface for non .net clients

109091
clearinterval	setinterval
setinterval returns an interval id which you can pass to clearinterval

109091
clearinterval	setinterval
see the docs for setinterval and clearinterval

109093
32-bit	64bit
i think that this will not more faster for a 64bit value but a 32-bit value can be faster

109098
clearinterval	setinterval
if you set the return-value of setinterval to a variables you can use clearinterval to stop it

109124
stderr	stdout
is it possible to run an external process from perl capture its stderr stdout and the process exit code

109124
stderr	stdout
how do you capture stderr stdout and the exit code all at once

109127
instance-variables	class-variables
your example shows instance-variables not really class-variables

109127
class-variables	class-members
look in hi_obj.__class__.__dict__.items for the class-variables along with other other class-members like member functions and the contains module

109150
stderr	stdout
with system both stdout and stderr will go the same place as the scripting s stdout and stderr unless the system command redirects them

109150
stderr	stdout
you could also call something like the following with open to redirect both stdout and stderr

109183
static-classes	inner-classes
this wouldn t deal easily public inner static-classes you could parsing the class file name but would never work with private inner-classes or anonymous inner-classes

109234
svg	vml
raphael is a plugin that uses svg for firefox and other browsers that support svg and vml for the ie products

109284
ruby-on-rails	rspec
is it possible to test the use of a given layout using rspec with ruby-on-rails for example i d like a matcher that does the following

109317
c-strings	c++
is there any good reason to use c-strings in c++ nowadays

109325
postgresql	oracle
how do you perform the equivalent of oracle s describe table in postgresql using the psql command

109339
attributes	properties
contrast that to datacontractserializer where all properties are opt-in you must explicitly declare inclusion attributes

109350
c-strings	c++
it s better to define these as c-strings than as c++ objects -- more lightweight portable etc

109355
c-strings	c++
if the c++ code is deep close to the kernel heavily dependent on c libraries etc. you may want to use c-strings explicitly to avoid lots of conversions in to and out of std string

109355
python	ruby
of if you re interfacing with other language domains python ruby etc. you might do so for the same reason

109375
c-strings	c++
given the choice there is generally no reason to choose primitive c-strings over c++ strings std string

109379
default-arguments	arguments
you cannot define default-arguments or block arguments

109393
attributes	properties
one decorates various properties or fields with attributes to inform the serializationr what to serialization

109409
webforms	asp.net
what are the key strengths of asp.net webforms 2.0-3.5

109447
instances	private
you can inject your own private modules into your private cpan with cpan mini inject for instances

109476
stderr	stdout
however i think that the mechanisms the standard requires for synching stdin cin stdout cout and stderr cerr don t have to be visible to you

109480
memcached	apc
i ve created a forum and we re implementing an apc and memcached caching solution to save the database some work

109496
margins	padding
you will probably have to tweak the margins and padding value to get it all to line up exactly though

109499
javascript-engine	spidermonkey
there s spidermonkey a javascript-engine written in c and rhino an implementation of javascript in java

109516
fieldset	labels
keep in mind that there are also tags like fieldset and labels which exist specifically for adding structure to a form so it s not really a question of just using div

109518
python	ruby
it supports wsgi standard interface for python web frameworks rack standard interface for ruby web frameworks and direct support for ruby on rails

109524
access-control	authentication
do you really need to see the authentication header if the webserver takes care of the access-control for you

109538
checkbox	textarea
i have a generic .form style in my css and then variants for text inputs checkbox selects textarea etc etc

109580
any	set
let s see i let a user set a variables foo and i store it using any web programming language

109590
stdin	pipe
until then it is recommended to either use system or open a pipe into stdin of iptables-restore

109605
postgresql	mysql
sql is used for relational databases ms sql server oracle sybase mysql postgresql sqlite etc... and xquery is used for xml databases marklogic sedena qexo qizx db etc...

109605
httpserver	webserver
you can have a typical webserver and connect to marklogic through xdb or you can use their httpserver and mix your xquery with your html directly

109615
profiling	trace
with sql profiling you can run a trace on the server which can show you which queries are being requested by the application

109646
interpolation	cosine
you could try using a cosine interpolation for the points in-between

109658
webforms	asp.net
overall asp.net webforms is a great development model and most of the downfalls that people complain about are misconceptions or poor design architecture

109663
linux	osx
the only thing that is missing from the mono distribution on the mac compared to linux is the apache module that one you will have to compile yourself if you want to deploy your application in production on osx

109672
stderr	stdout
it also means you only need to remember one single approach to capturing stdout and stderr or merging them instead of using ipc open3 for external programs and other modules for capturing perl output

109678
value	field
the expression means look inside the data structure that temp1 points to and return the value of the field next . so assigns the value of to temp1

109678
contains	lookup
of course the lookup happen before the assignment. temp1 will now contains whatever value the next field happened to contains

109714
contains	elements
so in reply to 17 of 26 s comment - the 60 width is entirely optional by default the fieldset will inherit the width of the contains elements

109737
constructor	object
i don t see any reason to believe that creating an object in the constructor will automatically dispose the object

109783
signals	sigint
once another signals comes through for delivery such as sigint when you ctrl + c aka keyboardinterrupt the kernel remembers that it never delivered sigquit and delivers it now

109785
constructor	object
instead walk your json responses after you receive them and pass the appropriate data to the appropriate object constructor

109790
data-access	ado.net
errors that occur deep down in a data-access layer or even higher up say within ado.net operations for example rarely make much sense to an end user

109790
nested	order
once the error reaches the user-interface - if necessary - it can then iterate through the nested exception-handling in order to display an error message that firstly tells the user which operation failed but also provides a bit of technical information about what actually went wrong

109820
entity-framework	ado.net
it can integrate nicely with visual-studio 2008 for development and has support for linq entity data model and ado.net entity-framework to make it easy to create next generation data-enabled applications

109827
matroska	mkv
for example on avi it gives all sorts of data about resolution fourcc fps etc while for an mkv file it just says matroska data telling you nothing about the internals or even the video and audio formats used

109861
postgresql	mysql
i ve seen questions for doing the reverse but i have an 800mb postgresql database that needs to be converted to mysql

109864
json	xml
if you just need a text format and not specifically xml you might try json

109877
debian	linux
debian gnu linux testing lenny

109879
icollection	ienumerable
will only serialization ienumerable or icollection collections conforming to specific rules

109879
icollection	ienumerable
the xmlserializer gives special treatment to classes that implement ienumerable or icollection

109879
icollection	ienumerable
a class that implements icollection such as collectionbase in addition to ienumerable must have a public item indexed property indexer in c# that takes an integer and it must have a public count property of type integer

109879
contains	any
the xmlserializationr cannot be instantiated to serialization an enumeration if the following conditions are true the enumeration is of type unsigned long ulong in c# and the enumeration contains any member with a value larger than 9 223 372 036 854 775 807

109880
while-loop	loops
so it s not so much the foreach loops or the while-loops

109885
administration	integrated
unless you re using integrated authentication and each of your users has an account and the ability to contact a system administration to find out why their account lacks privileges probably not

109898
enterprise	legacy
my organization recently hosted a legacy vfp 7 app on a windows-server 2008 enterprise 64bit server for access over terminal services

109926
opera-mini	safari
i remember it being wait and pay and nowadays the mobile phones usually have a real browser like opera-mini or safari

109926
windows-mobile	symbian
the alternatives are the sdk of the phone in question iphone symbian windows-mobile or java j2me which is theoretically compatible with more phones but still requires a lot of testing due to different screen resolutions the existance of a keyboard or not etc

109976
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i am setting up a ruby-on-rails app and i just finished making some unit tests and my friend said that apparently fixtures are no longer cool and people are now using rspec or shoulda

109979
parallels	vmware
parallels workstation -- it s commercial somewhat expensive and not up to par with vmware

109979
virtualization	vmware
for myself i stick with vmware workstation 7+ years and vmware server for my linux-hosted virtualization needs

109979
vmware	esx
at work it s vmware workstation on windows vmware server on windows and vmware esx on bare metal

109987
windows-mobile	symbian
symbian blackberry os and windows-mobile all have a lot of handsets out there but you kind of have to pick one
