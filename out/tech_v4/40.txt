400012
solaris	debian
but os updates usually have little effect on the dev server stack i m using and in any case my deployment environment uses a different os i develop on osx and ubuntu and deploy on debian and solaris

400014
groovy	java
it uses groovy which is similiar to java so if you know this already you re good to go

400014
groovy	java
groovy runs on the jvm so you can still use all the great libraries already available for java

400014
spring	grails
grails is already setup with hibernate and spring

400021
keyboard	mouse
a decent keyboard and mouse are essential

400021
keyboard	mouse
for the last 10 or so years i ve always taken my own mouse and keyboard to work as you typically end up with whatever comes from the pc manufacturer

400023
prototype	strict
i like -wall and strict prototype as well as implicit function definitions

400047
openvz	xen
if using debian debootstrap is your friend coupled with qemu xen openvz lguest or a plethora of others

400051
detailsview	datalist
i have a basic test web form with a datalist and a detailsview and two xmldatasource components for each of them

400051
detailsview	datalist
the binding of the datalist to the underlying xml document was easy to set up but i m struggling with getting the detailsview hooked up

400051
detailsview	datalist
the idea is that there is a master details relationship between the two bindable controls so i guess i should hook onto the onselecteditemindexchanged on the datalist to do the binding of the currently selected item in the detailsview

400063
cvs	git
we ve recently transitioned from cvs to git in our solaris environment and it s excellent

400074
player	movie
if i would write something that doesn t affect the global stability of the system let s say a game or a movie player i would not check for that exception-handling

400074
player	movie
what do you gain from a amazingly stable movie player if it starts slowing down to play movie because of your aggressive checking

400081
tokenize	parsing
instead of doing this you can implement a tokenize and a parsing with ply

400081
tokenize	parsing
you could also implement the tokenize and the parsing by hand

400083
webforms	asp.net
we are preparing to develop an enterprise human resources project using asp.net and our team is interested in using mvc instead of webforms but we are a bit worried about this

400088
contains	any
once you start it you will need to chdir to where your files are and then obviously require any files contains functions you need to test

400093
callback	methods
you will still need to handle the whole response in the same callback methods of course

400097
data-access	nhibernate
i m currently using nhibernate as my data-access layer using fluent nhibernate to create the mapping files for me

400134
promotions	product
then at the solution level you have the components and the apis for dealing with user profiling identity management and personalization content authoring versioning and publishing content search product catalogs for tangible and intangible goods product search and guided navigation pricing tax calculation promotions shopping carts gift lists and wish lists payment types shipping methods order tracking customer relationship management etc

400134
content-management	publishing
they support integration with pretty much anyone who is anyone in the e-commerce and publishing space for things like authoring and content-management identity management and security product catalogs search and guided navigation etc

400134
push	pull
the v iew in asp.net-mvc should be populate by the model - it is a push mechanism with the model updating the view not a pull mechanism with the view querying the model

400134
click	mouse
with web-applications we tend to get a completely updated view on form submission rather than lots of small changes each key press or mouse click or each changed input-field as we would with a rich user-interface framework

400134
implements	abstract
the best code will be that which adheres to a good design principle say true asp.net-mvc in the abstract and implements it realizes it using the right tools available in the chosen framework in the way they are intended to be used

400136
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i made the switch from webforms shortly after the preview releases started coming out and have been using the asp.net-mvc framework ever since

400136
asp.net-mvc	webforms
two people can simultaneously work on the same page in asp.net-mvc while in webforms working two people to a page ends up being much more of a challenge

400139
communication	messages
you would want to use messages-queue when there is a possibility that the other communication process may not be available yet you still want to have the messages sent at the time of the client s choosing

400145
callback	methods
async methods usually have a callback allowing you to do do some action upon completition

400161
cucumber	selenium
cucumber doesn t really work with an ajax-based app though for that you d have to take selenium or watir instead

400165
.when	ready
.when the semaphore is 0 then the class is ready to be disposed

400208
ibm-mq	msmq
examples of such systems are msmq and ibm-mq

400210
msbuild	nant
for nant scripting one may simply define system property teamcity_dotnet_use_msbuild_v35 in the build configuration settings to make it run msbuild 3.5

400210
msbuild	nant
on the other hand if nant target framework is set to net-3.5 only for nant 0.86 beta 1 msbuild should be taken from .net 3.5 folder

400213
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this june i chose webforms over asp.net-mvc since asp.net-mvc wasn t mature yet

400222
composite	visitor
i also noticed that factory composite and visitor often go hand in hand where the factory creates a set of domain- related objects that a visitor can traversal

400222
dependency-injection	factory-pattern
therefore my question is are there situations outside of frameworks where you would use factory-pattern instead of plain interfaces and dependency-injection

400223
any	set
users can multi-select any set of items to perform an action on them copying deleting and users can look at any other item while maintaining the current selection

400236
webforms	asp.net
i have a simple asp.net 3.5 sp1 webforms app.

400239
python	perl
i think a lot of script languages perl python have similar libraries probably for imap as well and should be fairly easy to hack together

400246
wcf-configuration	wcf
that works well and so we do have a solution but i believeit s not very elegant as it requires building the wcf channel in code moving away from the wonderful wcf-configuration

400246
communication	messages
this might be because the messages is an unsecured fault or because there is a binding mismatch between the communication parties

400251
key-value	key
uiviews are not key-value compliant on generic key

400254
http	ssl
a secure connection https or http via ssl

400259
delegation	dealloc
your delegation should nil out myobject s delegation property in its dealloc to avoid this

400264
unsigned	integer
while it is relatively easy to decide which integer type to use you selected smallest enough to hold the value with some added complexity for signed unsigned with floats it is not this easy

400275
spring	grails
with the acquisition of g2one by spring source one of the expectations is more support for groovy and grails in eclipse

400288
order	add
i m currently using a greedy algorithm where i just add each event in order but that can produce unwanted artifacts like

400291
asp.net-routing	global-asax
i ve had a similar issue and solved it asp.net-routing - do custom routes completely skip everything in the global-asax

400292
perl	php
whether you use flash or php you re still using html form technology specificaion to do the get post thus using flash is just as secure or insecure as using php perl cgi etc

400293
member-function-pointers	function-pointers
that works because a function-pointers to a static member function is not a member-function-pointers and can thus be handled like just a pointers to a free function

400316
curly-brackets	parentheses
escaping parentheses and curly-brackets in bres gives them the special meaning their unescaped versions have in eres

400319
uniform	points
randomly place an initial points p_0 by picking x y from a uniform distribution within the valid grid

400320
json	xml
otherwise you re stuck with parsing xml or json if the server can do that but there are frameworks you can use

400332
linux	unix
there are a number of things to look at i m writing from linux unix experience but things should apply to other operating systems as well

400355
build-process	nant
once you have a single file you could then go the extra distance by having a build-process update your single assemblyinfo version using msbuild or nant

400363
system.web	.net
i am guessing that your .net framework installation especially system.web is corrupt since it is refering to itself

400365
persistence	hibernate
sure you d unit test your persistence tier if it wasn t written in hibernate wouldn t you

400365
persistence	hibernate
create a given persistence interface that s implemented using hibernate instantiate some sample objects perform crud operations and ask junit to assert that the operations were successful

400375
put	get
of course the best solution is to use a restful client and use a combination of nsurlconnection to get send the data and the touchxml classes to parsing the data though this would require more work to put the data into a dictionary

400377
actionscript	mxml
you write apps using actionscript similar to javascript and mxml markup used primarily for layout view code

400392
varchar2	clob
well length takes a character arguments char varchar2 nchar nvarchar2 clob or nclob whereas vsize takes just about any data type so if you pass length a noncharacter data type there has to be an implicit-conversion

400407
networkstream	streamreader
i am writing a webserver application in c# and using streamreader class to read from an underlying networkstream

400423
attributes	properties
i even tried using the xmlattribute tag and making my properties show up as attributes of the root node but no luck there either

400428
any	set
to boot this request seems to ignore any httpwebrequest settings i try to set before initiating the request even if i set http 1.0 or keep-alive to false it still starts off with the above headers

400444
difference	zero
the only difference is that it doesn t add any leading zero so we have to do that ourselves

400445
spaces	output
this will allow you to render your output accordingly not wasting any spaces and avoiding those e event days

400474
http	ssl
.net should handle the creation of the ssl connection without being told what port to use when you use the http protocol

400477
32-bit	64bit
on a 64bit machine is the size of an int in java 32-bit or 64 bits

400479
windows-vista	windows
update microsoft statement march 2010 the visual basic team is committed to â œit just worksâ compatibility for visual basic 6.0 applications on windows-vista windows server 2008 including r2 and windows 7

400524
updating	updates
updating the dlls in our repository isn t a problem but making a build scripting to parsing apart the .proj file and updates the versioning number isn t optimal but it s a hack that would work

400552
callback	methods
obviously i need to call the methods and then see if the callback fires but is there a better way than simply sleeping for a bit and then checking for a flag that is set by the callback

400570
conditional	operators
there s a lot of great uses of the assignment operators in a conditional statement and it d be a royal pain in the ass to see warnings about each one all the time

400576
profiling	trace
i found an article that actually measures the performance impact of a sql profiling session vs a server-side trace

400583
constructor	object
the __init__ method does nothing because they are immutable object therefore the constructor __new__ should do all the work

400590
put	get
note you really need to put code in here for the case that totalvisits 0 or you will get a division by 0 answer

400591
javassist	cglib
since hibernate 3.3 the default bytecode provider is now javassist rather than cglib

400616
checkbox	button
but when you check the checkbox the next time you click the button the button is disabled as expected but never does the postback

400675
directory	folder
one thing i ve noticed is that you can t successfully version anything in a build directory because vs thinks it owns the build directories and is likely to delete your .svn folder is this just for builds involving a clean

400694
subtract	time
then just subtract the two structs using timersub and you can get the time it took in seconds from the tv_usec field

400697
virtualbox	vmware
with virtualization using virtualpc vmware virtualbox etc it in theory should be possible to support vb6 applications provided you have a host os that can run vb6 correctly that you can virtualize that can run these applications

400704
.net	wcf
i would go back to .net remoting but the architect says he wants this abstraction layer done in wcf because my words not his it s new and sexy

400704
.net	wcf
so how does one go about working with .net native objects on both sides of a wcf connection.

400706
constructor	private
what worries me is that the child forms in their constructor take a reference to the parent form and keep it in a private member field

400710
double	int
inputs current date maturity date coupon payment frequency int coupon amount double

400728
margins	padding
i ve tried setting css properties on the form itself such as floating eliminating margins and padding display inline etc but as long as the form s there there is extra spacing

400751
vb.net	vb6
so when microsoft made vb.net incompatible with vb6 this was a big deal for many of us

400753
arguments	default
keyword arguments default to a new

400755
order	add
of course add in your own where-clause and order by clause in the subquery

400756
webforms	asp.net
i ve built web sites using classic asp asp.net webforms and lately asp.net with extjs

400756
ruby-on-rails	django
i ve only briefly looked at ruby-on-rails and django but they look like a step in the right direction

400757
httpwebrequest	webrequest
you can t through inheritance from httpwebrequest if you don t want to call the serialization constructor but you can through composition and delegation and through inheritance from webrequest i m not sure if that will do it for you but functionally it is quite similar

400757
httpwebrequest	webrequest
in this case you then can t have the class be a httpwebrequest as in an is-a relationship since you can t extend from it but it wil be a webrequest which should suffice

400757
httpwebrequest	webrequest
you could write a class that inherits from webrequest that has an instance member of type webrequest create a httpwebrequest and assign to instance member in the constructor of the new type and delegate all calls to that reference sort of a decorator pattern

400764
versioning	upgrade
however i prefer to have a versioning table that can contains multiple rows with fields for the versioning number the time the update occured and the user that performed the upgrade

400764
versioning	upgrade
if you want to be really clever you can put checks in you upgrade scripting so they won t run unless the previous versioning of the database is correct

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
this is the primary use that i ve found for entity-relationship er diagram and the er model in general

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
in fact entity-relationship diagram don t need foreign keys at all

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
a well built entity-relationship diagram will have ventity-relationshipy little harmful redundancy in it but that s largely sentity-relationshipendipity and not the result of careful planning

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
the entities and relationships in a stakeholdentity-relationship oriented entity-relationship diagram should only include entities that are undentity-relationshipstood by the subject mattentity-relationship expentity-relationshipts and not include entities or relationships that are added in the course of logical database-design

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
the beauty of entity-relationship models and diagram is that they can be used to talk about data not only in databases but also as the data appears in forms that usentity-relationships can see

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
it s possible to turn a well built entity-relationship diagram into a modentity-relationshipately well built relational schema by a fairly mechanical process

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
a few technical stakeholdentity-relationships need to undentity-relationshipstand the relational schema and not mentity-relationshipely the entity-relationship diagram

400779
order	join
then join that table to the order table

400782
linux	unix
anyone who is running a unix linux system and doesn t use ssh is just being irresponsible

400803
contains	any
further suppose that the application no longer contains a references to the parent for or any of the child forms

400822
contains	set
i ve got some shell stuff set up that dynamically defines aliases depending on what sort of vc repo the cwd contains -- so for example d runs svn diff or git diff depending

400822
git-repo	repo
i d like to define some alias differently depending on whether i m in a git-repo versus a git-svn repo

400824
startup	launch
you could launch a thread on startup that will delete files that exist when they shouldn t to recover from your crash

400828
delphi	basic
they can be used from delphi even from visual basic there are interface units modules for both

400831
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
otherwise you can build dynamic-sql be careful of sql-injection attacks

400832
persistence	hibernate
you can also look at the caveatemptor which the sample application developed for the book java persistence with hibernate

400836
javascript	dom
we are noticing that when the page dom grows relatively large say 70kb to 150kb worth of html excluding external css javascript and images and or has very deep nesting 14-25 levels from body to deepest tag jquery events fire more slowly or the whole javascript user experience gets sluggish

400843
contains	set
i have a background image set on #navigation li items this contains the left side corner and i then have a second background image the right corner this is set using #navigation a

400857
pascal	delphi
you could use 7zip lzma bindings for pascal compatible with delphi

400860
http	ssl
just use winhttp it s a great api and has all you need to do ssl over http plus works with the proxy configuration of vista going forward

400867
keyboard	mouse
getting proficient with a mix of sr and keyboard mouse is much easier than full hands-free operation

400891
frame	width
i have tried the kb article that sets the height and width to 100 and the frame custom rules to table-layout auto but this doesn t work

400892
altera	fpga
i ve used the altera nios ii processor embedded on a fpga

400892
verilog	vhdl
i suppose that a similar setup can be achieved by downloading a vhdl verilog core of your cpu did you try opencores

400895
typedef	struct
in a typical c or c++ compiler the question of whether x is a type or not is answerable because the parsing communicates such information to the lexer as soon as it processes a typedef or struct declaration

400899
streamreader	streamwriter
the other answers talk about calling close explicitly - i would suggest that instead of doing that you wrap the use of the streamwriter and streamreader and streams in a using statement

400937
panels	grid
another thought is placing the grid on an asp.net panels and placing the panels in the div or table cell

400938
g++	gcc
it has been a while since i ve used anything but gcc g++

400939
scrollable	grid
what i had to do was limit the height of the grid by putting it in my own div which had overflow-y scrollable

400943
jquery-plugins	jquery
generally speaking jquery-plugins are namespaces on the jquery scope

400958
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loops to loops through the data but the length needs to be know or the data needs to be terminated by a know value eg

400967
constructor	object
populate the datatable object in a static constructor to the class

400989
contains	lookup
i have an arrays contains the name of cities that i need to lookup the weather for

400989
for-loop	loops
i inserted an alert in the for-loops and the success function and it seems like the loops gets executed cities.length times then i get the success function alerts

401014
silverlight	wpf
i ve been doing some wpf development for the last few months and i ve recently started silverlight development

401014
silverlight	wpf
so my question is how do you learn wpf or silverlight

401014
silverlight	wpf
really this is a major sticking point and something that microsoft needs to address to get the hordes of developers up and running with wpf silverlight efficiently

401015
macros	vba
i have been writing a vba macros that opens a html document within excel in order to perform various calculations on it

401020
www-mechanize	lwp
downloading content lwp simple lwp user-agent www-mechanize

401024
exception-handling	try-catch
short of inserting a try-catch block in each worker thread methods is there a way to deal with unhandled non-ui thread exception-handling in windows forms

401036
onkeydown	keyevent
onkeydown keyevent event

401036
keyevent	onkeyup
onkeyup keyevent event

401040
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i perform a hit test on the super layer when the touchesbegan and touchesmoved methods are invoked

401042
for-loop	arrays
the index variable cityidx is updated in the closure you create as the for-loop is processed so by the time your function on success is run cityidx will point to the last element in the arrays

401066
final	super
so when a new feature is developed the super user is the one who first validate the design suggestion and than performs the final stages of testing before deployment

401067
perl	php
i ve got a project i m working on converting some legacy perl cgi forms to php

401074
having	select
restrict protected data from being read from select statements without having to assign individual column permissions on underlying tables

401074
instrumentation	profiling
instrumentation log profiling and tune the application sps as named database interface components of your system without affecting or re-deploying the application code

401095
deployment	install
deployment is more than just copying files we need to stop start services call an exe file that executes database scripts initiate a number of setup.exe install etc

401106
deployment	install
personally i would take the hit to have a bootstrap script that ensures powershell is install and then use powershell as the actual deployment script

401108
modifiers	final
and then the label it says it automatically uses ctrl + alt with the intent of picking the final character and no other modifiers -- i assume to avoid overlap with existing shortcut keys

401114
jquery	.post
right now i have a jsp page that allows to sort some items when is ready and a link is clicked a javascript function converts all the info into xml text in a variable after this i need to send this xml to the jsp page again i tried putting the info in a hidden input and submiting the form sending with .post and a few more jquery functions but nothing worked

401125
silverlight	wpf
between wpf and silverlight

401142
jquery	.post
trying using the jquery ajax api - you can use it to send arbitrary data via get or .post and you don t need to set up a hidden form or anything

401200
udp	tcp
some solutions can selectively filtering traffic for instance by port number tcp or udp etc

401200
traffic	wan
apposite technoligies sell dedicated hardware solutions for simulating wan links with a web based gui for configuring the settings and collecting traffic measurements

401222
contains	any
header-files are c files except that they shouldn t contains any code implementation only declarations

401234
revision	svn
use svn revision to label build in ccnet

401244
callback	methods
here is an example of the callback methods i am using

401261
xsd	xml
consider using xml as file format xlsx for office 2007 or using the excel workbook xsd for somewhat older versions. then you would be freed from using the excel api on the server

401291
exception-handling	try-catch
occasionally i ll try-catch and throw a different more appropriate exception-handling

401305
contains	any
if my tabheader user-controls does not contains any sub-controls and i call mycontrol.focus from the mouseclick event focus returns true

401308
value	field
when you say new guid the runtime gives you a new object where all the field are initialized to their default value

401310
adplus	dump
i m about to capture a dump using adplus and windbg of the iis processes and try to figure out what s wrong

401323
directory	folder
this returns each individual folder in the directory arrays

401331
bazaar	git
i asked specifically about subversion but i d also like to hear about how bazaar mercurial and git handle this case too.

401334
shutdown	logging
logging asp.net application shutdown events

401346
value	field
i have the following structure message message table may have multiple fields fields table and each field may have multiple subfields stored in the same fields table with the only difference that fields dont have value in the parentfield column

401375
networkcredentials	system.net
mfc does not have a networkcredentials class but if you use .net clr then you can find networkcredentials in the system.net namespace link is to a pertinent msdn article

401378
python	perl
you might find it easier to use python or perl as they have better date-handling optins

401394
exception-handling	try-catch
to handle the exception-handling you must insert a try-catch block inside the code that is executing within the thread

401421
linux	unix
some information on how it is done in ubuntu and this is a generalized guide for linux unix

401429
javascript	dom
the problem is the this. this in javascript refers to the dom object

401442
default-value	default
this just happens to be the default for guid similar to int32 s default-value of 0

401463
javascript	dom
what is really going on is that i need to determine from inside a src d dynamically inserted javascript file where it is located in the dom

401506
worksheet	excel
there is a product called sql xl which allows you to run sql queries from within excel and the results appear within the worksheet it can also update

401514
any	set
then check if any other button has its cancel property set to true

401515
directory	folder
the solution to this problem was to do temporary impersonation with a user account that had access to the share permissions on the folder and permissions on the virtual directory

401523
directory	folder
the answer to this solution for me was to setup temporary impersonation with a user account that had access to the share the folder and the virtual directory

401528
terracotta	gridgain
if i decided that object reuse was important i d do it with product like terracotta tangersol gridgain etc

401533
value	field
edit2 reading through the docs on sqlite data types it seems that you might be able to just make the signature field span 26 columns of type integer and sqlite will do the right thing and only use as many bits as required to store the value

401546
perl	php
language imaginable php perl .asp

401557
contains	set
handling the selected action is done throught the contains screen object i ve done this below using a menuitem i m not really sure how to set a default selected listener you may have to detect key and trackwheel events

401570
sqlcompare	redgate
i ve been using the redgate sqlcompare and i can say that i couldn t live without it anymore

401603
payment	billing
each tme you receive a monthly payment i m assuming the credit card billing company would post something to a scripting on your website

401628
specifications	w3c
i ve got what seems to be a workable way to use jquery to capture mouse input and the various chord keys based on the w3c dom mouse events specifications

401628
button	popup
reports left-clicks as coming from mouse button #0 but for some reason this code still isn t capturing middle-clicks on the span and right-clicks still popup the context menu

401639
firefox	safari
the browser webkit which is what the iphone uses ie firefox safari doesn t see what happens on the server which is where the asp.net lives

401642
json	xml
however remember javafx can call java code and it can also make remote calls either getting back xml or json

401642
json	xml
where it can be written in java or .net or assembler if you can get your assembler to emit xml or json

401664
export	report
when my winforms app renders the report it export files to the location specified in the relativepath field

401684
hash	md5
never hash passwords with sha1 or md5 or even sha256

401684
pbkdf2	scrypt
use pbkdf2 if you cannot use either bcrypt or scrypt with sha2 hash

401684
linux	unix
scrypt will be better than bcrypt in time but it hasn t seen adoption as a standard by linux unix or by webservers and hasn t had in-depth reviews of its algorithm posted yet

401684
installation	environment
phpass supports php 3.0.18 through 5.3 so it is usable on almost every installation imaginableâ and should be used if you don t know for certain that your environment supports bcrypt

401684
credentials	account
attack your own software internally and attempt to steal user credentials or modify other user s account or access their data

401695
javascript	dom
you can t read the css file javascript just inspect the results in the dom

401698
hash	md5
there are actually websites that do just this - you can feed it a md5 hash and it spits out a known plaintext that generates that particular hash

401720
inherited	subclass
usually each definition instance is a subclass of a general class for that definition type wankelengine inherited enginetype

401725
revision	svn
if metadata in the git-svn repository has been turned on you can see if any svn revision has been used in the current head by using something like this

401743
web-services	webserver
i have a delphi webserver providing some web-services

401745
instances	destroy
moreover it does not need to check pointers or keep around instances that should have been destroy

401745
lighting	uniform
the proxy-pattern allows the client to be dependent on a lighting weight object that completely wraps up the details of the api s inner workings and maintains a constant uniform interface

401760
haskell	lua
it will execute c c++ d haskell lua and many others online and display the results

401777
user-controls	ascx
do i have to use an ascx user-controls or can i bypass that step

401797
msbuild	nant
i had written and maintained a non-trivial build scripting clean generate-assembly-info build test coverage analysis package in msbuild ms xml-driven nant effort and it was very painful

401819
contains	any
that query will return all rows where columntocheck contains any non-alphanumeric characters

401835
startup	launch
in terms of actually getting the application to launch at startup having a link in the startup folder is your best bet

401844
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
an objectinputstream deserializes primitive data and objects previously written using an objectoutputstream

401851
convention	standards
now we need a naming convention for widget and other variables generally to use it as a standards in all of our code so that the code gets better readability and we get better coordination between programmers

401888
hardware	monitor
it monitor this data and triggers another piece of hardware if the analog data reaches a threshold

401888
decrement	increment
is it possible to increment decrement the index or do i need to use a shift register that i can either increment decrement as needed ie decrement it if the redo button is pressed

401897
administration	account
i am running the install via an administration account so i m not sure why it would not have access to this

401908
getter	setter
so the question then become this is there a way i can develop a managed interface to json classes that both lets me use setter and getter for properties but also allows me to get the json serialization behavior i desire

401910
debugging	trace
im a little confused over how to use the .net trace and debugging classes

401910
debugging	trace
why would you bother using trace instead of debugging

401910
debugging	trace
also i understand that debugging statements are ignored when your in release config mode but if trace statements apply all the time how does this affect performance

401949
value	field
a customer was storing a comma delimited list of 3 value in a varchar field classic asp application so they had a stored procedure that looked something like this

401961
pointers	stack
stack objects will be released in the opposite order to which they where instantiated so unless the developer using the api is trying to manage the smart pointers it s normally not going to be a problem

401965
message	alert
i want to send a wap push si but i want the message to look like an alert - like flash sms

401999
.net	wcf
wcf windows communication foundation has its own transaction monitor which is reasonable as the architecture of com+ is tightly coupled to com and would be difficult to retrofit a .net runtime to

401999
.net	wcf
if you re writing a transactional application in .net wcf provides this facility although the system.transactions library also provides distributed transaction support for ado.net clients

402022
contains	any
since i need to return all items that contains the string anywhere within the description i m forced to use a like string which eliminates any chance to use the index

402022
contains	any
the data and table structure are originally based on a progress database which has a wonderful contains operator on any word-indexed fields

402022
business-objects	data-access
this obviously lets us keep our domain business-objects separate from the data-access layer

402022
constructor	object
to make sure it wasn t because i was using a list object to hold all the items which i was instantiating with the needed capacity in its constructor to avoid dynamic resizing which i ve also read may cause extra memory usage when it implicity calls ensurecapacity i tried using an item arrays sized ahead of time

402034
httphandler	httpmodule
for example moving httpmodule and httphandler to their new location within

402051
protected	public
even if your protected variables was public instead of protected you won t have the desired input since this will output the entire object like this

402065
internet-explorer	firefox
it works fine in firefox 2 and 3 as the server my html page is located on is a valid referer but in internet-explorer it doesn t work the other server denies me the resource generates an http 403 error

402101
double-quotes	single-quotes
strings should be quoted as appropriate for their content single-quotes for literal strings double-quotes to allow variables interpolation

402104
hide	show
use jquery to add an onchange handler to your dropdown list and when the value of the dropdown list is other show the textbox otherwise hide it

402121
put	get
if you put in sufficient effort you would find that you get to the point where you can quickly design sites confidently which best illuminate your content

402123
worksheet	excel
is there a way to access an excel worksheet using javascript

402156
httpserver	webserver
webserver also called httpserver hosts the web application

402156
internet-explorer	firefox
web browser such as internet-explorer or firefox

402156
ruby-on-rails	django
the most easy ones to get started are ruby on ruby-on-rails and django over which an open source social network called pinax too is written

402156
tapestry	spring
there are much more comprehensive frameworks and libraries in java too for a single web appl you may need to join several of these libraries such as spring webwork tapestry lucene for search sitemesh for page decoration

402159
revision	svn
i messed up on my svn repository and now need to revert the entire repository from revision 28 to 24 and don t want to deal with diffs or conflicts

402186
clisp	sbcl
the expression is true for sbcl clisp allegro cl clozure cl and lispworks.

402212
contains	elements
each elements may contains only one background image

402216
order	join
otherwise your hash join would enforce order as well - meaning you d hash 1 million records from table 1 and table 2 then join to the 12 records in table 3

402225
svnadmin	dump
checkout svnadmin dump load

402228
revision	ignore
brutal yes but its the only thing guaranteed to completely ignore collisions and keep revision history intact

402244
32-bit	64bit
in 32-bit windows these are the same size but in windows x64 the void is 64bit

402247
web-applications	enterprise
i have been programming in java since 2004 mostly enterprise and web-applications

402248
repr	eval
use repr to turn the dictionary into a string and eval to turn the string back into a dictionary

402272
revision	updates
where 24 is the revision number and trunk is the file folder you d like to updates or restore in this case to said revision number

402283
unicode	wstring
i know wstring supports wide characters such as unicode characters

402296
32-bit	64bit
you ve probably heard processors described as being 16-bit 32-bit 64bit etc

402296
32-bit	64bit
sizeof is usually measured in bytes so code compiled for 32-bit processors will report the size of pointers to be 4 32-bit 8 bits per byte and code for 64bit processors will report the size of pointers to be 8 64 bits 8 bits per byte

402297
json	csv
the function invoice.tojson can be called successfully without having to know what kind of data invoice is - the result will be json no matter it if comes from a database xml csv or even another json object

402298
jedit	emacs
in addition i use jedit the only visual editor that i ve seen--besides emacs that allows you total control over highlighting

402330
urlclassloader	classpath
i tried using urlclassloader but it modifies the classpath and does not add to it

402338
persistence	hibernate
someone can use hibernate for persistence or jms for sending messages without ever considering it j2ee that is my case for example

402348
javascript	dom
i need to set get the cookies stored at first.com while browsing second.com i have full access of first.com but i only have javascript access can manipulate the dom as i want on second.com

402352
32-bit	64bit
if you are developing only for 32-bit targets you may choose to disable this and some other similar warnings by turning off the project option detect 64bit portability issues c++ compiler option wp64

402354
document	element
you could inject a scripting element into head of the document with a callback that passes the cookie you need to whatever function needs it

402355
sql-server	mysql
the editor has a clear and easy-to-follow wizard for connecting to microsoft sql-server and access databases but i don t see an easy way to add a remote mysql datasource

402357
xquery	xslt
.net at this date does not implement xpath 2.0 xslt 2.0 or xquery

402357
expression	evaluation
one can easily construct an xpath 1.0 expression the evaluation of which produces the same result as the function ends-with

402370
python	perl
perl python .

402379
put	get
so my recommendation is if you can afford it get a job no matter if the pay is bad put your hands on any jsp project as soon as you can

402410
shell	bash
there is a shell tool getopt which is another program not a bash builtin

402441
network-interface	packet
- clear the rx tx packet queue in the device-driver and the network-interface flushing it of any older queue packets

402448
selected	textbox
the above div is show on click of a textbox.i want that the user can choose any of the child div and its selected value appears in the textbox

402456
parentheses	operators
note the similarity between the type declaration and using it - the parentheses dereferencing operators and brackets are in the same places

402469
packets	lan
it needs its gateway to encapsulate the packets specifying its own ip as source so that the peer gateway will accept it de-capsulate it and send it to the remote host on the lan

402473
packets	ping
most of the clients would be behind a gateway and or firewall and your ping packets won t get through

402474
ruby-on-rails	django
so far i looked at cakephp symfony django and ruby-on-rails

402476
selected	button
then click the copy button and selected copy regex as java string

402476
backslash	regex
the extra backslash is essential when using a java string literal to store your regex

402477
autocomplete	autosuggest
you re definitely looking for autosuggest autocomplete this is rather time-consuming to implement fully if you want to do it in pure javascript but yes you could use the example from strager to get started

402482
delphi	c++
the cool thing is that you can do that either from delphi or c++ builder in your case or you can add javascript on the page to edit itself

402487
getattr	setattr
the basic of this approach is to use django s contibute_to_class methods to dynamically add a new field to your model and uses getattr setattr to do the serializing on demand

402504
32-bit	16-bit
how do i see the type of a variables whether it is unsigned 32-bit signed 16-bit etc

402507
python	java
see the examples below but there s no unsigned type in python just like java

402527
copy-constructor	constructor
for example that third constructor is not a copy-constructor and generally there are problems in this code so i wouldn t read too much into it

402527
getter	setter
it only initializes the bare minimum and lets users set the rest with getter and setter

402527
constructor	object
other constructor are often convenience constructor that help create object with less calls

402527
constructor	object
for example certain frameworks like digester used to create object directly from xml use default constructor

402527
constructor	object
you may see a default constructor when the initialization of the parent object is good enough

402528
constructor	private
if the constructor is complicated it is better to divide the construction into several protected private methods

402528
getter	setter
you may have getter and setter functions but probably may be avoided from the interface as described here

402550
protected	public
to allow subtyping of non-serializable classes to be serialization the subtyping may assume responsibility for saving and restoring the state of the supertype s public protected and if accessible package fields

402550
protected	public
during deserialization the fields of non-serializable classes will be initializer using the public or protected no-arg constructor of the class

402551
margins	padding
i always start by stripping out all the stylesheets and normalizing all my margins and padding to 0 for every major html dom element

402554
alpha	rgba
the combinated parts should have an alpha channel rgba instead of rgb so that you will only combine parts that have an alpha value set to a value of your choice

402564
decimal	hex
do you only need decimal instead of hex etc

402570
methods	extend
and a little fancy footwork can extend it to support using wildcarded pathnames to pick up entire directories of jars this code has some references to utility methods but their implementation should be obvious in the context

402576
quirks-mode	doctype
if it doesn t have a doctype the browser will render in quirks-mode and many things will not look quite right

402622
type-conversion	int
if i understand correctly the type-conversion will be converting a char arrays of size 8192 to a short int arrays of size half of that which is 4096

402623
unsigned	short
the statement that you show doesn t cast a char to an unsigned short it casts a pointer to a char to a pointer to an unsigned short

402623
unsigned	short
note that sizeof unsigned short is unlikely to be one so that won t necessarily correspond to

402623
unsigned	short
it is more likely - if say sizeof unsigned short is two - to correspond to and

402624
unsigned	short
when you do unsigned short slt unsigned short lookup_ext

402624
unsigned	short
of bytes equivalent to the size of unsigned short are picked up from the location given by lookup_ext and stored at the location pointed to by slt

402624
unsigned	short
since unsigned short would be 2 bytes first two bytes from lookup_ext would be stored in the location given by slt

402629
postgresql	mysql
for mysql and postgresql

402633
environment	building
i am trying to put a requirement together for a new environment to consist of teamcity running of sql-server a couple of building agents for now and an svn repository

402634
contains	set
if it contains parameters then set the parameters just like you would normally

402635
unsigned	short
that will interpret the bytes making up the arrays as unsigned short objects when you read from that pointer s target

402635
unsigned	short
strictly speaking the above is undefined behavior because you can t be sure the arrays is suitable aligned and you would read from a pointer that s not pointing at the type of the original pointed type unsigned char - unsigned short

402635
memmove	memcpy
that s all the struct and simple types that are possible in c too such as short broadly speaking is by using such library functions as memcpy or memmove

402635
unsigned	short
so if you read above you would interpret the first bytes of the arrays and try to read it as unsigned short that s called type pun

402655
hide	show
you might like to add events that hide and show the div when the textbox gains or loses focus

402669
compact-framework	.net
in your case the system.text.encoding.default property is supported by the .net compact-framework 3.5 2.0 1.0 so you should be all set

402669
compact-framework	.net
you can tell by looking at the icons small images to the left that while the .net compact-framework supports the encoding class some overloads got removed

402671
webrick	thin
after that both webrick and thin crashes immediately with

402681
contains	any
it is special any compiler needs it because it contains types that are required to make the language syntax work

402702
tortoisecvs	svn
i have updated tortoisecvs and tortoise svn

402704
python	c++
python doesn t have the same types as c c++ which appears to be your question

402716
constructor	object
the default constructor is used if the object have a global visibility into a method for example you want log the actual state of a object in a try catch

402726
constructor	private
shall there always be an empty constructor of course public or private but at least it allows you to keep control of how the class is being or not instantiated

402728
python	java
bruce eckel is a great sponsor of flex as cross-platform user interface for both java and python services

402744
logging	trace
i ve tended to use trace with an associated traceswitch for logging efforts in release environments -- a quick tweak of the app.config can then give different levels of logging without the need for recompilation which might make a problem go away anyway or the the need to attach a debugger

402795
db2-connect	ibm
you generally have to buy db2-connect from ibm to get these files and i suspect it would be a similar situation for the .net

402806
tree	trie
a suffix tree is more or less an advanced trie here you can also search for any substrings in o c as for the trie

402813
glib	gtk
for that reason the gtk glib c++ wrapper folks have developed a glib ustring class that can handle utf-8

402834
json	csv
you can convert excel to csv or json by using php and the show it in datatable using yui datatable or extjs data grid

402844
windows-xp	windows
but i can assure you it survivec many os updates from xp over windwos nt windows 2000 windows 2003 windows-xp windows 2003-64 and the oh-so-shiny vista

402907
icriteria	named
create your icriteria in the normal manner and then the associations named relationship property for me is prices and then the fetch type which can be join selected lazyload eager

402918
ubuntu	linux
let s take a linux os my ubuntu system is already unicode aware

402919
constructor	object
technically constructor is not a property of the s instance it is a property of the sub prototype object showing through

402919
constructor	object
when you create the sub function in mozilla you get a newly-minted default sub.prototype object which has a constructor pointing back to the sub function as a courtesy

402977
vmware	esx
edit we use vmware here and the reason we can t use real keys is that our esx servers are running more vms than they have real usb ports and sharing is not acceptible

402988
sql-server	mysql
i m not familiar with the mysql syntax but with sql-server you can do something with top for example

402989
constructor	object
i usually write one constructor that fully initializes the object

402989
.when	ready
an object should be 100 initializer and ready for use .when it s created

402996
arrays	loops
i want to pass an arrays of these objects in json format and have them deserialized as a list so i can loops through them on the server but asp.net says something about not being supported to be deserialized as an arrays

403010
precompiled-headers	header-files
i think the most difficult part is not the need to compile the header-files unless they are really big but you can use precompiled-headers in that case

403028
haskell	c++
two type systems that do this are the haskell type system which by consense is generally not regarded to be object-oriented and c++ templates with template subclassing

403051
silverlight	wpf
i ve had some limited exposure to wpf and silverlight and am finding them to be a complete mind change from the winforms model

403068
contains	any
in any case ms seems to view mscorlib.dll as the core lib needed for the system while system.dll contains the core functionality for programmers - which also sounds good

403094
delphi	c++
a better comparison is delphi vs c++ where delphi is much faster to compile

403108
javascript	dom
opera has most of the power of the desktop version including dom and javascript support but i m not sure it has an enbedding facility on windows mobile

403122
directory	folder
i put the typed dataset into one of the existing directories as it was in the app_code directory of the previous site but don t see the option to create that asp.net folder in this project

403154
administration	account
we have a system set up so that no account has administration access by default and everyone has their own account

403155
jquery	dojo
if you want to do ajax while maintaining support for multiple web browsers i would strongly recommend that you check out jquery prototype and dojo

403165
firefox	safari
the problem occurs both in safari and firefox latest version

403233
filtering	sorting
i use them to create dynamic queries whether it be for sorting or filtering the data

403242
function-parameter	local-variables
local-variables are allocated on the stack so an arrays whose length depends on a function-parameter at run time violates this rule

403242
pointers	stack
a is still a local variables allocated on stack but instead of being the whole arrays which has variables length it s just a pointers to an arrays which is always the same size and thus known at compile time

403274
put	get
and with svn you can set up ignores for files and folders so the files in your web projects dont get put into svn and the ignore attributes are checked out onto each developer s machine

403292
.when	ready
.when you re ready to initializer the encoder display this form using the showdialog methods

403292
.when	ready
and .when you re ready to display the dialog you would do so like this

403345
default	reset
a reset button should be used only when there is default information

403397
deep-copy	object
the downside of this is that you have to deep-copy your l2s object into your datacontract hierarchy but the upside is that you can only include fields that are necessary and proper for transport over a network

403398
object-reference	instances
i have the drivers for this but when i followed the tutorials including adding the pooling and connection reset properties i get an error that object-reference not set to an instances of an object

403412
xcopy	runas
one might be able to use the exec task to launch the runas command to copy or xcopy the files over to a computer with a different username password

403412
administration	account
if this is a non-domain account you might have to use the local administration account to authentication

403430
contains	set
alternately you can set up your build scripting nant to ignore files contains test when you build your release executable

403443
administration	account
i have been able to send email from an administration account on the server and through a sql-server agent job

403452
xsd	xml
altova s xml spy has a feature that will generate sql ddl script from an xsd file

403464
private-members	private
i disagree with him somewhat i tend to use _ to prefix truly private-members in my own classes because it makes it clear to me what is private

403488
filtering	sorting
finding the exact position of where the item is supposed to go into the list box would be pretty complex based on any sorting filtering rules you have

403503
ssl-certificate	ssl
even if you use ssl a user can perform a man-in-the-middle attack the security is handled by the browser so if the user overrides the ssl-certificate it will be allowed to get access to your data protocol

403509
show	next
if the delete fails however i want a little error message to show up next to the delete button when the page rendering again remember there is a delete button for every order line on the page so i only want the message next to the one i click

403549
entity	pojo
can you describe the pros and cons of including an oid typically a database row identifier in a pojo representing an entity in your model

403560
selenium-ide	selenium
i m recording with the selenium-ide and copying the test over into fitnesse using the selenium bridge fixture

403563
linux	osx
i have no idea about osx except it is more likey to follow the linux pattern

403581
contains	set
a special case of this prohibition is that it is not permissible for a set to contains itself as an element

403583
protected	public
edit a little too late after asking this question i realized i d forgotten to exclude the standard pattern of package protected implementation classes possibly providing implementation of public interfaces

403589
spring	grails
until spring gets the groovy grails eclipse plugins whipped up to do something other than mere color coding your best bet is to use an ide like intelij which has the best groovy support at the moment

403590
profiling	trace
profiling applications such as dottrace from jetbrains may play into it and i have already isolated some operations that are taking a while within the page using trace

403604
rewrite	rule
basically install that then set a rule to remove the .html that way it hits your rewrite engine

403656
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
argumentexception argumentoutofrangeexception argumentnullexception or similar

403711
radio-button	selected
also rather than two buttons have two radio-buttons and one ok button with the don t continue radio-button selected as default

403714
associations	model
the most important part however is that these methods can be called through an associations has_many etc. to automatically link the two model

403721
required	checked
a disclaimer that required you to agree to it by checked a box before the user could continue

403740
primitive	int
the contains methods searches by reference correct i believe even for primitive so if you re trying to find a string or an int in an arraycollection you ll have to do the searching yourself by some variation of looping or searching

403747
linux	osx
cross-platform the application is be coded with cross-platform in mind windows - linux ubuntu - mac osx so the localized text system have to be cross platform too

403756
constructor	object
in my understanding the constructor is called upon the moment i create an object is this correct

403758
any	set
perhaps a better approach is for your code to dynamically set the class attributes on the div tag and then store any specific css settings in the style sheet

403766
constructor	object
yes the constructor is called when the object is created

403766
constructor	object
a question also asked why this should be used a real life example is a database class where you call the object with the username and password and table to connect to which the constructor would connect to

403769
base-class	subclass
in the interests of full disclosure i should warn you that i have the toolstrippanel and one of the toolstrips added to a base-class form and i am trying to add the other toolstrip to a subclass form that inherits from the base-class form

403779
contains	elements
this code hooks into the tooltip-show event during the capture phase before it displays to scale and positioning it appropriately based on the scale of the contains elements -- in this case the parentapplication document

403783
where-clause	sql
i changed the join into a where-clause this should eliminate all of the complex sub queries that linq generates when translating to sql

403789
constructor	object
the constructor allows you to ensure that the object is put in a particular state before you attempt to use it

403789
constructor	object
for example if your object has certain properties that are required for it to be used you could initialize them in the constructor

403789
constructor	object
also constructor allow a efficient way to initialize object

403837
32-bit	64bit
i was trying to add the 32-bit version of system.web to a 64bit sql-server and i think the 32-bit version indeed references the 64bit version

403849
selected	checkbox
you must selected the checkbox to state that you accept this responsibility

403849
checkbox	button
and then a checkbox with yes i accept the responsibility for my actions and two button

403849
checkbox	button
yes i want to delete it this button should only be enabled if the checkbox is checked

403862
ref	out
also - with the first option you probably wouldn t need ref - it would be sufficient to use out

403868
hide	show
i am using .ajaxstart and .ajaxstop to show and hide a progress indicator

403882
iteration	set
on each iteration determine which bits are set

403902
build-process	ant
i know that there have not been any good solutions using compiler arguments like one could do in c or c++ and am leaning to some best way to edit either the source file containing the constants or putting them into another file and swapping them out using the ant build-process

403925
void	main
the only main downside for me is the void register_object

403925
constructor	object
if i instantiate either class within main c++ provides a constructor with calls the base constructor and automatically registers the object

403943
attributes	properties
what is the correct way to configure the properties some attributes other than data-members to allow a get-only or a private-set properties to pass it over the wire

403947
postgresql	mysql
i haven t worked with mysql but postgresql so there might slight variation in interpretation of things here

403959
jar	war
pass its name to ant via -d or build.properties and copy the file to your build directory right before you jar or war it up

403971
json	xml
you can get significantly better client-side performance by using javascript and json instead of xml and xslt

403971
json	xml
i haven t benchmarked it but i d bet that the biggest performance gain comes out of the fact that parsing json is much less cpu-intensive than parsing xml

403972
hard-drive	floppy
at boot the bios scans all bootable devices in order like the floppy drive the hard-drive and the cd rom

403973
msbuild	nant
to stay within nant one could use msbuild or vcbuild directly by using the exec task

403973
msbuild	nant
you could then use the latest .86 beta 1 version of nant combined with nantcontrib provides msbuild task to get 3.5 support

403980
specifications	w3c
the w3c specifications for soap refers to the namespace

403983
concat	where
at the least you can pull the sql out from java code that most likely uses stringbuffer and append or string concat into xml where it is just easier to maintain

403994
g++	gcc
both gcc and g++ support the -v verbose flag which makes them output details of the current task

404014
google-chrome	firefox
| setup | | google-chrome usr lib firefox-3.0.5 firefox |

404019
put	get
i can put in the windows s opening block and it compiles and shows up in the vs design windows fine but during actual runtime i get a parsing exception-handling mywindowsstyle could not be found

404038
google-chrome	firefox
| setup | | google-chrome usr lib firefox-3.0.5 firefox |

404045
spring	jsf
there are literally hundreds now struts jsf spring wicket etc.

404073
internet-explorer	firefox
the following code works in firefox but fails in internet-explorer 7 when i try to swap two options

404093
getter	setter
saves you time of repeating setter and getter all the time

404096
scala	java
i think the last sentence is the most interesting of all i tend to err on the side of the database-as-model camp because i think objects are overrated. java c++ and c# are certainly the dominant languages but functional programming is making a comeback with f# scala etc

404118
screens	tablet
when on a tablet pc touching the screens with your pen is interpreter as a click

404118
mousedown	mouseup
the only events that one cares about are mousedown and mouseup

404118
mousedown	mouseup
what i m finding is that my tablet driver on windows is batching the mousedown and mouseup together for strokes that are shorter than a certain time

404170
sql-server	oracle
i am able to make my code work seamlessly with sql-server or oracle one using identity the other using sequences through my dal and i couldn t be happier

404183
command-line	cmd
if it is larger than that you can try this cmd at the cmd-line to edit the application setting for xcode

404193
double-quotes	spaces
this usually include spaces comma slashes colons quetion marks double-quotes etc

404219
contains	set
this generates foogen contains the fields and get set methods as well as making them bound which is optional

404224
oracle	mysql
are you using mssql mysql oracle

404225
contains	set
for third-party libs you can either set up a single eclipse project contains and exporting all of your jars i don t recommend this or a separate project for each third-party lib exporting the jar

404246
design-patterns	anti-patterns
when it comes to smaller applications of this nature i generally worry more about anti-patterns than i do about design-patterns

404280
administration	account
we tried logging on to this machine with an administration account and see the same thing

404280
deployment	install
we create the install and i want to know how our deployment project can detect and handle this situation

404280
selected	button
a technician logged on to the affected machine as an administrator and says the app does appear in the add remove control panel but there s no remove button selected it shows app info but no button

404284
package-private	inner-classes
package-private classes use inner-classes

404284
package-private	inner-classes
another poster suggested there is a small performance penalty for inner-classes vs package-private classes but to me that s not a good reason for bad design

404284
package-private	inner-classes
package-private and inner-classes i consider to be implementation details and as such i think it s better to hide them as inner-classes

404284
data-members	private
package private data-members i can see no reason for these at all

404295
lookup	any
this is really nice because it doesn t use any more spaces than an int and when you are looking at the source data you don t have to link the lookup table to know what the heck the value is

404302
contains	any
itself doesn t contains any native code

404305
enumerator	any
that said in any case you really should put another entry in your enumerator defining the value of the amount of items

404312
32-bit	64bit
.net code that isn t specifically compiled for 32-bit will run 64bit if it can

404333
transcoding	flv
both transcode and mencoder use ffmpeg and all three can handle the tasks that you require including flv transcoding and video thumbnailing

404343
screenshot	fps
options to use -r specifies a frame rate of 1 fps one frame used as the screenshot -ss seeks to the positioning you want hh mm ss fff -t is the duration one second to match your one fps -an tells ffmpeg to ignore audio and -s is the size of the screenshot

404355
contains	set
if by multiple arguments you mean the possibly more than one pseudo-attributes contains in the data the answer is that your code must parsing the data using some standard string methods as the c# split and retrieve the set of name-value pairs for all pseudo-attributes

404368
entity-framework	data-access
short of implementing nhibernate or entity-framework what is the best practice for the data-access code if these objects are being written to a single database-table

404371
python	java
i don t know python but i know how to write it in java

404378
output	cat
pretty much what we re doing is using the commands.getouput function to run a couple of shell scripting namely wvtext which extracts text from a word document and cat to read the file output

404384
order	join
join are defined as lists of objects for example order has a list of order details

404421
scheme	forth
furthermore i d like this interpreter to run inside emacs so i can jump back and forth between files of scheme code and the interactive interpreter and so forth

404446
name-mangling	wrapper
i wrote a little wrapper around the prototype function to allow me to get mangled controls in javascript despite the name-mangling

404461
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
with php frameworks like codeigniter i m not sure about ruby-on-rails your forced into the class method extra url structure

404462
cursor	row
and if you re not careful and do get two or more rows purporting to store the same information and you then need to update the information there is a danger especially if you use cursor that you will update just one row rather than every row so the rows are out of synchrony and no-one knows which row contains the correct information

404481
vb.net	vba
dunno how that s done in vb.net but in vba it would be something like

404487
click	mouse
in java you should be able process the mouse pressed mouse moved and mouse released events and ignore mouse click events altogether to be able to program the behavior you want

404539
protected	public
this scoping is irrelevant to your public protected private friend member-access-control

404542
vmware	esx
i haven t used vmware esx servers so this may not be valid in your case but at least in vmware workstation shared folder appear as network drives

404551
skinning	skin
it s relatively easy to convert an open source css templates into a dotnetnuke skin as well if you have some familiarity with html css and dotnetnuke skinning

404566
put	get
minor comments i put off to the right indented to column 81 to get them out of the way of the code

404570
iteration	elements
the only other technique that i ve occasionally used is to restart the whole iteration when you find the first elements to delete

404604
linux	unix
lots of ipcs are offered by unix linux pipes sockets shared memory dbus message-queues.

404626
32-bit	16-bit
for example certain arm processors provide an alternative instruction set thumb that almost halves code size by using 16-bit instructions instead of the normal 32-bit

404634
environment	execution
i also like the ability to rendering a freemarker or velocity templates in any kind of execution environment junit main methods without requiring a servlet jsp containers as jsp would

404651
selected	listbox
with a listbox i have the following code to extract the item selected

404651
selected	cell
i want to do something similar for a datagridview that is when the selection changes retrieve the contents of the first cell in the row selected

404659
cos	sin
if you only need 64 entries in a lut that s 16 4 bytes for sin cos tan use symmetry

404659
cos	sin
compared to a large sin cos tan function

404659
16-bit	8bit
audio may be reduced from 16-bit to 8bit or even 4-bit and stereo can be converted to mono

404676
python	java
edit i understand that c# java and ruby are strongly typed and that only ruby like python and others is dynamically typed while java c# are statically typed

404683
python	java
c# in v4.0 will add dynamic features but till now java and c# have had a completely different and more strict paradigm than dynamic languages such as ruby and python

404684
rewrite	rule
i just want to know how to write rewrite rule for this url

404708
debugging	exit
i like style 1 just because the loop has one entry point per iteration and one exit point per iteration so it s easy to insert debugging code at the end of the loop and know it ll get called

404713
data-members	private
but if you mark propertyb with a data-members then you must have a setter private proptected or public in order to serialization it correctly otherwise you may get an exception-handling

404713
getter	setter
please note that if you use svcutil.exe the generated proxy class will have both public getter and setter for the property which might not be what you are looking for

404715
python	ruby
another dynamic language that s fairly similar to ruby is python

404715
ruby	php
python and quite possibly ruby are actually strongly typed meaning you can confidently do type comparisons and can t do php tricks like adding numeric strings to get a number

404720
viewdidload	dealloc
i guess the correct positioninging to register for notification is viewdidload methods and correct positioning to unregister for same notifications is dealloc methods

404721
partition-problem	np-hard
this is very close to the partition-problem which is np-hard

404749
.when	ready
.when you are ready to read books on the subject i recommend michael feather s working effectively with legacy code

404802
exception-handling	try-catch
also since you raised the issue yes the try-catch block does incur some overhead even if the exception-handling is not thrown

404809
innodb	myisam
it seems like i will be needing transaction with mysql and i have no idea how should i manage transactions in mysql with mixed innodb myisam tables it all seems like a huge mess

404816
account	userid
assuming an account locks with 3 incorrect attempts then having a 4 digit pin plus a user id component userid 999999 + pin 1234 gives you a 3 10000 chance of someone guessing

404819
contains	set
it contains two x members with one set to 5 and one to 6

404823
configuration	environment
the only issue you may run into is the developer s machines will probably not have the exact same configuration runtime environment as the test and production server

404823
version-control	cvs
as far as mysql version-control put your schema in your source code management system cvs svn perforce whatever

404848
variables	boolean
if you re using an hungarian-influenced regime then you can tell visually that a given variables is boolean so being specific about whether it s true or false is less of an issue

404850
variables	boolean
if you have more specific requirements for your boolean you can always do some prep work tests on your variables and assign it to another variables with better defined boolean values

404868
callback	methods
i wouldn t extract the methods calls validations callback plugins etc into modules though i d limit the extraction to my own methodss

404873
notepad++	scite
notepad++ is based on the editing component scintilla - for which at sourceforge there is a response to a request for this feature no need for this to be included in scite as you can add this command to the tools menu using the parameters dialog. so is it possible to do multi-line replace in files in notepad++

404875
oracle	mysql
i have a batch file that was created for an oracle database that i m now trying to import to a mysql database

404883
variables	boolean
i would say that if you are comparing a true integer then never do an implicit conversion to boolean as it implies a different meaning to the variables

404883
boolean	int
boolean or int that is basicaly a boolean

404890
selected	checkbox
i have set the firewall to allow incoming http connections firewall settings window- advanced tab- selected my network connection- settings- services- check webserver http checkbox

404893
traffic	packets
i also recommend you uncheck what you checked asap since windows client operating systemd aren t particularly suited for packets forwarding and settings on that tab sometimes mysteriously interfere with normals network traffic like in your case.

404916
iostream	boost
boost format is nice because it allows you to use printf -like syntax and will throw an exception if the arguments you supply don t match the format string whereas string formatting with c++ iostream tends to make your code quite verbose

404921
perl	c++
it s the style i ve used ever since in my c perl c++ vb.net since obviously the point becomes moot in c# whihc doesn t actually allow the if x scenario unless x is actually a boolean of course

404926
variables	boolean
when using it on boolean variables i strongly believe in easily readable names

404926
variables	boolean
i usually name boolean variables used like that with names beginning with is has or something similar

404928
sql-server	oracle
maybe not an anti pattern but it annoys me is when dba s of certain db s ok i m talking about oracle here write sql-server code using oracle style and code conventions and complain when it runs so bad

404931
sql-server	oracle
putting stuff in temporary tables especially people who switch from sql-server to oracle have a habit of overusing temporary tables

404932
viewdidload	dealloc
in this case you could get the viewdidload message sent a second time after the memory event when your view is brought back on screens by its navigation controller. thus you ll have two registrations of the same object but only one removal in its dealloc

404941
postgresql	mysql
edit i will be using postgresql mysql i haven t decided yet

404945
digits	short
i d go for 9 digits if you want to keep it short or 12 digits if you want a bit more security from automated guessing

404957
animation	rotation
using iphone calayer i want a rotation animation for my spirit layer but i also want a callback for the animation end hot to do that

404972
versioning	upgrade
is easy to push upgrade to both versioning

404976
firefox	safari
it has already been implemented using a nasty browser specific style -moz-border-radius in firefox and safari --

404980
buffering	streaming
some parsing operations can be performed on streaming as the bytes arrive rather than copy into buffering and parsing

404988
webforms	asp.net
i have an asp.net webforms application that is being extended in unforeseen directions meaning that certain bits of code are being adapted for multiple uses

404992
search-engine	web-crawler
the tag has little rank or relevance to search-engine web-crawler

404996
version-control	cvs
to cherry-pick a merge the method described in pragmatic version-control using cvs is very good

404999
python	java
exceptions are handled more efficiently in python than in java which is at least partly why you see that construct in python

405003
cvs	git
wincvs for cvs tortoisesvn and trac for svn and git-gui for git

405006
lookup	any
ensure any lookup tables or other constant data are actually declared using const

405008
linux	osx
on linux and osx the versions are appended to the filename librecorder.so.0.0.1

405022
innodb	myisam
i think you are overrating the performance difference between myisam and innodb

405022
innodb	myisam
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries

405022
innodb	myisam
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns

405034
radio-button	selected
in the form below either zero or one radio-button may be selected

405039
any	set
is there any way how to set std setw manipulator or its function width permanently

405055
switching	screens
this will allow you to draw on screens using only 2d coordinates if you want 3d later on switching from ortho to perspective view and you have 3d however i don t think it will help you reuse the code since the 2d ortho view is usually done with texturess and you cannot transform a textures to a 3d mesh

405056
variables	boolean
i generally prefer if variables or if variables is used as a boolean even if there isn t any such type in the language

405056
perl	c++
some languages like perl and c++ provide extra or even user defined interpretations of trueness

405056
variables	boolean
if the conversion to a boolean seems too magic remember it s basically just an is_true variables or variables.booleanvalue or something like that behind the scene just a more concise syntax

405070
postgresql	mysql
better yet if your application can work across multiple dbs oracle mysql postgresql sql lite ms sql server then your clients can leverage either a free cheap db or use an existing in house db

405073
shared-objects	.so
i used registerclass on part and arrayofpart .so they both are serialization to shared-objects

405078
selected	button
however examples of 3d code i have seen all look to operate on a very low level and what i can t figure out are the appropriate co-ordinates to be using or how the user would be able to interact with the view by selected items with the mouse for example clicking an expand or info button to get edit task properties with the usual swing components

405087
positioning	embed
and then send the positioning arrays to some server side scripting which turns it into css which you can then embed into the html page that the user can download

405099
python	ruby
there have been many jvm languages in the recent few years including javascript python ruby etc

405106
python	php
i have realised that the reason i m asking so many questions may not be because i m so new to python but i know a good bit of php and is probably not because python has some inherent flaw

405106
python	php
maybe this will show some massive flaw in my understanding of python 6 months vs the 3 years of php

405111
wamp	php
if other developers are involved you probably want to setup your version control such that both the database schema javascript css and the php code can be checked out and setup on a developer s personal box pretty easily assuming they have the correct lamp wamp setup

405111
revision	svn
with svn you can really just do an update of the live code with svn update specifying a revision or tag that indicates the current live version

405115
java-3d	jogl
to be honest having tried both if you use jogl instead you ll find there s tonnes of opengl examples to copy that sort of thing from and you won t have to code around the limits of the scene graph java-3d gives you

405122
linux	osx
small note i work on osx so the specific applications used might be a bit different from you if you re a linux windows user

405124
linked-list	arrays
instead of a linked-list i would personally allocate an arrays reallocating as necessary

405143
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i ve had this problem before it boiled down to the version of rspec i had not working with the version of ruby-on-rails i was using

405143
ruby-on-rails	rspec
iirc it was a 2.1 ruby-on-rails and the updated rspec hadn t been released as a gem

405143
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i ve taken to just using the head of master rspec with whatever version of ruby-on-rails i happen to be on it seems stable to me and isn t going to break things in production unless somehow a test broke with a false positive

405144
linked-list	arrays
you can keep track of the arrayss by linking them in a linked-list or having a higher level arrays that keeps the pointers to the data arrayss

405148
revision	svn
use svn revision to label build in ccnet

405161
python	java
i work in java but any tip in c c++ c# python perl.

405165
python	ruby
which one is closer to lisp python or ruby

405165
perl	ruby
i can t seem to be able to choose from python and ruby they seem very similar but apparently ruby is more functional and object-oriented which are good things while python is more like perl a simple scripting language

405165
ruby-on-rails	django
ps - this might seem like a flame bait but it s not really i m just trying not to go crazy from ocd about switching from ruby-on-rails to python django and back

405171
uicontrol	uibutton
it s in the uicontrol class which is the superclass of uibutton

405193
export	report
i need to export the crystal report to text file

405195
contains	elements
declaration space to contains elements

405206
python	ruby
now for web development python might seem like a more scattered option than ruby with the plethora of python web frameworks available

405206
python	ruby
as ruby and python niches overlap i agree with kiv that it is partly a matter of personal taste which one you pick

405211
python	ruby
both ruby and python are very object-oriented and support functional programming

405216
value	field
there are two things you should do to ensure you have a value in a field

405216
value	field
make sure the field in the current does not have a null value

405221
memcached	apc
use a virtual drive in your ram google it for a how to for your distro or if your data is provided by php use apc memcached might work well with mysql

405228
python	ruby
personally i think ruby can read more like pseudo-code than python

405228
perl	ruby
a lot of ruby s syntax was borrowed from perl though and i haven t seen much python code that feels similar though again i have little experience with python

405228
python	ruby
you can get a working knowledge of each of them in an afternoon and while you won t be writing awesome ruby or python you can probably establish a feel for each and decide which you like more

405228
python	ruby
update i think your question should actually be two separate discussions one with ruby one with python

405231
bugzilla	mantis
i ve used bugzilla and mantis and found bugzilla better from a technical point of view but mantis wins if some of your bug reporters are not programmers not programmer minded

405232
bug-tracking	fogbugz
fogbugz wiki release estimates bug-tracking

405246
daemons	systemd
i m writing a a very small daemons that must remain responsive even when a systemd is under severe stress

405261
virtual-machine	vmware
use a virtual-machine such as vmware

405265
scheme	lisp
if you are looking at some example written in scheme or say lisp perhaps even perl

405265
lgpl	gpl
even rms himself will admit that interpreting the gpl agpl lgpl can be tedious they expect and welcome these kinds of questions

405268
associations	model
having no knowledge of your object model it s a bit harder to advise but i d say that if you re absolutely convinced that all of the validations associations callbacks need to be in that place there are still ways of factors out common behaviors

405295
triggers	insert
triggers cannot modify the changed data insert or deleted otherwise you could get infinite recursion as the changes invoked the trigger again

405295
triggers	insert
edit the reason for this is that the standard for sql is that insert and deleted rows cannot be modified by the triggers

405300
json	xml
since most servers will limit the amount of data you can transmit in a single message i found it helpful to use json over the obvious alternative xml

405305
triggers	insert
i think the right way is to use instead of triggers to prevent the wrong data from being insert rather than deleting it post-factum

405309
reflection	runtime
your code would compile but there would still be runtime errors when reflection would try access non-existent variables

405310
python	ruby
both ruby and python are fairly distant from the lisp traditions of immutable data programs as data and macros

405310
smalltalk	lisp
but ruby is very nearly a clone of smalltalk and i hope will grow more like smalltalk as the perlish cruft is deprecated and smalltalk like lisp is a language that takes one idea to extremes

405310
smalltalk	lisp
based on your desire to do cool hacks on the language level i d go with ruby as it inherits a lot of the metaprogramming mindset from smalltalk and that mindset is connected to the lisp tradition

405312
python	ruby
it s a bit dated now but i agree with the basic gist of it python and ruby are two different ways of implementing the same thing

405312
python	ruby
sure there are some things you can do in ruby that you can t do in python

405312
python	ruby
and sure python syntax is arguably better than ruby s

405312
python	ruby
a common thing that you will hear is this the platform is more important than the language and python has a better platform than ruby this argument works both ways so don t vote me down all you rubyists

405317
python	ruby
afaik python support for unicode is better than ruby s especially since python 3.0

405333
callable-statement	jdbc
i m currently writing an implementation of a jdbc driver yes you read that correctly in a tdd manner and while i have only finished class stubs at this point and only some minor functionality it just occured to me that since statement is a superclass for preparedstatement which is a superclass for callable-statement what should i do when i really start to write tests for my implementations of those classes which one of these should i do

405333
superclass	inherited
test each implementation individually ignoring the methods inherited from superclass es

405342
python	ruby
i will admit that i ve used python much more than ruby but i wouldn t say that i have any great preference between the two apart from familiarity

405342
python	ruby
i ve used python off and on since about 1998 and i like the smalltalkish-ness of ruby as i used smalltalk briefly about 15 years ago

405342
python	ruby
i would like certain features from ruby or smalltalk for that matter but python doesn t work that way

405342
python	ruby
django seems to be the winner of the python web framework melee and rails seems to be in the process of crossing the chasm and bringing ruby along with it

405344
subclassing	base-class
i am also generally sceptical of subclassing test classes other than the general utility base-class

405344
base-class	subclass
so the base-class has a separate test usually with a test-local private subclass that is used for testing it specifically and i use my knowledge of the subclasses to write proper tests for each subclass

405350
union-all	union
when you use union instead of union-all duplicated results are thrown away

405352
connection-pooling	pool
i recall hearing that the connection process in mysql was designed to be very fast compared to other rdbmses and that therefore using a library that provides connection-pooling sqlalchemy won t actually help you that much if you enable the connection pool

405355
base-class	subclass
therefore when implementing a subclass you can restrict to testing only the behaviors that are different from the base-class

405361
superclass	subclass
the author of the subclass makes assumptions about the superclass

405361
superclass	subclass
the superclass changes and the subclass is now broken

405378
required	checked
the problem with checked if there is a record with the same value is that it required you to lock the table for modifications until you insert the new record to prevent race conditional

405382
perl	ruby
ruby is more flexible in the perl way and you can do a lot of hacks

405382
python	ruby
ruby s basic types can be modified in a hackish way that typically prototype languages allow while python basic types are more suited for subclassing

405382
perl	ruby
by the way i would add a minor correction both ruby and python are very very object-oriented and neither is intended to be used for quick-and-dirty scripts the perl way

405382
perl	ruby
among the two ruby is syntactically more similar to perl than python

405387
postgresql	mysql
brazil is ruby ruby on rails based and supports change deployment to any database that ruby dbi supports mysql odbc oracle postgresql sqlite

405395
callback	methods
if you set a delegate for a caanimation you can add the callback methods

405403
triggers	insert
instead of deleting an invalid row after it has been inserted write an instead of triggers to insert only if you verify the row is valid

405403
triggers	insert
just make the triggers silently not do an insert that isn t valid

405403
triggers	insert
note that instead of triggers do not cause recursion if you insert into the same table for which the trigger is defined

405409
contains	any
so for example how can i get all the href values of any link tags contains in the html held in data without adding it to the dom first

405432
ruby	php
i know i know why don t use php ruby python insert your favorite web language here etc

405433
data-structures	dictionary
i m am looking for specific suggestions or references to an algorithm and or data-structures for encoding a list of words into what would effectively would turn out to be a spell checking dictionary

405434
keyword	synonym
in mysql the keyword key is simply a synonym for index

405437
value	field
i initially started to just use the observe_field functionality to observe the auto_complete_text_field value and then update another value based on the users selection as shown below but i was unable to reference the innerhtml of the text field as required by the observed_field

405442
python	php
i am writing the website in php and writing the program that interacts with the databases in python

405463
union-all	union
lose the distinct clauses as your union vs union-all will take care of removing duplicates

405466
instanceof	typeof
using instanceof rather than typeof circumvents some of these

405474
python	ruby
python is a good language and i enjoy working with it too but i think ruby is somewhat more lispy in the degree of freedom it gives to the programmer

405474
perl	ruby
python certainly isn t more perlishâ ruby is essentially a smalltalk perl mashup some of its less-used features are pulled directly from perl whereas python is only distantly related to either

405509
perl	ruby
i actually think python is the perfect tool for the job i just don t want to expose that to the user would like the same even if it were written in java perl ruby or anything else

405543
sql-server	oracle
however i believe the relational model provided by sql is infinitely more powerful and useful and products like oracle and sql-server deserve their success in the marketplace

405545
pkcs#12	pfx
pfx files are pkcs#12 personal information exchange syntax standard bundles

405567
pointers	stack
since you return the address of the variables once the function returns stack is useless but you ve returned a pointers to a struct on the old stack

405577
python	ruby
some might say ruby rails for web python for everything else

405585
pointers	stack
with indicating stack pointers to the last used element of stack

405585
pointers	stack
but then you return stack pointers is decremented

405668
any	set
in any case if you do a fetchall its a result set not a single result

405684
jquery	.post
i have a javascript jquery html5 page interact with my php script using .post

405684
contains	any
where xxx contains no ã chars works as expected but it does not if there is any ã char

405694
filesystems	fileserver
as kamil kisiel says when subversion is accessing the repository directly off the filesystems that is the repository url is of form file path to repo or file fileserver path to repo it uses your filesystems permissions to access the repository

405727
lgpl	gpl
the website says it supports the following licenses apache license 2.0 common development and distribution license cddl eclipse public license epl gnu general public license gpl v2 gnu library general public license lgpl microsoft public license ms-pl microsoft reciprocal license ms-rl mozilla public license 1.1 mpl new bsd license and the mit license

405747
updating	updates
then i can updates the library-project when i am updating my whole solution

405751
calayer	uiview
for iphone game development seems there are very like functions using calayer and uiview we can implement our spirit using calayer or uiview and animation are usable for them too

405751
calayer	uiview
but for coding there are many difference between calayer and uiview like object methods and properties etc

405757
uiresponder	uiview
if you need it to have uiresponder characteristics respond to events you should probably use a uiview

405761
haskell	ocaml
in statically typed functional programming languages like standard ml f# ocaml and haskell a function will usually be written with the parameters separated from each other and from the function name simply by whitespace

405766
unicode	wstring
what i want is for the interface into the lib to be with unicode strings wstring instead of normal strings

405776
32-bit	64bit
whats the best resource to look at for when migrating dotnet applications from 32-bit to 64bit

405780
put	get
i ve thought about simply having the get request block until the move is played-- my client would put the coordinates of my move to

405803
sql-server	mysql
i suspect the difference is due to the fact that sql-server has a much more robust query optimizer than mysql

405805
boolean	int
there s no fundamental reason you need tuples in a programming language you can build up tuples in the lambda calculus just as you can boolean and int mdash

405809
haskell	fortran
if you want more powerful optimisations move to a more strongly typed language like fortran or haskell where the compilers are given much more information to work with

405830
linked-list	arrays
an insertion is when you add an element to a sequence an arrays or linked-list for example without erasing anything that was present before

405840
constructor	private
make the constructor private

405841
apache-mina	mina
but there are other implementation out there mina is just the first one i can recall

405845
buffering	streaming
socket handling is really pretty straight forward in java and it will let you streaming the data without loading the entire file into memory which is what happens behind the scenes without your own buffering

405846
unsigned	short
you cannot re-define xmlchar to be an unsigned short

405853
contains	any
that means that any defects or design flaws it contains are outside of my control

405856
packaging	building
then your building scripting can very simply ignore when it comes time for packaging and deployment

405899
bazaar	git
ciarã n walsh has replaced svnmate with projectplus -- in addition to subverison it handles git mercurial bazaar and svk

405910
populate	row
i have a query to insert a row into a table which has a field called id which is populate using an auto_increment on the column

405912
scala	java
people spend a lot of time trying to figure out ways to prevent programs from having bugs in them and type systems like those in java and scala are attempts to prevent bugs but right now no one is using type systems to make statements about execution time as far as i know

405917
value	field
an empty string is a fine sentinel value for a blank name field phone number or annual income for any application

405919
value	field
think about the state machine here you have field which have several states it slounds like you re thinking about a state of unitialized another of purposefully empty and a third with some set value

405924
value	field
in that case all current employees should have a value of null in that field

405924
input-field	checkbox
as for getting them to actually enter a null value for the values that truly require a null value i would put a checkbox next to the input-field so that the user can check it on and off to see the corresponding value to null or in a more user friendly manner none

405924
checkbox	textbox
when enabling the checkbox to set the field to null the corresponding textbox should be disabled and if a null value is already associated it should start out as disabled and only become enabled once the user unchecks the null checkbox

405930
convention	standards
this consensus is respected by every statically typed functional language since standards ml which purely as a matter of convention uses tuples for functions that take multiple arguments

405936
scriptaculous	dojo
i suspect any of the major packages will work like rico scriptaculous or dojo

405946
benchmarking	profiling
the best way to make sure your code is fast is to benchmarking or profiling it

405951
oprofile	gprof
in terms of free tools check out gprof or oprofile if you are on a unix environment

405956
arrays	loops
thus with large two-dimensional arrays there can be a significant speed difference between choosing rows or columns as your inner loops variable

405967
selected	textbox
the wpf textbox natively makes use of the system highlight color for painting the background of selected text

405968
python	php
alternatively you can write all of the database interaction in python then have your php website call those python scripts using php s system function

405986
arrays	loops
the main difference i can observe is the first loops manages to use stloc and ldloc for positions 2 and 3 for the first arrays and the x index variable

405995
ocaml	lua
could you please give a code snippet showing how to use lua embedded in ocaml

405995
ocaml	lua
as a non-c programmer could i implement this without having to write an intermediary c program to pass the data between lua and ocaml

405995
ocaml	lua
ocaml prompts for a name calls the lua function and prints the return value

406004
subproject	libs
my project has several subproject in particular a libs a user executable and a unit test executable

406004
subproject	libs
i would like makefiles i type make and this happens for each subproject to execute cmake as above and build only that subproject with dependencies so the libs would be built from the executable makefiles if needed

406004
subproject	libs
the resulting binary .so libs or executable should be in the subproject s directory

406011
operators	keyword
as a language they add meaning to specific keyword or operators

406013
valgrind	gprof
on the rare occasions when it isn t for c++ and objective caml i use the venerable gprof and the excellent valgrind with its superb visualizer kcachegrind part of the kde sdk

406017
value	field
if you re fetching the value from a database and it s null sql there most likely the php function to grab the record will return null php for that field

406020
global-variables	call
the advantage of this is that i can call timer as many times as i want without worrying about global-variables etc

406020
global-variables	call
is there a clean way to make setinterval stop after a certain number of call without using global-variables

406026
authentication	login
login - you login to an software application either for authentication or authentication

406028
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort and mergesort are faster in terms of sorting and should be always used before a bubble sort

406029
logout	login
i personally prefer login logout but i know lots of software that uses logon logoff

406033
put	get
it sounds like you re willing to put up with a little unfaithfulness to a true projection to get simpler calculations

406035
logout	login
login logout logon and logoff are all nouns

406036
ocaml	lua
i m not aware of a mature set of bindings for embedding the c implementation of lua into ocaml

406037
response	timeout
if the connection drops or you get a timeout you simply reconnect until you get a valid response

406046
.when	ready
it depends some people like to have the trunk stable work in branches and then merge the branches back to the trunk .when the features are ready but you can also commit directly to the trunk

406050
enumerator	any
pod type s data-members must be public and can be of any the primitive-types bool numeric types enumerator types data-pointer types pointer-to-function type also arrays of any of the previous

406055
scalac	javac
sun s javac does have some basic optimizations as does scalac groovyc etc

406097
javascript	dom
do any of these projects or others address the performance of dom operations or are they purely javascript computation related

406107
command-line	cmd
this should work if the make -f gui-make all cmd works on the cmd-line and we ve hidden cmake in the generating target

406110
for-loop	arrays
a fairly simple for-loop to iterate through elements in an arrays

406124
any	set
i know it doesn t affect you but if you use any other protocols such as streaming or any udp based protocols set the maximum packet size to atleast 1300 bytes or lower

406124
tcp-ip	udp
with tcp-ip we use mss-clamping to protect against large packet issues but this cannot be applied to any udp transmissions or anything secure protocol that uses an authentication header

406124
any	set
some proxies are set to not allow any keep-alive sessions go through them even though i beleive most of the new ones are fine

406140
any	set
you may need to do some set up to create a test environment including any data you want to use in the test in which to carry this out

406148
methods	extend
for instance if you have a and b and your class c extends them both and a has a makejuice methods which makes orange juice and you extend that to make orange juice with a twist of lime what happens when the designer for b adds a makejuice methods which generates and electrical current

406152
instance-variables	local-variables
when reading large chunks of code written by other people at certain points i would often get confused as to whether they were referencing instance-variables or local-variables

406155
svn	rcs
i am using svn for development tasks but still have many files managed with rcs because it does not seem reasonable to edit them in my private svn repository working copy since they re often just configuration files that are also best tested in-place

406155
svn	rcs
it also doesn t seem reasonable to have a working copy of the repository wherever there are files to put under svn control so i just use rcs instead

406173
versioning	upgrade
at the moment i ve made it a practice to upgrade to the latest versioning as soon as possible

406174
javascript	dom
unless a particular dom method call is implemented in javascript they ll have little effect not to say there hasn t been work done on reducing the overhead of such calls however

406214
revision	updates
that will updates the current folder s revision number and all associated metadata

406226
nsstring	uilabel
i can t find the documentation for the nsstring sizewithfont forwidth linebreakmode methods see kevin ballard s answer to sizing a uilabel in the iphone sdk to fit

406249
postdata	request
i m also able to get data from the gae service i did it after reading another question written here but now i need to postdata so i need to send the authentication token in the header of the post request

406255
buildr	maven
there are examples of this like buildr the drop in-replacement for maven for java that is built on top of rake

406258
solaris	ubuntu
we have currently standardized on 5.8.8 on our ubuntu workstation and solaris production platforms and i m wondering about the pros and cons of making small step to 5.8.9 or a larger one to 5.10.0

406266
restart	reload
you d have to restart to reload any modifications to the settings

406280
required	checked
this would then required changing the public key and the hash as well as understanding the program or changing the program code itself to subvert the checked

406288
getter	setter
i recently started working in java and was introduced to the wild and crazy world of getter and setter for everything

406288
getter	setter
one of the things i am trying to do is avoid the trap of doing getter and setter for everything

406288
getter	setter
however much of the work i do is with entities that are mainly data containers and i am not certain that getter and setter are actually inappropriate in these cases

406288
getter	setter
here is a simple example using private properties and using getter and setter

406288
getter	setter
i have read several discussions about getter and setter being evil and or an anti-pattern but it really feels like those might not apply to this situation

406296
nested	order
the way to do nested list comprehensions is to put the for statements in the same order as they would go in regular nested for statements

406303
getter	setter
that being said getter and setter tend to be overused

406323
javascript	dom
for that reason i believe they are looking at implementing more of the dom in javascript or at least in a javascript friendly manner

406323
javascript	dom
the other issue i mentioned was the dom - javascript binding cost -- this can actually play a very significant part in web performance the best example of this is safari 3.1 2 vs chrome at the dromaeo benchmark

406323
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is based off of the safari 3.1 2 branch of webkit so it s reasonably safe to assume similar dom performance compiler difference could cause some degree of variance

406323
javascript	dom
in this benchmark safari 3.1 2 actually beats chrome despite having a javascript engine that is clearly much much slower this is basically due to more efficient bindings between javascriptc webcore the dom rendering etc of webkit and v8 webcore

406342
contains	elements
to still force override the stackpanel behavior i think you d need to dynamically compute-set the width property of the contains elements or some funky override of measureoverride

406344
hash	md5
the best option is going to be code signing -- either using a tool supplied by your local friendly os for example if you re targeting windows you probably want to take a look at authenticode where the operating system handles the tampering or by rolling your own option storing md5 hash and comparing

406350
getter	setter
getter setter are evil except for plain data storage objects which itself is just an evangelism of tell don t ask

406350
getter	setter
ideally if a class has getter and setter that s all it should have

406352
command-line	cmd
i ve tried these two matlab c-compilators set up with the mbuild -setup cmd in the matlab cmd-line

406408
contains	any
the regex above will match any string or line without a line break not contains the sub string hede

406426
smalltalk	lisp
to tell you the truth i just want an excuse to dive into lisp smalltalk aren t smalltalk lisp clojure the same

406426
python	ruby
- like python and ruby

406426
prolog	lisp
i also checked prolog and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than lisp but i d like to hear what you think

406426
common-lisp	smalltalk
i always confuse common-lisp with smalltalk

406426
prolog	lisp
also what i meant by other people that are fond of the basic language is that i don t prefer a language with semantics like lisp for people with no cs background and i find prolog a little bit more intuitive but that s my opinion after i just messed a little bit with both of them

406441
arrays	loops
if you get a list of files in an arrays files and the names are base names so you don t have to fiddle with file basename then the loops might look like

406455
prolog	lisp
there are several good free some as in speech some as in beer implementations of smalltalk prolog and lisp

406464
triggers	insert
constraints may occur specifically if you are using innodb engine where an insert will fail but actions from your before triggers will succeed

406464
triggers	insert
stick with after triggers for most other operations such as insert into a history table or updating a denormalization

406470
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if iâ m working in a team that already as a good background on webforms development style itâ s far easier to introduce mvp than asp.net-mvc

406470
asp.net-mvc	webforms
my experience tells me that moving a team from webforms to mvp and then from mvp to asp.net-mvc is relatively easy

406470
asp.net-mvc	webforms
moving from webforms to asp.net-mvc is more difficult

406474
put	get
i don t know if it s better or worse but one way to structure it is to get rid of all smartness from your entity data transfer object product and put everything including create retreive retreiveall save getrelatedproducts etc

406479
smalltalk	lisp
aren t smalltalk lisp clojure the same

406479
python	ruby
- like python and ruby

406479
python	ruby
and python or ruby are classic imperative oo languages with some limited functional ability

406481
gedit	gnome
for handling files on ftp shares i just mount them using the places- connect to server functionality and then the remote files are easily accessible from gedit or any other gnome program for that matter

406504
textbox	button
say i have textbox dropdownlists and submit button

406504
margins	padding
which means that officially margins padding width and height properties should be ignored in practice not really

406504
display	height
if i were to go the right way to set the height to a button i would write something like display block and then define the height

406504
any	set
i have not noticed any issues with both inline elements forced to render as block elements without being floated or width set or with the list item example

406504
safari	opera
it works just fine in ie7 ff3 opera 9 and safari whatever the current version is

406548
domain-object	repository
when using the repository pattern instead of activerecord don t reference to the repository in the domain-object product

406562
struts-1.x	struts
keep in mind this only works with struts-1.x and not struts 2

406571
double-quotes	spaces
if you are wondering why there are the double-quotes into the cp command it is for cope with filename contains spaces

406585
command-line	cmd
use the tee 1 cmd which duplicates its standard input to standard output and any files specified on the cmd-line

406588
margins	padding
officially margins padding width

406589
configuration	installation
virtualisation with snapshots or non-persistent disks is really useful for testing software installation in a known clean configuration nothing left over from previous buggy installs of your software

406601
python	c++
unless there is a particular reason for sticking with c++ you could well be better off switching to python and using beautifulsoup

406630
copy-constructor	constructor
strictly speaking in the first case the default constructor is called followed by the assignment operator and in the second case it uses just the copy-constructor

406630
copy-constructor	constructor
okay my initial assumption was wrong and apparently in both cases just the copy-constructor would get called well in the assignment case an additional conversion constructor may be called as well

406634
safari	opera
looks weird but works great on all common browsers ie6 7 ff2 3 opera safari

406637
credentials	security
system error could not acquire security credentials error 8009030e

406642
bug-tracking	bugzilla
it seems that the bugzilla one of the oldest large open-source bug-tracking tools currently used for mozilla projects thunderbird firefox etc might have the features you want checkout their grouping security

406649
stderr	stdout
iirc the studio s output windows display not only stdout and stderr but also trace messages

406656
virtualization	vmware
i used the virtualization approach using vmware server when the task in front of me was to test a clustered environment of websphere application server

406656
virtual-machine	vmware
after setting up vmware server i created a new virtual-machine and did all the software installations that i would need like websphere app server oracle websphere commerce etc after which i shutdown the vm and copied over the virtual hard disk image to two different files one as a clone vm and another as a backup

406656
virtualization	vmware
the snapshot functionality which exists in both vmware and microsoft s virtual pc server is good enough to consider virtualization for scenarios where you think you might do breaking changes which may not be that easy to revert

406661
sql-server	mysql
you ll have to forgive the sql-server style variable names i don t remember how mysql does variable naming

406665
authentication	login
i am verifying my login authentication using asp.net web-services

406667
ruby	php
i m a php and ruby programmer

406668
ruby-on-rails	django
hypothetically if i were to build the same app using a few popular similar frameworks say php cakephp|zend django and ruby-on-rails should the memory consumption of each be roughly the same

406671
webserver	security
storing application code in the document tree of the webserver is a security concern

406678
safari	opera
as i mentioned it works in current ie7 ff3 opera 9 and safari

406679
ruby-on-rails	django
it is hard to efficiently say i would say that php frameworks will have mostly a similar footprint which is typically less than other frameworks such as ruby-on-rails and django

406695
any	set
i want to then use that set to delete any files from a specific directory that do not belong to the torrent

406711
bad-request	http-error
besides this looking ugly it then also generates a http-error 400 - bad-request when following the link which i ve not yet tracked down the cause of

406729
common-lisp	lisp
a search query on google reveals that the search term practical lisp returns a link for practical common-lisp which is a very nice starter book

406744
command-prompt	cmd
it is for invoking shell cmd the kind of thing you type in at a command-prompt

406745
python	c++
i ve been programming in idl c++ labview python pascal for 20 years and i think you should use the language environment that s best suited for the job

406745
python	ruby
i certainly wouldn t use python or ruby for that

406745
python	c++
how much have you contributed to c++ python ruby etc

406745
python	java
it s true there are free read no money being transfered c++ python java compilers but ittvis is a commercial company who wants to make money

406777
postgresql	oracle
it looks that all other jdbc drivers i tested oracle and postgresql shows timestamp columns with miliseconds if i use getstring

406783
any	set
doing this way you set a min-width to ie6 and you won t have any other problems

406787
getter	setter
i really dislike when people tell me to use getter and setter instead of making the variables public when you should be able to both get and set the class-variables

406797
data-members	private
same reason why some people like to prepend private data-members with m_ or name interfaces ifoo

406807
getter	setter
getter and setter are highly overused

406807
getter	setter
i ve seen millions of people claiming that public fields are evil so they make them private and provide getter and setter for all of them

406807
getter	setter
now creating private fields and then using the ide to automatically generate getter and setter for every one of them is nearly as bad as using public fields

406816
environment	building
i don t think support will go away soon as happened with cocoa java since it is pretty solidly part of gcc and the fact that objective-c++ compiles down to straight c++ in the same way that objective-c can compile down to straight c but i still don t find it a very pleasant environment to building software in compared with objective-c and being able to comfortably fully use the os x-provided frameworks

406825
for-loop	loops
if you can t apply loops invariants to a trivial for-loops you re not worth your salt as a supposed computer scientist

406833
python	lua
or an easy way to run for example lua python in a sandbox no filesystem access no creation of objects etc and be called from ruby rails 2.2

406833
prolog	lisp
but it has to be an easy language i saw there was a prolog in ruby even a lisp but i don t think they are easy to learn languages...

406834
constructor	private
the c++ type should not have any constructor must not overload the assignment operator must not have virtual functions base classes destructor and also non-static members that are private or protected

406838
set	bag
i m not sure how you do it with fluent nhibernate but you need to set the cascade option on the bag tripitems

406840
uniform	points
however uniform random placement of the points yields a significant probability of failing the path requirement all points being connectible by a path with no step greater than 100

406840
uniform	points
the revised algorithm below produces points sets whose stats are very similar to those of purely uniform random placement but which are guaranteed by construction to satisfy the path requirement

406840
subtract	add
apply dx and dy to the previous point based on horizontal and vertical travel right down - add left up - subtract

406842
silverlight	wpf
in particular select day two - internationalizing wpf and silverlight applications

406852
json	xml
dealing with json is much easier than xml from the javascript side.

406855
carbon	cocoa
usage is likely to rise as carbon applications are moved to cocoa front ends

406907
python	ruby
why historically speaking did this happen for ruby but not for python

406907
python	ruby
please avoid discussions of whether ruby or python is better which is just too open-ended to answer.

406913
scheme	lisp
script-fu under gimp is also lisp the scheme dialect

406940
python	ruby
so the question is really why did david hansson decide to write rails in ruby rather than python

406949
python	ruby
and yes i would say ruby is to rails as python is to django

406951
interpreter	runtime
i ll never understand the wisdom of letting the developer waste costly time tracking down runtime errors caused by variables name typos instead of simply letting the compiler interpreter catch them

406952
database-table	unique-key
that at least during initial design every database-table well almost every one should be clearly defined to contain some clearly understanable business entity or system-level domain abstraction and that whether or not you use it as a a primary key and as foreign keys in other dependant tables some column attribute or subset of the table attributes should be clearly defined to represent a unique-key for that table entity abstraction

406963
swing	gwt
i don t know if gwt would accept the jpanel solution - the app is not written in any way that gwt can parse - it s not using the gwt api it s using the swing api

406963
swing	gwt
afaik the only way to mix swing with gwt would be in an applet fashion

406965
curly-braces	conditional
if you scream when you see both styles of curly-braces on a page why or why don t you scream when you see free formatted sql or sql that obscures or obfuscates the join conditional

406967
duplicates	contains
the library contains many other enhancements to the ide also some which are duplicates in other packages such as gexperts

406977
functional-programming	imperative
lisp - much closer to functional-programming although with imperative overtones

406977
python	ruby
python and ruby - i lump these together at the risk of further annoying fans of either

406977
python	ruby
the use of indentation-only for control nesting in python and the perl-like use of special characters in ruby are often points of complaint by newcomers

406982
qmainwindow	qdialog
qmainwindow has special behavior for the central widget that a qdialog does not

406982
assign	add
to achieve the desired behavior you need to create a layout add the textarea to the layout and assign the layout to the dialog

406987
javascript	dom
i ve been using javascript to do lightweight functionality on sites for years - dom manipulation etc - but just now im beginning to investigate using it to do a lot more of the heavy lifting in combo with php

406992
required	checked
checked for the existence of the executable files you will required using which or similar

406992
required	checked
you can also use the executable files arguments and checked for required versioning as well if needed

407003
python	ruby
before rails python was much more widely used than ruby and so had a number of competing web frameworks each slowly building their constituencies

407056
launchd	daemons
it has jsvc launchd which suports starting and stopping java-based daemons services

407070
keyboard	mouse
here is some code that looks for mouse and keyboard activity with the applicatin

407074
environment	building
vc++ is what matters most since in the other environment we use custom python building scripting so i can do whatever i want

407074
revision	svn
we use svn so we were looking at using the output of svnversion to write the revision to a header and include it

407074
revision	svn
this has problems if we put the file in svn it will appear as modified every time but it would be a superfluous commit and in a sense generate an infinite loop of increasing revision

407080
export	csv
basically they make the schedule on one program export it to a csv and then upload it on a web page for all of the webapps that need that data

407108
sqldatasource	gridview
and i m trying to get the return value using the below code sqldatasource gridview combo in vb .net

407181
administration	account
it s a sudo-similar as known from linux approach to running as unprivileged user but having the possibility to promote to an administration account with password when needed

407182
pixels	line
there are also several 6-pixel wide x11 fonts that are less than 13 pixels high often named clear so you can get more line on the screen

407182
pixels	line
lucida console is not quite as tall as 6x13 so it gives more line for a given number of pixels vertically

407260
python	ruby
rails dominates ruby - there is no single application that dominates python mainly because the python community is somewhat bigger than the ruby community

407274
haskell	erlang
now there is a new option use the haskell erlang ffi to write your logic in haskell and communicate using erlang

407280
firefox	safari
only safari so far seems not to be able to set cookies but ie6 and firefox work fine.

407287
registration	login
what i want to do is load this snippet of code again when the user clicks login with ajax and use a jquery effect probably fade that smoothly makes the side-panel transition from login registration to the shiny users-only panel

407290
python	java
i for instance made the same client app for kde and gnome for the first i used python and for the second c# even when my day job is at a java shop

407293
radio-button	selected
why not just add a different name attribute to the input and only validate it if the other radio-button has been selected

407320
rollback	commit
and then im doing commit or rollback depending on if it went well or not

407328
hide	show
when you get a successful login hide the login div and show the user panels div

407343
swing	awt
is it okay to skip the awt and swing package i learned a bit of the basic though

407358
swing	awt
you should certainly write swing for desktop java only using awt to the degree that swing demands it

407361
swing	awt
when learning swing you ll find that you will come to know those parts of awt that are still important such as event layoutmanager graphics font color etc

407362
build-process	ant
how can i add what is described in the above sentence to my ant build-process

407369
python	ruby
support for multiple languages has been part of .net since its beginning and having the .net runtime in silverlight 2.0 means you can code your client-side logic in c# visual basic or thanks to the dynamic language runtime dlr iron ruby or iron python

407391
swing	awt
it explains some of the history of awt and swing

407391
swing	awt
swing being a lightweight alternative successor to most of the awt classes

407395
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms

407395
webforms	asp.net
o in asp.net webforms or mvc you are caching on the server

407395
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms

407395
webforms	asp.net
o silverlight is a completely different programming platform than either asp.net webforms or mvc

407395
data-access	ado.net
o data-access in silverlight is limited to web-services wcf ado.net data services

407395
stored-procedures	ado.net
you cannot make direct calls via ado.net or stored-procedures to a database

407402
sql-server	mysql
i m not new to sql i m a mysql person but i am still new to the ms sql-server stuff

407412
python	ruby
implemented it in python ruby php5 and released it to public domain

407412
scheme	let
let s weaken our password hashing scheme

407414
python	ruby
implemented it in python ruby php5 and released it to public domain

407414
scheme	let
let s weaken our password hashing scheme

407415
perl	php
having used python php perl and a few other dynamically typed languages i find that well-written code in these languages follows static typing conventions for example

407415
python	perl
i actually use ocaml s repl for ad hoc throwaway scripts in exactly the same way everyone else uses perl or python as a scripting language

407451
google-chrome	firefox
if my app has been tested in firefox 3 safari 3 ie 7 will it need additional testing for google-chrome

407456
export	report
is there any way to export the contents of a crystal report to a text file - i am using vs 2005

407464
python	c++
i m making a game engine in c++ and python

407468
directory	folder
i ve placed this .py file in my my documents directory and placed a shortcut to it in my send to folder the shortcut url is

407474
google-chrome	safari
if it s working fine on safari it will probably work on google-chrome as well

407475
google-chrome	safari
theoretically because google-chrome uses the same engine as safari webkit you ve already tested

407475
google-chrome	firefox
now that gmail suggests people switch from ie to firefox and google-chrome i m guessing we ll see ie lose more and more market share to those browsers

407476
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses the webkit rendering engine which is also used in safari and some other small browsers

407476
google-chrome	safari
overall with both google-chrome and safari gaining in market share it is definately a browser to test you only really need to test one

407482
google-chrome	safari
i ve already run across sites that work in safari but don t in google-chrome

407482
google-chrome	safari
i have ie8b2 ff3 safari and google-chrome all installed on my machine

407483
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses the webkit engine which as i recall is the same engine used by safari

407483
google-chrome	safari
so in theory if your site works for safari it should work for google-chrome as well

407484
oracle	mysql
sql that is written for ms-sql is different than sql for oracle ibm mysql sybase etc

407485
xquery	xslt
you may try using the saxon xslt xquery processor

407493
swing	awt
skip awt and swing

407493
swing	swt
in the broader sense i have a number of java applications although i am not too sure if they use swing or swt

407500
perl	php
i come from more of a sysadmin shell perl and my real programming php type background

407506
swing	gwt
is the concept behind gwt and awt and swing the same or different

407524
swing	awt
awt and swing are for programming stand-alone applications and to a lesser extent applets

407524
web-applications	gwt
gwt is supposed to make programming web-applications similar to stand-alone apps

407537
swing	gwt
gwt is conceptually similar to swing but is more a replacement for jsps than anything else

407545
versioning	upgrade
if you re using python 2.5 or newer urllib2_file is both unnecessary and unsupported so check which versioning you re using and perhaps upgrade

407554
getter	setter
domain classes in grails try to make sure that every property has a getter and setter during startup

407554
getter	setter
it does this by looking for all the getter and making sure an appropriate setter exists

407559
swing	awt
awt swing are used for desktop java apps or applets

407562
google-chrome	opera
however i always try in all modern browsers ie6 7 ff2 3 opera 9.x safari and google-chrome

407584
numeric	digits
if you really want to think in terms of digits there is a numeric type provided as well

407604
swing	awt
while swing has a lot to teach you and it is too heavily infused with awt if you re never going to be writing guis you may be better off investing in something else

407622
linked-list	tree
it doesn t appear that you balance your tree so you just get a simple linked-list that may account for your incorrect values

407654
any	set
that says 1 when you find the pattern of any set of characters followed by followed by an uppercase character followed by any remaining characters take the third element initial of first name and append the last name

407657
xml-serialization	xml
you could write your own functionality maybe generating xml from your data xml-serialization could be your friend here and using an xslt transform to generate the output format of choice html if you like or even the xml formats direct for word

407662
filtering	grouping
for the first it s generally a good idea to just have a grouping which you can then filtering on if you want

407704
order	add
if the type is used for a table field you can add code to the insert and update methods of the table in order to validate the value whenever the record is updated

407712
order	add
i want to add a reference to an existing contact on the order on creation of the order

407725
expression	evaluation
you re best off writing all your definitions in a separate buffering and using slime s extensive evaluation compilation functions c-c c-k loads an entire file c-x c-e evaluates the last expression c-c c-r evaluates a region etc. only directly entering into the repl things you don t want to save

407729
contains	elements
how do i determine if superset contains all elements of subset

407755
tuples	set
recall that python isn t strongly typed so you can save anything you like just make a tuples of priority thing and you re set

407759
priority-queue	heap
there s an example a little less than halfway down of using a heap with a list of int char tuples as a priority-queue

407769
value	field
similarly getbykey is used to retrieve the value of the object from the underlying database where the value of the primary key field has to be passed

407778
put	get
mind you you might get a securityexception so make sure that the runtime gives you the appropriate permissions you might want to put this in a library and make a call and then set the library up in the gac with evidence to give it full trust

407797
order	add
that s pretty much what i did though i had to add the .tohtml methods in order to output it in hex notation

407807
blacklist	whitelist
i followed the post on binding to a list as referenced above while the binding works i was unable to use the bind whitelist or blacklist in the controllers s action parameter

407832
selected	button
selected the adf bc application module and use your right button to create a business components deployment and selected ejb session bean

407865
weblogic	oc4j
oracle will release a 11g version oc4j but after that oracle weblogic server wls will be the preferred java ee server

407878
javascript	dom
i m working on a project which is heavy on the ajax and pulling in data dynamically so i ve been working on a javascript pagination system that uses the dom - but i m starting to think it would be better to handle it all server side

407886
virtual-machine	parallels
it s been a while since i used parallels but i m sure there was an option to send special macos keys to the virtual-machine rather than to osx - if you switch that on it should send everything to the vm

407912
ckeditor	wysiwyg
also when i tested them i found that wysiwyg editors like ckeditor he removed the f preserve well-formed xml so you shouldn t have to worry about that as a potential issue

407923
reflection	runtime
reflection will allow you to dynamically load the dll set you want at runtime

407924
decrement	increment
when a reference is created to the object some counter is increment and when the reference goes out of scope the counter is decrement

407926
environment	building
contrary to the naming all newer wdks are generally supersets of older release and so include building environment for platforms back through xp

407927
handler	service
you can put a handler to the service to catch all unhandled exceptions including all sub threads of the service

407930
average	minimum
the counter instances themselves are available but they all just show -- for the last average minimum maximum display

407930
32-bit	64bit
edit 3 just found this article about 32-bit 64bit app and monitor mismatching but i m not sure how it applies to my situation if at all

407930
32-bit	64bit
cassini is indeed a 32-bit app but i had no problem viewing the values on my 64bit system

407935
triggers	insert
my kindergarten sql-server taught me that a triggers may be fired with multiple rows in the insert and deleted pseudo tables

407944
triggers	insert
i ve always written my triggers to handle multiple rows it was my understanding that if a single query insert updated deleted multiple rows then only one trigger would fire and as such you would have to use a cursor to move through the records one by one

407959
temporary	rvalue
you are taking the address of a temporary an rvalue which cannot be done

407987
pointers	stack
each of them can be broken down into operators that directly manipulate memory and stack pointers

408013
instances	private
for instances a mix of public private and protected member variables could be laid out such that each access type is contiguous

408023
controllers	routes
you may also want to make custom named routes for your marketing department eg mycoolsite.com free-trial that go off to specific controllers and actions etc

408038
callback	methods
if you don t want to have a public methods for this in table you could probably use some callback trick or some other clever hack

408050
arrays	loops
it makes debugging difficult if you must see the entire arrays you could create a loops to print every line

408051
order	join
selected distinct p from parent p left join fetch p.children order by p.someproperty

408052
triggers	insert
after triggers are best used for extra actions to take as a result of insert update of the row such as the audit logging you mentioned

408061
message	alert
you cannot change the button text on a javascript alert and while you can t change them on a vbscript message box it has different text

408063
swing	awt
the only real similarities to swing and awt are that they are toolkits for creating user interfaces and they use java

408084
great-circle	haversine
checkout the haversine formula for calculating great-circle distance between two points

408116
linux	unix
what i would like to do is sum up my worked time by parsing the text file using bash tr sed awk and the other common unix linux tools

408116
python	java
i prefer using this approach instead of using python perl haskell java etc

408117
macros	vba
if you want to avoid the dialog you are better off creating macros in vba for outlook that are loaded in a session and put buttons on a new commandbar to execute them

408123
double	int
the only time that it doesn t pass a pointer is when you pass a variables with an intrinsic data type like an int or a double into the function

408131
pointers	stack
stack is very fast because its memory allocation is simply a pointers increment to reserve a new frame or allocation record. most .net parameters do not exceed the size of a machine register so little if any stack space is used to pass parameters

408131
pointers	stack
in fact basic types and pointers are both allocated on stack

408146
python	perl
the real technical answer is that there are three major approaches to web-development in python one is cgi-based where the application is built just like an old one-off perl application to run through cgi or fastcgi trac

408146
ruby-on-rails	django
and then there is django and turbogears etc. which is guided by the same just-the-tools-needed philosophy as ruby-on-rails it can be argued who got there first or who did it better

408146
ruby-on-rails	django
a lot of people would probably agree that the django ruby-on-rails cakephp approach is better than the older approaches but as the older language python has a lot more legacy frameworks that are still trying to evolve and stay relevant

408147
double	int
i also resorted to sqlite3_bind_text for other simple data types because the api i m working on can translate int double etc into a string

408151
dictionary	arrays
first i don t use a dictionary but an arrays of size 256 for all the characters

408156
pointers	stack
if you are passing a value type then byref may be faster if the structure has many members because it only passes a single pointers rather than copying the values on stack

408188
variables	boolean
i also try to be very explicit when setting a boolean variables preferring

408195
double	int
developers just throw int and double in because they have to write in something

408195
double	int
if you have a day of the month variables it doesn t matter much if it s signed or unsigned or whether it s char short int long long long float double or long double

408200
while-loop	loops
if you want to be able to respond to changes in the data structure during iterations a while-loops may be more appropriate --- you ll be able to test the loops condition at every iteration and set the value of the loops variable s as you wish

408213
derived-class	base-class
there might be the naughty case where you have an operator new in the derived-class but the corresponding operator delete is in the base-class

408213
malloc	free
if you use from within your overloaded member operator delete new the global operator new delete to get your memory and release it or even malloc free you don t need that size information

408225
selected	button
when a user selecteds something fills in the form goes to the next page and then hits the back button the selected field is pre-selecteded with their choice but since there has been no .change event the form box is not displayed

408257
exception-handling	try-catch
i believe the use of try-catch exception-handling is worse than the use of simple return codes and associated common messaging structures to ferry useful error messages

408262
contains	set
two class libraries one for 2005 and one for 2008 both contains a set of classes implementing a set of common interfaces

408271
haskell	lisp
it is less of an issue in languages like ml haskell or lisp which are typically designed with the idea that the program is going to allocate like crazy

408290
webforms	asp.net
for example i used to reflect a lot when first attempting to create complex web controls for the old asp.net webforms model

408293
click	mouse
you can make polygons with the google-maps api and then you should be able to let user click or mouse over those.

408297
callback	methods
javascript doesn t entirely encourage this sort of thing due to its curious object system and in particular the way bound methods are not first-class objects but with a bit of suitable metaclass and callback glue it s eminently possible

408305
python	java
in addition to the relative cost of exceptions in python and java keep in mind that there s a difference in philosophy attitude between them

408327
gethashcode	tostring
you should make sure that myobject overrides equals gethashcode and tostring so that the indexof methods can find the object properly

408332
contains	set
thinking of the table as being nothing but the set of the rows it contains is wrong imo

408334
python	c++
you can assume the language is c c++ though i ll actually be using win32all for python

408335
entity-relationship	diagram
i am a fan of singular table names as they make my entity-relationship diagram using case syntax easientity-relationship to read but by reading these response i m getting the feeling it neventity-relationship caught on ventity-relationshipy well

408342
firefox	safari
you can see it run fine in firefox and safari but not in ie

408343
logging	trace
on the other hand to perform only logging of certain events actions just specify a log trace listener that is not referenced from an exception handling policy

408362
documentum	alfresco
examples - alfresco documentum jackrabbit day opentext many other ecm vendors

408378
updatepanel	gridview
i m using the asp .net ajax toolkit and have a gridview within the updatepanel everything works fine

408378
updatepanel	gridview
how can i perform any actions on a gridview that lies within an updatepanel

408379
put	get
unlike purists i m not really a put the functionality in the class so you can use polymorphism to get around the type switching kinda person

408381
triggers	insert
the above triggers will only work for the last row in the insert table

408384
32-bit	x86
i ll assume 32-bit x86 with 32-bit pointers

408384
pointers	stack
passing values larger than 32-bit will use more stack space than a pointers and probably more copying time

408393
interpreter	runtime
this relies on countpoints which has o n runtime having a lower constant multiplier than the naive approach s runtime hence above m being the runtime of countpoints and n being the time for the interpreter to loop through a row

408412
directory	folder
the images are supposed to be stored in the webserver where the application runs in a folder called images under the main application directory

408431
contains	any
i would like to encrypt the server s certificate contains the private key but i do not want to use any hard coded keys for this encryption

408449
text-editor	editor
note that the default text-editor is used as the basis for many non-java editor in eclipse

408449
radio-button	selected
under formatting selected the indent using spaces radio-button

408470
webserver	security
storing the password in a file that is read by system initialization scripts as encouraged by at least two webserver vendors adds little in terms of real security

408471
directory	folder
if you want to stick with 2 tiers and you have n users as your target population then you should aim for sqrt n folder in the first tier with sqrt n folder in each second tier directory

408474
spaces	output
for example try assigning to the variables ofs and colons instead of spaces will result in between fields in the output

408481
reliability	scalability
a popular scalability folder naming scheme if you don t care about reliability is something like that squid uses or so for user-id 1 the folder path can be c4 ca42 1

408489
entity-relationship	diagram
looking for a tool that will automatically create a graphical representation of a mysql db schema from a live database showing tables columns and relationships an entity-relationship diagram

408490
deployment	install
the solution i ve come up with is to start our utility using the run registry key at login and to prevent launching the utility during install if the current user is system - this wasn t specifically with sms but using ad gpo deployment

408498
python	php
not only is it a good ide for ror it also does a somewhat decent job sans debugging for php python html css and javascript

408511
any	set
mingw provides a complete open source programming tool set which is suitable for the development of native windows programs that do not depend on any 3rd-party c runtime dlls.

408511
perl	php
ultraedit -- text hex html php java javascript perl and programmer s editor.

408511
text-editor	editor
intype text-editor -- code editor for windows

408511
debugging	trace
dbwin32 -- lets you see windows debugging and trace messages

408511
debugging	trace
debuggingview -- lets you see windows debugging and trace messages

408511
telnet	ssh
putty -- telnet and ssh client

408511
sftp	ftp
winscp -- sftp ftp and scp client for windows

408511
linux	unix
gnu utilities for win32 -- windows version of several unix linux tools

408511
virtualization	virtualbox
virtualbox -- open source virtualization product

408513
filesystems	xfs
i would look into xfs or another high-performance journaling filesystems

408520
environment	building
to add to the fun the system and platform building batch files can also play with environment variables that in turn may adjust settings

408528
virtualbox	vmware
i ve tried virtualbox vmware server free and virtual pc

408532
configuration	logging
so my thoughts are that big dividends will be seen during maintenance when you re needing to change the way you re handling logging exceptions by having the flexibility to change configuration easily and still have the same one line of source code

408535
aptana	pydev
i use eclipse with pydev for python programming but i don t use aptana

408535
aptana	pydev
aptana just uses pydev for its python support so really there is no incentive for me to add extra baggage i wouldn t use like javascript support

408553
revision	updates
subversion updates it s directories and reformats the .svn directories the first time you run a revision with major updates

408553
versioning	upgrade
what this means is that when you upgrade you have to be careful that both subeclipse and tortoise have released new versioning with the matching underlying subversion updates

408554
updating	updates
adding a layer in between the sql-server and both the form and the updating application so any updates from the main application go here and the form application can be notified of changes in real time

408556
csv	xml
i have an application that imports information from a csv file or from a database and exports it to xml

408556
csv	xml
currently i have csv xml and sql repositories that deal with importing exporting data

408556
csv	xml
is it poor design to let the object have knowledge of it s xml representation or csv representation etc

408566
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux

408588
.when	ready
i currently develop with django but want to be ready .when a future client inevitably requests a site done in asp.net-mvc

408588
ruby-on-rails	django
while most of the structure and flow of asp.net mvc is more or less identical to django and ruby-on-rails the one part i m not sure about is the apps methodology django employs to make code reuse easier

408611
for-loop	loops
the first loops creates a variable i that is a scalar and it iterates it like a c for-loops

408621
python	c++
i use cvs to maintain all my python snippets notes c c++ code

408636
getter	setter
the getter setter probably look like this

408641
parentheses	braces
json is essentially balanced parentheses plus a bunch of other stuff with the braces replaced by parens

408645
pari	sage
sage include pari which is an open source package for number-theory

408660
smalltalk	lisp
assembler c lisp ruby smalltalk

408667
double	int
there aren t many types that are c# keywords int double string .

408675
sql-server	mysql
i m used to sql-server but using mysql shouldn t be a problem

408679
any	set
if you can pre-compute your session variables or store them to a text file maybe when they get set the map entries can be easily retrieved based on any of the available request details

408679
rewrite	rule
otherwise you could put together a simple external mapper probably a php scripting as that d be easiest that uses the sessionid to determine the value of the session variables and returns the proper url for the rewrite rule to use

408688
pointers	stack
pointers to stack allocated objects leads to bugs.

408690
allocation	deep
stack-memory allocation function variables local-variables can be problematic when your stack is too deep and you overflow the memory available to stack allocations

408691
constructor	object
and class object that define a user declared constructor won t have their destructors called

408712
message-queue	messaging
i also found the wintab api in a out of the way corner of the wacom site but that s not part of windows as far as i can tell and has a completely distinct event messaging system from the message-queue

408719
linked-list	heap
so allocating on a heap makes sense for a linked-list when you are not aware of how many elements would be inserted into it

408727
native-code	unmanaged
in my opinion rewriting urls with iis 6 is best handled with an isapi filtering written as unmanaged native-code

408756
ruby-on-rails	django
i d have to agree that django is basically the ruby-on-rails for python equivalent

408756
turbogears	pylons
in fact this is exactly what pylons and turbogears do is provide a reliable predictable stack to build asp.net-mvc web apps

408781
triggers	insert
then create a triggers on each of your old user tables to insert the id into this extra table

408783
selected	button
you should wait until the user selected a button which will trigger your delegate function and then access the text field property

408820
swing	awt
can someone please explain me what s the difference between swing and awt

408820
swing	awt
are there any cases where awt is more useful advised to use than swing or vice-versa

408828
swing	awt
swing vs awt

408828
swing	awt
basically awt came first and is a set of heavyweight ui components meaning they are wrappers for operating system objects whereas swing built on top of awt with a richer set of lightweight components

408828
swing	awt
any serious java ui work is done in swing not awt which was primarily used for applets

408830
checkbox	button
it uses awt to create an operating system windows and then paints pictures of button labels text checkbox etc. into that windows and responds to all of your mouse-clicks key entries etc. deciding for itself what to do instead of letting the operating system handle it

408830
swing	awt
because awt uses native gui widgets your os knows about them and handles putting them in front of each other etc. whereas swing widgets are meaningless pixels within a windows from your os s point of view

408830
swing	awt
mixing awt and swing is highly unsupported and can lead to ridiculous results such as native buttons that obscure everything else in the dialog box in which they reside because everything else was created with swing

408830
swing	awt
because swing tries to do everything possible in java other than the very raw graphics routines provided by a native gui windows it used to incur quite a performance penalty compared to awt

408830
swing	swt
finally you might also want to check out swt the gui toolkit used for eclipse and an alternative to both awt and swing which is somewhat of a return to the awt idea of accessing native widgets through java

408834
selected	checkbox
...i want to enable the registred user to view his selection history by retriving and displaying the checkbox he selected in a page with thier values .

408834
selected	checkbox
i m just able to save the selected checkbox as choice 1 choice 2 for example

408834
selected	checkbox
i want to view the selected checkbox that is saved in database as the appear in the page when the user first select them for example if the registred user selects these 3 options

408834
selected	checkbox
but if he want to view selected checkbox the appear exactly as first he selects them

408839
contains	elements
when a form is posted back to the webserver all the server knows about is simply the form was sent and contains the following input elements

408853
gedit	vim
normal people prefer gedit instead of vim

408867
xsd	xml
if so there is a lot you can do in sql-server - for example you can bind the xml column to an xsd or you can promote portions of the xml via udf xquery to persisted indexed columns

408873
keyboard	mouse
generally speaking one primary focus has to be in minimising movement between the mouse and keyboard so put lots of functionality into the mouse or into the keyboard because when you have to move your hands like that there is a real delay in trying to find the right place to put them

408884
swing	awt
another statement which i saw is that swing is asp.net-mvc based and awt is not

408889
pprint	pickle
have you considered using pickle for the serializing and then pprint or a more fancy object viewer for humans looking at the objects

408891
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram are great

408914
g++	gcc
mingw for gcc g++ and added gdb maybe msys when i get around to it

408917
any	set
however i just wanted to know if there is any built in attributes in the callback which i can set in the cakeyframeanimation object and then refer the same in the callback

408921
having	select
i ll avoid commenting on having select queries and login information for your db in your markup

408937
.net	wcf
the code has #if blocks based on different symbols to control logic - so for example binaryformatter isn t available on cf wcf is only available with .net 3.0 delegate.createdelegate isn t on cf 2.0 etc

408957
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
i used to use sharpdevelop before moving to visual-studio express for fun stuff

408969
datagridviewcolumn	winforms
since you mention datagridviewcolumn tags i assume you mean winforms

408970
freebsd	linux
i know the win32 api supplies us with createiocompletionport freebsd has kqueue and linux in general can use dev epoll that works somewhat similarly.

408978
javascript	dom
i m trying to find any javascript frameworks whose sole aim is to standardize the dom and javascript across all browsers

408981
pyopengl	pyglet
i d say that pyglet is actually more evolved than pyopengl

409004
windows	ms-dos
unix terminals support ansi escape sequences and windows world used to support them back in old ms-dos days but the multibyte console support put an end to this

409024
csv	xml
update 2 if what you need is just to store structured information you import from csv and store it in a single xml file if i am not wrong why not using a plain old rdmbs

409034
bazaar	git
modern distributed version control systems like git mercurial or bazaar are the best tool in a situation like this

409041
png	gif
according to the documentation itext supports the following image formats jpeg gif png tiff bmp wmf and eps

409042
google-chrome	firefox
if you like how things look in the other browsers ie firefox safari google-chrome then i d say you ve got 99 of your bases covered

409050
jar	war
or do i assemble a separate ear for each service most often only containing a single ejb jar file and sometimes and ejb and a war file

409106
ruby-on-rails	rspec
bort a ruby-on-rails skeleton app has a full set of rspec tests and supports openid login so you may want to take a look and see what they do

409120
children	nodes
the number of leaves should be the number of nodes in the tree having no children

409132
base-class	inherited
if you have a small number of master pages it makes sense in there or you could put some code to emit it in a base-class that you inherited all your pages or master pages from or if you have a standard footer control that you use on all pages you can put it in there

409171
double	int
first never use floats or double if you want to represent decimal values exactly - use either int types int long etc or decimal which is just an int type with a scaling factors

409174
oracle	mysql
team system is great when you re working on a project where all things are microsoft but all the extra features database architect etc will become useless when you start working with oracle and mysql database

409187
deployment	install
the trickiest part is making a deployment package for it that install the service properly but again.

409211
dialog	pop-up
if anything takes longer than that then a progress dialog should pop-up or a progress bar should appear in the status bar or somewhere else in the interface

409215
constructor	object
if that is the case overload the copy constructor copy assignment operator and destructor of that object s class which then manages the resource by either copying it properly or sharing it among all other instances of its object see this answer

409225
memcached	apc
caching in php userland means using a separate programmable system along the lines of memcached or the apc to handle the details of memory-management for you

409250
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it seems to me like you d be better off on a webforms development track than an asp.net-mvc track

409256
tcp-ip	tcp
is there a convenient way to pass the tcp byte arrays bytes 20-39 of the complete tcp-ip packet to the parsing function without extracting it to a new byte arrays first

409287
firefox	safari
i would much prefer something like firefox or safari that doesn t clutter my screen real estate with a useless windows

409302
double	int
using floats not double or int

409305
value	field
if you want to store a specific value you should use a datetime field

409306
callback	methods
so it is non blocking. you should put your console.log into the callback methods if you want it to log after getjson is done

409311
linux	bsd
i m interested in learning about clusters that run popular os platforms like linux bsd mac os x and windows

409313
dialog	pop-up
on the other hand if you just don t like the pop-up dialog i think you re sol for now

409336
any	set
i often find that this helps make sure any unimportant details are not left off the minutes - and the minute taker is almost always glad for the second set of notes to work off

409346
aggregate	grouping
the grouping by is the magic that gives us one row per topic with the max and count functions giving us the aggregate data you need

409370
value	field
for example i d like to reduce this list to only contains the 4th field value of 2somename

409388
expression	evaluation
alternately if you are after simple math evaluation you can download edmonodo s expression parsing and evaluator from his codeplex plage - symbolic differentiation in c# f#

409396
decrement	increment
just change the iterators swap decrement by increment

409417
contains	any
contains any postdata

409417
postdata	request
it s possible for a post request to contain no postdata

409417
required	checked
i checked the required post fields though

409420
value	field
for example i d like to reduce this list to only contains the 4th field value of 2somename

409423
contains	elements
now y is an iterator contains tuples of elements item iterator

409437
database-table	recordset
if you are saying that the entire com recordset is being persisted to a single column in the database-table as a binary object byte array then i don t see any way around the complexity

409440
latitude-longitude	location
use google-maps to geocode the location that the user enters in other words transform postal code and city to latitude-longitude

409442
filtering	sorting
if you ll be doing a lot of sorting and filtering you may like some helper functions

409453
postdata	request
is the correct way you can send a post request without any postdata

409457
textbox	button
i have usercontrol which contains a textbox and a button control

409457
selected	button
the button opens a filedialog and the user selected the file

409472
google-chrome	safari
also the resource inspector in webkit browsers like safari or google-chrome will do the same for you

409478
filtering	sorting
then you can use sql statements to do all this sorting and filtering without having to reinvent the wheel

409480
administration	account
administration features lock unlock disable account troubleshoot etc

409491
sftp	ftps
this question originally asked which is the best methods for uploading files via sftp or ftps in ssis

409491
winscp	putty
methods install a free command-line sftp application such as putty and winscp and execute it either by running a batch file or operating system process task

409491
sftp	ftps
methods install a sftp or ftps library and use a script task that references the library to upload the files

409493
environment	building
and finally make sure your environment is setup correctly when running the building for vs2005

409495
getter	setter
this question is language-agnostic but i am a c# guy so i use the term poco to mean an object that only preforms data storage usually using getter and setter fields

409511
any	set
so if your app is in srv yourapp set the server to serve files from srv yourapp app and put the include in srv yourapp include so there literally isn t any url that can access them

409519
order	add
had to add the two helper functions to convert from network order to little endian

409541
constructor	object
it s really frustrating to look over my code and get a headache of all these setters in object constructor and this messy throwing together of these

409541
implements	abstract
- i tried to use a lot of interfaces to abstract from the building process and to have just a few implements interfaces which will be added together i thought i could switching between different libraries like gwt-ext and gxt easily but still i am not really happy

409544
perl	c++
like c++ or lisp or perl

409563
exception-handling	try-catch
what best practices are there for exception-handling that don t result in everything requiring a try-catch block

409563
boolean	int
returning boolean or an int is more of a c mindset than a java in java you would just handle the exception-handling one

409567
jquery	.post
search the jquery site for documentation on .get and .post

409581
dfa	nfa
fsa including dfa and nfa are very important for computer science and they are use in many fields including many fields

409586
default-value	default
i learned this from my previous question where i was previously relying on a thrown exception-handling to return a default-value rather than doing parameter checking to return that default

409587
notepad++	emacs
but i ve written them all in emacs elisp and getting them to convert from notepad++ is not going to happen

409589
updating	updates
instead of manually updating the staging server subversion folder every few minutes when i need to check something i ve got a scripting that automatically checks for any subversion updates

409590
multithreading	wait
in summary i think that the user should be blocked from doing stuff in your app only when the wait interval is very short 2 seconds or less and the cognitive overhead of doing multithreading is likely to result in a less stable app

409597
revision	updates
you would have to have a script check the current revision number of the repository before doing an updates

409597
revision	updates
if the revision number hasn t changed don t perform an updates

409620
while-loop	loops
without more of your while-loops it looks like an endless loops - i assume you have another findnext somewhere

409620
required	checked
checked your api docs to see if that s required here

409629
put	get
free to develop on free to put apps on your own phone 25 to get a license

409638
rtcp	rtp
the other two are essentially always rtp and rtcp -- real time protocols and real time control protocols and those are better p2p because you want fast transmission with no intermediate bottleneck

409716
ip-address	proxy
i notice that when http requests are made from clients through a proxy-server then the ip-address of the requests is always that of the proxy

409727
postgresql	mysql
since i am using postgresql instead of mysql i decided to load all these dumps into my db using pipeline shell commands

409751
contains	set
internally this would contains a collection of validators and a very simple set of public methods such as validate which could return a collection of error object

409771
pascal	delphi
a pascal string the delphi shortstring has an extra byte for the length

409785
sql-server	mysql
sorry this is tested only on sql-server as i don t have access to mysql at the moment

409786
protected	public
sth_to_objects is supposed to be a public actually protected methods

409812
contains	elements
or if your arrays contains other arrayss as elements

409823
textbox	button
on the user control there is a form element with two textbox quantity and price and an update button

409823
attributes	properties
there is no name propery on an asp.net control and even when i try to set it using the attributes accessor properties by saying control.attributes name price

409834
updating	updates
sometimes you can get around this by updating the row s your interested in bank first within a transaction as this is guaranteed to lock the row preventing further updates from changing its value until your transaction has completed

409838
typedef	struct
second when using templates code it s sometimes easier to rely on pairs than to add yet another typedef for the struct type

409840
document	element
it s easier for the person writing the code and for other using it when you just document what each element in the tuples is rather than writing your own struct making people look up the struct definition

409848
constructor	private
neither private constructor nor abstract classes were defined in the old ecmascript 4 standard on which actionscript 3 was based

409848
reserved-words	keyword
the abstract keyword for example is a reserved-words so they have this stuff in mind

409848
constructor	private
if you feel abstract classes or private constructor are important to you as a developer request these features in the public flash player bug database or vote for existing feature requests if they re already present

409849
updating	updates
by reading and updating at the same time i would like to reduce lock time from time we use selected for updates to actual updates so that using multiple instances would increase read rows per second

409853
tuples	any
to use the function one will need to read the function documentation in any case and the tuples will be explained there

409866
syntax-highlighting	textmate
since his site uses ruby s ultraviolet to do syntax-highlighting and it uses textmate syntaxes he needs a delphi syntax for textmate

409866
oxygene	delphi
a delphi prism oxygene one would be great too

409901
pascal	delphi
see also looking for a complete delphi object pascal syntax

409916
loading	gif
and also put up a loading processing image which is a gif

409933
put	get
i ve always had the impression that one important difference between java and .net was that the microsoft suite required that you or your employer had put up some coin to get access to the tools

409933
postgresql	mysql
a java person has the advantage of being able to download a jvm eclipse or netbeans tomcat or glassfish mysql or postgresql and they re in business

410010
implements	extends
you can extends your application framework to help with this strategy but please don t implements such a policy in a library good libraries do not make global decisions without an applications consent

410027
command-line	cmd
for when i m just quickly writing a small objective-c cmd-line program place this in a new cmd

410039
websphere	ibm
keep in mind that i haven t used posix message queue before i did use ibm websphere mq a while back but that s rather different

410041
ip-address	hostname
if you can make do with the ip-address i would skip the reverse dns-lookup but you specifically asked for a hostname

410045
haskell	python
can be seen in haskell and python for example

410052
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a paying versioning if it s

410056
bazaar	git
it replaces the annoying project drawer with a project panel adds support for svn git mercurial bazaar and svk and adds lots of other small stuff

410056
bazaar	git
support for svn git mercurial bazaar and svk

410073
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m converting a fairly large web application from webforms to asp.net-mvc and after a while i encountred a problem with passing data to the view

410084
macros	vba
i do know that openoffice has a vba equivalent but don t know enough about the object models to say whether an excel macros will behave the exact same way in openoffice

410089
arrays	loops
my string example is just an example so the path may be longer or shorter and could contain 1 arrays item or 10+ i just don t know so i won t know how many arrays items there are i need to loops through them all so i have all the paths in the arrays

410092
euclidean-distance	nearest-neighbor
this is easily obtained for the euclidean-distance by computing the delaunay triangulation of the set of points the nearest-neighbor of a site is one of its neighbor in the delaunay triangulation

410095
queue	fifo
system v message queue and fifo named pipes are both absolutely fine

410113
checkbox	listbox
i have a listbox with checkbox how do i check the checkbox of the selecteditem

410120
sftp	ftps
what would be a recommended choice of ssis component to perform sftp or ftps task

410131
selected	listbox
the code below moves the selected item in the listbox downwards to the next item in the listbox but it unchecks the selected item if it was checked

410138
error-handling	try-catch
other than these two types of error-handling all of the rest of the code in the middle should be free and clear of try-catch code and error objects

410141
png	gif
i haven t yet locked in sizes so i didn t want to generate image files png gif jpg directly in case i change my mind after i get further along with layout and user-interface to see what works and what doesn t

410148
order	join
from order inner join

410149
internet-explorer	firefox
currently the library supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet-explorer 6.0+

410161
keyboard	mouse
however it s worth noting that in recent versions of windows directinput for mouse keyboard input is just a wrapper around the win32 windows messages

410176
adobe-illustrator	fireworks
the ones i use are adobe-illustrator adobe fireworks adobe photoshop

410176
fireworks	photoshop
admittedly fireworks and photoshop are bitmap graphics packages that have vector support

410176
fireworks	photoshop
i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in photoshop they re actually a combinations of a vector mask and a colour fill

410176
fireworks	layer
i use grouping in illustrator or folder fireworks or photoshop to isolate each icon from one another but lets me keep all the individual layer that make up the icon unflattened

410186
serialization	marshalling
i m not a ruby pro but i know that i can define two methods marshalling_dump and marshalling_load which will be called by the marshalling module when i attempt to serialization the object

410188
default	reset
turn off any overclocking software and reset those settings to auto or default

410199
exception-handling	error-handling
once you embrace exception-handling you should find that it makes your code simpler and clearer by moving your error-handling code away from your core logic

410213
ubuntu	linux
i used python 2.5.2 on linux ubuntu 8.10 with a 1.5 ghz pentium m

410217
webforms	asp.net
i think you re straddled between two worlds of asp.net webforms and asp.net mvc

410245
ubuntu	linux
with regards to ubuntu and linux in general a good book

410253
http	ssl
must be secure http or ssl

410254
webforms	asp.net
assuming you prefer asp.net mvc to webforms it s worth it for a system that s in active development maintenance

410257
organization	naming
naming and organization might get confusing

410259
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc is not meant to replace webforms

410259
webforms	asp.net
i ll be using webforms and asp.net mvc but looking at the needs of the current project so that i make the right decision for the current implementation

410275
json	xml
it can use json instead of xml which is simpler

410278
calayer	uiview
there are methods to transfer a cgpoint from one uiview to another and from one calayer to another

410278
calayer	uiview
i cannot find a way to change a cgpoint from a uiview s coordinate system to a calayer s coordinate system

410286
webforms	asp.net
but still using asp.net webforms for righ backoffice applications to take advantage of rich custom controls and some of other nice features of webforms

410338
webserver	host
it s usually issued to a single webserver host basically a computer cname or a record like foo.bar.com where foo is one name for the host which the certificate request was generated for and bar.com is its domain

410343
callback	methods
the callback object contains a methods and returns the parameter and return types for the methods via a couple of accessor methodss that just delegate to the equivalent methodss in methods

410343
callback	methods
i am trying to validate that a callback i have been supplied points to a valid methods

410343
callback	methods
since i require all these callback to return some sort of number which will be returned by invoke as a number i am trying to validate that the supplied methods returns either number or a numeric primitive

410367
linked-list	arrays
this is an index into the arrays and you get a linked-list at that index

410367
linked-list	arrays
since arrays retrieval is o 1 and linked-list traversal is o n you want a hash function that creates as random a distribution as possible so that objects will be hashed to different lists

410367
linked-list	arrays
every object could return the value 0 as its hashcode and a hash table would still work but it would essentially be a long linked-list at element 0 of the arrays

410367
arrays	map
the java hashmap for example increases the size of the arrays when the number of entries in the map is 75 of the size of the arrays

410367
linked-list	hashmap
1 a linked-list is not the only way to represent the objects that have the same hashcode although that is the method used by the jdk 1.5 hashmap

410367
hashmap	arrays
2 as of jdk 1.4 the hashmap class uses an arrays sized as a power of 2

410373
compression	streaming
the gzipstreaming in system.io.compression part of the .net base class library since .net 2.0 provides a streaming interface for ietf rfc-1952 compression

410373
compact-framework	.net
works on compact-framework as well as on the regular .net

410374
delphi	vb.net
does using multiple .net languages delphi vb.net c# into the same application but in differents class library of course can down peformances compared to a full c# application for example

410380
perl	ruby
it borrows all the best features from perl 6 clos lisp smalltalk java beta ocaml ruby and more while still keeping true to its perl 5 roots

410388
ironpython	ironruby
one place where this would be different is with the languages that are run on the dlr ironpython ironruby etc.

410391
wamp	php
okay so a continuation from this question where you experts intro d me to wamp which can basically execute php within a windows xp environment

410392
authentication	login
i m working on a django-based application in a corporate environment and would like to use the existing active directory system for authentication of users so they don t get yet another login password combo

410394
asp.net-mvc	webforms
imo asp.net-mvc is better for web sites while webforms are better for web applications

410397
compact-framework	.net
as an added benefit the embedded deflatestream in dotnetzip allows dotnetzip to be used on the .net compact-framework 2.0 which lacks a system.io.compression.deflatestream

410404
compact-framework	.net
dotnetzip works with .net v2.0 3.0 3.5 as well as compact-framework v2.0 and 3.5

410405
strict	let
vmware ace or whatever they re calling it nowadays will let you deliver single virtual machines under strict control with forced updates expiration and whatnot

410417
linked-list	arrays
i was curious so i looked at the source of stack with reflector and i can see that they implemented it as an arrays instead of a linked-list and i m just wondering why

410434
linked-list	arrays
so an arrays works well without the memory and allocation overhead of a linked-list

410453
ruby	php
dig into one of the ruby on rails tutorials or a php tutorials.

410453
ruby	php
beyond that there s a wealth of information available for free online but it will require you to figure out what platform you want to develop on ruby on rails php django asp.net

410457
python	ruby
but then again there s hundred of other languages and frameworks that might be more fun to start off with like ruby on rails or python and cgi

410467
benchmarking	profiling
i didn t need any fancy profiling tools or benchmarking suites to tell me the new version was a significant improvement

410469
child-process	spawn
so long as you make sure not to import tkinter before you spawn the child-process it will work because then it is the child-process that is importing it for the first time

410472
compact-framework	.net
the dotnetzip library as of v1.7 runs on the .net compact-framework 2.0 and above

410484
asp.net-mvc	webforms
these can be done just the same with asp.net-mvc or webforms

410484
asp.net-mvc	webforms
migrating an existing webforms project to asp.net-mvc doesn t make a lot of sense

410500
constructor	object
when attempting to use joshua bloch s builder pattern item 2 in effective-java second edition with reflection object constructor index .newinstance constructorparametervalues

410500
constructor	private
the accessible private constructor was being discarded and a non-accessible override false was being attempted

410527
put	get
if you want to put a class inside a namespace and that class is going to get declared in a header file well then it should be declared inside the namespace which thus should be in the header file

410545
order	join
it appears that when you do a find that has both join and a limit activerecord has to first query the main table to get the ids of the rows to return then redo the query using just the ids in order to apply the limit

410554
jqmodal	jquery
jqmodal is another i have used that is based on jquery

410555
perl	lua
in addition to the original version in perl there s a c version called discount and several other implementations including one in lua

410561
postgresql	mysql
one of the disadvantages of postgresql is that it does not seem to support an in memory storage engines as mysql does.

410614
solaris	linux
i will be using c and only c on a linux solaris and probably windows platforms

410616
ubuntu	linux
how can i increase or eliminate a maximum number of connections that my ubuntu linux box can open at a time

410618
bazaar	git
if you are interested in a distributed vcs then you should be looking at git hg bazaar

410618
bazaar	git
hg and bazaar are ahead of git as far as windows supports

410618
cvs	git
git supports a hybrid scenario where the server can be cvs svn and individual developers can use git-svn to work locally and manage local branches

410618
cvs	git
i have been working on an open source project the repository was stored in cvs which then got migrated to svn and then to git

410624
constructor	object
the default copy constructor will only do a shallow copy hence if the called function modifies an integer in the object this will not be seen by the calling function but if the function changes a data structure pointed to by a pointer within the object then this will be seen by the caller due to the shallow copy

410628
contains	elements
a sequence that contains two elements x and y whereas

410629
virtual-machine	virtualbox
you can as already mentioned go about it the easier way by installing something like xampp my personal favorite or if you want to mimic something closer to a server environment install virtualbox virtualpc and create a virtual-machine running debian or whatever server os you need with the appropriate php apache2 etc... packages

410643
packets	ping
check for packet loss using ping with large packets ping -s 1472 ...

410643
packets	lan
if this is a gigabit+ lan can you use jumbo packets

410645
bazaar	git
at work we ve been evaluating three different dvcs s namely git mercurial hg and bazaar and had a full packed evening presenting them for the rest of the company

410645
bazaar	git
find someone who can present some alternative to git such as mercurial or bazaar and do a presentation together on dvcs at your company

410651
progress-bar	progress
i m downloading a collection of files and i d like to display progress in a progress-bar

410651
progress-bar	progress
it s simple to display overall progress by setting the maximum value of the progress-bar to the total size of all the files and by setting the current positioning to the size downloaded so far

410656
xsd	xml
since each element in xsd is optional by default this xsd will match the xml structure you have defined with the y element appearing anywhere before after or between the x elements with a maximum occurence of 1

410662
vbscript	jscript
if you want to play with an application vbscript or jscript give you a quick way to experiment

410681
imultivalueconverter	ivalueconverter
the converter needs to implements imultivalueconverter rather than ivalueconverter and can look something like this

410684
circular-buffer	queue
add to that the locality of reference and the reduced gc pressure and i think it makes perfect sense to use arrayss as the underlying data structure for stacks queue and deques - the last two would use the arrays as a circular-buffer of course

410689
version-control	git
you can also pick up the pragmatic version-control using git

410690
exception-handling	error-handling
when using exception-handling the error-handling code is separated from the code causing the error

410691
python	php
a programming language knowledge - for purposes of learning i would suggest python or php - from my own experience these allow to sooner start concentrating on 1 and 2

410691
client-server	security
the real hurdle of web and other programming is that you can easily make stuff that works but is either clunky and hard to maintain or a security risk -- and for web apps on internet security risks multiply by the inherent vulnerabilities of the client-server engines themselves which you use to build your web apps

410697
jprofiler	jvm
two other people i work with agree that a jvm fault is clearly indicated as do the programmers at jprofiler ej-technologies

410741
base-class	inherited
for example a file and directory class may inherited from the same abstract base-class because they are very similar types

410750
getter	setter
if ilist can or cannot be modified it should ve been broken down into two one for the unmodifiable part getter lookup etc. and one for the modifiable part setter add remove etc.

410757
any	set
i set up my development environments so that anybody can build any of my project components independently of anybody else

410767
revision	updates
this is the file that was the base revision before you updates your working copy

410771
toolchain	binutils
i ve found a company that provides gcc based toolchain for arm mips but i don t know in what are they different from the vanilla gcc of course they bring other software pieces such as eclipse but when looking only at gcc and binutils are they different or just the same

410778
binary-operators	operands
binary-operators provided each operands is of a type listed above

410778
conditional	operators
conditional operators

410778
value	field
note because a readonly field can be initialized either at the declaration or in the constructor of a class readonly fields can have different value depending on the constructor used

410781
debugging	trace
one thing to note fl.trace is how you print trace messages in jsfl when you re debugging took me a while to figure that out

410782
double	int
const can hold only integral type sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong char float double decimal bool or string an enumeration or a reference to null not classes or structures because they are initialized at runtime with the new keyword whereas readonly can hold complex types structures or classes by using the new keyword at initialization but cannot hold enumerations

410783
value	field
therefore readonly field can have different value depending on the constructor used

410787
arrays	loops
as a result 2n+1 copies of the arrays will be created in the following loops

410797
data-access	nhibernate
am i right in thinking i can use nhibernate and all my data-access classes entities and mappings in the model part of the asp.net-mvc

410802
value	field
whenever i have properties that are costly like recreating a collection on call i either document the property stating that each call incurs a cost or i cache the value as a private field

410804
sql-server	oracle
if you ll consider oracle instead of sql-server you could use features such as grid and table partitioning which might boost performance considerably

410814
cross-compiling	toolchain
building a toolchain from scratch especially for cross-compiling purposes is tedious and can be a complete pain

410814
toolchain	platform
there are open source tools to make this process easier like crosstool-ng but having a proven toolchain thatâ s been optimized for a certain platform can save a lot of time and headaches

410814
toolchain	platform
montavista as far as i know doesnâ t include support for older platform in their newest toolchain releases

410840
document	element
add a schema_version element to each document

410857
temporary	copy
the implementation may copy the temporary and then bind that temporary to the reference

410892
fireworks	photoshop
and as always if you can fake the 3d look using 2d vectors in illustrator flash photoshop or my favourite fireworks you ll have a much less steep learning curve

410896
substring	strstr
typically the way to do this would be to use strchr or strstr one or more times to find a pointers to where you want to extract the substring from say p and a pointers to the character after the last character that you need to extract say q if the buffering is a temporary buffering that you don t mind destroying then you can just do and p will be a pointers to the required string

410898
show	next
now id and show are both what i d expect at runtime but the next line doesn t work

410901
ruby-on-rails	django
in the overall i prefer django over ruby-on-rails because of the django apps

410941
click	mouse
the application is supposed to be windows and will need to respond to mouse click and drag events in the 3d viewport

410945
value	field
just use an arrays for the field value

410961
any	set
is there any open source or use environment picker in dotnet that allows me to simply create a set of environments whatever that may mean to my application and then have a picker on startup

410964
constructor	private
the accessible private constructor was being discarded and a non-accessible override false was being attempted

410965
authentication	login
control panel - internet properties - security settings - user authentication - login - prompt for username and password

410966
csv	xml
when an object has various formats xml csv it can be represented in where should one store knowledge of those formats

410993
httpd.conf	.htaccess
updaet if this is caused by settings in httpd.conf how can i override in .htaccess file while i don t have permission to it

410995
forwarding	port
i have been searching the internet for away to setup our linux server running centos 5 so that there is a daemon listening on port 443 that depending on the client protocol forwarding the request to the correct internal port ssh 22 or http moved to a differentport_

410996
c-preprocessor	macros
i also suspect that this behaviour is designed to be the same as c-preprocessor macros which typically are set up to not evaluate the arguments when not in use

411012
exception-handling	try-catch
i just finished reading this article on the advantages and disadvantages of exception-handling and i agree with the sentiment that try-catch blocks should not be used for normal control-flow management don t use them like a goto

411014
assign	add
you can usually assign multiple ip addresses to a single adapter no need to add a second network card

411015
primitive	int
given what i know about my own code i m willing to bet that there are other slow-downs in your code beyond the choice of primitive int types

411026
exception-handling	try-catch
the bad thing about using try-catch block everywhere is that in consuming the exception-handling you potentially conceal bad code

411034
unsigned	integer
for integer division otoh unsigned integers are a tad faster on the arm

411064
value	field
and if your property is simply getting setting the value of the field then there is no performance difference because it will most likely be inlined by the jit compiler

411065
webforms	asp.net
i ve been using asp.net mvc for several months now and i prefer it to webforms

411067
fadeout	fadein
jquery fadein fadeout ie cleartype glitch

411103
base-class	inherited
when i am trying to use the base-class s function in another class that inherited from the derived i receive an error

411104
json	csv
furthermore this violates the single responsibility priciple as each class is responsible for both what id does and representing itself as xml json csv etc

411113
compatibility	platform
i would suspect that compatibility between different os and platform x86 vs x64 may not work for things like boost-serialization

411125
pointers	stack
describes the difference between them but note that thiscall stores the this pointers in the ecx register while stdcall stores all parameters on stack

411127
transient	entity
let say if i add a transient entity to the persistence context with code like this

411143
mousemove	mousedown
i can t disable it because i want to handle mousemove and mousedown events

411153
constructor	object
important to note is that the implicit object parameter is only a theoretical construct to formalize how the rules for calling a member function are made up and constructor do not include them while the this pointer is actually existent

411161
perl	php
i ve created a few small-scale games in python java html php and perl

411161
python	c++
i would go so far as to recommend learning python pygame and start building games with that tool rather than c++ which complicates the design and implementation process

411164
contains	set
creates a new set contains the elements of the given enumerable

411176
eventual-consistency	distributed-system
if you want to have a distributed-system that eventual-consistency thing you need people build maintain and to operate it

411193
selected	textbox
you can see the opposite of what you wanted in automatically selected all text on focus in winforms textbox

411199
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i was never really fond of webforms to begin with so getting to work with asp.net-mvc was like a breath of fresh air to me

411207
cygwin	gnu
gnu size under cygwin says

411210
firefox	opera
there is a push to make truetype opentype font files just work on the web which may show up in firefox 3.1 opera 10 and safari

411250
16-bit	8bit
however 16-bit integers and 8bit integers are only slightly slower

411250
32-bit	64bit
64bit integers will be emulated by two or more 32-bit operations are therefore slower

411250
32-bit	64bit
when it comes to floating-point types in the iphone processor arm11 with vfp hardware floating point 32-bit floats are somewhat faster than 64bit doubles

411260
gethashcode	equals
note that if you override the equals operator you ll also want to override gethashcode so that the hash codes for equivalent objects are the same

411261
double	int
any time you re trying to convert floats double to int you want to think carefully about which operator you want to use -- truncation rounding down rounding up or rounding-to-nearest

411312
log4net	nlog
it is a custom class because we are not allowed to install additional software on our servers nlog log4net etc

411313
required	checked
some additional error checked null-checks might be required

411317
swing	gwt
besides really good apps like intellij idea and netbeans there are lots of swing like frameworks swt eclipse gwt etc. which you can learn faster with swing knowledge.

411329
swing	gwt
gwt is very much similar to swing in its usage of widgets panels and the eventlisteners it provides

411350
variables	boolean
how about variables ... directly since it s boolean

411351
scala	ocaml
f# is first class .net language and it s the first functional language that comes with really big foundation not that i say that lisp haskell erlang scala ocaml do not have lots of libraries they are just not as complete as .net is

411353
unit-testing	assertions
first to have both design by contract assertions and unit tests your unit-testing framework shall be able to catch the assertions

411372
arguments	undefined
in addition to the two you mentioned in your original question - checking arguments.length or using the || operator to provide default value - one can also explicitly check the arguments for undefined via or if one is paranoid see comments

411372
default-value	arguments
using the || operator has become standard practice - all the cool kids do it - but be careful the default-value will be triggers if the arguments evaluates to false which means it might actually be undefined null false 0 or anything else for which boolean ... returns false

411372
arguments	undefined
the test for undefined is next best - it only fails if the function is explicitly called with an undefined value which in all likelyhood should be treated the same way as omitting the arguments

411372
default-value	arguments
the use of the || operator might triggers usage of the default-value even if a valid arguments is provided

411386
default	reset
if you set the default then you reset it again later to something else although it s a very small amount its still a waste of resources

411391
debian	linux
the machines hosting the applications run os x and debian linux

411406
scheme	lisp
it seems to me that those people who never learned lisp or scheme as an undergraduate are now discovering it

411409
python	ruby
the two cool new kids of the past few years ruby and python are both radically closer to functional languages than what came before them â so much so that some lispers have started supporting one or the other as close enough.

411413
worksheet	excel
viewing your linked excel worksheet was lost

411429
decrement	increment
you can t dereference increment or decrement that pointers because you don t know what type you point to

411435
any	set
numerous frameworks can be configured to intercept an html request - for instance asp.net can be set to handle any given extension and an httpmodule could do anything with that

411467
haskell	scala
option comes standard with scala and it is called maybe in haskell

411498
httpd.conf	.htaccess
the server level in either the .htaccess file or the httpd.conf or vhosts.conf file

411523
any	set
edit having one set of property files per dialog etc makes it easier to see where any particular string is coming from but it makes it harder to reuse the same messages etc

411544
linux	unix
how can that be done in linux unix systems

411552
http	ssl
weâ ve updated the adsense ad code so that it now supports secure ad serving through secure sockets layer ssl on hypertext transfer protocol secure http web pages

411561
mime	rfc
rfc 2049 - multipurpose internet mail extensions mime part five conformance criteria and examples

411566
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
look at nscalendar and nsdatecomponents

411571
value	field
but the field are empty without any value after adding a new data row

411594
double	int
what about for int and double

411598
constructor	object
if you have a method or constructor that takes an object parameter and the object method in question cannot sensibly deal with that parameter being null then just check and throw a nullpointerexception there and then

411604
opensuse	ubuntu
in the ideal situation this sort of thing is handled by the desktop environment kde gnome xfce and firefox respects those settings---it should do so on ubuntu fedora and opensuse at least

411650
double	int
this includes primitive-types such as boolean int double and char as well as object data-types such as arraylist string and your own objects

411650
dictionary	hashmap
there s another collection called hashmap that will give you a dictionary or associative array if you went to school in the 90s like object

411656
value	field
if using parameterized sql i think your current solution is fine although if the database-table field for date allows nulls i don t think it is necessary to pass a value for the date column in the insert statement if the date field is blank

411658
python	perl
but gradually c# delphi python perl javascript have added support for closures

411658
python	ruby
several languages notably python c# and ruby have native support for list comprehensions and list generators

411661
button	slide
i m talking about the slide to unlock button on iphone

411674
scala	ocaml
my own suspicion is that hybrid multi-paradigm languages such as scala or ocaml

411679
circular-buffer	fifo
so you need to keep a kernel arrays and a fifo or circular-buffer of the same number of samples

411683
decrement	increment
we can t increment or decrement the pointers

411705
google-chrome	safari
layered backgrounds are part of the css3 working draft but as far as i know support for them is limited to webkit khtml-based browsers such as safari google-chrome konqueror and omniweb

411710
hashmap	arrays
the equivalent of php associative arrays is php maps eg hashmap

411710
arguments	default
php has default value for function arguments

411710
perl	php
string constants in php are declared using single or double quotes much like perl

411732
firebird	mysql
i can t answer of my own knowledge for sybase ingres ms sql server firebird or mysql

411736
functional-programming	imperative
after all most business problems are not pretty math problems but hairy imperative rules to move data around and display them in various ways which means it s not a good fit for pure functional-programming paradigm the learning curve of monad far exceeds oo.

411749
perl	tcl
examples c++ tcl tk perl

411749
haskell	scheme
there s a strong core of support for teaching intro programming using scheme and haskell also enjoys some support there but there s very little in the way of teaching advanced technique for functional programmer

411750
debugging	trace
in a debugging build i want to see the original stack trace with as little effort as possible

411774
put	get
people don t do that necessarily to be able to put the product in a box at any day sure there may be routines that have to be done before release but the idea is that any developer can get the latest code in the server and it will build in their machines

411798
32-bit	64bit
i am presently working on converting a 32-bit application into a 64bit application in c

411798
linux	unix
this application is currently working on x86 architecture windows osx unix linux

411800
installation	building
this means that failin hourly building are noticed much later and weekly installation are not possible because of unfinished functionality

411805
virtualbox	vmware
rather than having an additional hardware server you could use vmware or virtualbox for windows host a small linux vm and install nagios on it

411816
environment	building
get a 64bit machine building environment up and running

411825
any	set
however whenever i tried to get the object by the primary key string it was not bringing back any relationships they were always set to 0

411913
silverlight	wpf
i found a few answers in winforms or wpf like here on stackoverflow but i didn t manage to convert them to silverlight

411916
any	set
if the iptables service is enabled check with chkconfig --list iptables it must be on on runlevels 3 and 5 depending on your situation but it s safe to set it on on both 3 and 5 in any case then your rules will survive the reboot

411918
contains	set
we have an apppool set up which contains two websites both coldfusion sites not .net

411954
javascript	dom
firebug - advanced javascript css dom debugger

411958
stdio	fgets
you should probably read the stdio manpage but the canonical thing would be to open the file with fopen 3 then read using fgets 3 to read a line at a time

411962
getter	setter
is your only problem that your view components feel cluttered by getter setter and constsructors with many parameters

411976
postgresql	mysql
my goal is to utilize an open source relational database for the data storage portion and i m aware of two solid databases that are widely supported mysql and postgresql

411976
sql-server	mysql
i m more familiar with mysql and ms sql-server 2005 but i m trying to move away from the latter due to license costs

411980
javafx	swing
sun is not replacing swing with javafx script

411980
javafx	swing
instead javafx script makes swing easier to use

411986
firefox	safari
building in ie first and then tweaking for firefox safari has brought my ie support up to par

411994
postgresql	mysql
with that said if you are worried about sql server licensing costs i d recommend postgresql first or mysql second as your database of choice

411996
postgresql	firebird
there are four main open-source relational database management systems of note that might be appropriate to this sort of application postgresql mysql firebird and ingres

411996
any	set
postgresql has the best feature set of any of the open-source databases and support for xa transactions which you will probably want if your application is a three-tier system and supports transactions of non-trivial complexity

411996
postgresql	mysql
mysql 5.x has a feature set that supports a reasonable cross section of capabilities but it is not as feature-rich as postgresql

412008
value	field
the tables are usually sparse tables which basically means each record can have any number of field which are basically name value pairs

412015
postgresql	mysql
to answer your stated question more directly i don t think there s a significant difference between postgresql and mysql that is relevant to your project

412043
python	perl
i added python c# perl to the list but i got really bored learning the same things over and over with just a subtle change in syntax

412043
haskell	lisp
just for funsies i learned a functional programming language i chose ocaml over haskell and lisp and it completely changed how i thought about programming

412057
postgresql	mysql
anything from sqlite to mysql to postgresql would probably work just fine

412064
virtual-machine	virtualbox
virtualbox makes development pretty easy since you can have a virtual-machine be the server and browse the pages from your main os

412077
configuration	environment
have you consider of storing configuration values as environment variables

412083
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i have 1 uinavigationcontroller and 2 subclasses of uiviewcontroller

412090
constructor	object
references to const for example can bind to temporaries they are required to implement a copy constructor for overloading operators and they can t be put into an arrays not even if you initialize all elements of it because references are no object as opposed to pointers

412091
postgresql	mysql
mysql has improved a lot with its later versions but postgresql still beats it in every category

412098
calayer	uiview
my assertion that the calayer associated with a uiview shares the same coordinate system could in fact be entirely erroneous

412098
calayer	uiview
i just performed this test myself and it appears calayers actually use the same coordinate system as uiview so my assertion that calayer s flip the y axis is definitely wrong

412098
calayer	uiview
however if you do drawing with coregraphics directly be aware that coregraphics does use a flipped y axis though when drawing in a uiview subclass or i assume a calayer delegate the coregraphics context has already been flipped to match the uiview s or calayer s coordinate system

412098
calayer	uiview
so the short answer if you made it this far is the coordinate system for calayer should match the coordinate system for its corresponding uiview

412132
scheme	lisp
when i was in college at boston university 98- 02 we spent a semester learning scheme which is a close cousin of lisp

412136
set	bag
to prevent this problem you must use a bidirectional associations with the many valued end the set or bag marked as

412168
dictionary	map
a dictionary sounds like an stl map to me

412184
cryptography	security
they will both be on the order of 1024 bits each for cryptography security

412198
constructor	object
that being said your code has weirder things in it since you seem to be trying to assign the constructor or a constructed object into your function pointer

412199
member-function-pointers	function-pointers
the type that the conversion operator returns has function-pointers type but not member-function-pointers type

412244
32-bit	64bit
we re only using three 64bit vms at the moment - mostly it s 32-bit

412254
exponentiation	mod
do the exponentiation g x mod m

412278
virtual-machine	vmware
i ve run websphere for zseries on a vmware virtual-machine with no problem and websphere is more resource intensive then any php stack

412303
32-bit	64bit
the two major difference between 32-bit and 64bit programming in c are sizeof void and sizeof long

412303
32-bit	64bit
the major problem that you will have is that the most unix systems use the i32lp64 standard which defines a long as 64bit and win64 uses the il32llp64 standard which defines a long as 32-bit

412303
32-bit	64bit
if you need to support cross-platform compilation you may want to use a set of architecture based typedef for 32-bit and 64bit integers to ensure that all code will behave consistently

412307
mbunit	nunit
rollback after every test using xtunit for nunit or the mbunit rollback attributes

412314
contains	set
in java all i have to do is create an include directory that contains those libraries and set my classpath

412314
python	ruby
it occurs to me that this is a common issue with all dynamically compiled interpreted languages since the runtime will have a lifetime longer than any particular application that the runtime runs ruby or python and applications will share the same library load state

412314
perl	ruby
if i were developing a perl or ruby web app then i can depend on the existence of a webadmin to manage these dependencies

412324
proxy-pattern	decorator
no this is not the decorator it is the proxy-pattern note i think microsoft expects you to make your test class inherit from the smtpclient class and implement the send asynchsend etc yourself in a way that they just write to a text file or whatever -- if you re wanting to plugins a test version

412339
any	set
if the property usage guidelines state that properties should be able to be set in any order so serialization can work then they re useless for setter-time validation

412340
linux	unix
this might happen on the windows platform or not but on the linux unix platform i don t see that happening

412344
derived-class	base-class
i had tried casting from a base-class to the derived-class putting it in the arrays of the base but obviously that didn t work

412353
derived-class	base-class
casting from a base-class to a derived-class is a bad code smell in most circumstances

412353
derived-class	base-class
the calling code should invoke a methods using the base-class pointers allowing it to be dispatched to the appropriate implementation in the derived-class

412356
derived-class	base-class
conversion from a base-class to a derived-class should only be done when absolutely necessary

412356
polymorphism	override
normally you want to use a technique called polymorphism which means you call a function on the base pointers but it will actually call a function defined in the derived class having the same signature name and parameters are the same type and is said to override it

412427
any	set
thanks to jonathan i have set it but it does not take any effect

412478
internet-explorer	firefox
the little-used getelementsbyname method is part of the dom level 1 specification and is supported by both internet-explorer and mozilla firefox

412478
selected	button
according to the html 4.01 spec the only elements that support name attributes are button textarea applet selected form frame iframe img a input object map param and meta

412504
capistrano	puppet
most of my system maintenance administration and programming is done through automated tools lately all written in ruby puppet capistrano some home-rolled tools etc or are related to scm git svn

412521
svnadmin	dump
backup procedure we use svnadmin hotcopy unless the customer already has something in place usually svnadmin dump heh

412532
python	c++
it is an open source c++ framework for music audio algorithms prototyping but there are python wrappers and graphical tools for prototyping

412563
numerical	nan
and instead of using regular expressions you could use isnan value to check if the numerical value is not a number nan

412589
command-line	cmd
there s also system which runs the cmd as if you typed it from the shell s cmd-line

412598
worksheet	excel
i have heard of a guy who was able to actually push data onto the screen in this app s windows and controls programmatically such that the data was able to be collected into say an excel worksheet then effectively uploaded into this app

412611
variables	boolean
i have the following use case a struct with some boolean and int variables

412614
value	field
if you want to say that the field have an indeterminate value i m afraid you have to use other techniques

412660
entity-framework	nhibernate
from my experience the major orm frameworks for .net nhibernate linqtosql entity-framework work best when they keep track of loaded objects

412660
client-server	web-services
this works fine for simple client-server applications but when using three- or more tier architecture with web-services in a service oriented archtitecture this is not possible

412668
perforce	git
for the last 6 months or so i ve been using a 2-way git mirror of our main perforce repository at work to evaluate it for our workflow

412678
bazaar	git
mercurial has probably the best support for windows out of git bazaar

412685
hardware	monitor
does the target machine have two monitor or some other difference in video hardware that might cause different code to be execution

412689
parallels	vmware
or you could get a mac instead and run textmate with things like vmware fusion and parallels 4 running a mac editor for windows files it should be very easy.

412690
debian	linux
i do host my git repos on a debian gnu linux box though

412693
directory	folder
problem i have a custom wsh scripting that creates a new directory in a similar manner to the standard new folder action in the windows desktop

412693
windows-xp	windows
bonus question regardless of whether and how cumbersome it is to do such a thing in windows-xp does windows vista make it any easier

412694
selected	button
under direct dependencies click the + button and selected your main target

412698
.net	wcf
i m confused with wcf and other web services such as asp.net asmx .net remoting can anybody tell me what is difference with wcf and the others and when should i use it thanks

412720
reflection	runtime
you can use reflection to test for the existence of methods types at runtime when you need to make decisions about code paths

412747
value	field
add name field and value

412747
value	field
add author field and value

412747
value	field
add category field and value

412747
value	field
when you search the index for a category it will return all documents that have a category field with the value you re after

412759
.net	wcf
wcf is communication library that is superset of both .net remoting and old asmx web service and successor of both of these libraries

412759
.net	wcf
basically you should use wcf since .net remoting and asmx might be considered legecy and if i recall correctly some .net remoting bugs were only fixed in wcf and never in .net remoting itself

412764
jquery	dojo
as more and more people do more advanced things with javascript especially leveraging the finer points of jquery dojo and other frameworks fp will be introduced by the web-developer s back-door

412765
malloc	free
second the suggested automatic free cannot work malloc does not initialize the allocated memory

412765
calloc	malloc
i would use calloc instead or add a memset after malloc

412766
jasper-reports	jfreechart
jfreechart or jasper-reports would be my recommendations

412779
calloc	malloc
also i use calloc instead of malloc because it will set all the pointers to null and integers to 0

412786
data-access	ado.net
note that ado.net data services is another option here if you want rest-based data-access but most orms should work ok with wcf

412787
integer	modulus
for your 12-digit bcd number provided there won t be any overflow assume that b 5 through b 0 holds your bytes from most significant to least significant and that mod is the modulus remainder operation and div is integer division the following pseudo-code would multiply by 10

412790
integer	zero
in case you don t have a decimal point your number is an integer you can concat zero if x 0 or delete the last -x characters if x 0

412810
callback	methods
the .load methods has a callback

412810
callback	methods
this will be invoked when the data has been returned so you can instantiate your user-interface controls in this callback methods

412821
contains	any
if you need a methods to take a list of a specific type arraylist fall short because you could pass in an arraylist contains any type

412831
arrays	loops
if you re able to interop with c++ you could consider storing all the values in an arrays and loops over them using sse like this

412835
callback	methods
my guess is that also asp.net ajax have some sort of methods to append javascript back in ajax callback like ra-ajax does and that you can use that to append a window.location redirect.

412865
boost	stl
that s one of my beefs with boost and stl

412866
stateless	stateful
contrast with java and .net frameworks that need to resort to horribly ugly hacks like viewstate and session keys to maintain application-state and maintain the occasionally quite leaky abstraction of a stateful imperative language on an essentially stateless functional platform like the web

412867
authentication	login
my application needs to be designed so that an administrator can via a web interface select if their users login via windows authentication or forms-authentication

412877
authentication	login
use forms-authentication mode whereby the login form can determine the user and the preferred authentication method for that user

412877
authentication	login
if the user can be windows authentication you don t need to present the login form just set the user as authentication and redirect accordingly

412884
binary-serialization	deserialization
it comes with xml-serialization deserialization of graphs for wcf and also its own binary-serialization for remoting much faster than the default binary formatter and also much more compact

412898
web-services	api
some parts of oracle ebs already have web-services api others will surely follow in the future

412910
keyboard	mouse
is there a way to detect when a specific device is plugged into a usb port what i would like to happen is when i plug my laptop into my docking station it run up several apps to account for my different keyboard mouse and monitors

412914
design-principles	principles
i m doing a presentation of solid design-principless and i m trying to connect the single responsibility principles and the open-closed principles to design-patterns

412917
contains	elements
make sure that the container has overflow auto or if you want it to work in ie6 put an elements with the style clear both between the two divs and the contains div

412933
e-commerce	product
i am planning a high performance e-commerce project in asp.net and need help in selected the optimal data retrieval model for the product catalog

412960
host	dns
my basic wish is to host a dns server that represents the following lookup table

412960
hosts-file	hosts
i know i could add the individual subdomains in my hosts but since we have a lot of subdomains which has to be maintained on several dev machines i would rather have a simple wildcard setup

412965
put	get
i must parsing mail body regular expression get some data from mail body put this data to mail subject and forward this mail to another address

412975
printf	scanf
it seems like a lot of templates code to achieve very little given you have direct hex conversion in the standard c scanf and printf functions

412985
python	php
binding php python

412996
binary	hex
converting from binary to hex notation should often not be called ascii... as ascii is a 7-bit format

412997
getattr	setattr
look at built-in functions getattr and setattr

413000
tcp-ip	ppp
most rs232 connections are limited to 115200 baud which ignoring the overhead required for tcp-ip ppp framing is going to yield a transfer rate of at most 11 000 bytes per second

413004
gzip	zip
i haven t used the iphone but you may want to look at gzip which is a very portable open source zip library available for many platforms

413010
attributes	properties
properties are meant to dynamically evaluate attributes or to make them read-only

413013
constructor	object
this method will use a mailservice to send the actual email and i would like to use dependency injection to pass in the service so i created a constructor overload on the user object like this

413027
constructor	object
the problem with that approach is that much of the time the entity is going to come from the linq-to-sql back-end and so isn t going to use your constructor linq-to-sql creates object in its own way

413027
constructor	object
you cannot force linq-to-sql to use your constructor - so this would only be useful for the few object you create yourself

413032
denied	root
you ve denied root access you ve install something like bfd or denyhosts you only use public key authentication.

413036
push	pull
unfortunately this will likely also require manual intervention since you probably don t have a way to make the application programmatically pull from push to the clipboard

413053
any	set
i have a small 500kb swing applet that displays very simple limited set of small html page s inside it with jeditorpane however this does not seem to work 100 fluently some customers get a blank page displayed without any java exception-handling

413054
design-view	designer
when i double click on a .cs file in the solution explorer it opens in design-view by default windows form designer

413060
direct3d	directx
it can grab the vista windows desktop manager directx direct3d shared surface and use it as a visual brush in wpf

413071
latex	tex
into latex tex quotes #39

413072
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am in the middle of a project where i am migrating some code for a website from webforms to asp.net-mvc - unfortunatly there s not enough time to do it all at once so i will have to do some.

413072
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am suspecting this has to do with the mix up of asp.net-mvc and webforms however i am was under the impression that such mixup should be possible is there any kind of tweak for this

413077
parentheses	let
the parentheses let you extract the matched portion

413079
msbuild	nant
this second place animosity isn t old news to be honest i don t know why ms don t spend more time supporting solutions already in place we ve seen this all before with nant - msbuild and nunit - mstest it would save everyone a lot of time and effort if they just accepted one of the better and mature solutions and endeavoured to support that as opposed to brewing their own all the time

413093
gethashcode	equals
equals and gethashcode - not all classes are comparable or hashable should be moved to an interface

413110
windows-xp	windows
i wonder why some people wrote in some forums that windows-xp and windows server 2008 limits this number to 15 or 20

413114
markup	xhtml
but that s not the case anymore with at least the most modern browsers aka everything but ie6 if you have valid xhtml strict you still triggers standard compliant mode hence as long as i produce valid markup why bother

413125
execute	prepare
the advantages of a prepare statement over an execute string are many -

413125
execute	prepare
the statement is parsing and an access plan determind only once when the prepare statement is execute

413131
persistence	stateless
so a stateless persistence layer or even bright-enough object-oriented database abstraction layer is what we would need the most

413160
versioning	upgrade
the problematic moodle was upgrade from 1.8 versioning earlier

413180
specifications	w3c
the w3c specifications say that it is okay to serve xhtml 1.0 as text html as long as you follow certain rules for backward compatibility mainly in self closing tags include a spaces before the forwarding slash

413194
enumerator	iteration
so an enumerator may use a state machine that tracks your current positioning and returns the next item for each iteration of the loop rather than using a counter

413205
for-loop	loops
if you want to know how many loops you ve gone through you need to use a for-loop or keep track of the count yourself

413221
web-deployment	web
i ve created a web-deployment project using the templates for visual-studio 2008 for a asp.net 3.5 web application not web site

413240
haskell	erlang
now which language could be the next step that is the hard stuff but i believe could be haskell f# clojure ocaml or erlang

413240
python	perl
or could be python with more fp constructs and better support for parallelism performance or also perl 6 with parrot looks very interesting

413250
png	gif
push this along with all the media files aspx gif png etc. out and your source should be hidden from less-than-diligent people

413261
value	field
it will not verify that the someothernumber field of result has a value

413278
png	gif
maybe not the ideal solution but you could always extract the gif animation frames to a png formatted sprite sheet and then use the sprite class to handle the animation

413281
put	get
any new tests get put in there with the rest of them and whatever package name you have it doesn t matter

413306
compact-framework	.net
i was once able to get windows mobile device with .net compact-framework 2.0 installed to communicate with pc using 32feet.net library

413313
contains	any
composition of components containser components can contains any other component

413313
contains	any
for example a grid should be able to contains other grids or any other components

413313
click	mouse
a system for passing events to components such as mouse click cursor enter etc

413332
ref	out
do place all out parameters after all of the pass-by-value and ref

413338
click	mouse
it is possible to re-arrange the file tabs by using the mouse to drag-sort them click and hold the mouse button on a tab and then drag it to the new location

413344
directory	folder
maybe i m wrong but i m not convinced that iis will serve any files from the bin folder it doesn t for me anyway and i assume this is by design in the same way that you cannot donwload web.config - it also won t even list the directory contents

413355
positioning	slider
if i m fast enough to get my cursor into the positioning that the close button will be placed before it slider into place the ie status bar shows the # link but clicking or moving the cursor makes the status bar go blank -- and of course nothing happens

413391
for-loop	arrays
the code could appear to run through a for-loop over an entire arrays collection whatever but maybe it uses obj.length instead of obj.length-1

413392
any	set
copy this to the server set up your db and any filesystems permissions for uploads etc. and you re away

413407
duplicates	contains
some search engines i m not sure exactly how google in particular does it will use heuristics to try and decide if two different urls contains the same or extremely similar content and are thus duplicates results

413407
duplicates	contains
if there are 156 unique urls but 9 of those have been marked as duplicates of other results it is simpler to say about 150 results rather than something like 156 results which contains 147 unique results and 9 duplicates

413423
vsts	tfs
we use tfs and are looking at using vsts database edition gdr

413423
configuration	environment
we then have configuration for each environment

413462
stateless	stateful
there is also obvious confusion when you used the term stateless and transactional in the same discussion as transactionalal are inherently stateful

413463
textbox	button
for example a button is also on the page when clicked a postback occurs and within the method that is raised this textbox was not used

413471
postback	ajax
with that said and as others have pointed out look into using ajax if you want to avoid whole page-level postback to the server

413473
constructor	object
this library contains a static object which throws an exception in its constructor

413473
exception-handling	try-catch
i have a try-catch ... block around the dlopen call but it doesn t catch the exception-handling and i just see abort printed

413482
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc is a new paradigm instead of using webforms which doesn t have view state or post backs

413484
any	set
i wanted to set up the states without consuming any characters

413501
contains	any
remove any path that contains the removed edge s and decrement the counter for that node

413510
any	set
however if for each node in your network you store a set containing the nodes it was lit through you can easily traverse the graph from the removed edge and fix up any lit unlit references

413536
markup	xhtml
the problem is that you need to limit your markup to subset of both html and xhtml

413544
space	input
you need at least o n + m time and space to read the input therefore the algorithm is optimal

413556
attributes	properties
make sure that on the summary type that you set the properties of the datacontract attributes as well as any data-members attributess or datacontract attributess on children you expose specifically the name and namespace properties to reflect the name and namespace of the non-summary type since these must match

413557
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
if you obfuscation your assembly you will stop a casual developer whose just curious but you won t stop a slightly motivated person from reverse-engineering

413577
firefox	opera
i would prefer solutions which are for opera though i m not opposed to firefox answers

413580
contains	elements
that s simply putting the textbox in a contains elements

413603
value	field
but for instance the genre field is a manytomany field so is it possible to get the value from genre.all.0 for instance and not just the genre id

413604
firefox	opera
although this page is about opera it has some good examples that are applicable to greasemonkey in firefox too

413614
selected	button
now i can see my list fileed but when i selected an item and push next button the selectededitem property of the list remains null what s the reason

413615
value	field
use a field that indicates the type of measure weight length etc. and store the value in another field

413629
jeditorpane	jtextpane
we tried both jtextpane and jeditorpane with no luck

413637
markup	xhtml
the arguments for xhtml generally tend towards the cleaner markup or talking about well-formed markup

413637
xml-serialization	xml
additionally text xml doesn t play nicely with rest because that should mean xml-serialization of the data and not a formatted markup page safari gets this one wrong in my opinion by requesting text xml before text html as desired content-types

413647
linked-list	queue
if you need quick insertions and deletions in the beginning or end use either linked-list or queue

413651
linked-list	arrays
when to use a linked-list over an arrays arrays list

413657
selected	button
however it seems that when i don t specify an approval form to use sharepoint just selected a default one with a complete task button but no reject button

413706
substring	charindex
substring lastname 0 charindex lastname + + firstname

413706
substring	charindex
charindex substring lastname 0 charindex lastname + + firstname len lastname + 3

413713
executable	jar
when i m done with a project and want to deploy it or if i just want to test it i use the built-in jar tool in eclipse to make an executable .jar of my project

413713
redmine	trac
maybe i ll also install something like trac or redmine for bug-tracking todo list etc

413722
png	gif
it takes a latex snippet runs latex and produces a png or gif

413736
erlang	scheme
my macbook s default name jamess-macbook does not play well with erlang s node-naming scheme due to the dash

413750
jeditorpane	jtextpane
i don t have any experience in this but if you really need to load big files i suggest you do some kind of lazy-loading with jtextpane jeditorpane

413750
jeditorpane	jtextpane
define a limit that jtextpane jeditorpane can handle well like 500kb or 1mb

413750
show	next
if so show a nice waiting cursor and load the previous next chunk to memory and into the text control

413750
jeditorpane	jtextpane
the text on the jtextpane jeditorpane must not change when loading chunks or else the user feels like is in another positioning of the file

413752
code-coverage	cobertura
i would recommend using junit in conjunction with a code-coverage tool such as cobertura which is easy to set up - it will help you to understand how much code your tests are covering and is an indicator about how effective your tests are

413763
sftp	scp
use ant to build your project and deploy it scp sftp task

413769
triggers	insert
is it possible the insert is valid but that a separate update is done afterwards that is invalid but wouldn t fire the triggers

413777
revision	svn
how can i get a fully recursive svn blame report for all non-binary files in a branch where the output is in a single file in xml format and includes revision date author filename path and the text of the line of the file itself

413777
msbuild	nant
available tools are the latest stable release of nant and nantcontrib msbuild and latest command-line svn

413777
command-line	cmd
here s some of the issues i have run into cmd-line svn blame cmd does not support directory recursion

413796
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m writing a component that i would like to be able to use in both asp.net-mvc and webforms web apps but i m not sure how to handle the differences between how httpcontext is handled

413796
asp.net-mvc	webforms
my component involves a custom ihttphandler for webforms or a custom actionresult for asp.net-mvc

spring	jsf
according to jeremy grelle the submission of _eventid parameter does not trigger transitions when integrating spring webflow to jsf

413818
value	field
a better solution here would be to encrypt the names of the field and the value with a key that is generated on the server and only the server

413822
value	field
a hacker can access hidden field just as easily as querystring value by using an intercepting proxy or any number of tools

413822
value	field
i dont think there is anything wrong with using hidden field as long as they aren t used for anything sensitive and you validate them like you would any other value from the client

413825
attributes	properties
in c# i m marking some classes properties with attributes and i m using reflection to find these properties in order to perform gets and sets on them

413855
http	ssl
it does not support ssl http

413855
webserver	nginx
you ll have to run it using apache nginx or some other webserver that supports ssl in order to test

413860
contains	any
one thing to keep in mind if you place data on the querystring is that people pass urls around and because of this should never contains any information specific to the current user

413862
parallels	vmware
i ve run it in vmware fusion and parallels previously on several macs with 2 gig of ram without any issues

413862
parallels	bootcamp
i generally install with bootcamp because that lets you boot into native windows if you need more umph or if you want to game and the more recent versioning of viewmodelware and parallels both allow booting the viewmodel directly from the bootcamp partition

413864
getter	setter
going beyond what casperone has said including the bit about checking that this is the bottleneck you may find it very helpful to convert the getters setter into delegates a and an for the getter and setter respectively using delegate.createdelegate

413867
uisegmentedcontrol	uitableview
i have an uitableview with about 30 custom cells each containing an uisegmentedcontrol

413872
iteration	elements
that will have the fastest insert time and will have great iteration time it just sucks at indexing such as looking at the 3rd elements from the end or the 72nd elements

413882
methodology	waterfall
what software development methodology do you use waterfall agile scrum xp

413903
ocaml	lua
on further reflection i m not sure if you can do this with the official c implementation of lua because i think ocaml believes it owns main

413904
object-reference	instances
side note of course static-members can access instances members through an object-reference

413910
deployment	install
will it be available if i have office 2007 install on the development and deployment machines

413912
margins	padding
margins and padding are set to 0 yet the images are being display a little offset from top and left

413914
value	field
in addition to all the other useful advice by other posters i d also add that hidden field make your app no less vulnerable to sql injection attacks as url query string value do

413918
margins	padding
you probably need to remove padding and margins from the

413927
put	get
i publish the web site and put a reference to the app_code.dll in the test project and i no longer get a build error

413939
if-statement	loops
learn what an if-statement is this is all boolean logic so it should be somewhat familiar learn about loops learn about mathematical operations learn about functions subroutines

413943
webforms	asp.net
you are writing your code for asp.net not asp.net mvc or asp.net webforms

413943
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it s easy to make it working on both models works ootb with webforms with ignoreroute in asp.net-mvc

413948
variables	boolean
the first will cast the variables to a boolean which will fail the check on empty arrays non-numeric strings and other checks in which the variables is definitely set

413948
variables	boolean
i would never perform the first check boolean cast without checking the type of the variables as well

413949
python	ruby
gcc python ruby on rails etc

413949
aptana	pydev
eclipse 3.4 ganymede with aptana radrails and pydev addons

413955
driver	kernel
i think they are both in the kernel so there might be a way that can use another driver directly

413985
error-handling	try-catch
what is the proper place to explain error-handling in a try-catch statement

414020
json	xml
what i want to do is sending xml json or other serialized messages from a client to another client and or client to server

414021
document	element
it always returns an empty arrays if you are not using a dom element or the document as your context

414023
local-variables	class-members
for class-members and local-variables use lowercamelcase

414046
variables	boolean
this true false check acts like - basically whether the variables returns true when converted to a boolean

414047
message	alert
i have a client that wants the application to be able to send sms text message alert to people that have subscribed to the service

414054
authentication	login
for example in the zend-framework there are two classes zend_auth which handles user authentication login simple database tables to openid and zend_acl which handles the user access side of things

414082
jsonp	ajax
i m not sure about reddit.com but for sites that don t support the jsonp idiom you can still create a proxy technique on the backend that would return the reddit json and then you would just make an ajax request to that that

414084
linked-list	arrays
a collection class like arrayslist encapsules some kind of internal storage presumably an arrays which is resized as needed but it could also be a linked-list or some other implementation

414084
instances	private
metods like indexof and sort needs access to the underlying private storage to be efficient so they have to be instances methods

414090
licensing	gpl
warning gnu readline is subject to gpl licensing terms

414096
constructor	object
note by moving the code from the method connect to the constructor you can make the object always valid

414118
document	editing
below is a sample macros that is selected a piece of text enabling it for editing and then locking the rest of the document

414127
data-structures	dictionary
this will help the dictionary to allocate the necessary space in its internal data-structures to avoid reallocating and reshuffling data

414136
vb.net	vb6
you could use that in anything that can use activex c++ vb6 vb.net etc... to create a parser as well to follow-up on what berek said

414137
where-clause	sql
there is a where-clause to constrain the results to a specific database of a specific server that was not included in the above sql query

414146
googletest	cxxtest
we ve been using a similar approach at my office except using cxxtest instead of unittest++ and now we re in the process to migrating to google s vastly superior imho googletest framework

414149
put	get
in any case if you get out of the top-level loop and put things into a separate file with an explicit type signature it all works fine

414151
keyboard	mouse
it would be extremely natural to use and much more lightweight than having to deal with a keyboard and mouse

414158
implements	abstract
it is implemented using jgroups and while your requirement is not for a caching solution it does abstract some of the salient functions of jgroups quite well by basically implements a distributed hashmap with event notifications etc

414160
handler	service
take an approach similar to #1 above but attempt to use the data port ashx handler to update the products instead of using our own custom web service

414170
execute	prepare
generally it s more efficient to prepare the statement before your loop and execute the statement handle during the loop supplying the parameter at that time

414179
order	add
i should add that i typically get pdf with hyperlink by using something on the order of

414188
expression	evaluation
oddly enough i did some playing with lazy evaluation of lambda expression a few weeks back and blogged about it here

414199
fatal-error	crash
so i m pretty sure if i do a fatal-error on these cases the server will crash eventually

414208
slidedown	slideup
it has also got a slideup and slidedown effect

414218
eclemma	emma
emma and eclemma will give you nice reports of what percentage of what classes are run for any given run of the code

414227
nagios	munin
there are generic system like that for servers such as nagios and munin

414231
upgrade	migrate
as an addendum to harms answer i would note that like the windows registry os x preferences are deliberately not deleted when the app is removed but unlike the windows registry preferences can migrate from machine to machine as you upgrade your mac and use the user migration facility

414243
haskell	c++
c++ does not have native support for lazy evaluation as haskell does

414247
hide	show
for other kinds of apps on cds say a slider show or something like that the developer generally uses hidden folder to hide support data to ensure that the only thing the user will see when they open the cd is the single icon they re supposed to double click to start the app

414258
forwarding	port
so if your program uses its own ... lib you might have to look into another option like port forwarding

414260
expression	evaluation
as it is the code makes no sense because although evaluation happens lazily it still happens in the same expression

414272
type-conversion	int
from the databasetest was a type-conversion from int to product or

414289
emacs	vim
there is also a minority class of person that thinks vim or emacs is the best thing since sliced bread

414289
keyboard	mouse
especially avoid forcing the user to change their position in front of the computer moving one hand between the mouse and keyboard

414289
keyboard	mouse
the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse

414291
callback	methods
you may want to implement something like a callback methods that the client calls to know why it returned null

414292
json	xml
if you mimic the interfaces and implementation of the txmldocument then conversion to from xml json is somewhat trivial

414303
user-interface	look-and-feel
it can be tempting to tweak your user-interface dialogs to fit your exact needs but also keep in mind that it is jarring to users who are accustomed to the look-and-feel of windows already

414319
toolchain	newlib
the psp is not unix and is not posix compliant however the open source toolchain is composed by gcc 4.3 bintutils 1.16.1 and newlib 1.16

414323
.net	wcf
wcf is a communication stack that allows services to be exposed over http like asmx and tcp like remoting as well as named pipes which is really an intra-machine cross process call msmq and with .net 3.5 rest

414353
easymock	mockito
some mocking frameworks like easymock require a repository interface while others like mockito dont

414366
unsafe	out
does anyone know if there are any solutions out there that go beyond just removing unsafe tags

414377
one-to-many	entity
i want to have a collection of securedpage in staff entity so it s a one-to-many but i couldnt figure it out how to handle with it in mapping

414388
selected	button
if the user selected a menu button on the top of the application while an invalid edit has popped up the dialog it switches screens destroying everything currently on the screen including the table

414396
versioning	upgrade
after i have upgrade to the latest versioning of java mail the reason of the error became clear it was a javax.net.ssl.sslhandshakeexception which was not thrown up in the old versioning of the lib

414404
redgate	ssms
i know redgate has such a product but i d rather not have to pay for something which in my opinion should be built into ssms

414409
put	get
i put both details in the same file so users dont have to download multiple files to get their map working it could become time consuming and seem complex

414409
tokenize	parsing
i found a some explanation code here that does something similar but still parsing into one arrays although it manually tokenize the input

414414
sql-server	mysql
i m not sure about mysql but for sql-server even just the default query analyzer can restrict how long queries will run before they time out

414416
boost-phoenix	boost-lambda
but for those of us living in the present you have boost-lambda library and boost-phoenix

414448
json	xml
storing json or xml in databases is normally bad unless there is something inherent about the application such that the data that needs to be extensible

414470
contact	submit
the name of the button submit or add contact needs to be a variables

414477
globalization	localization
note i have not done much globalization or localization in asp.net generally so there may be some best practices from the non-mvc world that i am missing

414489
primitive	int
alternately you can use the trove class tobjectinthashmap to map objects to primitive int

414494
webforms	asp.net
typically in the past i would have just built it using asp.net webforms

414497
json	xml
so you can basically create an xml payload or json or whatever you want post it to the ashx page which has a single method which will inspect the request perform what you need and return the results you need

414502
object-reference	instances
i m getting the error object-reference not set to an instances of an object. when trying to reference a hidden-field lveditprojectsteps_hdnstepstatusid for future reference from the edititem during the onitemupdating event after the updates event fires in a listview

414523
having	select
i m pulling from a bunch of different tables and filtering the content with information not included in the select statement tblcontracts is not having information pulled from it by select it s only used in where

414529
radio-button	selected
i am having some difficulty accessing the value of the selected radio-button in a radiogroup

414533
javascript	dom
next pick up a good framework it will help you a great deal performing dom manipulations which is what javascript is generally used for

414555
javascript	dom
next i strongly recommend learning to use a cross-browser javascript library rather than trying to do everything by hand specifically interacting with the dom performing xmlhttprequests aka ajax calls etc.

414555
javascript	dom
jquery is a javascript framework that allows easy and reliable interactions with the document object model dom

414555
jquery-plugins	jquery
20 amazing jquery-plugins and 65 excellent jquery resources

414564
required	checked
as a maintainer i d always rather have clean clear comments unmuddled by whatever strange markup your auto-doc tool required that tell me why you wrote that weird switching statement the way you did or what bug this seemingly-redundant parameter checked fixes or whatever else i need to know to actually keep the code clean and bug-free as i work on it

414581
ubuntu	linux
i use aptana on both windows and linux ubuntu

414582
deployment	install
if you have created a standard visual-studio deployment project the project will already include a form asking for the install location and will install all files you put in the application folder of the filesystems panel to this folder

414589
exception-handling	error-handling
in general assertions are most useful during the debugging phase whereas exception-handling are considered part of regular program flow and error-handling

414606
json	xml
json is a data format like xml but it s native to javascript

414606
webforms	asp.net
microsoft asp.net ajax is basically a set of extensions to asp.net webforms that facilitate ajax functionality by performing postbacks to the server without refreshing the entire page

414606
webforms	asp.net
asp.net ajax however is based on asp.net webforms and as such it is not compatible with asp.net mvc

414606
javascript	dom
in short learn javascript itself if you haven t already learn dom manipulation dhtml fundamentals as well and then learn jquery and i think you ll be all set

414614
having	select
i m pulling from a bunch of different tables and filtering the content with information not included in the select statement tblcontracts is not having information pulled from it by select it s only used in where

414630
configuration	environment
what s the easiest way to setup separate configuration files for these different environment

414638
arguments	default
as you say though there is a constructor for list int that does take an int as an arguments and the new syntactic sugar added in c# 3.0 allows you the convenience of using to add members to the collection defined by the default constructor

414644
buffering	streaming
when serializing into an xml string from a memory streaming be sure to use memorystreaming#toarray instead of memorystreaming#getbuffering or you will end up with junk characters that won t deserialize properly because of the extra buffering allocated

414648
json	xml
but if you re going to be using such large datasets then perhaps you could consider exporting your sqlite data in json format rather than xml

414661
configuration	environment
i find having several configuration files for each environment works well

414661
web-config	app-config
i then link to a master version of this using the built in configsource attributes within the web-config or app-config such as

414661
configuration	environment
i would then use the build process or deploy process to copy the the correct configuration for the environment down to the name that the web.config is expecting

414670
keyboard	mouse
with either one you should be able to reuse your existing screen keyboard mouse usb disks etc

414671
triggers	insert
if you want to keep a record of what changes have been made to a database instead of storing the sql statements you could also define insert update triggers and define another table in which these values can be stored

414694
emacs	vim
that said there is similar features in vim and emacs although i ve not used it nearly as much - search and replace as people have said and more similarly column insert mode

414697
configuration	environment
then i just deploy the right configuration file to the right environment

414700
private-members	instances
your test code doesn t appear to require access to any private-members so why not juse use an instances of the class itself

414701
sql-server	oracle
this is likely a very inefficient way to do it in oracle you would use exists instead of in but i don t know the sql-server equivalent

414713
pdcurses	ncurses
are pdcurses similar enough to ncurses to use ncurses tutorials

414734
put	get
here s how a crusty old government contractor i know recently put it as the prostitutes say first you gotta get them upstairs.

414738
firefox	opera
then when developing a site is it common place to use two separate stylesheets to fix bugs for example create one stylesheet for ie and one for firefox opera etc

414740
command-prompt	cmd
you could manually parsing the relevant part of the registry find the associated application and kick it off yourself but the cmd-prompt s built-in start cmd life easier

414763
difference	factors
the very small difference is probably a result of another factors

414763
subtraction	modulo
as you can see modulo is about an order of magnitude slower than subtraction

414776
derived-class	base-class
when you say it should only be callable within the actual class do you mean the base-class or the derived-class

414780
protected	public
visibility determined by access-modifiers private protected public

414787
sql-server	mysql
switch away from mysql to a client database such as sqlite or sql-server compact edition

414803
getter	setter
the reason for using a setfield methods approach rather than properties with getter and setter is so that it is easier for code to actually set these fields in a generic way without resorting to reflection or switching statements

414838
http	ssl
i think the value with be http for location.protocol if you are on ssl

414865
derived-class	base-class
but that means that code in a base-class can execute code in a derived-class

414873
jquery	.post
your jquery call is sending the data to the addlink action on the user controller as .post data which means in your c# code you ll access it via the request.form object

414887
contains	any
it contains a comprehensive coverage of all of the concepts and design-patterns that you might use in ajax development in any lib

414887
lgpl	gpl
downside for some might be the gpl commercial license terms was orginally lgpl and the switching to gpl caused some controversy

414891
quirks-mode	doctype
what is the difference between standards and quirks-mode and what are some quirks i may run into with differently set doctype

414902
export	csv
from within psql you just use copy with the query you gave us export this as a csv or whatever format switch database with c and import it

414919
joomla	drupal
there are also various modules plugins for various cmss drupal plone joomla wordpress etc. that you can use to add socnet functionality to a site

414927
swing	gwt
i think you need to treat gwt just like any other ui framework like swing cocoa etc

414934
innodb	myisam
this gives you back a lot of raw performance that you would otherwise lose when moving tables from myisam to innodb

414934
innodb	myisam
likewise if you have some tables that are near 100 write you may benefit from insert delayed but that is only supported in myisam the delayed clause is ignored for an innodb table

414939
latitude-longitude	great-circle
once you have latitude-longitude coordinates which i assume are in the wiki page s geotag format you can use the great-circle formula to compute relative distances and bypass google s api entirely

414940
arrays	loops
you don t really want the components arrays which is what the for - in loops iterates over since it has nothing to do in general with the parent-child relationship

414940
click	mouse
that is to make a button have grayed text it s not enough to disable its parent even though the button won t respond to mouse click

414968
bufferedwriter	bufferedreader
try bufferedreader and bufferedwriter to speed up processing

414969
contains	any
ie does it have any default values in which case the asp.net-mvc framework will be looking for a methods signature that contains those default values do you have id in your url rule

414972
windows-vista	windows
however you don t have to do this if you use the control panel to set persistent environment variables or if you use the setx command in windows-vista or one of the windows resource kits

414993
quirks-mode	doctype
not including a doctype or including an incorrect doctype can trigger quirks-mode

414993
internet-explorer	firefox
the kicker here is that quirks mode in internet-explorer is quite different from quirks mode in firefox and other browsers meaning that you ll have a much harder job trying to ensure your page works consistently in all browsers if pages are rendered in quirks mode than you will if they are rendered in standards mode

415016
arrays	loops
when the key is pressed you set the the appropriate index to true in the keydown method and in your game rendering loops you call depending on what keys in the arrays are true

415016
key-value	key
you set the key-value to false when the key is released in the keyrelease event methods i m not sure what it is in c#

415017
authentication	login
if the user is not authentication he is thrown back to the login page

415019
value	field
args are the form field kwargs hash of variables and value

415030
.when	ready
since you have your own convention i recommend explicit encoding the whole string .when it is ready to send and explicit decoding it on the receiving end

415035
perl	c++
the languages i use the most are perl java and some c c++

415064
stdin	pipe
when it runs it creates three pipe to redirect the console s stdin stdout and stderr

415064
stdin	pipe
it then finds its own name usually devenv.com replaces the .com with .exe and launches the new app devenv.exe using the read end of the stdin pipe and the write ends of the stdout and stderr pipes as the standard handles

415091
assign	add
now you have a custom operation pressing the program key or which one you ve assign to it will run the sequences without your further assistance and will multiplying the content of the display with 2 and will add 1 - this is a program

415091
.when	ready
.when you turn on a machine which have a built-in basic language interpreter it s ready to accept your commands and performs just as you type

415108
internet-explorer	firefox
i used the css provided and i am seeing the same behavior in both internet-explorer and firefox

415139
webforms	asp.net
wow everyone is coming on board to simpler better web development controlling html in asp.net webforms

415142
udp	tcp
if that happens look up the port numbers one udp outgoing and one tcp incomming and unblock them

415153
default	reset
by default that is unless you include connection reset false in the connection string .net resets the connection with the sp_reset_connection stored procedure before reusing it

415153
any	set
among other things it undoes any set commands that have been issued since the connection was opened

415169
jquery	dojo
you might want to check out the jquery or prototype or mootools or dojo or insert name here framework to see how they do it if you insist on writing your own

415216
ubuntu	linux
i have ubuntu 8.10 linux and was wondering what everyone was using as a tool for developing applications for any linux flavor - is java the best way to go

415216
ubuntu	linux
i m new to ubuntu and haven t worked in linux since the days of redhat using terminal so i m still pretty new

415216
.net	wcf
.net remoting web services wcf many recent wcf apps windows applications windows services web applications - i use javascript when developing asp.net and i also know vbscript vb6

415228
python	java
java for real desktop applications in eclipse and python for quick-and-dirty things

415234
internet-explorer	firefox
i just found out the hard way that when you have a html form with webkit browsers treat it differently to firefox and internet-explorer

415234
google-chrome	firefox
safari and google-chrome however will send that first form to the default page index.php or whatever - the second form works the same as firefox ie

415236
perl	ruby
the python perl and ruby people use command line tools frequently as well but their ides are becoming richer all the time

415240
static-class	inherited
so i m refactoring a legacy codebase i ve inherited and in the process i found a static-class that encapsulates the logic for launching 3rd party applications

415257
callback	methods
however the event-firing mechanism doesn t work in gwttestcases which means you can t do things like programmatically click a button and expect some onclick callback methods to be invoked on a listener

415270
jndi	jdbc
specifically in reference to the actual pooling of ldap connections if you are using the built in jndi ldap provider the connections are pooled already using semantics similar to jdbc data sources where separate pools are maintained for different ldap urls and security properties

415292
shell	bash
write some shell scripts using bash or ksh

415292
python	lua
python is a popular favorite but ruby and lua are also fine choices

415305
display	height
i m trying to make a horizontal list of links with ul wherein all a is display block and has a height

415305
display	width
my question is if there s a way for me to retain height and display block because of background images but without width i want the item length to be flexible for a and make a horizontal list in ie6

415322
order	add
4 click the column on the child table that you want to filtering this check mark will be removed later in order to add it to the criteria panels so you can filtering it

415330
python	perl
linux world is primarily hacked with bash perl python and c

415361
python	php
there is a semi-functional php implementation of wordnet but i d suggest outsourcing to the natural language toolkit for python for the heavy lifting there as most of the work is already done for you

415369
variables	boolean
but thanks to orso who pointed out that setting event.cancelbubble true is useless the way to get rid of the confirm prompt is to exclude the return statement altogether i chose to use a boolean variables as a flag to decide whether to return something or not

415376
perl	php
this can be done in just about any language php python perl etc

415376
perl	php
edit one more you might find interesting as a base filechucker is a php and perl solution that s got a ton of features including the ability to do email notifications of uploads downloads and file management from the browser etc

415396
arrays	loops
i timed each of the suggested methods in a loops executed 1 million times using 3 arrays of 10 bytes each

415396
arrays	loops
finally i increased the size of each arrays to 1 million elements and re-ran the test executing each loops only 4000 times

415396
arrays	loops
ienumerable byte i re-ran the last timing test 1 million elements 4000 iterations adding a loops that iterates over the full arrays with each pass

415410
shell	tcsh
shell csh sh tcsh use it as well

415411
disposable	dispose
in general you can call dispose either implicitly with a using statement or explicitly on all disposable objects however in the hypothetical scenario where you can not it depends on the way the object was implements

415411
disposable	dispose
bottom line is it is a best practice to dispose all disposable objects otherwise you can introduce weird and complex bugs

416340
keydown	keyup
by the time keyup or keypress is triggers the default for keydown has already happened

416346

reverse-proxy	varnish
i m looking for a caching reverse-proxy something like squid or varnish with good support for serving stale content in the event of failure - in other words if the application i m proxying goes away or starts serving internal server errors i d like the cache to continue to serve the last good response saved from the back end

416393
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
i wouldn t bother with obfuscation the latest syntax-sugar compile-time tricks and optimisations in .net 3.5 make simple reverse-engineering pretty tough already

416395
fiddler	charles
addition to other tools mentioned here i often find great help in having a proper debugging proxy - fiddler free windows only and charles commercial cross-platform are great ones

416400
required	checked
the one possibel problem i see with this model is if you suddenly find that part of your support libraries depend on library blahonga checked out of cvs before 2008-12-01 and other parts of your support libraries also depend on blahonga but required a feature only available in cvs from 2008-12-29

416402
constructor	object
i ve seen unit tests that check to make sure a constructor is returning an object of the correct type.

416406
tuples	any
we have a list of points with masses like so a python list of tuples but you can represent it as you see fit in any language

416443
versioning	downgrade
note that you often cannot downgrade from a newer versioning of the os to the original so if you had problems with the beta you might be stuck with it

416447

perl	c++
i know that this is possible in perl with the next label or last label calls and labeled blocks is it possible to do it in c++ or i should use a while loop

416472
arrays	map
as already indicated you need an associative arrays or hash map or equivalent

416484
put	get
for large binaries in addition to the version number i tend to put a record count and crc the reason being that large binaries are much more prone to get truncated and or corrupted over time or during transfer than smaller ones

416495
basic	vba
another way would be to open an access file and write some basic vba code taking advantage of the docmd.transferdatabase method where you can link or copy tables from other databases into access

416505
duplicates	sorted
if you want to maintain a sorted list which you will frequently modify a structure which in addition to being sorted allows duplicates and whose elements can be efficiently referenced by index then use an arraylist but when you need to insert an element always use collections.binarysearch to determine the index at which you add a given element

416521
nested-loops	loops
you can use the return keyword move the nested loop into a subroutine invoke the subroutine to run the nested-loops and return from the subroutine to exit all the loops

416525
contains	any
you would have to come up with a delimiter you guarantee would not be contains in any string to get this to work and that could get messy

416538
any	set
in the property set it tries to build a date from the different values and displays any errors that might occur

416544
interpolation	contour
if on the other hand your mass is scalability or that the mass at an unknown positioning can be interpolation from surrounding points i would tend to triangulate and contour the input data and use areas between contour to find clusters of similar mass

416568
exception-handling	try-catch
from all of the suggestions above i would avoid using the try-catch mechanism because exception-handling should be reserved for exceptional circumstances and not normal control flow

416570
persistence	hibernate
for this kind of application i like the persistence as a service model ironically written about hibernate but it applies to anything

416579
ip-address	hostname

throwing testing frameworks tdd test-first mentality and mocking framework at someone who s not yet comfortable with neither c# .net or programming in general could be just too much to handle

416657
selected	button
then i can have action links button whatever that apply an action to the selected items such as delete

416673
exception-handling	try-catch
if you really want to catch exception-handling and die slightly nicer you can put a try-catch block around the application.run call and work from there

416681
exception-handling	try-catch
maybe whoever came up with the requirement doesn t understand that you can still catch all exception-handling at the top without putting a try-catch in every single function

416706
arrays	loops
i would add the two groups in two arrayss and then loops over the arrayss to compare the individual strings in that arrays

416728
order	join
this drove me up the wall for a couple of hours for the linq join to work with composite keys you need the name as well as order of each part to match

416742
error-handling	try-catch
he knows there is a global error-handling but it does not help in this scenario and stacktrace is not accure in release mode so he requires a try-catch block like this

416743
gnome	kde
you might want to look what desktops like gnome and kde give you

416743
kdevelop	cdt
for ides you can check kdevelop and eclipse + cdt for c++ job

416743

learning automake toolchain should also be a bonus as a lot of software for linux uses this

416743
python	ruby
for rapid jobs use python or ruby - whichever suits you more

416751
interpreter	runtime
javascript is an interpreter language it s not compiled till runtime

this contains vb6 compatibility functions the my namespace features as well as some compiler helper functions and is commonly referred to as the vb.net runtime

417012
user-interface	drawing
swing is considered lightweight because it is fully implemented in java without calling the native operating system for drawing the graphical user-interface components

417012
swing	awt
the evolution of the swing paint system section from the painting in awt and swing article explains the difference between lightweight and heavyweight

417012
swing	awt
the advantage of swing is that it has many more components available such as jtable and jlist which are more graphical and extensible than the components provided in awt allowing for more graphics-rich applications to be developed

417025
value	field
you could do it with hidden field for the value you don t want to display

417039
tuples	set
with this configuration set i then need to do lookups on bazillion give or take key1 key2 key3 tuples to get the effective value

417039

417062
value	field
it is often useful to have a field in a dao whose value comes from a java enumerator

ideally hibernate should support enum field directly and would create an extra table to store the enumerator value

417062
enumerator	any
my question is is there any way to directly map an enumerator class in hibernate

417080
constructor	object
the command object can only be assigned a transaction object using one of its constructor

417093
javascript	dom
unfortunately the realities of modern web apps mean you just have to know javascript and the dom

417095
swing	awt
just a suggestion elaborating on what bruno advised one pattern for taking advantage of the excellent java 1.5+ concurrency utilities without breaking swing is to have your executorservice do all the heavy lifting as bruno said but once that is done the executorservice thread should hand off the interaction with the actual ui components to the awt thread in a runnable using one of

we can use doxygen javadoc to generate them or spend 10-15 minutes to just jot down something in comments section

417392
sql-server	oracle
the equivalent of the number p s oracle datatype on sql-server is the numeric p s datatype

417401
selenium-ide	selenium
i generally use selenium mainly because i like the selenium-ide plugin for firefox for recording starting points for my tests

417403
rollingfileappender	logfile
according to the log4net documentation the rollingfileappender will only roll the logfile when a message is logged

417404
arrays	loops
then you simply add to your arrays element say from a while loops from your sql or whatever you are doing

417409
superclass	subclass
three separate tables with some common columns usually copy-and-paste of the superclass columns among all subclass tables

417416
version-control	cvs
is there a way to somehow symbolically link the dlls to another eclipse project that is using cvs as the version-control system so that it is possible to tell which version of the code was used to create the dll

417418
gethashcode	equals
to make these useful in a hashtable or dictionary you will likely want to provide overloads for gethashcode and equals

417419
versioning	migrate
so finally we decided to keep the sourcesafe db intact read-only and just migrate the current versioning into subversioning

417442
contains	any
say that you have a custom backend system called foobar and you make a foobardownexception-handling you can track usages of this exception-handling to identify any custom logic your application contains because foobar is down

417448
dialog	pop-up
for example if you try to send some data and the data transport class throws a connectionbrokenexception you can pop-up a reconnect dialog and try to reconnect

417452
order	add
in addition you can add specific info about the problem in order to let your exception-handling handler act more accurately

417454
tuples	set
here s my set of tuples they re autogenerated by a python scripting so i ve perhaps gone a bit overboard

417454
gethashcode	tostring
they also implement gethashcode and tostring and so forth and lots of smallish helper methods

417485
static-typing	let
of course you could use ignore static-typing and make it dynamic - let me know if you want me to implements that instead

417492
repository	entity
instead of trying to mock my entity model i simply substitute a mock repository which returns iqueryables

417509
unsigned	short
note however if you are using this for serialization the unsigned short int pointer is not going to point at anything useful when you deserialize it unless you are very careful to use some sort of methods to convert pointers into offsets and then back again

417513
triggers	insert
however you can define your own instead of triggers s on the view which can then do the actual insert update delete statements

417538
buffering	streaming
use a buffering streaming if you are using python 3.0

417547
pointers	stack
push pointers to object f onto stack

417547
pointers	stack
load this pointers from stack pushed on by caller

417547
pointers	stack
load this pointers from stack again

417547
pointers	stack
load this pointers from stack again

417549
unique	words
my goal to to find the unique words among all files

417584
any	set
i m creating an app that i want to have an expandable set of properties each a ratingproperty i also want to validate that any dynamic properties are of the ratingproperty type

417590
implements	abstract
i don t want to implements the abstract-methods in class b therefore i need to declare class b as abstract as well

417610
abstract-class	subclassing
so the question is which is preferred when subclassing an abstract-class in java and don t want to provide implementation

417613
.when	ready
then merge the changes back to the mainline branch trunk .when completed ready approved to be merged in

417616
any	set
also see if you can set it up so that you get email or similar notification any time a change is committed usually also including the commit message and a list of changed files

417616
updating	updates
i find it helpful to know both that an updates has been made and then to have some idea of what s contains in that updates before updating my working copy

417618
revision	svn
if you use bugzilla you can set it up so if your comment begins with bug xxxx your svn comment is automatically added as a comment to the given bug including a link to you svn web interface to that revision

417635
pointers	stack
the first is for simple exception-handling safety and cleanup operations - if you want to guarantee that an object is cleaned up no matter what in the face of exception-handling-handling and you don t want to stack allocate that object put it in a scoped pointers

417640
push	pull
the action controllers are pretty boring - they pull value out of forms and urls call a few methods on model classes to actually perform the action and push the results out into the view

417643
quirks-mode	doctype
on the web a doctype does nothing but tell the brower if you want standards almost standards or quirks-mode

417643
google-chrome	firefox
what changes in quirks mode depends on the browser firefox opera safari and google-chrome implement a limited set of quirks like removing the space for text descenders in code like solution

417648
tasklist	cmd
my initial though was to use something like tasklist cmd and netstat and pool every 15 minutes or something like that but i don t think this is the way they re doing this

417648
linux	osx
the wakoopa app tracker works on osx and linux too but it is clear to me they are three different apps one per platform

417655
arguments	default
it s not a major problem but i find that as the number of associations with extra arguments get added the less clear things become so it s best to stick to the default whenever possible

417659
common-lisp	lisp
best free and non-emacs common-lisp ide is cusp ide for lisp built on eclipse platform

417672
rollback	commit
the idea is that any change anyone might conceivably want to have on its own or rollback on its own should be a separate commit

417684
subclassing	inherited
if you only need to point to any product not any model then the solution is to have a product model that all product inherited from television and camcorder are both subclassing of product and give your offer model a foreignkey to product

417686
capitalize	strsplit
use strsplit to break up the sentence into a bunch of words than use the code you have to capitalize each word.

417710
hide	show
show the throbber before the code is run and hide it after

417730
textbox	button
asp.net 1.1 let you put objects on a web page much the way you would drop button labels and textbox on a desktop forms application

417742
32-bit	64bit
an object consisting of only a 32-bit int and a 64bit double -- 96 bits of data -- will require two words for the object header one word for the int two words for the double

417742
double	int
this is because sun is relying on a relatively simple tactic for memory alignment issues on an imaginary processor a char may be allowed to exist at any memory location an int at any location that is divisible by 4 and a double may need to be allocated only on memory locations that are divisible by 32 -- but the most restrictive alignment requirement also satisfies every other alignment requirement so sun is aligning everything according to the most restrictive location

417762
show	next
i have an issue where the parent form will minimize to the task tray but i don t think it is loosing focus because the next form that show the studio ide has focus when i close a dialog form that was shown by calling showdialog owner

417795
firefox	safari
works beautifully in firefox safari etc

417806
vb.net	vb6
i was a straight vb6 developer when i started transitioning to vb.net

417806
vb.net	vb6
re-did a couple of small applications that i d previously written in vb6 and vb.net in c# and just went on from there

417808
perl	php
personally i think this makes asp.net hard to use but then my background is in perl and php

417816
python	ruby
some are built on ruby or python but even those are minorities

417818
buffering	streaming
i do have to disagree with the comment about fbp being just a means of implementing fsms i think fsms are neat and i believe they have a definite role in building applications but the core concept of fbp is of multiple component processes running asynchronously communicating by means of streaming of data chunks which run across what are now called bounded buffering

417829
value	field
if you require even moderately complex date related queries having your day month and year value in separate field will become a chore

417861
webforms	asp.net
as others mentioned another thing to consider is asp.net webforms vs asp.net mvc

417876
unix	aix
i am on a aix unix box so i am using vac compilers - no gnu compilers

417889
webforms	asp.net
asp.net will present learning opportunities on the web side of things although webforms abstracts out much maybe too much of how the web works

417889
asp.net-mvc	webforms
moving from winforms to webforms will help you be able to just jump right in but you will eventually want to look into asp.net-mvc or another web framework maybe php or even classic asp

417900
static-classes	accessor
whirlwind 4 - accessor static-classes nullable types

417901
children	nodes
as a final optimization check i would check if all children of a nodes are leaves and if they all contain the same rule then make the nodes a leaf with that value

417926
perl	php
it was pretty performant but thinking now i could have been more productive seperating the image processing stuff as a cli utility which is called from php perl whatever you have in hand

417926
perl	c++
culture around c++ is more varied than relatively newer languages used on web such as python ruby newer versions of php notable exception is perl which is about doing things differently thanks to its general scope and age there is not an obvious it should be done like this way which a newbie can pick up quickly and get started

417932
buffering	streaming
the advantage of writing things as iterators is that you can easily use either streaming or buffering - for example you can do

417944
selected	listbox
any listbox can be selected at anytime meaning there is no specific order the user has to choose

417962
winmerge	ignore
if those guids keep changing you can define a regex pattern helping winmerge to ignore those guids like it can ignore by default all whitespace helping it to focus on the rest of the document

417966
getter	setter
just recently i also thought about handling getter and setter the way you suggested the second approach was my favorite the private props arrays but i discarded it for it wouldn t have worked out in my app

417968
versioning	upgrade
it will be a major upgrade to the current ctp 2.0 versionings and will basically give you the same functionality to automate firefox and ie as versioning 1.3.0 offers for automating ie

417984
perl	awk
you may use whatever you want to transform the name perl sed awk etc.

417990
msbuild	nant
since i was using nantcontrib to run msbuild on the projects i did want the net-3.5 framework for nant

417999
superclass	inherited
however a class can inherited from more classes if these classes are superclasses of the direct superclass of the class

417999
superclass	inherited
but the class inherited from these classes indirectly meaning that it does not see anything from these upper superclass right

417999
superclass	inherited
i mean the inherited is only from the direct superclass - the first nearest class from the inherited hierarchy

417999
superclass	inherited
this is my question - with super we mean only the constructor of the direct superclass no matter how many other classes we have in the inherited hierarchy

418036
constructor	object
so the constructor in the class object is also called

418047
selected	cells
basically what the code does is look at the target range to see if any cells in the n column are selected and then loops through any of those cells in column n that are selected to see if their value contains mco you can get rid of the stars if you only want a prompt when the cell contains just mco and if so prompts the user and exits out

418056
stream	send
i would like to be able to send a stream of binary data to an asp .net website from a java applet hosted in the same website

418066
any	set
since that properly handles just about everywhere i can see there being any ambiguity between variabless that don t exist and variabless that are set to null i m calling array_key_exists the official easiest way in php to truly check for the existence of a variables

418078
versioning	migrate
since vs2003 it has always been extremely easy to migrate projects to new versionings of the development enviornment if one so chooses to do so so just start on whatever versioning of vs is current when you re ready to write code

418098
macros	vba
i m new to vba and have been throwing together a small macros application for the office

418099
fogbugz	trac
i am pleased with my initial trial of fogbugz nothing wrong with trac but i really wanted an autoresponder and a way for email to support mycompany.com to create a new ticket and reply

418115
.when	ready
is shorthand for so it runs the function .when the ready event fires

418115
value	field
the first field is the url of the service the second is a name value pair that is converted to a querystring and the third is the callback to handle the response

418140
callback	methods
in your callback that is being called by the updatepanel you should be able to use a registerstartupscript call to invoke a javascript methods

418143
any	set
yes it returns false for a variables that was previously set but is now null but it also returns false if a variables has not yet been set ever and for any variables that has been marked as unset

418145
expression-blend	wpf
so far there is only one significant desktop app that uses it microsoft s own wpf design tool expression-blend and to try and convince people wpf really is viable they have committed to using wpf in visual-studio 2010 for parts of the user interface like the editor

418146
terracotta	hazelcast
i m planning to implements this idea with hazelcast i love its super-simple api or terracotta which i never used - but i m aware of their sweet spot medium-term data

418146
scala	java
concurrency-wise would it make sense to consider scala instead of java

418146
neo4j	hbase
how about non-relational data stores such as couch db neo4j hypertable hbase

418148
vba	vb6
vb6 might be a good idea here given it s similarity to vba

418169
trojan	virus
the only service.dll i know of is a trojan virus

418174
treeview	listview
if you mean the listview you see when web sites is selected in the treeview you can click the listview header columns to sort them variously

418176
any	set
i am using a machine set to australian settings so there shouldn t be any accented characters or the like

418196
updating	updates
i would recommend dynamic view for those initialization phases where you need to import a lot of data you can quickly see what your view looks like without making any updates like without updating your workspace

418206
constructor	object
in the destructor of the tgarbo object it also frees the object you passed to it in it s constructor the object you passed in the gc function

418214
superclass	inherited
assuming you don t want the superclass itself to represent an entity you can use mappedsuperclass on the superclass to have subclasses inherited the properties for persistence

418215
basic	vba
i then advise you to isolate your reference checking procedure in a startup module equivalent to an autoexec which deals only with vba and basic application objects

418219
redmine	trac
trac redmine et al

418238
innodb	myisam
well if you have the ability to use innodb tables instead of myisam then you can use transactions

418255
firefox	safari
at any point in time i have firefox 3 ie6 ie7 and safari win open on my pc checking all my work

418255
floating	margins
get familiar with the concepts of floating and margins

418277
double	int
int double etc 0

418288
google-search	web-crawler
i know the google-search appliance has access to this information as this factors into the pagerank algorithm but is there a way to export this information from the web-crawler appliance

418297
vmware	esx
vmware esx citrix xenserver and

418297
vmware	esx
vmware r esx server virtual appliance

418302
display	width
then when display your image you can set the height and width properties as required

418311
dependency-injection	inject
e.g. if i m teaching about dependency-injection and show example code where an instance of the car class is inject into the driver class no one s going to get confused and think so that means the car controls the driver then

418316
.when	ready
maybe .when the form loads i could load all the possible status lines so they re ready for .whenever the control is moused over

418329
authentication	logout
i have a problem within my cakephp application i use the authentication component for the login logout mechanisms

418347
put	get
this is all in an attempt to get .net sftp working to put a file on a remote host

418362
contains	set
that being said you could also set up your webservice to call your local batch file which contains your detexec command

418372
javascript	dom
i don t buy the leaky abstraction theory either it doesn t try to fully abstract out the html elements as it gives you direct access to both native javascript and the dom if you choose to use those

418373
debugging	trace
you can also do trace outputs and debugging strings to the output windows if you want

418380
continuous-integration	nant
consider integrating with continuous-integration cruisecontrol.net nant for build and nunit vs for unit tests

418381
stderr	stdout
it is better not to pollute stdout and direct your debugging output to file or to stderr

418402
web-services	security
asmx web-services are simple but lack the security model built around wcf either restful or soap based

418406
authentication	login
i ve got the authentication stuff being handled by an auto method in the controller -- if you request an action that requires authentication and you re not currently logged in you get redirected to the login method which displays the login form and then processes it once it s submitted

418426
arrays	loops
the classic example is working with large resultsets from a database most programmers fetch the entire resultset into an arrays and then loops over it one or more times with foreach

418428
value	field
when i look at which tables are being referenced everything is fine but from table4 where it should only be selected the value field i m getting an all being called.

418434
gridview	listview
the repeater and listview allow you to control the html the gridview is a total black box in this regard and generates atrocious html while avoiding the tedious server-side code that comes with the control ok new row

418441
oracle	mysql
for the fun of it here s some code that should work in sql server oracle or mysql

418452
parentheses	braces
i got a color scheme with light background color but the braces parentheses are barely visible

418452
parentheses	operators
btw this is for c# because c++ seems to color braces parentheses using operators color

418456
yourkit	jvm
for instance the latest project i had to troubleshoot threw out-of-memory exception-handling and after firing up yourkit i realised that most memory were in fact being allocated to some ehcache lfu class the point being that we specified loads of a certain pojo to be cached in memory but us not specifying enough -xms and -xmx starting- and max- jvm memory allocation

418463
host	whm
it would also be nice if we could make this alias change in the context of the virtual host within whm and i haven t found a great way to modify virtual host sections in whm without hacking a file that i don t believe we re supposed to hack.

418483
early-binding	late-binding
with vba it is often recommended that you develop with early-binding but release with late-binding

418489
groovy	java
it appears that the netbeans 6.5 java webapp project manager does not have the enable groovy support that is present in the java app and java class library projects

418489
groovy	java
first you could put your groovy code and tests in a separate project as a java class library

418489
groovy	java
then make the java webapp dependent on the groovy project

418495
show	next
in the end i try to absorb as much of their cleverness as i can and make it show the next time i m presented with a problem of a similar nature

418505
promotions	product
with the advent of numerous ajax enhancements on a future versioning of our site our db servers load has gone up - we create pricing summaries for thousands of product for all countries taking into account duties tax rules for all these countries plus promotions and real-time auctions running all the time then the ajax services have the latest prices in a blink

418551
traceroute	ping
all of your standard ping and traceroute tools are probably your best bet

418551
packets	ping
if you open command-prompt run ping -t aspwebsiteurl.domain - will show if there is packets loss

418591
button	popup
i have a popup menu consisting of a list of radio button and when i click one of them i want some action to occur

418599
continuous-integration	teamcity
the only thing i would add is that you should be hooking up svn with cruisecontrol or teamcity to drive a continuous-integration process

418602
testdriven.net	gallio
you just need to make sure you install testdriven.net before gallio

418602
testdriven.net	gallio
otherwise the gallio install will not install its extensions for testdriven.net

418610
testdriven.net	gallio
just make sure testdriven.net was install before gallio otherwise gallio won t install its extensions for testdriven.net

418640
oracle	mysql
each database server will have its own implementation and each server oracle mssql mysql will have their own behaviours

418694
where-clause	sql
in sql there is always a where-clause because no one ever wants to see more than 100 results

418730
selected	checkbox
the shortcuts are then each in individual components with a condition set to only install if the checkbox was selected

418735
profiling	debugging
follow the user scenario what your user will be doing and see how it will touch your code often this means debugging it other times profiling and other times it simply means thinking about the scenario - whatever points in your code get touched by the user those are the highest priority to write tests against

418737
tasklist	cmd
before or after your test run tasklist svc from a cmd console

418751
hide	show
you can hide show the main menu bar by pressing ctrl+f11

418781
driver	kernel
i would read the linux kernel source documentation there may be a text file about the serial driver

418808
configuration	environment
i have a headless server running esxi which runs various machines for building installers so i don t have to give up processing power on my desktop automated testing server is faster than any desktop and various test environment about 20 different configurations so that the support team can easily jump onto a configuration that closely matches a customers system

418814
constructor	object
the main difference between the 2 is that functions and constructor are not part of the javascripton standard but are allowed in javascript object literals

418822
contains	any
is there any side effect of doing that since we have lots of pages that contains number validators

418878
command-line	cmd
how does one get the above generators to run from a cmd-line or is there a call somewhere that will generate the correct temp files that are needed for vbc.exe to run the cmd string correctly

418887
arrays	loops
after out side of the while loops i iterate through the arrays and every element is written with id 20

418899
stderr	stdout
redirects channel 2 stderr standard error into channel 1 stdout standard output such that both is written as stdout

418915
expression	evaluation
or else i can also use redo which resumes processing at the top of block without evaluation the loop expression

418917
for-loop	arrays
what you need is a double for-loop that check for occurrence of each char in one string in another and copy the non-occurring chars into a third char arrays which is your result

418926
revision	svn
your password is still there svn cat file 2342 where 2342 is a revision the file was still there

418926
svnadmin	dump
you can svnadmin dump you repos to a file search and replace you password with ultrasecret svnadmin create a new repos and svnadmin load the modified dump into that new repos

418930
vb.net	vb6
that looks like vb6 vbscript not vb.net but i might be wrong

418941
python	ruby
i m not sure about python and ruby

418942
required	checked
for example c doesn t required memcpy to checked whether the regions to copy overlap

418945
command-prompt	cmd
from a visual-studio cmd-prompt change to the folder with the script file and compile it using the following cmd

418949
perl	awk
this has the advantage of using standard tools in the windows os rather than having to find and install sed awk perl and such

418980
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
since cakephp is like one of the ruby-on-rails ports for php and ruby-on-rails does support this i would like to know why it doesn t support this feature

418984
svnadmin	dump
i know i can just use svnadmin dump but i want the smaller hotcopy output

418989
hidden-field	checkbox
if you need to access it from the client side however you re gonna have to get imaginitive with what the server control renders - likely a combination of a checkbox and hidden-field whereby the hidden-field contains the value

418999
transparency	frame
to actually do the drawing you would put a custom nsview subclass in your windows and create the windows without a frame see nsborderlesswindowsmask and transparency

419005
svnadmin	dump
you can use svnadmin dump repo --incremental

419014
visitor-pattern	visitor
assuming those functions are your own the only thing i can think of is the visitor-pattern passing in an abstract visitor function that calls you back when each thing happens

419041
decrement	increment
putting something at the stack will just increment or decrement depending on your platform the stackpointer

419041
malloc	free
you have to call free passing it the address you got from malloc manually if the time has come to do so

419065
svnadmin	dump
what i do for svn backups is use svnadmin dump and then compress the output with 7-zip

419088
hash	md5
take a look at the following link the example gets an md5 hash of a supplied image

419088
hash	md5
md5 hash of an image

419094
google-chrome	firefox
the thing is it works fine in ie7 firefox and google-chrome the problem only comes up for ie6

419104
value	field
now i wired the button to the username password text field using takestringvaluefrom but i don t understand how to then get at those value

419128
attributes	properties
based on what i ve googled i ve added a dependency properties and specified appropriate attributes to expose the properties in blend

419132
interface-builder	iboutlet
you want to declare your username and password textfields as iboutlet s and then hook them up in interface-builder

419133
environment	building
we have cruisecontrol running which automatically deploys the latest building to environment

419146
triggers	insert
then you can create a triggers on insert and maybe delete and you can log from there based on the session count

419148
click	mouse
for mouse events it contains the positioning of the click and which button was used

419153
malloc	free
thus is neither must be managed as with malloc free nor do you have to worry about the address being reused as you would with an auto definition

419153
defined	declare
it s useful to recall the whole declare vs defined thing here

419157
jfreechart	swing
i have a swing application which uses jfreechart to display one of a series of queries

419157
hide	show
i would like a simple way for the users to hide show some of the time-series in the display chart component

419174
command-line	cmd
is the part that runs when the script is run from say the cmd-line using a cmd like python myscript.py

419176
value	field
the table can keep track of the number of open sessions very simply now by adding a session count field to the record that is incremented from the previous record s session count value when a session start event occurs and decremented when a session end event occurs

419198
pointers	stack
translation name is a constant pointers to a character that points to some memory on stack

419198
malloc	free
the main difference is that when you call malloc you take your memory from the heap and any memory taken from the heap must be free from the heap

419198
pointers	stack
p is a pointers the name arrays on stack

419198
malloc	free
in this case the free is correct because p points to a memory location on the heap which was allocated by malloc

any	set
any our good friend the x86 executes an instruction set that these days bears little relationship to the actual cpu archientecture

419201
carbon	cocoa
this is a cocoa function but you can use it in carbon apps too

419201
dictionary	arrays
the advantage of nslog is that you can print cf property-list objects strings data objects dates numbers arrays and dictionary using the formatter

419204
continuous-integration	build-process
continuous-integration says that this build-process should be repeated every time there is a significant change event to the code like a check in if at all possible

419204
build-process	ant
i ve done several projects in which this turned into a build every night because the code was large enough that it took several hours to build but the ideal is to set up your build-process so that some automatic mechanism --- like an ant script or make file --- only rebuilds the pieces affected by a change

419204
build-process	release
you handle the issue of providing a specific release by in some fashion preserving the exact configuration of all affected artifacts for each build so you can apply your repeatable build-process to the exact configuration you had

419204
version-control	git
that s why it s called configuration management. the usual version-control tools like git or subversion provide ways to identify and name configurations so they can be recovered

419218
hide	show
the show hide works fine but i can t figure out how to set it so that if the mouse is over the div it wont hide

419222
pixels	line
that height can t be in pixels nor in number of line

419239
linux	osx
i m running on osx but the command should be identical on linux and possibly also on windows though i never tried

419292
if-statement	loops
in day to day programming you probably won t use more than algebra and logic for if-statement and loops conditions

419299
constructor	object
when you are allocating memory for an object invoking constructor aligning memory on word boundaries etc

419301
attributes	properties
there s no garbage collection classes oop entity frameworks linq properties attributes fields or anything like that

419301
pointers	stack
you have to know what a stack frame is and what the instruction pointers is

419302
silverlight	wpf
i ve built a control to edit xhtml but it too uses system.drawing rather than wpf and therefore isn t for silverlight

419322
version-control	git
for this problem in particular i m using git but i m curious about how to deal with this for all version-control systems

419323
python	java
for example if you use java or python both operate very cleanly on linux

419327
hash	md5
to interact with an external data feed i need to pass a rolling security key which has been md5 hash every day we need to generate a new md5 hash key

419328
dialog	pop-up
having it pop-up the vista security are you sure dialog would be allright but the process cannot be marked with uiaccess otherwise it won t interact properly with the rest of the system and it will in 98 of cases be run by users without rights to elevate to administrator

419331
python	java
java is built on c python is built on c or java or .net etc. perl is etc

419334
linux	osx
what is the tray equivalent on each platform and how much manual work would be required to support windows osx and linux which shells in particular would be friendliest

419339
linklabel	panels
actually the hardest part was getting a border around it using manual positioning to place the white linklabel just inside a black panels

419342
getter	setter
all the properties getter setter and common methods are created automatically which really saves time and money

419344
libcurl	curlpp
i ve heard of libcurl curlpp ptypes rolling my own just using the .net api and been told a bunch of times

419354
base-class	inherited
or does staff_base already inherited from another base-class that you do not have control over .

419357
any	set
however this is the set intersection meaning if lista and listb don t have unique values in it you won t get any copies

419359
configuration	environment
here is a blog post about creating other environment-specific configuration options it is for ruby-on-rails but might give you some ideas about how to do something similar for your environment

419366
sniffing	packets
if you re coding it yourself it d be helpful to use a packets sniffing tool

419377
perl	php
perl php and python and i am sure more all have great documentation and support on this kind of operation

419382
triggers	insert
before that you used to have to use a combination of insert and update triggers to ensure the ulname column was kept in sync and this was a nightmare to maintain

419392
union-all	union
then i check to see if i m grouping data properly making sure that distinct s and union s without union-all don t remove necessary duplicates

419396
hash	md5
my high-end workstation can calculate well over 100k md5 hash of a 10-byte data segment in a second

419402
contains	elements
for each and every tag elements found it has display the message box contains the tagname of the tag elements

419408
configuration	environment
you could could have environment specific configuration files which contain your paths that are copied or created along with it

419418
configuration	environment
in most enterprise-class fortune 500 organizations no one sees the production or even test environment configuration except the admin team for that environment

419430
return-type	arguments
requiring a return-type and a function arguments list are great for things like intellisense to auto document your code but they are also restrictions

419441
perl	php
there exist perl and php scripts that attempt to reverse-engineer portions of the format but a complete spec would be most helpful

419442
any	set
but what i realy want to know is why a property populated by unity is treated differently to a property set by any other methods

419444
gnome	kde
for many linux desktop systems gnome kde etc. a freedesktop s systray protocols is implements

419446
motif	x11
wx is a cross-platform gui and tools library that supports win32 mac os x gtk+ x11 motif wince and more

419461
value	field
to solve this problem is by adding a custom code that retrieves the relative path then concantenate with the field value that you may wish to be part of the url - atleast that works for me

419466
getter	setter
the first beanwrapperimpl uses the setter getter methods of a java object while the other set the fields directly

419469
push	pull
the basic idea is to reverse the pull model of and turn it into a push model with observers - each part of the pipeline effectively pushes its data past any number of observers using event handler which typically form new parts of the pipeline

419475
revision	svn
svn export simply extracts all the files from a revision and does not allow revision control on it

419477
shutdown	restart
the next step would be to include in your executable a way to detect any change in a setting files in order to update while running some parameters avoiding the the all shutdown change settings restart sequence

419497
any	set
also i didn t get any methods to set user name and password required to access crm

419512
revision	svn
i use this for example to set the revision number to the current svn revision

419532
foundation	cocoa
many of the basic cocoa classes like nsstring and nsnumber are implemented in core foundation and toll-free bridged to objective-c classes

419546
version-control	git
use an scm such as git for version-control and a deployment tool such as capistrano for deployment

419548
text-classification	weka
i have used weka for text-classification

419549
delphi	c++
some language require explicit directive such as virtual member function in c++ or override in delphi and c#

419552
command-line	cmd
are you asking for the cmd to build from the cmd-line

419562
contains	any
so you divide and conquer - for any given clip figure out what all nontrivial things it contains and then figure out what each of them is doing

419562
selected	button
empty clips or clips with nothing on the first frame always show up as a small white circle but clips whose alpha is 0 do not show up at all unless you selected them or turn on outline mode the little colored button on each timeline layer

419575
delphi	vb6
c# sockets how do you handle a socket in c#.net the way they re handled in vb6 or delphi event driven

419575
delphi	vb6
on vb6 or delphi when creating a socket you had an onconnect onreceive and onerror events placed into the main code file how would i replicate the same

419578
set	bag
the 2 3 1 4 5 pattern you describe makes we wonder if your object isn t a property bag and it is simply serializing data in the order it was set - this would be highly risky

419578
attributes	properties
so you need to define the order yourself somehow perhaps alphabetically but this is brittle when somebody adds an aardvarkcount properties perhaps via a custom attributes

419590
png	gif
the web favors gif jpg and png mostly

419594
drupal	django
or better still what is the difference between cmss joomla drupal etc and web frameworks django symphony zend etc

419598
any	set
any other good practices to cover not set variables and assert an arrays

419600
png	gif
the png portable network graphics file format was created as the free open-source successor to the gif

419600
png	gif
the png file format supports truecolor 16 million colours while the gif supports only 256 colours

419600
png	gif
gif is good for illustrations when you do not wish to move to png

419602
png	gif
examples of lossless image compression is png and gif

419602
tiff	bmp
tiff and bmp are both wrapper formats as the data inside can depend upon the compression technique that is used

419614
tiff	bmp
bmp and tiff probably are not good candidates for web-applications

419617
png	gif
web browsers at the moment only display jpeg png and gif files - so those are the ones that can be shown on web pages

419645
sigaction	signals
okay first off you ought to be using sigaction 2 instead of the deprecated signals

419645
sigaction	signals
then use the sa_handler field in the sigaction structure to change whether to ignore sig_ign or terminate sig_dfl on that signals

419645
void	main
int main void

419647
delphi	vb6
you dont have exactly behavior like in vb6 delphi and you have async methods and events for doing stuff like it for example asynctcp client

419652
directory	folder
i set up a website and i created a folder names docs in the website as virtual directory with some documents

419662
access-control	authentication
check you have anonymous access allowed with a valid account under properties| directory security | authentication and access-control | edit.

419668
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort or heapsort and the

419696
drupal	django
for example it doesnâ t make much sense to compare django to something like drupal because django is something you use to create things like drupal

419717
mbunit	nunit
mbunit also has collection assertions similar to nunit assert.collections.cs

419738
contains	elements
this happens to be in a cake app so this- params url contains an elements of url

419743
realloc	malloc
otherwise you have to malloc the buffer and store its size which would make it possible to realloc on overflow.

419772
export	report
this export the report into an rtf stream

419774
panels	grid
if you put a datagridview that is 400 pixels high on a panels that s 300 pixels high so that there s a scroll bar on the panels then scroll down so that the lower half of the grid is shown then click on a control outside the panels then click on a line in the grid the panels scrolls up to the top and the wrong row in the grid is selected

419787
ubuntu	linux
download vmware and an ubuntu virtual machine ubuntu is a popular linux distribution from the vmware site

419822
web-deployment	web
now every time i open my asp.net web project solution which contains the web-deployment visual-studio asks to convert the project i guess from vs 2005 to 2008

419822
web-deployment	web
1 web project + 4 library projects + 1 web-deployment project new

419829
linux	unix
for example most binary executables on unix linux .

419829
linux	unix
cutting at the last . is probably saver but can still fail for files with no extensions or with multiple or multi-part extensions such as .tar.gz tar.bz2 which occur rather often in the unix linux ...-world

419849
web-deployment	web
my current web app works fine locally and on live what i am currently playing around with is compiling my web app with the visual-studio option add web-deployment project so all the code behind is compiled into dll s

419861
urlclassloader	classpath
if you want to do it programmatically then i suggest you start with empty classpath and use urlclassloader giving it a different set of jars each time

419868
dialog	pop-up
the strange thing is that the windows pops up tries to load show the file dialog and then you hear the sound like a pop-up windows has been blocked although pop-up blocker is deactivated

419869
perl	ruby
linux kernel kde perl ruby on rails android wine fedora x.org mediawiki django vlc mono gnome samba cups gnupg emacs elpa.

419869
python	java
mozilla and mozdev openjdk java opensolaris alsa ntfs-3g dovecot moinmoin mutt petsc octave fenics aptitude python xemacs xen vim xine.

419870
required	checked
i would say a reasonable license checked scheme required central server outside customer control and for customer to have internet access

419885
protected	public
bear in mind that all protected methods become part of the public api so if you change things later you will break other people s code

419890
configuration	environment
instead you could have one master configuration and using regex xmlpoke nant your-favorite-text-manipulator to massage the file at build deploy time to insert the right values for each environment keeping the settings for all environments in another file but crucially all together

419890
configuration	environment
then you only have to maintain the one configuration file and a file of environment settings - i think this makes maintenance easier and clearer in the long-term

419919
sql-server	oracle
it works in oracle and the sql-server specs seem to be the same for this function so it should work

419933
contains	set
i have a picturebox its sizemode property set to zoom contains an image and both may vary in size

419933
background-color	height
for example if the picturebox is more widescreen in relation to the image see screenshot it means the picturebox will stretch the image to its own height and center it horizontally showing its background-color in this case red to the left and right of the image

419933
display	height
then i assume the image s display height is the same as picturebox.height and work from there

419945
search-engine	seo
keep in mind putting - instead of _ is better in the eye of a search-engine spider and it is seo rule

419961
global-asax	web-config
if you can i d like to see your web-config and global-asax files

419965
environment	building
when you building your xcode project part of what it does is install the application to the iphone simulator like in a real environment

419991
low-level	hardware
this gives me backup in the case of adsl issues does happen occasionally that one goes down and the other stays up but also means i can run a low-level internet server for showing things to clients on a dedicated and isolated line - obviously not production quality but good enough for testing i have a couple of dedicated servers co-hosted elsewhere running client sites but they can t be extensively used for non-production purposes obviously and having the hardware in-house means i can adjust the configuration more easily

419999
base-class	inherited
look at the following example where you have two classes that inherited from the same base-class

420002
telnet	ssh
telnet or ssh

420004
javascript	dom
another popular way would be to use javascript s xmlhttprequest dom to send the request

420018
telnet	ssh
you can normally telnet or ssh into the machines but into some sort of unix emulation which hides the true power of the native os

420039
telnet	ssh
you can connect to the omvs uss unix system services subsystem using standard telnet or ssh if the mainframe has had that set up but to access the z os interface tso e or ispf you ll need a 3270 emulator such as x3270 we use ibm s personal communicator product because it s incredibly powerful

420039
processor	cpu
the power of the mainframe lies not in it s cpu grunt the individual processor aren t that powerful but they come in books of 54 cpus with hot backups and you can run many books in a single system z box but in the fact that all the cpu does is process instructions

420046
uitableview	uiview
we cannot add controls to uitableview like we do to uiview

420046
uitableview	uiview
try using a subclass of uiview instead and add the uitableview and the picker to this uiview subclass

420047
telnet	ssh
for unix vms and most other systems use telnet or ssh

420076
pixels	line
is there any way i can use css or anything else to force the long line to be wrapped when it reaches the 200 pixels limit

420094
webserver	upload
you want the user to upload their certificate s private key to the webserver so that it may sign pdfs

420103
google-chrome	firefox
however ie firefox and google-chrome all fail to redirect to the new resource

420114
constructor	object
i d rather not have to do what i m doing below and i d rather not have the decarator constructor populate the object underneath since there will be times when the dependencies are not the same

420164
terracotta	hazelcast
again what i want to accomplish is something like described here and i would love to have some more feedback on ideas concerning the actual implementation why use terracotta instead of hazelcast use serialization or deep cloning via reflection or whatever else and also the major drawbacks of an approach like this - eg

420169
malloc	free
you could malloc a to the size you want just remember to free it afterwards

420180
notepad++	bbedit
it s very seldom that i want to edit something on mac win and for that any decent editor is enough bbedit notepad++

420187
revision	svn
personally i m a big fan of trac which has great svn integration revision comments can point to tickets and tickets back to revision for traceability etc

420197
contains	elements
attributes cannot contains multiple values child elements can

420210
jquery	dojo
i know that i only considered mootools and jquery while there are a lot of other frameworks out there yui which is heavely namespaced more verbose why i don t like it but most of the others dojo kit ... try to abstract away the javascript nature of javascript.

420225
arguments	default
if you want to create a bar object initialized by a default constructed foo put parentheses around the arguments

420239
environment	building
we use it all the time to manage environment variables in our building environment

420240
treeset	treemap
this is implementss as part of the interface and the typical use is to define one or more small utility classes that implements this to pass to methods such as sort or for use by sorting data-structures such as treemap and treeset

420245
build-system	cmake
there are open-source qt and kde projects that use cmake as their build-system so you can look at their code if you need to see real use cases i did

420262
authentication	login
edit on redirect from the asp.net login control check for the forms authentication token and run your custom code if the token is present

420275
dictionary	arrays
i know that children contains data probably nested data but i m unsure if it s a list dictionary arrays etc

420284
environment	building
but i believe i have not tried it you can configure your eclipse environment to handle the qmake execution when it does an auto building

420298
udp	tcp
besides all the others nice and correct answers this article gives a good understanding about the differences between tcp and udp

420303
msbuild	nant
it integrates with msbuild - see this article and also works well with nant - see this article

420319
continuous-integration	build-server
build-server runs in continuous-integration and i would like this automated

420361
.when	ready
the issues with testing can be sorted out by using automated testing so you re release build can be effortlessly tested .when you think you re ready to release

420398
data-structures	tree
as to stacks growing downwards in memory remember that when dealing with hierarchical data-structures tree most programmers are happy to draw one on a page with the base or trunk at the top of the page.

420433
any	set
i know that this is standard procedure for a struct the backing field for any property must be assigned directly and not via the property s set accessor from within the struct s constructor

420485
selected	checkbox
also note that 2 3 4 is a list selected from a checkbox list by the web app user and i forgot to mention that i just hardcoded that for simplicity

420488
nsurlconnection	nsdata
nsurlconnection is good if you want to get data from the web service into an nsstring or nsdata

420498
assign	add
it s also worth noting that your add function doesn t have any lasting effects -- all it s doing is assign a value to pname which is a copy of the pointers you pass into it

420502
configuration	logging
as far as i can recall you can define the listeners in the application configuration making it possible to activate or deactivate the logging without touching the build

420535
return-value	return-type
if an if-statement isn t the return-value of a function it should have the return-type unit

420535
if-statement	while-loop
you can replace the if-statement with pattern matching and replace the while-loop with recursion

420543
lazy-evaluation	maybe
easy_install seems to work better with the macports package but maybe that s just because i m too lazy-evaluation to figure out all the nuances of the default install

420545
varchar2	clob
you either have a smallish bit of text in a varchar2 - which is up to 32767 bytes in pl sql and up to 4000 bytes in sql in a table definition - or you have a potentially very big bit of text in a clob which is a specialised blob

420555
hide	show
this way when we are in dev or qa we show the toolbar but in production we hide it

420566
profiling	debugging
no there isn t - at least not without using a profiling debugging api of some description

420584
order	join
a merge join goes through both tables together in order

420605
contains	any
as a rule i keep my projects in a logical folder structure where portions of the project might be allocated into folders dal or bm and within there i might have a number of logically named folders which each contains a number of files one interface one implementation and any helper classes specific to those

420614
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object is usually an indicator of not using the keyword new

420619
output	mode
when you run without the debugger in release mode you get the output from the first test function

420663
variables	boolean
then replacing the boolean variables istestactive with

420665
httpwebrequest	webclient
or write a .net executable which does everything you need it to using webclient or httpwebrequest

420688
unsigned	bigint
however of those you ve proposed i d suggest going for 2 bigint but make sure they re unsigned

420694
memory-management	memory-leaks
if you work with unmanaged language like c c++ you can efficiently discover most of the memory-leaks by hijacking memory-management functions

420705
sql-server	mysql
i have to insert a couple million rows in either sql-server 2000 2005 mysql or access

420706
value	field
2 x bigint would be uncomfortable - two field that are really one plus is the value stored big-endian or little-endian

420741
contains	set
using this i want to be able to loop through the result set in c# and then say for each table in the result set do this use reflection to make a class that will do or contains xyz

420774
for-loop	loops
now i know i could recode this to add a boolean flag variable or traditional for-loops but i am wondering if there s any way to find out if a foreach loops is on the first iteration of its loopsing

420779
callback	methods
use that value somewhere in your callback methods

420779
callback	methods
firstly to pass variables to your methods shouldn t they come before the name of the callback

420783
versioning	upgrade
even if i have the old versioning it upgrade it

420792
ironpython	cpython
related question what are some strategies to write python code that works in cpython jython and ironpython

420801
versioning	upgrade
if that doesn t i would upgrade the jdk to use a more recent versioning of 1.6

420813
instances	private
can i create a private instances methods that can be called by a class methods

420821
windows-xp	windows
will the dos application run in a command windows in windowss-xp

420830
put	get
we had the budget for tfs and even the hardware to put it on but with our team only being 5 people going through the work to get tfs up and running didn t seem worth it

420905
constructor	object
the unity container will instantiate object and call parameterised constructor magically

420911
selection	highlight
b will wrap a highlight selection in braces

420943
buffering	streaming
in fbp the lines represent bounded buffering across which travel streaming of data packets

420969
reflection	runtime
to call generic methods using a type at runtime you need to use reflection - and makegenericmethod in particular something like

421040
margins	padding
we have a simple reset that clears every margins and padding on every element

421055
contains	elements
and if the contains elements has padding you ll need a wrapper around the image to make it fit

421060
constructor	object
first you can get a date object by parsing your mysql date string using a simpledateformat then create your regulartimeperiod using the constructor with a date arg

421075
where-clause	sql
the resulting sql has the where-clause on the intermediate mapping table contentaudvidlinks rather than the clips table even though i have added the filter attribute to the bag of clips

421081
hash	md5
without a salt i could compute md5 attempt 0 and then scan through the file to see if that hash shows up anywhere

421081
salt	md5
if salt are present then i have to compute md5 salt a

421081
salt	md5
attempt 0 compare against entry a then md5 salt b

421106
ruby	php
explain that there may not be as much ror developers out there as there are php developers per say but the fact that there s such a great amount of documentation and information about ruby and rails makes it exponentially easier to for any open-source developer to learn and use the framework

421119
visitor-pattern	visitor
the visitor-pattern would also be awkward in this situation because there really is only one visitor but the number of different visitable types will only increase with time -- these are the opposite conditional for which visitor is suitable

421149
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
for windows you can get visual-studio express for free but i also use sharpdevelop

421149
linux	unix
you can also get the mono ide on linux and a few flavours of unix i think

421150
firefox	opera
the change did not seem to have any negative side-effects in firefox 2 or 3 opera 9.63 or safari for windows 3.2.1

421161
order	add
templates that have low sort order values appear in either the new project or new add item dialog box before templates that have high sort order values

421170
installation	uninstall
i need to run a custom action during uninstallation of a managedcode which is a part of the installation before it is removed in the uninstall process

421187
defined	declare
in c++ g++ you can have a class where the declare header methods are never actually defined in the source .cc files as long as those methods are never invoked

421187
temporary	copy
as a consequence you can copy your current code files to a temporary directory do a hack and slash job on them run a manual binary search and isolate the problem fairly quickly

421211
firefox	safari
ie7 firefox safari anything but ie6

421232
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
however the output is case-sensitive how do i change it to be case-insensitive

421235
any	set
once we created the report variables we set the data source values and any parameters we need and bundle the item up into the viewdata

421239
any	set
on the other hand if you just set it to some dummy value and throw the exception-handling elsewhere then depending on the approach you take the client will either see the dummy value with no indication that this was not the value actually set or they will receive an exception-handling that doesn t give them any idea of who is responsible for the invalid state or how to rectify it

421239
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
and since you asked about languages other than .net in java i would use an illegalargumentexception in the general case - perhaps a good old nullpointerexception if the argument is null

421254
single-sign-on	shibboleth
it has also pretty much been mandated that we use shibboleth single-sign-on to handle the authentication

421254
single-sign-on	shibboleth
problem shibboleth single-sign-on uses ssl as part of its protocol but getting multiple virtual hosts to use ssl is not a walk in the park

421259
virtualization	vmware
the virtualization software vmware virtual pc virtual server etc is not an os it s an application that runs on an existing os the host os

421293
document	element
this uses xpath syntax to search through the xml document for the element we want

421321
autoscroll	panels
i am guessing that you are setting the autoscroll property of the panels to true

421321

if you switching off autoscroll and add your own scrollbar you can set the scrollbar s maximum and minimum to match the requirements for the panels then set the panels s scroll value in the scroll event of the scrollbar

421335
csv	xml
built-in support for parsing html xml csv and javascript

421337

421353
dialog	pop-up
i have an asp imagebutton that is supposed to pop-up a save dialog when clicked

421353
dialog	pop-up
when i put it outside the updatepanel it works fine but when i put it inside the updatepanel the dialog does not pop-up

421379
sql-server	mysql
i have the following query which works fine with mysql but refuses to work with sql-server

421386
union-all	union
a union can be deceptive with respect to result set ordering because a database will sometimes use a sort method to provide the distinct that is implicit in union which makes it look like the rows are deliberately ordered -- this doesn t apply to union-all for which there is no implicit distinct of course

421396
turing-complete	lambda-calculus
however untyped lambda-calculus is turing-complete turing_completeness#examples but lambda-calculus does not permit recursion per se lambda_calculus#recursion it s all very dicey

421405
account	api
an api that would make it simple to query their account regardless of whether they re at chase bofa or other

421409

i would like to be able to selected the code page to which unicode arguments passed to createprocessw are converted to be different from the system s default codepage for non-unicode programs

421437
selected	textbox
well and i added a textbox which i use to add new child under the selected node and it works also good but so as to see the new added node i have to refresh and page and all the expanded nodes collapses naturally

421448
contains	set
the result set is always a single row which has the datetime value equal to user max_date that is it returns the row that contains max date if no more rows have been added with more recent dates than max date

421454
visualvm	jvm
i use visualvm to monitor the jvm

421469
oracle	mysql
it s very common to come across poorly written code that assumes table data is returned in insert order and 95 of the time the coder gets away with it and is never aware that this is a problem as on many common databases mssql oracle mysql

421479
contains	any
however you may be able to do the check yourself in any methods you need to protect by using assembly.getcallingassembly to get a reference to the assembly contains the calling code then check the strong name on that assembly manually

421489
silverlight	wpf
and it can easily downscale to silverlight since silverlight wpf e wpf everywhere and become a web application with just a bit of tweaking

421497
safari	opera
in opera and safari esp

421514
value	field
if you have multiple replaces of different text in the same field i recommend that you create a table with the current value and what you want them replaced with

421514
sql-server	mysql
sorry didn t notice this is mysql the code is what i would use in sql-server my sql syntax may be different but the technique would be similar

421518
temporary	copy
i have to copy tables from an oracle to a db2 v7 one and in order to do this avoiding millions of drops and creates i d like to know if db2 has a feature like oracle to enable disable constraints temporary without dropping them

421523
linklabel	panels
each linklabel is at 1 1 and is 2 pixels smaller in both dimensions from is parent panels

421537
base-class	inherited
if you really want to you can streach your inherited chain and move some of the code to a base-class

421566
contains	any
it basically wraps an object and uses reflection for late bound calls but it is totally self contains and doesn t have any sdk exposure

421566
minimum	max
the plugins dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes

421566
constructor	object
the scripted classes allow one to instantiate a new object via a constructor

421584
contains	any
an object is considered alive and non-eligible for garbage-collection if any live thread contains a reference to it or if it s referenced statically directly or indirectly in both cases

421604
qtreewidget	qlist
then i remove an item from my qlist items and i try to clear reset the qtreewidget

421631

421645
csv	xml
built-in support for parsing html xml csv and javascript

421653
malloc	free
or malloc some memory for the new name and don t forget to free it...

421659
udp	tcp
are aware that both tcp and udp and ip and ethernet and... already provide checksum protection to data in transit

421661
static-members	non-static
a non-static methods which only accesses the instancess own members no static-members --and of course parameters and local variables--would not need to use locks in the context of that instances being used by a single owner doesn t need to be thread-safe but if instancess were intended to be shared and wanted to guarantee thread-safe access then the instances would need to protect access to its member variables with one or more locks specific to that instances locking on the instances itself being one option --as opposed to leaving it up to the caller to implements their own locks around it when sharing something not intended to be thread-safe shareable

421661
temporary	copy
one easy way to solve this is to use an atomic thread-safe operation inside your protective locking scheme to make a temporary copy of the collection and then iterate over that local snapshot copy outside the lock

421664
strncpy	memcpy
you could also use memcpy instead of strncpy as you want to just copy some bytes

421666
malloc	free
you need to allocate some memory for it using malloc and remember to free it when you re done or in this case you can probably simply declare it as a character arrays

421683
any	set
when user clicks any of these items another set of items are beign shown sort of hierarchy browser

421704
ref	out
edit in c# an out parameter is similar to a ref parameter in that they are both call-by-reference parameters as opposed to the more typical call-by-value parameter

421715
lgpl	gpl
adobe open sourced the actionscript virtual-machine as a mozilla project named tamarin under an mpl gpl lgpl tri-license

421733
http-post	post
i create two overloaded actions in the controller one to render the input form using an http get and the other to process the form post using an http-post

421749
updating	updates
mysql usually would notice your were updating a column to the value that it was already - but watch this because if mysql thinks it needs to move a record from one partition to another your updates would take a hit

421760
any	set
set up after triggers on the source databases that send any changed rows to the central repository database in some kind of holding table

421765
decimal-point	digits
your regular expression expects either no decimal-point or a decimal-point followed by two decimal digits

421765
decimal-point	digits
i changed the near the end to to allow one or two decimal digits after the decimal-point

421772
shell	bash
what i d like to do is to include settings from a file into my current interactive bash shell like this

421773
value	field
when i used the syntax to assign text field of the updatepanel control the value of the page properties it sort of worked but it changed the field of all updatepanel in the repeater

421781
perl	php
looks like some php or perl templating engine such as mason

421803
put	get
then put all known converters into a map and get happy

421813
silverlight	wpf
you ll have better luck working with moonlight which targets the silverlight api which is a subset of full wpf

421817
any	set
for example certain options have to be set any time you update the base table

421826
value	field
i can only see doing this happening if you want to guarantee the change of the value of a field upon return and after the return-value is determined

421848
scriptaculous	jquery
i m surveying a wide array of web frameworks and the majority don t mention security as an issue on their websites eg scriptaculous jquery prototype rico

421851
base-class	subclass
i have a subclass with an over-ridden methods that i know always returns a particular subtyping of the return-type declared in the base-class

421871
compatibility	platform
i would recommend you to use ncurses if you aim for cross platform compatibility

421896
constructor	object
all but the third and fifth define a sometype object on the stack and initialize it with u in the first two case and the default constructor in the fourth

421920
spring	grails
i haven t seen this kind of functionality in pure spring although grails offers things like that

421933
data-access	nhibernate
i m trying to use nhibernate for data-access and i have 2 simple entities that look like this

421933
contains	any
my question......how do i construct a criteria if i want to find any user that contains a role with an id of 1 in it s roles collection

421939
msbuild	nant
for example if your company always uses msbuild but decided to use nant for whatever reason on this one project then i d include it

421948
build-server	nant
and the build-server i use does not have nunit nant etc installed

421955
contains	any
the reason i have a nearly self contains build-system any system with a jdk and ant installed will be able to build without network connection neccecary package lists for external javadoc also checked in

421956
firefox	opera
once set up this makes it trivial to test on ie6 7 and 8 various firefox flavours konqueror opera safari etc.

421960
sql-server	mysql
i am more partial to sql-server mysql etc but before make any comments on filemaker i d like to know some of the pros and cons of the system

421962
silverlight	wpf
moonlight is an implementation of silverlight which is a browser based flash like technology based on a subset of wpf

421974
expression-blend	wpf
for situations in which a wpf application is being developed that has designers accessing the solution in expression-blend the solution folders are ignored in the blend environment

422002
contains	set
i am trying to dynamically browse through all our free tables and set up a listing of every column from every file and xref that to another free table that contains a description of each column

422019
select	union
if you want the distinct list of teams you have to select from the game table twice union the home and the away teams theoretically one team could play all its games on the road or at home if you have logic that prevents that then you could adjust this query

422019
union-all	union
the union operator will make sure you only get distinct elements in the return set unless you use union-all

422022
oracle	mysql
mysql oracle mssql access experts

422025
required	checked
i would probably hook onitemdatabound checked the value and replace reformat if required

422031
any	set
at the time you populate your grid loop through the records and for any that have a value that isn t 01-jan-0001 12 00 00 am set your visible row to that value

422033
order	join
specifies the exact join order to be

422039
superscript	subscript
on the other hand an i with a hat on top and a subscript d and a superscript is rather confusing.

422050
server-side-includes	include
look into server-side-includes ssi to easily add a block of javascript to each page though you could also do it with a php include instead

422060
getter	setter
i ve not worried a whole lot about javabeans but i have found that following basic javabean conventions has been very helpful for me in the past basically using standard getter and setter for properties

422060
getter	setter
bound properties are properties available through standard getter and setter which fire propertychangeevents when they change

422060
convention	standards
be aware also that standards getters and setters can be very non-standards through the use of beaninfo classes to define a javabean s exact interface but i never use that either. the main other javabean convention that i choose to follow or not as appropriate in each situation is a no-argument constructor

422060
superclass	inherited
i m going to create an additional class javabean as a superclass of model which will provide the propertychangeevent support that i need inherited by every model

422066
uilabel	uiview
my application needs to display text in either a uiview or uilabel but the back ground must be a gradient as opposed to a true uicolor

422078
keyboard	mouse
selection with the keyboard works perfectly just not with a mouse

422126
triggers	insert
they are a hidden tax on every insert update delete query you execute depending on the type of triggers

422135
directory	folder
you can run crossftp client and choose tools - synchornize directory to compare your local folder and the remote folder

422147
any	set
to lighten the load you can set trusted users to pre approved but you have said your client can t accept any risk

422151
triggers	insert
if you re going to allow public access to the database to insert into tables then you ll have to go with the triggers because otherwise anyone can insert update a single field in the table and the updated field could never get updated

422157
fflush	stdout
edit as swaroop mentioned this doesn t work i m guessing raw_input fflush stdout

422182
defined	declare
this example is to say you can defined the scripting to use a declare variables x in this case and then declare the variables before running the scripting

422188
filtering	sorting
note that these wouldn t be the entire uris for example the uri to list the movies would support filtering paging and sorting

422196
silverlight	wpf
i d say likely candidates would be wpf silverlight active-x or java applet

422196
silverlight	wpf
if you go with wpf silverlight then there s a slightly different paradigm to pickup called asp.net-mvc model-view-controller which is starting to become the next big craze

422196
webserver	upload
the reason i would go with these options rather than a traditional model change upload dynamically generate and stream audio through your webserver is that i would not particularly want to have to dynamically generate the sound files on the fly every time the tab is upload changed - you want it all to happen on the client computer otherwise you re potentially looking at high resource usage and high bandwidth bills for the sound transfer

422205
installation	environment
i wanted to replicate my work environment on my mac so i installed vs2008 with the asp.net-mvc beta into a winxp installation running within a parallels vm

422207
javascript	dom
with javascript if i had a reference to the dom node i could have written

422208
uilabel	uiview
as a more detailed example you could create a uiview subclass to use as a background for your uilabel

422208
uilabel	uiview
you just need to size this uiview appropriately and add your uilabel as a subview of it to get the effect you desire

422210
moss	wss
stsdev is a proof-of-concept utility application which demonstrates how to generate visual-studio project files and solution files to facilitate the development and deployment of templates and components for the sharepoint 2007 platform including windows sharepoint services 3.0 wss and microsoft office sharepoint server 2007 moss

422227
contains	any
is there any way to do this programatically ending up with a browser windows contains the results pages of the sites

422229
multiplication	multiplying
well your multiplication by scalar is wrong - you should multiplying variance by the square of d

422232
ruby	php
using it does not make much sense when mysql sql server etc are available for the data storage and asp.net php ruby etc are there for the programming

422242
command-line	cmd
here s a piece of code to take a string either nsstring or nsattributedstring input that represents a command-line and parsing it into two strings the command cmd and the arguments args

422250
authentication	login
includes some login authentication features

422259
capacity	storage
quite large if your question is what s the storage capacity of an mnesia database made up of a huge number of disc_only_copies tables - you re largely limited by available disk spaces

422259
capacity	storage
in this case the capacity of the table is limited by the backend storage

422276
implements	abstract
if you want to absolutely dictate that the child implements this then the only way i see doing it is making the base-class abstract and expose instances properties to return the icon and friendly name

422287
restart	exit
do you really need to stop the process exit it and restart it or do you just want it to wait until some event occurs

422313
webforms	asp.net
in the end using either will likely encourage better development practices over say asp.net webforms and getting familiar with the one will make it easier for you to pick up the other one rather quickly

422320
polymorphism	override
i think the point you may have missed is that you can t override static properties for a good reason -- namely that when you re writing code to call it you don t have an instace so the complier will statically link it at that time -- if you need polymorphism you need to be working with an instance for the runtime to work out which version of the methods to call

422341
linux	bsd
only problem is not all platforms seem to include it in their libc such as linux ._. most all bsd varients do seem to have it

422344
deployment	install
i m finding the documentation of setup and deployment projects to be surprisingly opaque it was quite a bit harder to find out how to make it possible for the msi to uninstall properly if the user install it to a non-default path which is a pretty freaking common use case to be undocumented and have no idea if it s even possible to do this

422359
subtract	time
wrap your cms code to store the time the operation started then subtract it from the current time at the end of the script and print it

422370
active-directory	adam
you may also want to look into adam active-directory application mode

422372
configuration	environment
any configuration that might differ across environment should stored at the machine level not the application level

422372
configuration	environment
when each environment developer integration test stage live has its own unique settings in the c windows microsoft.net framework64 v2.0.50727 configuration directory then you can promote your application code between environments without any post-build modifications

422372
directory	folder
and obviously the contents of the machine-level configuration directory get version-controlled in a different repository or a different folder structure from your app

422403
credentials	ntlm
i heard that on windows you can login from a web browser to the webserver without going through the usual login entering username and password but using instead the credentials from windows directly using the ntlm protocol

422405
pointers	stack
returning a reference to a local variables is returning a pointers into stack that s now being used for something else and that s going to cause lots of badness

422419
authentication	login
if you set the iis settings to require authentication then your users will need to login to access the page

422420
firefox	safari
edit looks like firefox has some support for this too and safari on macos

422422
webserver	security
if your webserver and client pc s are on a network secured by active directory or similar you can set windows integrated security in iis on the webserver for the website which automatically logs in all i.e clients that are allowed

422439
javascript	dom
i ve never used dojo but most javascript frameworks when dealing with the dom return the calling element when a method is called from the element object poor wording sorry

422440
constructor	object
in domain driven design it appears to be a good practice to use factories to create your domain object in your domain layer as opposed to using a direct constructor or ioc

422469
buffering	streaming
buffering streaming will allow you to read encrypt decrypt and write in a loop

422476
constructor	object
could you explain the difference between setting methods in the constructor and through prototype object

422504
selected	button
i want to set the selected item when the user clicks a button to edit the row

422535
getter	setter
for example if you have event handler or you wanted to simulate private properties with getter setter you might do

422535
constructor	object
edit because there has been discussion about how this effects objects extended by another object with functions assigned in the constructor i m adding a bit more detail

422535
subclassing	base-class
most javascript libraries call the constructor on the base-class and the subclassing

422535
constructor	object
prototype.js s object.extend this means that methods assigned in the constructor of each will be available on the resulting object

422545
haskell	lisp
there s less need for metaprogramming in haskell than in common lisp because much can be structured around monads and the added syntax makes embedded dsls look less tree-like but there s always template haskell as mentioned by shreevatsar and even liskell haskell semantics + lisp syntax if you like the parentheses

422554
textbox	button
take a page with a simple textbox validation control and button to submit them

422554
textbox	button
when the submit button is pressed with an empty textbox the client-side code appears to be ignored and a postback performed

422557
click	mouse
have the user click the mouse on any two points an inch or a centimeter apart

422566
arrays	loops
and a for is the usual way to loops over an arrays which everyone expects and understands

422572
constructor	object
if you need to create a type that doesn t have a parameterless constructor there is an overload on createinstance that takes a params of object to pass to a constructor

422575
linux	unix
it s for linux unix but maybe you can re-swizzle this for ruby on windows 2003 or have it serve as a model for doing it in some other scripting language

422583
sql-server	mysql
sql-server 2000 2005 mysql and access can all load directly from a tab cr text file they just have different commands to do it

422596
versioning	upgrade
the best versioning of this framework is the one in the colloquy irc client as it has been upgrade to use pcre 6.7

422602
value	field
you can do this without the triggers if your database supports default value on the field

422602
triggers	insert
i forgot that only worked for the first insert - i do have an update triggers as well to update the date fields and put a copy of the updated record in my history table - which i would post .

422622
change-password	login
for example the default accountcontroller has login change-password and register actions

422636
pointers	stack
it forces you to think about stuff like the call stack and instruction pointers

422650
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the autoreleases you mentioned don t actually make any sense all you re doing is creating a mutable copy nsmutablestring that s properly autoreleased but since you re casting it to an nsstring there s no practical difference then just saying

422672
symbolic-math	sympy
you could also checkout sympy a self-contained pure-python symbolic-math package

422690
constructor	object
if it makes sense to add and subtract to from primitive types then you should write a constructor that constructs the object from the primitive type

422695
binary-search-tree	map
to represent a linear sum use a finite map a binary-search-tree to map each variables to its coefficient

422698
order	join
there are lots of tricks the database query pre-processor can do and choices it can make - what order to join the tables which indexes to use whether to apply where clauses before or after join etc

422728
code-coverage	gcov
code-coverage with gcov or valgrind

422744
dictionary	map
a rainbow attack is essentially a more efficient dictionary attack it s designed to use the low cost of digital storage to enable creation of a map of a substantial subset of possible passwords to hashes and facilitate the reverse mapping

422744
subset	unique
without a salt the weakest of your users passwords are trivially accessible with a constant salt those weak passwords are accessible to a determined attacker with a unique salt the cost of accessing passwords is raised so high that only the most determined attacker could gain access to a tiny subset of vulnerable passwords and then only at great expense

422784
put	get
in the code below i m trying to load some images and put them in the stage as soon as they get individually loaded

422788
fflush	gets
it would help explain lots of performance issues - parsing s slow because there s lots of branches and pipeline gets fflush very easily branch predictor cannot compensate for everything

422798
contains	elements
i have a complex wpf user-controls made of other contentcontrol templates which contains sets of button textfields and other elements

422809
networkstream	streamreader
in clientaccepted i set up a networkstream a streamreader and a streamwriter

422822
udp	tcp
most networked games don t use tcp but udp for communications

422822
udp	tcp
with tcp there are a number of interactions between the host server to guarantee data in an ordered manner another thing you have to account for using udp the fact that data is not ordered

422836
base-class	inherited
having said that the answer is yes on my machine provided that the example_class contains no virtual methods and doesn t inherited from a base-class

422838
virtual-functions	base-class
however if the class has any virtual-functions including virtual destructor which could be inherited from a base-class or uses multiple-inheritance then the class layout may be different

422851
udp	tcp
the difference between tcp and udp should not account for 200 ms but a combination of other factors can

422857
highlight	selected
right-click on your database in ssms selected ensure your database is highlight and click next

422871
value	field
i ve typically seen a red asterik used for marking required field on webforms if you want to not pre-select some value for the user for another way to try to solve this issue

422894
value	field
to update a field you new up a directoryentry for the object you want to update set the property look in the properties collection to its new value then call commitchanges to save the changes for good

422905
arguments	undefined
you can use perl s eval statement to catch exception-handling including those from trying to call methods on an undefined arguments

422932
value	field
when i retrieve any scalar value from the database i usually write code like this for nullable field

422951
contains	set
i m looking for a way to set up via sql a log table contains everything that had been done to my sqlite database preferably in terms of the insert create table etc

422963
directory	folder
i m using the following command to remove every .dummy directory in a folder named test folder

422971
project-management	scrum
scrum is a project-management methods

422971
methodology	waterfall
waterfall is a software-development methodology

422971
project-management	scrum
the confusion arises because scrum is often practiced as the project-management part of an agile development process but scrum and agile are not the same thing

422972
png	gif
if there was a better compression algorithm than jpeg gif png etc

422984
constructor	private
and then work with that by setting the private field _parameters after you initialize it through the constructor

423013
firefox	safari
i have checked this against ie firefox and safari

423036
pixels	line
the above code produces an image with the dimensions of 256 x 256 pixels and draws two intersecting diagonal line in the form on an x

423036
pixels	line
by keeping the image size and location of the line to align within the 8 x 8 pixels section it will reduce the amount of compression artifacts and improve the quality of the image

423065
click	mouse
how do you tell a single mouse click from a double click

423070
actionscript	mxml
i don t like the way it feels different when i am using actionscript vs mxml

423071
32-bit	64bit
i am not using load balancing and am wondering why my application would be switching between 32-bit and 64bit modes

423073
iteration	elements
typically the for-loop will have finished by the point complete fires and imagedata will be holding that last elements from the final iteration

423073
put	get
you can put this inline but the doubly-nested function starts to get harder to read

423086
uniform	points
alternatively you can use the alias and store the point to the left and pick a uniform number between the two points

423093
sql-server	mysql
both mysql and sql-server support selects of constant expressions without a table name so this should work as one statement

423102
udp	tcp
we regularly use tcp and udp connections to pass info from services to other exes and in some cases msmq

423117
python	c++
there s lots of ways to interface with c and c++ in python

423120
exception-handling	try-catch
i think setting vs to break on uncaught exception-handling and wrapping the try-catch in ifdefs is how i would go about doing it

423123
firebird	mysql
it has providers for sql server oracle mysql sqlite and firebird

423130
dynamic-memory-allocation	c++
in c++ that is not dynamic-memory-allocation

423152
arrays	map
you could use an 1d arrays that is 64 elements big you can easily map 2d indexes to a 1d arrays and use something like this

423159
photoshop	layer
assuming that the image is done in photoshop or painter usually from a tablet there are often a number of filtering or layer at work in the average web-comic

423168
spring.net	ninject
namely autofac mef ninject spring.net structuremap unity and windsor

423168
web-config	app-config
that leaves us with initialization which is done in two ways via code or via xml configuration app-config web-config custom.config

423177
required	checked
it takes less than hour to checked all them cause usually they required just 3 lines of code to embed em in project

423214
codeigniter	kohana
the 1 controller to 1 view works well for me in the php asp.net-mvc frameworks zend codeigniter and kohana

423214
webforms	asp.net
in asp.net although not mvc 1 webforms view is mapped to 1 code behind file

423223
stax	sax
if you want more dynamic handling stax approach would probably work better than sax

423256
firefox	safari
the gwt debugging browser uses the native browser on your machine so ie on windows safari on mac firefox on linux

423263
malloc	free
you need to use delete w new or free w malloc to free the memory on the heap

423265
base-class	inherited
the first design has unnecessary interfaces which you don t really need unless you re implementing something else which implements the interface but doesn t inherited from the base-class

423284
udp	tcp
i would recommend first working with tcp rather than udp

423284
udp	tcp
udp doesn t automatically redeliver lost packets like tcp so it will add another element to the equation that will probably just confuse you as you re just starting out

423295
oracle	mysql
i can do it in sybase and i can do it in oracle but i m not seeing how to do it in mysql

423296
python	tcl
if you don t like tcl there is a python expect module as well

423312
value	field
you might want to look at the datakeyvalue property of the ownertableview object which will let you access a collection of value that represent the field in a given row

423334
json	xml
your message types are what you d expect - messages that conform to a contract between the process es inserting and the process es reading structured with xml or your other choice of representation json would be handy in some cases for instance

423362
directory	folder
i have a directory on a windows machine with a large number of files and folder that i need to watch and have the files mirrored synced instantly or as near to as possible to a linux machine over the local network

423382
msbuild	nant
is msbuild or nant necessary to integration

423384
redmine-plugins	redmine
note i m one of the core developers of redmine helped build the redmine-plugins system and have about a dozen redmine-pluginss release

423399
gethashcode	tostring
have fun implementing isystemobject on all of your classes so that you have access to tostring and gethashcode

423407
required	checked
i have another controllers which currently has 34 methods but those are all tied to a single view and they each have around 8-10 lines of code max checked required parameters updates the model and redirect as necessary

423420
malloc	free
the caller would have to know you malloc d it and then call free

423426
contains	set
this will produce a result set consisting of 2 columns and 3 rows where the left column contains foo on each row and the right column contains 3 4 and 5

423427
coalesce	nvl
you may also have to play with nvl or coalesce to convert nulls into zero

423444
alignment	layout
absolute control over the memory layout alignment and access when you need it

423446
revision	svn
the use of svn externals with the revision flag for the non changing stuff might prevent subclipse from refreshing those files on update

423448
base-class	inherited
i would use generics in the rows without involving string in the base-class and have the non generic inherited the table class

423459
contains	any
are there any resources with information creating a self contains reusable module

423469
firefox	safari
duplicated in firefox 3 and safari

423484
google-maps	gps
google-maps could determine location using cell tower info but not gps

423490
dictionary	arrays
i know that children contains data probably nested data but i m unsure if it s a list dictionary arrays etc

423516
scheme	elisp
nested functions in scheme are neat i wish elisp had the concept 1

423531
webforms	asp.net
i made a tutorial to do this with asp.net mvc but it should be almost identical for traditional webforms

423536
caf	mp3
if the audio file being streamed is an mp3 or i have to use caf

423537
entity-framework	nhibernate
personally i very rarely use dataset preferring standard poco classes for the entities perhaps with orm like linq-to-sql entity-framework nhibernate

423541
driver	kernel
the next time exallocatepoolwithtag is called to allocate memory with that pool tag the system will break into the kernel debugger and then you can look at the call stack to figure out which driver is performing the allocation

423542
synchronous	.when
if you play the sounds synchronous on new threads that you manage you will know .when they complete

423547
logout	login
i am doing erp solution in c# 2.0 windows application and sql2005 database.the network application communicate through database.i used normal technique for user login and logout keeping a status bit.my problem is that when my application interrupted with any other reason user status might not change.that will cause the user can t login at next time.how can i solve this problem

423556
autoscroll	panels
set the autoscroll property of panels to false

423558
malloc	strdup
strdup char allocates memory the malloc for arrays i is not necessary

423560
malloc	strdup
also as kauppi has pointed out strdup will allocate memory for you so you don t need to do malloc on each string

423570
strdup	free
as the other have posted - there was unused size and strdup allocates memory by itself and it is nice to free the memory afterwards.

423603
linux	unix
under unix linux systems the dot in front of a command to search for the command in the current directory

423603
command-line	cmd
on the cmd-line where you want your script to be executed you need to call the script with . matz.rb otherwise the bash will search a cmd like usr bin matz.rb what leads to your errormessage

423616
linux	unix
it sounds like you re on a unix linux system and just typing matz.rb on the command line

423630
lookup	any
in both cases they still use a separate text file to store the lookup rules rather than have any details hard-coded in the program itself

423644
insert-into	sql-insert
my feeling is generally that you shouln t be doing this at the last possible moment though as you insert-into a db you should be doing it at the first opportunity and or a common gateway the controllers which actually makes the sql-insert request where incidentally you would have the advantage of regex and possibly even a library which does the real validation for you

423668
contains	lookup
if it is only reading from a name and the name doesn t exist locally it will try to lookup the name in any contains scopes the module s global scope

423688
processor	affinity
the fact the processing is stuck to a single processor shows that the process is doing something that is not multi-core aware or someone has set it s thread affinity to 1

423731
lookup	any
checking into any of these branches requires a bug id - this is enforced by scmbug which will not only check that the comment is prefixed by the bug id but will also lookup this bug in the bug database ensure it is assign to the committer and potentially check other criteria that the fix in branch field is the branch being committed to

423734
mouseleave	mouseenter
then when the mouseenter one you will know and can ignore the user-controls s mouseleave event

423734
mouseleave	mouseenter
then when the child s mouseleave event fires check for the user-controls s mouseenter again

423756
ruby	php
script source if the webpage is dynamically generated then it is coded in some server side scripting language like php ruby jsp...

423760
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can also loop through all the child controls recursive on your control and attach a mouseenter and mouseleave event to them as well

423761
processor	affinity
on a dual quad-core getprocessaffinitymask or the dialog from set affinity in taskman.exe will report eight logical processor

423808
sql-server	firebird
i have done this for sql-server by first connecting to master then passing in the script for create to a query but with firebird i have a little chicken and egg problem

423814
msbuild	nant
neither msbuild nor nant is necessary - both are optional helpers

423815
pcre	icu
but they are considered slow and the regex syntax is limited compared to other solutions icu pcre

423849
constructor	object
that said if your object are trivial enough that you don t really need to write your own copy constructor and assignment operators and destructors - see the rule of three you may well get away with this especially if you re only throwing a couple of pods around

423883
spaces	output
you may need to recheck your header.php file for any part that may output html or spaces before your first

423884
buffering	capture
edit looking at your header you need to avoid doing any html output if you want to output headers or use output buffering to capture it

423890
put	get
have you debugged it and put a breakpoint there to verify that the string you get is actually the string you expect it to be

423910
integer	short
so in short it does much more than convert a string to an integer applying specific rounding rules to fractions short circuting unecessary conversions etc

423919
firefox	opera
that works perfectly fine on safari and firefox but when i try to click the link on ie7 and opera it does not even hit the server

423922
ado	jet
if you are considering both ado and dao then it s likely you are interested in ms-access or jet as a datasource in which case the following kb article is useful

423937
dialog	pop-up
visually you can either have it in a new pop-up or integrated into the list but actually it ll be only added to the list on the next try to add or acknowledge the parent dialog

423942
executable-jar	jar
in addition to the export as jar function which is included to eclipse the plugins bundles all dependent jars together into one executable-jar

423992
any	set
my initial approach was to send a simplified version of the object where i reflect the entity and set any entitysets to null but of course in the above example roles gets set to null and so roleid is null

423992
attributes	properties
my current favourite solution which i like and hate at the same time is to put the classes into opt-in serialization mode but because i can t add attributes to the real properties i d have to create json-only properties in a partial class

424003
dictionary	arrays
a fabricated ado recordset can be a good choice of container object for data as an alternative to a vba type struct collection dictionary etc strongly data typed nullable fields with built-in support for filtering sorting searching output to formatted text xml arrays paging cloning etc

424006
linux	unix
however a reasonable stab is to use both windows and linux unix mac and also an alternative on windows as path separators

424013
llvm	gcc
i m interested in knowing what is best free oss compiler for mips code gcc or llvm or is there anything even better than those

424016
children	nodes
when i expand a nodes with around 70 children it takes a while before the children are loaded task manager shows mem usage as 1000000k

424016
children	nodes
if i expand the next nodes with around 50 children boom

424020
javascript	dom
the reason for this is i am trying to replace ids from the browsers dom using javascript

424033
python	perl
plowing your way via bash perl python etc

424067
python	lua
my initial hunch is that i should be using one of python ruby or lua

424085
spaces	output
alternatively not to think about a newline or spaces somewhere in the file you can buffer the output

424098
configuration	upgrade
if that s the case then quite possibly around the same time as that upgrade some routing configuration was changed or firewall changes were made or whatever box the instance is on had some change made now that it handles your stuff differently

424105
vb.net	vb6
the library must be able to be accessed from a wide range of languages including vb6 c++ vb.net and c#

424112
attributes	properties
for example if i m adding a properties the ide infers what attributes other properties in the file has and how the properties itself is structured and adjusts the properties accordingly

424141
protected	public
beside #define private public you can also #define private protected and then define some foo class as descendant of wanted class to have access to it s now protected methods via type casting

424150
private-members	object
create another class with the same layout as the object with private-members but with private changed to public

424150
private-members	object
use a simple cast to point this to your object with private-members and try calling a private function

424175
any	set
if the user is able to authentication the remote_user environment variables is set to their username where it s available to any cgi they access

424230
web-deployment	web
i m using a web-deployment project in order to precompile my asp.net 3.5 web project

424265
required	checked
basically set up some sort of password policy that checked a dictionary against the letters and required a number or symbols in the password

424267
python	lua
i don t think you would be able to do the idea you re talking about even if you could do the equivalent for java ruby lua python other so having your desktop app pre-compile and upload just the native code to the device

424289
disposable	dispose
if your object is holding both an unmanaged and a disposable the finalizer must call two diferent versioning of dispose one that release disposable and unmanaged the other only unmanaged

424292
any	set
however i don t think there s any way to set you own seed for it

424293
click	mouse
componentfrompoint icoordx icoordy in internet-explorer but how do i differentiate a mouse click occurred in the content area of an element from the click occurred on its scrollbar in other browsers

424296
udp	tcp
tcpview is a windows program that will show you detailed listings of all tcp and udp endpoints on your system including the local and remote addresses and state of tcp connections

424307
localization	translation
however i plan to integrate it a bit into kde in future and here come the problems with localization translation

424309
32-bit	64bit
and if 8 capabilities isn t enough for you it s trivial to change the tinyint 8 bits to a smallint 16-bit capabilities int 32-bit or bigint 64bit which should be more than sufficient for just about any application most of us are likely to write

424343
oracle	mysql
let s go with an example you define the axis jdk with possible value 1.4 1.5 1.6 and you define another property database where possible values are oracle mysql

424356
32-bit	64bit
we use a mixture of 32-bit and 64bit development environments

424356
32-bit	64bit
c program files xxx on the 32-bit dev enviroment or c program files x86 xxx on the 64bit dev environment

424373
silverlight	wpf
this isn t asp.net specific some of these apps are winforms also will be adding some wpf and possibly some silverlight apps in the future

424373
versioning	upgrade
how straightforward or not is it going to be to upgrade this between .net versioning

424385
lookup	any
that saves running all the way around the houses creating custom attributes and attaching them to your enums or using lookup tables to marry an enum value with a friendly string and best of all it s self managing and can be used on any pascal case string which is infinitely more reusable

424387
iteration	set
iterating on this node set create your pivot by filtering you status base on the current element in your iteration

424399
interpreter	runtime
as i understand the iphone sdk licence there is nothing preventing you from using a scripting language in your app - just that you cannot install any interpreter or runtime of your own

424407
internet-explorer	google-chrome
i am not sure what pitfalls there are to avoid and i am not currently able to test implementations in any other browsers than internet-explorer 8 google-chrome and mozilla firefox 3

424422
build-server	msbuild
i want to use msbuild for my build-server since everything is already set up that way thanks to vs but i m also looking for tips on how files should be laid out how projects should be laid out in a solution etc

424424
push	pull
it s a pull based parsing instead of the push you are currently using

424431
spacing	layout
i m thinking things like spacing text size layout of the elements etc

424435
export	csv
have you considered export as csv instead of excel

424439
contains	elements
this is just a visual representation when the collection elements contains the null value

424443
shell	bash
when working an interactive bash session one aspect from the windows shell i miss is the f8 key where you start typing a command hit f8 and the shell finds the most recent command entered in history that matches what you have typed so far

424453
show	next
pressing ctrl - r again show the next match etc

424483
command-line	cmd
where file is neither your data nor your result file but a file with the cmd you would type in the cmd-line

424483
execution	exit
after execution all commands in that file gnuplot exit

424492
digits	zero
trying to reverse the process i wrote three numbers 007 in an excel sheet once as number once as text and once as number but formatted to show 3 digits padded with zero

424502
command-line	cmd
my gentoo is configured in a way that i can press pgup and pgdn to scroll through those cmd in the command history that start with whatâ s currently in my command-line

424517
contains	set
should my test fixture contains tests for every possible validation error that can occur in the validate methods or is it better to leave that for a separate set of tests

424522
iso	utc
this look a lot like a iso 8601 format with a zulu utc timezone

424531
debugging	trace
is there any way to trace debugging this code to find out what is causing the failure

424547
put	get
so then the only merge i ever need to do is to get a bug fix out of trunk and put it on the latest build branch and re-release that branch

424557
triggers	insert
for instance i can reset a fields value in an update insert triggers but it would still have to get through the insert first

424582
triggers	insert
the code in this triggers wil run in stead of the original insert update

424584
default-value	default
by default sql-server will set the default-value of the row to newid which will generate a guid

424587
json	xml
but even if atom had addressed it i still need to support other representations xml json so i am looking for a pattern more inherent in the restful approach

424589
enterprise	platform
for a little background i work for a firm that develops web-based enterprise social media platform

424602
printf	scanf
c runtime library contains c functions such as printf scanf fopen and so on

424619
triggers	insert
as charles suggested if you don t have access to the source then you need to have a triggers on the insert

424619
triggers	insert
however sql-server doesn t have a true before insert triggers to my knowledge so you need to try instead of

424623
any	set
you d be surprised at how you can have 100 line and branch coverage with a set of tests that look comprehensive and yet you can fundamentally change or even comment out a line in your source without any of the tests complaining

424625
installation	upgrade
software is supposed to require admin rights for installation including update upgrade

424625
directory	folder
what specific folder in the user s directory

424648
ruby-on-rails	django
we use puppet to manage overall system configuration for ruby-on-rails django and php based web db app servers and we use capistrano for application deployments and single commands like running puppet after a config change

424668
simpledateformat	date-format
i think commons-lang is using java s built-in date-format or simpledate-format which throws a parseexception for your date

424688
arrays	loops
no need for loops or arrays

424691
xcopy	cmd
a simple xcopy source file destination folder cmd to copy the xml templates file from the dependent assembly s bin folder to the main project s bin folder should work

424705
show	next
however if you click the next button on the datapager it does not show the second page

424724
any	set
i agree with damien now that jquery is pretty much or will become ubiquitous in any .net devs tool set i d recommend the jquery-ui-autocomplete plugins

424764
filtering	sorting
i thought that would apply the sorting filtering etc

424802
any	set
ultimately any set of nonsense words should work or any set of words that are nonsensical relative to the problem

424825
arrays	loops
you have to loops through the arrays no other way to check all elements

424848
hash	md5
the most reliable way would be to make md5 hash of all the local files you care about and store it in a file

424848
hash	md5
so the file will contain a list of filenames and their md5 hash

424848
archive	backup
i m not a fan of using the archive bit or modified date because either of those could be confused if you backup or restore your local directory with another backup program

424927
selected	button
for instance let s say i have a listview that displays customers and a button that i click to allow me to edit the currently selected customer

424927
button	popup
clicking the button fires the editcustomercommand which opens a popup windows which allows me to edit all the properties of the customervm

424932
value	field
when a selected field is changed i would like to loop through all of the input value in the form it belongs to using jquery

424962
primitive	int
it seems you do not need a property for a primitive type such as int bool float

424984
processor	cpu
having dual or quad cores is just the beginning there will be systems with a much higher number of processor in the near future currently there are cpu with 256 cores windows 7 will have support for such processor

424990
contains	any
if the class contains any templates member functions you can specialize that member function to suit your needs

424995
postback	ajax
i m not sure if your issue is related to one i ran into with postbacks but some of the ajax libraries i was using was inserting extra controls into the page and was causing the generated id in my link to no longer match up to the id the server expected for the postback event

425011
instance-variables	accessor
i can t speak for the rest of the example but it s probably accessing the internal instance-variables directly or if it s being accessed from another class key-value coding is generating an accessor which is really bad form

425011
instance-variables	accessor
if i don t need a special accessor and the instance-variables isn t used outside the class i ll just refer to it directly rather than declaring a property

425015
.net	wcf
i have recently begun working with ajax-enabled wcf and have been plagued with this .net caching issue - could not load file or assembly app__web__hamznvwf

425058
tiff	png
tiff can beat png by about 2 1 43k vs

425058
tiff	png
83k using imagemagick convert to go from original tiff - png - tiff again to double-check that imagemagick is producing both file formats and ensure that my original program didn t do a bad job producing the tiff but only because tiff uses 8bits pixel grayscale and png uses 24bits pixel rgb

425061
64bit	x86
as has been stated the 64bit jit compiler behaves differently to the x86 jit compiler

425061
32-bit	64bit
for example in .net 3.5 the 32-bit jit will inline function calls with struct as arguments but the 64bit jit does not

425062
swing	awt
swing components should always be manipulated on the awt event dispatch thread edt

425070
order	add
to do that i just add a dummy first column and order by that

425092
xlsx	xls
i am trying to open an excel xls or xlsx file and read through value as you can probably see

425092
basic	vb6
i can open the file in excel with no warning and i can also open read close the file in vb6 with the basic open file for input as #1 syntax without error

425112
webforms	asp.net
i have an existing asp.net webforms project that uses microsoft s enterprise daab for the dal i need to implement some extensive features and i would like to use nhibernate to make things easier

425112
webforms	asp.net
additionally what is the best way to setup nhibernate dal bll for an asp.net webforms application

425150
ref	out
be passed using a ref or out

425197
python	ruby
i have been using zend framework in a mvc configuration read about ruby on rails and plan de check other mvc frameworks in python django

425211
malloc	free
the function free can only be called on memory that was allocated with malloc

425214
malloc	free
you need to have malloc d something for it to be able to be free d

425221
authentication	login
my initial thought is there are system methods which utilize your current authentication data to perform encryption decryption but do not give access to applications to read it your system login data directly

425234
contains	elements
i d like to add an option elements to a selected elements where the option elements s text contains an html entity mdash

425234
firefox	safari
did not test with firefox safari etc

425284
show	next
it s possible that they show the implementation next to the constant as assume that is self-explanatory but it seems that comments would also be helpful

425304
groovy	java
mostly the community needs to integrate with existing developer toolsets and write good documentation aimed at ordinary developers - probably oo developers using java .net and ruby groovy - and then i predict it will snowball

425306
ruby-on-rails	django
i ask because i initially learned about mvc with java applications then things like ruby-on-rails and django

425308
firefox	opera
currently it s showing the value of scrollwidth which is reported as 1540px by ie and 920px by firefox safari opera etc

425329
webforms	asp.net
edit regarding asp.net mvc i have a negative personal bias toward asp.net webforms

425329
webforms	asp.net
i haven t seen a single platform for web development as easy as asp.net webforms and this is only because of great webcontrol support which requires viewstate

425329
webforms	asp.net
but i think asp.net webforms will remain a great technology where it s more applicable

425329
asp.net-mvc	webforms
specifically about data access asp.net-mvc usually requires more code than webforms counterparts

425329
webforms	asp.net
for presenting tabular data i.e where gridview is applicable i think asp.net webforms is the easier way to accomplish things

425331
javascript	dom
frankly i m getting bored taking this apart so instead i dumped it into a local html file disconnected from the internet opened firefox disabled javascript loaded the file in firefox turned on firebug reloaded the page so it would run and inspected the dom

425334
abstract-class	subclassing
the abstract-class is effectively declaring an interface - and you already know from your two concrete subclassing that an implementation may well be unable to return successfully due to an exception-handling conditional

425341
xsd	xml
i ve got some xsd files to validate generated and received xml s

425347
arguments	default
note that the button callback is set to a function handle to increment and that this function must accept two arguments by default a graphics handle for the user-interface component that triggers the callback and a structure of associated event data

425350
subclassing	superclass
in the code we d probably make all of these entities subclassing of an entity superclass

425357
hide	show
then in my main user-controls applications rootvisual i just show hide each user-controls when needed

425361
mouseleave	mouseenter
hooking all the controls mouseenter and mouseleave events then figuring out if it is still inside the form is pretty painful

425374
triggers	insert
there would be performance considerations but you could add insert and update triggers to all of your tables and have the triggers insert into your audit tables

425378
data-access	nhibernate
for example if you re in .net and are writing code-gen for data-access you d better have a good excuse for not using linq to sql or nhibernate

425429
google-chrome	firefox
firefox opera google-chrome konqueror - all display it properly watchbot can

425443
put	get
that is doing a get delete head or put on a resource more than once is the same as doing it only once

425451
derived-class	base-class
perhaps more importantly if you customize the generated code the customizations would be lost if you re-run the generator but customizations in a derived-class will be preserved when the base-class is changed

425464
sql-server	mysql
for example you can use mysql sql-server or even xml file to authticate your users

425467
setinterval	settimeout
probably the best way to handle this is to use setinterval instead of settimeout

425467
setinterval	settimeout
like settimeout setinterval returns an integer which can be passed to clearinterval to cancel the processing

425474
linux	unix
you can do java development on windows in which case no unix linux knowledge is required

425474
cygwin	gnu
that said even on windows gnu cygwin utilities can be helpful

425494
selected	textbox
if you bind to dt then say for example if you have a datagridview bound to this datatable every time you selected a different row the textbox will change

425569
silverlight	wpf
i m not 100 sure this is in silverlight but in wpf you call a static method called setx where x is the property on the type the attached property is defined on and pass it in which control to set the value on and the value

425583
lan	wan
my suggestion to you is that if there is no performance problem for example when the service provider is on the lan not wan or the data is relatively small it s worth it to send 100 post requests to the server

425586
32-bit	64bit
if this is a 64bit version of the windows os and your program -- in the case notepad++ -- is compiled and linked as a 32-bit application the operating system will automatically redirect any file open requests from windir system32 to windir syswow64

425586
32-bit	64bit
for reasons that are hard to explain microsoft decided that this was the best way of compatibility so that 32-bit applications work correctly under the new 64bit oses

425593
document	editing
one of my applications deals with ms-word and document creation editing formatting

425627
arguments	default
given your code example you cannot instantiate myparent at all either because it doesn t accept a templates arguments list or because it has no default constructor

425630
actionscript	mxml
adobe has an free alpha release of flexbuilder for linux i thought it was quite unstable when editing mxml files but if your doing strict actionscript work you may find it useful

425662
minimum	max
for these you should set a minimum time to your estimate and make it clear you don t know what the max is

425664
tiff	gif
if not perhaps gif tiff or jpeg

425670
chown	chmod
file permission tools are also a must for getting a system working - look into chmod and chown and how those commands work

425680
required	checked
i would then like to map these data-types and required value to data validation rules so the form could not be submitted unless it passes the checked

425682
contains	set
to do that the css property overflow can be set to scroll and it will scroll if the contains elements size is larger than that of itself

425706
display	width
but when there is no width set it display one letter per line

425706
background-color	width
i also set the background-color to something very flashy to see the control takes the whole width of the page

425717
passthru	exec
i tried passthru and exec but they didn t work

425732
beyondcompare	utility
i have found that partial classes and a good file comparison utility araxis or beyondcompare are essential

425734
restart	reload
wouldn t you want to pass a reload instead of a restart

425745
sql-server	mysql
i m working with mysql db2 sql-server at the moment but the solution needs to be database agnostic for xml in sql-server isn t a viable option

425748
protected	public
you should never have to test private methods because only the public or protected methods of the same class will ever call private methods

425751
any	set
just set a cron job with sufficient privileges to check for changes to the host file and restart apache if any are found

425778
methods	extend
you can extend the applicactioncontext that are using and override the methods createbeanfactory

425876
populate	row
that way you can populate the commandargument with the row id or whatever you need and you ll have access to it when you handle the rowcommand of the gridview

425878
contains	any
make sure any wrapper classes that you create are disposable if they contains pointers and make sure you dispose of them in your managed code

425898
triggers	insert
i could write triggers in c# that fires when an insert occurs and then send the newly inserted data to a windows or wcf service

425919
unmanaged	c++-cli
mixing unmanaged c++ code and c++-cli code in the same executable dll is a really bad idea

425919
unmanaged	c++-cli
c++-cli objects can only hold pointers to unmanaged c++ objects

425920
job-queue	queue
what you are describing is sometimes called a job-queue or a message queue

425921
groovy	java
because oracle has a built in jvm you can develop stored procs in java but also in non-java-languages that use the jvm that means languages like jacl jython scheme and groovy

425922
32-bit	64bit
64bit support .net by default generates 32 or 64bit code depending on the platform but your native code will probably be 32-bit only.

425925
ironpython	ironruby
.net covers many languages c# vb.net ironpython ironruby delphi.net even on the same solution

425926
triggers	insert
in the insert triggers add the record s pk into a queue table

425929
uiscrollview	subviews
to enable the ability to zoom into and pan around the board i added my view as a subviews of uiscrollview

425947
host	dns
does your client look up the dns mx record to find the right smtp host

425949
delphi	vb.net
i was a vb.net guy but i took a one year delphi gig a few years back

425977
.when	ready
since i dont know exactly .when the file will be ready to download i figure that i must need to poll the remote site every so often get a listing of the files in the results directory and see if one matches what i am expecting

425987
exception-handling	try-catch
my idea is throwing an exception-handling but operation is really complex so should i put try-catch to all of my functions or is there a more generic way pattern

425988
32-bit	64bit
is it different on 32-bit vs 64bit machines

425989
google-chrome	safari
here s the easiest way to fix this issue for both google-chrome and safari if you have multiple web apps

425989
google-chrome	safari
now the asp.net menu will render correctly in safari and google-chrome

426012
constructor	object
the one thing that gets me all the time is leaving the last in an object constructor

426015
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i had a ruby-on-rails 2.2 app running when i tried to add the latest rspec plugin to it

426064
function-call	inline
you might also be able to inline the access methods so that it doesn t cost you a function-call during execution

426138
processor	cpu
you generally can only optimally have 1 thread per cpu but unless your application has some explicit thread affinity to one processor then yes windows will assign these threads to a free processor

426148
sql-server	oracle
the closest you get in oracle is the clob which has the same limitations that text had in sql-server back in the bad old days

426161
display	width
if you run this the trace statement should display the height and width of the drawn sprite which is randomly generated

426182
icollection	ienumerable
i ve read a couple of blog post mentioning that for public apis we should always return icollection or ienumerable instead of list

426186
triggers	insert
a very simple triggers that chucks stuff into an audit queue table may be acceptable if you don t care about identity after insert and you will never lock the audit queue table up

426186
triggers	insert
instead from your application orm you should triggers insert stuff into a queue table and have this queue processed on a regular basis

426210
arguments	default
by any chance is there a short cut in visual-studio which writes the constructor in the derived class with the same signatures as in the default class for me with boilerplate code which calls mybase.new ... and plugs in the arguments for me

426212
rollback	commit
i must use a corporate class that re-uses or re-creates a transaction after every commit or rollback

426219
contains	any
i have a blob byte arrays contains any kind of binary file plus a file name

426228
msbuild	nant
i don t know from what you posted if this will work but if you re trying to run the solution using a the nant msbuild task you might be able to get away with substituting that for a an exec task that calls the most recent version of msbuild as an executable

426235
administration	account
i found this out the hard way when i set the built-in administration account to default to the application db and it went offline somehow and i could no longer login

426235
any	set
using management studio you can set the option to login to master but you must run the above command before any other operation will work less you get the default database is unavailable error

426239
python	java
one for someone coming from a higher level background vb6 c# java python - not to familiar with c or c++

426245
web-config	app-config
how can i share link app-config or web-config between multiple projects in a visual-studio solution

426248
filtering	grouping

generate set of rows from table s including any rows produced by join

426248
filtering	grouping
evaluate having conditions against grouping filtering out grouping that don t match

426252
malloc	free
for example you can write a library which implement malloc and free

426252
malloc	free
and by loading these with ld_preload your malloc and free will be executed rather than the standard ones

426255
git-pull	git-svn
since you are git-rebase the branch git-svn git-rebase is a bit like git-pull --git-rebase it effectively rewrites history

426260
any	set
if you set ld_preload to the path of a shared object that file will be loaded before any other library including the c runtime libc.so

426262
linux	unix
if you re on unix linux try

426267
versioning	packaging
maven install plugins has command-line usage to install a jar into the local repository pom is optional but you will have to specify the groupid artifactid versioning and packaging all the pom stuff

426271
order	add
in order to do this you will have to click on the down-arrow on the right side of the add button and choose add as link

426276
contains	any
since the latter will if the box was initially checked change the behaviour of a call to .reset on any form that contains it - a subtle but probably unwelcome behaviour change

426276
attributes	properties
for more context some incomplete discussion of the changes to the handling of the checked attributes properties in the transition from 1.5.x to 1.6 can be found in the version 1.6 release notes and the attributess vs

426278
web-config	app-config
first of all remember that an app-config or web-config is visble to all code running in any project that is a used within the process established by the start-up project within a solution.

426280
carbon	cocoa
it doesn t yet create cocoa apps they are carbon right now it doesn t have as many built-in controls as some other ides it uses quite a bit of ram and it s harder to automate builds than it should be

426282
margins	padding
namely using spacers nested cells etc to control margins and padding

426291
device-driver	hardware
then you would be able to create a device-driver for more modern operating systems using more modern hardware possibly with the addition of a pci to isa bridge

426306
value	field
i don t know if this helps but here s some proof-of-concept c code i threw together that retrieves the value of the isize field in a gzip d file

426357
ftpwebrequest	ftp
no need to buy a 3rd party ftp library ftp is built into .net ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse

426369
windows-xp	windows
next most of these back office systems are running either windows 2000 or windows-xp depending on the age of the system so be really careful about the version of .net you choose

426383
constructor	object
edit by named service constructor i mean try creating a servicesecurity object with the name of the service in the form server_name service_name or ip_address service_name

426384
dialog	pop-up
however the dialog box doesn t pop-up here is the download.php scripting

426404
linux	aix
lf multics unix and unix-like systems gnu linux aix xenix mac os

426404
linux	unix
unix linux n

426405
margins	padding
this has a nice side effect of being able to add your padding margins background colors etc

426428
logging	trace
you re going to need to capture a full stack trace in your logging if you want to get to the problem

426456
firefox	opera
gwt works in firefox and all gecko browser safari and all webkit browsers ie and opera

426490
tic-tac-toe	chess
alpha-beta pruning is a good one for game tree in general and turn-based games like chess and tic-tac-toe in particular

426496
formatting	printing
again many inline definitions are used probably to quickly mockup site s structure but so correctly uses also css to style the divs and to provide printing formatting

426501
tic-tac-toe	chess
the heuristics for something like tic-tac-toe is too simple and for chess too complex

426532
put	get
occasionally i get messages in a different order in which they were put onto the queue

426539
constructor	object
if classes did inherit their superclass constructors all classes would have the parameterless constructor from object

426541
user-interface	look-and-feel
we d like to have extensibility points in the future to allow external developers to change the look-and-feel of the user-interface without having to buser-interfaceld compile and stage the entire application or even the entire front end

426541
tapestry	jsf
so far our top choices are tapestry and jsf maybe with facelets

426569
perl	php
i ve been a software developer for over twenty years programming in c perl sql java php javascript and recently python

426573
execution	restart
i wrote a powershell scripting for killing then restart rdpclip but no one s using it because it s a scripting not to mention the execution policy is restricted for the box

426584
capitalization	capitalize
i am trying to actually capitalize as the developer types not remind them about proper capitalization

426586
debugging	trace
step into libraries that you are not able to re-compile for the purposes of adding trace assuming you have access to the debugging symbols

426607
python	ruby
i ve been wanting to have a play with either ruby or python while at the same time i ve been wanting to do a bit of cocoa programming

426607
python	ruby
so i thought the best way to achieve both these goals is to develop something using either a ruby or python to objective-c bridge pyobjc or rubycocoa

426622
operators	keyword
stylecop says all keyword are to be followed by a spaces framework design guidelines say get rid of all spacess even around binary operators

426622
operators	keyword
this is explicitely stating that the stylecop style is wrong spaces after the while keyword spacess before and after the equality binary operators

426628
scriptaculous	jquery
the array.prototype.call in scriptaculous effect causes this problem with jquery

426632
.when	ready
add a mailbox to your user-interface to alert users .when the pdf was ready to be picked up

426644
sql-server	mysql
what is the best way to update sql-server with the data from mysql

426644
sql-server	mysql
i can update sql-server from a local copy of mysql not production is there a way to apply mysql replication to a slave server at specified intervals

426647
shell	bash
edit a solution using either the dos shell or the cygwin bash shell is fine

426659
updating	updates
updating the site when there aren t schema changes is as easy as issuing an svn updates command

426693
core-animation	catransform3d
as an aside the core-animation struct catransform3d has the same internal structure as your matrix

426694
json	xml
i am currently putting together a rails-based web application which will only serve and receive data via json and xml

426695
python	ruby
alternately what i use these days is a scripting language that plays nicely with windows like ruby or python for such tasks

426702
json	xml
this would make it safe to use in xml or json format

426706
sql-server	mysql
regardless of how you do the import to sql-server from the mysql clone i don t think you need to worry about restricting mysql replication to specific times

426723
sql-server	mysql
also does someone know the group by versus distinct performance considerations in mysql and sql-server

426723
sql-server	mysql
i m guessing that sql-server has a better optimizer and they might be close to equivalent there but in mysql i expect a significant performance advantage to distinct

426728
constructor	object
as nearly every type in .net inherits from object which has a parameterless constructor that means almost every type that you create would be forced to have a parameterless constructor

426733
foundation	cocoa
once you have a solid foundation no pun intended in cocoa objective-c then the bridges can be useful to you

426738
sql-server	mysql
limit 1 is particular to mysql as top is to sql-server

426740
any	set
is there any way to selected a subset from a large set based on a property or predicate in less than o n time

426740
any	set
but for a large data set the number of indexes required to match any possible combination of queries would make the index grow exponentially

426745
python	java
my general opinion is that ide debuggers are absolutely amazingly wonderful for managed languages like java or c# are fairly useful for c++ and are not very useful for scripting languages like python but it could be that i just haven t tried a good debugger for any scripting languages yet

426749
value	field
the value i need to insert is in the web_share field of the zen_products_description table

426757
profiling	trace
if you want to see the total held bytes sum all the bytes of all objects referenced by your object of a specific object type use a memory profiling like dot trace -

426764
constructor	object
if you don t create the foo object on the heap and the internal arrays of foo isn t a pointer to which you allocate memory with new in foo s constructor then that internal arrays will be created on the stack

426766
constructor	object
you can make a timertask implementation that takes your thread object in a constructor

426793
ready	live
i run the live server direct from the master branch and when i m finished with another branch and ready to merge it flip the server to that branch for a while

426837
project-management	project
subversion is a version-control system in order to have the features you ask you will have to use a third party add-on i recommend you to try trac it s an open source project-management and bug tracking system for software development project and is very easy to integrate with subversion

426842
firefox	safari
javascript doesn t run across multiple threads so you re safe from race conditions ignoring upcoming worker thread support in safari and firefox d

426842
firefox	opera
simple question how are you calling setalpha multiple times firefox safari and opera all coalesce style sheet updates -- eg

426842
firefox	safari
safari and i think the latest firefox builds

426842
any	bag
my sites render the same in lynx as any other browser because i couldn t design my way out of a paper bag d

426843
.when	ready
.when we re ready to push to production we run a rsync scripting that backs up production updates the database and then pushes the files up

426861
spring	seam
spring asp.net-mvc seam struts are not suitable here

426862
cygwin	gnu
if so i would recommend installing the cygwin environment and if you install all the packages along with it gnu s make is part of the deal

426862
linux	unix
if you are on a linux platform or one of the unix variants then you can just go with the gnu make directly

426865
javascript	dom
so the browser pauses waiting for javascript to finish and doesn t even have a chance to update the screen while your code is rapidly changing some dom values

426875
click	mouse
not to mention that if you can drag and drop a component with a mouse click and drag then why waste the keystrokes

426897
filtering	sorting
linq s supposed to be used to make filtering sorting aggregating and manipulating data from various sources as intuitive and expressive as possible

426899
value	field
it s a query option and a distinct value in any of the three field of the select-list will lead to a distinct row in the query result

426952
parallels	vmware
it definitely works using vmware or parallels

426958
conditional	operators
the result of the conditional operators that is the a and b in p

426967
base-class	inherited
make pa1 and pa2 inherited from a common base-class and use a reference to that ancestor as the arguments type of your then non-templated function

427027
highlight	selected
the problem is when i inserted a new data through formview i put the highlight on the new data but if you click edit or delete if would go for either the first data on the grid if you have not selected anything yet or the last data you have selected

427029
mochiweb	yaws
as already mentioned yaws or mochiweb are a great way to go but if you d like a dead simple way to get your restful api done quickly and correctly then use webmachine

427033
any	set
all i want to do is to set my client app timezone equal to server timezone so that any date time related discrepancies can be avoided

427040
multiplication	multiplying
for example you could define an infix multiplication operators as follows where multiplying x y is already defined

427040
operators	keyword
or a c or java-style ternary operators which involves two keyword interspersed with variables

427045
cakephp	symfony
some frameworks like symfony cakephp akelos codeigniter and others have support for scaffolding

427056
text-align	display
and then once the input is processed the form is submitted or an event of the textarea is captured the contents are display in a non-editable text element such as p span td where the text-align justify

427083
silverlight	wpf
additionally and unrelated i m also noticing asp.net-mvc is starting to get a lot of exposure - perhaps since the introduction of silverlight wpf

427096
xhtml	tidy
you can pass it to tidy externally or use xmltextwriter if you are willing to use xhtml instead of html

427100
overwrite	copying
i m relying on memory here but i recall getting this error once after copying settings between different configuration files and the only problem was that i d overwrite an extra angle bracket when pasting

427101
nested-loops	loops
if you re iterating over three lists in nested-loopss this is simply a more complicated way of iterating over the product of the lists with a single loops

427130
strong-typing	types
the problem you have is with the strong-typing at compile time and you wish to change the types at runtime

427145
xhtml	tidy
tidy can clean up your html and make it look nice as well as turning it into valid html or xhtml

427146
parentheses	operators
at equal levels of precedence you can require disambiguation with parentheses but you ll probably prefer to permit some operators to be associative so you can write

427146
operator-precedence	associativity
once you have a fixity a precedence and an associativity for each operators you ll want to write an operator-precedence parsing

427153
haskell	lisp
both lisp and haskell are loaded with powerful new ideas that will make your head explode in different incomparable but useful ways

427192
jquery-cycle	preload
iâ m quite new to jquery and trying to figure out how to preload images for the jquery-cycle plugins

427192
loading	gif
also i need to display a loading gif wile it preloads the images

427203
perl	php
i saw someone ask a question about detecting if a url redirects from groovy and perl but couldn t find anything on php

427208
any	set
you can use any mocking framework like rhinomocks or nmock to mock out the interface contract so if your service implemented imyservice then you could use a mocking framework to set expectations on the methods calls on that interface

427209
alloca	malloc
the alloca routine like malloc but uses the stack automatically frees itself and also blows up with sigsegv if it s too big

427210
decimal-point	digits
i have a cgfloat value which i want to round to 3 digits after the decimal-point

427211
python	c++
or you can go with pymaemo for building apps with python which to me is much easier than c or c++

427217
any	set
isn t it just as effective in using a public variables that you can set any time using the set methods of the variables

427242
command-line	cmd
the cmd are pretty simple i use the command-line eg

427245
where-clause	sql
simply use an sql where-clause

427253
droppable	draggable
have a look at the jquery and more specifically jquery user-interface since it has draggable droppable sortable and a variety of other complex components

427274
alloca	malloc
the deprecated alloca routine like malloc but uses the stack

427274
alloca	malloc
anyhow how much faster in your case is alloca vs malloc

427284
safari	opera
the following jquery code works just fine for me with safari opera ff2 and ff3

427311
google-chrome	firefox
i figured out to do it in a non-w3c-compliant way and it is working in both ie and firefox and incidentally in google-chrome too

427320
subtract	add
it returns an arrays where you can get top and left arrays values. the fix was that i have to trap for ie6 and just subtract some fixed number 12px in my case for top and add that same number on height

427321
javascript	dom
for buttons i would often times use javascript to replace the outerhtml in the html dom of an iframe to show a button rather

427330
python	c++
by embedding python in the c++ plugin you can effectively script the program in python

427334
getelementsbyclassname	classname
with 2.6 one alternative is to use dom getelementsbyclassname and search in the html for the tree for any element with classname ygtvfocus then use treeview methods getnodebyelement which should tell you which node it was

427347
pointers	stack
then to determine the current stack depth subtract a pointers to the top of stack from one to the bottom

427366
arrays	loops
the result is an arrays of objects which i can loops through and add to the container

427386
subroutine	scoping
in some cases it is required let s take for example a variables in the scoping of a class and a parameter being passed to a subroutine that has an equivalent name like so

427387
synchronous	.when
so instead of just a dowork methods that starts to do the work asynchronously and an event that fires .when the work is complete worker would include a synchronous work methods that returns the result s of the work and beginwork and endwork pair that can be used for asynchronous use

427388
alloca	malloc
the linux man-page for alloca notes that for certain applications its use can improve efficiency compared to the use of malloc and in certain cases it can also simplify memory deallocation in applications that use longjmp or siglongjmp

427389
arguments	default
but turns out that javascript does not support default arguments value like this

427391
function-calls	main
the standard solution to this is to define an opaque abstracted set of function-calls that are the driver to the hw and then call that in the main program

427391
low-level	hardware
note that if the goal is at a low-level writing code where each hardware access is to be simulated rather than entire functions it might be a bit tricker

427397
powerpc	arm
also if you can choose the architecture of the target device going with something like a modern arm with thumb v2 or a powerpc with vle or mips with mips16 or selected known-compact targets like infineon tricore or the sh family is a very good option

427410
python	ruby
since dreamhost supports mod_passenger and afaik it works not only for ruby rails apps but also for python django - you might give it a try

427427
protected	public
in c# i would make such methods protected instead of private and expose them as public in a subclass for testing

427433
stderr	stdout
however i want to display the console windows and write stdout stderr by giving a cmd line parameter

427461
stderr	stdout
i d look into starting a cmd instance possibly using system.diagnostics.process to start a process while redirecting stdin stdout stderr of that new process

427467
contains	set
as for the username password - looking at the installation folder for the adpater i can see there s a schemas folder and in it a propertyschema.xsd - this one contains context properties which i assume are used to control the adpater s behaviour at runtime as this is almost always the case - the schema contains properties for username and password - i would try to set those on the outgoing message

427481
pointers	stack
allocate a large chunk of memory at the beginning of the program and keep a stack of pointers to this which would correspond to frames on the regular stack

427481
pointers	stack
you just need to remember to pop your private stack pointers when the function returns

427485
any	set
before starting a worker thread i want to see if any previous thread for the same set of data is already running

427490
shell	bash
this autocompletion is a shell feature either bash or zsh whatever you use

427498
ubuntu	debian
if you are using bash you can look at etc bash_completion and at least on debian ubuntu you should create a file in etc bash_completion.d that specifies the completions for your program

427503
put	get
any pc i work on for more than an hour - where i have permissions to get puretext.exe onto and running - i put it in c windows double-click it once set it to autostart in its settings and always hide the icon in the task bar

427518
logout	login
a request after a session has timed out will in addition to having isnewsession true will also have a login status cookie showing the user is still logged in thus indicating the user hadn t manually chosen to logout

427518
any	set
for housekeeping purposes you should include an expiry datetime field which is set for much longer than any realistic logon period a week for example

427549
order	join
selected from tablea a inner join tableb b on a.ida b.ida and b.date 2009-01-10 order by a.id

427571
arrays	map
in addition to what people here said about processing comma-separated files i d like to note that one can extract the even or odd arrays elements using an arrays slice and or map

427610
arrays	loops
you then just need to write a loops that iterates through your input arrays two elements at a time and writes to an output arrays

427643
revision	updates
when i have something i m happy with i tag that revision and updates prod

427651
postgresql	rdbms
i haven t made sure if all rdbms s in question mssql oracle db2 postgresql mysql maybe a few others actually have such a type but at this point i just assume they do

427659
contains	any
any service contains multiple unrelated features also tend to get split up

427661
google-chrome	opera
i ve used it a lot and works just perfect for many many browsers ie6 7 opera safari google-chrome ff2 3

427686
windows-server	windows
this works in windows 2000 2003 however when i try to do this in windows-server 2008 i get access is denied

427694
command-prompt	cmd
go to visual-studio or .net cmd-prompt and type the cmd

427730
export	report
but the problem arises when i try to export the report to a pdf using the built-in option

427731
hide	next
also instead of referring to it by id pass in this.nextsibling to the toggle using dom navigation to get the next sibling which should be the span to show hide

427741
contains	elements
it also uses the fact that a function called as an event listener has the this property pointing at the elements to which it is attached hence avoiding a circular reference contains a dom elements

427746
contains	elements
in webforms i solved this by rendering the form with repeaters instead of foreach and then iterating through the question repeater checking the control id each repeater item contains a hidden questionid elements and a input with id answertype

427750
powermockito	easymock
i ve been a fan of easymock for many years now and thanks to so i came across references to powermockito and it s ability to mock constructor and static-methods both of which cause problems when retrofitting tests to a legacy codebase

427753
wordpress	blogs
the problem i am sharing a debian server with a friend and we host multiple wordpress blogs on the server

427756
superclass	subclass
why are we not able to override an instance variables of a superclass in a subclass

427759
margins	padding
use margins and padding instead

427759
margins	padding
and dont forget to reset margins and padding so you dont start with whatever the browser has as default

427792
variables	boolean
a switch is really saying pick one of these based on this variables value but an if-statement is just a series of boolean checks

427817
web-deployment	web
after further research it appears that there are problems with web-deployment projects and web application projects when merging assemblies

427821
sftp	ftp
i m currently setting up a commercial sftp server and i m just looking for some of your opinions on the set-up i m currently thinking of implementing as well as a recommendation as to what commercial secure ftp server software would be best to suit

427821
sftp	ftp
for the commercial server side of things i ve narrowed it down to gloalscape sftp w ssh http module or jscape secure ftp server - i ll be assessing the suitability of each over the weekend but if any of you have any experience with either i d love to hear about it also

427825
macvim	vim
i want cscope to open files in macvim instead of vim so i m trying to have the path to macvim as the value of the editor environment variables which is used by cscope

427830
protected	public
compiler is free to reorder public private protected members virtual base classes end up at the end of the most derived object iiuc etc

427830
malloc	free
you should make sure that memory acquired by malloc should be free with free so delete your instances like this

427837
meta-inf	jar
specifically each jar contains a meta-inf services directory so when we try to get an instance of a documentbuilderfactory via jaxp which instance we get depends upon the order in which these two jars appear in the classpath

427837
put	get
if i don t put a manifest file into the .war at all i get the standard stuff followed by the contents of web-inf lib but in an arbitrary order

427838
http	ssl
it is slightly more complicated that a simple http call though as the service is secured by ssl and wcf authentication username password

427839
getter	setter
instead of cluttering all objects with getter setter essentially making a sieve of them i d like to tell them to do stuff

427859
assign	add
i want to assign the task to some grouping of people and add all persons who belong to that grouping as well as some other people later or remove particular person from the task

427866
typedef	struct
if it is defined using a typedef you dont have to put the struct keyword in front

427866
typedef	struct
but if its not a typedef you need the struct keyword

427868
any	set
i don t see any reason why when the process is up and running it would not be listed in the local processes set

427872
formatting	printing
try to printing it without formatting now you probably have null in there

427880
silverlight	wpf
i am wrestling with a binding problem in wpf silverlight

427881
user-interface	drawing
while wpf probably does have drawing capabilities it is really a completely different user-interface toolkit than winforms

427891
lookup	any
does it exists any free web-services that kan lookup more information about a specific ip

427896
push	pull
as ajax only offers you a client-server request model normally termed pull rather than push the only way to get data from the server is via requests

427920
hide	show
show hide preexisting layers in the eps file toggle them on and off

427933
.net	wcf
then you can analyze the results using the wcf service trace viewer tool provided in .net framework 3.0 and 3.5 sdk

427937
instances	private
for legitimate inherent complexity which comes from the problem domain it may be appropriate for a class to have private instances of helper classes which take on responsibility for specific concepts

427951
httphandler	httpmodule
when i am swapping out the httphandler with one that implements irequiressessionstate the session member is available in the httpmodule and a set-cookie is sent back to the browser but later when i try to read the contents of the session in a normal aspx page none of the value i set are there

427957
actionscript	mxml
although the flex command-line compiler mxmlc can compile mxml + actionscript files into swfs i need specific insights into its capabilities via the command-line switches

427966
profiling	debugging
we are trying to debugging a random sql timeout error and did a trace with sql-server profiling on the audit login event

427980
vb.net	vb6
i ve recently moved from vb6 to vb.net and i am finally getting there with understanding the inner workings

428003
perl	c++
we re software developers not c c# c++ php perl python java .

428018
listitem	selected
since the listitem is being shared it s selected in both drop downs

428019
listitem	selected
the listitem class has a property selected which marks if the item is selected

428043
callback	methods
i don t know about the regex support in boost but check if it has a replace methods that supports callback or lambdas or some such

428053
oracle	mysql
oems original equipment manufacturers isvs independent software vendors vars value added resellers and other distributors that combine and distribute commercially licensed software with mysql software and do not wish to distribute the source code for the commercially licensed software under version 2 of the gnu general public license the gpl must enter into a commercial license agreement with oracle

428056
widget	button
the path is set in windows-xp from system control panels widget advanced tab environment button

428066
associations	model
i m wondering what the easiest most elegant way of selected attributes from join model in has_many through associations is

428116
attributes	properties
personally i d declare a class with the properties i need attributes them as i like and return an arrays or of that type

428120
python	ruby
the languages sun is trying to support with their scripting spec python ruby are up and comers largely due to their perceived productivity enhancements

428120
python	ruby
the classic implementations of python and ruby effect the same ability for c libraries

428120
python	java
consume python ruby libraries from java

428129
margins	padding
for example if you want all your paragraphs to have pink text set the text colour to pink and also set the margins padding background colour font and so on

428153
perl	c++
i m writing a c++ static library that needs to be shared among several applications one of them written in perl

428153
perl	c++
how do you make calls to an external c++ binary from a perl script

428153
perl	c++
i m pretty sure that s for writing c and c++ code directly in your perl scripts not for calling external c++ libraries

428153
perl	c++
the c++ static library is being cross-compiled for an arm processor so there will be no c++ compiler on the target machine where the perl script will be running

428156
conditional	operators
a conditional like a b is two expression connected by a logical operators

428164
perl	c++
probably not what you re thinking but how about writing a stand-alone c++ program that the perl program communicates through pipes with

428172
any	set
in any case you can use the same to set it back

428179
perl	c++
you want to look at using xs which is how perl normally interfaces with c c++ libraries

428189
linked-list	arrays
in regular code linked-list are used to get better insert performance compared to arrays no need to move all elements around

428205
memcached	apc
to streamline the process a bit you can always configure drupal s caching there are some addon modules and then you could go with something like apc or memcached

428266
authentication	login
btw in my case i do redirect to the login page but i check to see if the user is authentication and if so display a message that they don t have the correct permissions

428267
children	tree
but i m wondering if there are better proven effective ways to do this such as adding a methods to collapse the entire children tree of references for this and target and then examine the results less pressure on the stack

428271
bmp	png
when i need multiple icons i embedded the png bmp or whatever image type it is as a image resource in the application

428279
contains	set
you either have to set this to false to achieve the cursor for all contains items or you have to specify the attributes usehandcursor and buttonmode for all elements

428279
mouseover	mouseout
however the side effect of settings mousechildren to false is that all mouse events mouseover mouseout click ... on child elements will no longer work

428279
mouseover	mouseout
use the mouseover and mouseout events to set the cursor programmatically

428282
implements	extends
i do however want to do my best to force anybody who wants to implements igenerator to extends basegenerator as that s the only way to properly combine two generators

428295
internet-explorer	firefox
alternatively you can try to host acrobat within your application using the plugin api the same way internet-explorer firefox etc does

428308
contains	set
i have a set of word documents that contains a lot of non-embedded images in them

428308
python	java
how can i go about doing this in java or python

428310
abstract-class	subclassing
you need one interface concrete implementation abstract-class and several subclassing of the abstract-class

428359
xsd	xml
is there an ide out there that can generate xml from xsd

428360
contains	set
how i would attack it since i haven t explored jquery is to set your a tag which does have a hover methods to display block with all of the attendant rules you would set as if it were a div make it expand to fill the contains div and then of course add your rounded corner rules to the hover

428368
google-chrome	firefox
the site renders correctly in firefox google-chrome ie 7 and safari but the design appears to be complete borked in ie 6

428369
reflection	runtime
and since it uses reflection to do code generation instead of reflection at runtime you ll likely see better performance

428380
global-variables	call
each global-variables must also be added independently via its own call to taskvaradd

428384
triggers	insert
when the triggers does find an illegal insert update however what is the best way to prevent the illegal inserts updates from happening

428391
triggers	insert
create a triggers on insert into the employers table that inserts into the materialized table all rows that match the newly inserted employer

428410
folderbrowserdialog	openfiledialog
to keep the user-interface consistent it would be nice if it is possible to extend the openfiledialog or the folderbrowserdialog

428419
xsd	xml
how to generate sample xml documents from their dtd or xsd

428427
selected	checkbox
and sum up the selected checkbox into haveaccessbit field

428452
icollection	ienumerable
we recommend using collection readonlycollection or keyedcollection for output and properties and interfaces ienumerable icollection ilist for inputs

428484
put	get
this put me back to trying to get it to work with osql and an exec task.

428487
cakephp	drupal
a better approach would be to use a framework like cakephp or a platform like drupal that already has user and role functionality built-in that you can take advantage of

428497
contains	set
hopefully it will work for your data set too whatever it contains

428506
text-editor	editor
if you re frustrated at whatever editor your ide is using eclipse jumps to mind then either use vi as an external editor or get used to the text-editor that the ide uses

428513
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

428518
postback	ajax
this may or may not help you out but you can at least determine if the postback is an asynchronous one meaning that it was likely sent via ajax

428529
worksheet	excel
on this project i am working on right now one of the newest feature requests is to output expense information which is stored into expense report that matches an excel worksheet they already use for all of their expense reporting

428529
worksheet	excel
i was curious if there was a way that i could take this excel worksheet with all of its layout already done and just fill in the parts that our system tracks and then serve it up as an .xls file to the user without having to do excel automation or any other method that requires excel to be installed on the server

428534
populate	row
however regardless of that since the datawindow issues a series of inserts updates and deletes that are targeted at only one row if this value is populate i wouldn t expect it would ever be more than one no matter how many sql statements the datawindow issues

428549
contains	set
you could even control a set of allowed values using a nested contains and tags see the ant manual

428573
environment	building
does anyone know of any good tools utilities for managing web-config files between different building deployment environment

428610
contains	any
hardly any email clients will allow html forms in email and some spam systems specifically block and delete email that contains forms

428624
environment	execution
in essence a closure is a block of code which can be executed at a later time but which maintains the environment in which it was first created - it can still use the local-variables etc of the methods which created it even after that methods has finished execution

428625
configuration	environment
i like to use a build task to automate changing the configuration file for the desired environment

428638
export	report
since you have a specific format that the document needs to be in things might be a bit harder but the way i have done things before in the past is to export the data that needs to be displayed on the report to an xml file either saved on disk or in the memory and then apply an xsl transform to convert things over to the correctly formatted document that excel can load

428643
vbscript	basic
how do you specify hex values in a visual basic 6 vbscript source

428674
ostream	std
note that the reference must be of type std ostream not std ofstream since std cout is an std ostream so you must use the least common denominator

428678
vbscript	vba
vbscript vba vb6 and lower

428735
istream	ostream
cout is an object of type ostream whereas cin is of type istream and i m not sure that one inherits from the other

428747
order	add
add the order to their related customers

428755
windows-vista	windows
having said that i believe that windows 7 shares a similar kernel to the windows 2008 server and windows-vista sp 1 kernels as well as the same or similar security models

428755
windows-vista	windows
windows 7 is designed to run on the same hardware as windows-vista and to be compatible with applications and device drivers that work with windows-vista.

428756
windows-xp	windows
among it s goal one is to give you a layer of abstraction on the system below so usually you can run a .net application on windows-xp or windows vista without having to mess around with low level apis

428769
children	nodes
in the case where you never add self-referencing to be defined later objects your data structure describes a directed acyclic graph where each instance of the of the iamcircular class describes a nodes with a set of direct successor nodess children

428779
abstract-class	base-class
provide an abstract base-class with a default implementation and then have all your concrete classes inherit that abstract-class

428793
order	add
rather than brute forcing every combination of invoice totals you could iterate through the outstanding invoices in order of date issued and simply add each invoice amount to a running total which you compare with the target figure

428799
show	next
selected needed classes in the show dialog box and click next

428813
development-environment	virtualbox
i carry a virtualbox hard drive file that contains the whole development-environment for our project

428826
hide	show
have a little bit of javascript that runs on document ready that hide the button and show the link

428833
function-call	inline
note that if the function doesn t have a name then you can wraps it in as an inline function-call

428842
contains	set
i ve put the contains workbook in a trusted location set all of the security settings to their minimum values and trusted programmatic access to my object model

428843
command-prompt	cmd
here is a 1-line perl cmd that does what you want just type it from the cmd-prompt windows

428855
linux	unix
or is that too linux y unix y for you

428862
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari it looks like i expected it to - the windows is as wide as editorbody and closebutton sits in the top right corner

428865
profiling	trace
have you tried collecting basic information with perfmon and profiling trace to see how many connections are made memory stats and other interesting things

428910
value	field
you have a spaces in the password field s name so the value is being stored in _post password not _post password

428968
expression	evaluation
in contrast the ternary operator in c# is a language construct that prevents the evaluation of the second parameter if the expression of the ternary is true

428976
buffering	streaming
you can redirect cout to write into another streaming buffering

428978
value	field
just put the following around any value that are inserting into int field

429005
javascript	dom
the only reason i m interested in doing this is because of the huge pain it is for front-end developers every time there s a dom structure css change so you now have to go figure out where in the javascript html building process you may have to update

429014
convention	standards
i have a table in sql-server 2000 standards edition called dbo.t668 don t blame me for the naming convention

429017
getter	setter
one thing in java with getter and setter is that with the upper-casing your variables end up having to be

429017
getter	setter
because the generated getter and setter in eclipse anyway

429022
hide	show
is there a way of globally tapping into some event that i can use to show hide that notification if there is an active call

429035
export	report
my goal place all of my fields on my report around 25 of them and export the data to excel

429045
switching	screens
do you see it switching on the screens or the power indicator

429050
url-encoding	url
and generate an absolute url without the fuss of messing with url-encoding prepending the protocol host context path etc

429072
grouping	sorting
this works great when you want to do filtering grouping or sorting on the client side without re-requesting the data in a different form

429076
marquee	button
in my code when a button is clicked the progress bar is set to marquee and then my backgroundworker is called but when the backgroundworker is called the progress bar freezes or disappears

429085
hide	show
the beforesend handler can be used to show a hidden div contains your loading text or image while complete handler will be used to hide it no matter whether the call succeeds or not

429086
annotations	mapping
i ve implemented an xml mapping system using a gwt code generator so the code to translate between xml and javascript objects is automatically generated based on the objects themselves using annotations in the java classes

429095
temporary	copy
this looks very similar to greg s solution and conceptually they are similar in that behind the scenes both use volatility to ensure freshness of values and take a temporary copy in order to apply a conditional before using the value

429095
any	set
because this is an atomic operation so if one thread sees the value as null it will also set it to the possiblenewball reference before any other threads get a chance to read it

429141
windows-vista	windows
i am using windows-vista and writing my program in c++ using straight windows api no mfc

429142
base-class	inherited
override is useful when you inherited from a base-class and wish to extend or modify its functionality

429143
constructor	object
perhaps the constructor of a class should only create the object if the properties are initialized to appropriate values

429149
entity-framework	nhibernate
now with this sudden wave of mapping layers like subsonic entity-framework nhibernate etc should i still be using my favourite pocos

429149
webforms	asp.net
i do this mostly and when working with asp.net webforms 99 times end up using objectdatasource for binding to controls and the features specific to each type

429150
key-value	key
if the in out key field in the personnel table contains a key-value then the corresponding record in the in out table is located and updated with the latest timestamp from the raw table in the outtimestamp field

429150
value	field
the in out key field value is then removed from the personnel table

429174
javascript	dom
recently i battled thru a number of memory leaks in internet explorer caused by this dom destroy-and-create code most of them having to do with circular references between javascript objects and dom objects and the javascript library we are using quietly keeping a reference to every js object created with new element ... until the page is unloaded

429174
javascript	dom
so my question is is there any way in javascript to tell the browser to pause js execution and re-render the dom

429174
javascript	dom
however this seems a little bit like re-creating threading in a javascript environment which seems like it could get very complicated what if another ajax data request fires while i m still re-creating the table s dom nodes

429183
enumerator	any
i agree that you should pass ienumerator as an input that way you support any enumerator collection

429192
websphere	ibm
websphere is a brand name applied to a number of ibm products

429192
jar	war
if that isn t an option you might want to look at making one of your dependencies an ear project utility jar and configure module classloading with a parent_last classloading policy on the war

429215
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
i started a topic on the subject of whether or not it is a good idea to proactively throw an argumentnullexception or to let the runtime throw a nullreferenceexception

429217
value	field
when the form is submitted i think you would determine the value of the link_id from the field number

429233
application-pool	was
it turned out that it was a matter of different .net versions running on the same application-pool

429236
derived-class	base-class
it means that if you have a virtual function in a base-class you can write a function with the same signature in the derived-class

429238
derived-class	base-class
in this way a base-class provides interface and the derived-class provides implementation

429251
selenium-ide	selenium
so when i record with the selenium-ide what it does is the equivalent of telling selenium to type nothing

429268
business-process	bpm
but to answer directly a bpm tool is appropriate when a business wants to automate a portion or all of a business-process

429268
integration	bpm
transactional bpm is targeted at automating system-level processes - mostly integration

429268
integration	bpm
human-centric bpm is targeted obviously at processes that involve human integration - mostly document or structured unstructured data management

429284
websphere	ibm
in ibm websphere application server 6.1 web modules have their own class loaders that are usually used in the parent_first mode

429284
jar	war
this can be done by placing the xerces jar in the root of the ear file if you have one or prepare the ear file with xerces.jar and your war file in the root

429284
websphere	ibm
you can find more information about this in the ibm websphere application server v6.1 system management and configuration

429293
csv	xml
it could be an xml file a simple csv file fixed length file etc

429303
forwarding	port
alternatively as you ve presumably got root access on the server in question just run tomcat on a non-privileged port and then use iptables tricks to forwarding inbound requests from the privileged port to the one that tomcat is actually listening on

429310
stderr	stdout
you can redirect the stdout stderr standary out put error stream of a process if you are the one starting it

429330
worksheet	excel
for example if you un-maximise a worksheet in excel but not the main windows it becomes a windows in a larger workspace

429339
execution	restart
the application-pool doesn t have to be restart the appdomain related to your execution code has to be recycled

429341
any	set
for long-running programs days months etc where i have loads of load copy dump cycles i garbage-collect using exit and exec and where it s otherwide unfeasible i simply pack up my data-structures using storable and file descriptors using and - usually with an environment variables set like and you may need something similar even if you don t have any leaks of your own simply because perl is leaking small chunks that your system s malloc can t figure out how to give back

429355
search-engine	web-crawler
that would be an implementation detail invisible to the search-engine web-crawler and any web browser accessing the resource

429366
packaging	building
also the tools can actually be used standalone to perform the various functions scripting building comparing upgrading and packaging if you want it s just that using them all together provides a full end-to-end process thus making the overall value greater than the sum of it s parts

429368
any	set
any windows you want to appear as a child of the parent just set the mdiparent to the form you have ismdicontainer set to true for

429383
shutdown	restart
note this windows service hosted wcf services so in addition without restart the service and so don t shutdown down wcf clients

429391
minimum	max
see compute the minimum min or maximum max of two integers without branching and comparing floating point numbers

429393
.when	ready
to solve this problem you need to either turn off cross thread checking so that the exception-handling is not thrown simple but not recommended or change how you use the control so that the main work happens elsewhere and the control just raises events .when things are ready

429394
core-animation	catransform3d
the uiview folding can be approximated using core-animation perhaps by adding perspective to the catransform3d of the uiview s underlying layer to distort the uiview into a trapezoid which gets sucked into the trash can

429416
javascript	dom
i m writing a piece of code that requires the dom of a website to remain frozen while arbitrary javascript runs

429416
javascript	dom
i know in javascript there are a base number of functions that can modify the dom

429416
javascript	dom
while it s easy to do this for the document object the dom modification functions can be called from many different javascript objects

429416
javascript	dom
how can i protect the dom from modification from arbitrary javascript

429437
python	c++
i would like to use some python library like pypdf or reportlab but even some c c++ lib should go well for me

429443
account	api
i am writing a django app and i would like an account to be created on our google apps hosted email using the provisioning api whenever an account is created locally

429444
digits	short
the short answer to that question is when you can t tolerate the performance overhead of nsdecimalnumber and you don t care about small rounding errors because you re never dealing with more than a few digits of precision

429499
web-services	webserver
web-services are stateless so they can safely be shared between connections and threads on a webserver

429505
prototype	strict
with those arguments you ll be able to extend via prototype again and the compiler won t use strict mode

429527
asp.net-mvc	webforms
ok i m an asp.net-mvc newbie coming from a webforms background so please excuse any ignorance here

429527
selected	checkbox
each table row consists of 3 pieces of information a checkbox some text describing the row and a dropdown list allowing the user to selected the appropriate permission for the application

429550
telnet	ssh
people have been doing this for years using telnet ssh for remoting a cli that runs on the server

429588
export	csv
i just don t know how to export the data to a csv or excel file

429620
macros	vba
this would be one of the simpler solutions you can implement the entire thing as a word macros vba

429651
instances	destroy
this is a service with only one instances which will not be destroy between calls

429657
convention	standards
even if the two forms are equivalent i find some class- new to be much more clear as it follows the standards convention for calling a methods on a module and in perl the new methods is not special - a constructor could be called anything and new could do anything although of course we generally expect it to be a constructor

429683
jcifs	ntlm
after some research found out that jcifs implementation of ntlm is very hacky as described by the jcifs devs and they re removing support in the next major versioning of jcifs

429684
sql-server	oracle
i have a sql-server 2005 database that is linked to an oracle

429702
for-loop	arrays
one bug i can see though you re skipping the last element in your arrays in your for-loop by subtracting 1 from the count

429727
foundation	cocoa
as chris says objective-c is the foundation and native language of cocoa and many of its paradigms are inextricably linked with that lineage

429727
python	ruby
although these features are available in other dynamic languages such as ruby and python there is enough of a mismatch in the language models that you will have to at least understand objective-c to understand cocoa

429727
python	java
i often tell people it will take them a day to learn objective-c coming from c c++ java or lisp scheme or any of the newer dynamic languages such as ruby and python

429756
fadeout	fadein
i need a function that i can call when somthing is done for example a fadeout fadein and so on.

429774
groovy	java
i have a couple projects hosted that are using java groovy to do oauth

429774
web-services	api
if you are relatively inexperienced with rest you haven t built a full scale web api yet i would recommend that you buy or better get your boss to restful web-services by richardson ruby

429779
linux	unix
java probably uses sockets internally for lots of things - they might be unix netlink under linux or some other type of socket

429799
constructor	object
let s see the use of an object basic methods its constructor

429808
32-bit	64bit
also note that modern cpus use the same fp unit for both single 32-bit and double 64bit fp numbers so unless you are trying to save memory storing a lot of floats there s really no reason to favor float over double

429810
64bit	x86
on 64bit systems the x86 key usually with more entries is

429817
ruby	php
obviously it doesn t integrate as well with php as it does with ruby but you can still use it for a lot of stuff

429849
base-class	inherited
i don t know the actual type unless i try dynamic_cast but i do know that the object inherited from the base-class type

429859
http-get	get
get rest api methodss should be using the http-get methods i m not sure if being restful is your goal just thought i would point that out

429863
private-members	object
my reasoning goes that if you have an inheritance relation between two classes and there are private-members then it is a very strong indicative that you should factor the private parts out into a separate object

429864
any	set
any ideas for which permission s to set to achieve this

429867
visitor-pattern	visitor
you basically want the visitor-pattern but with only one type of visitor

429871
value	field
have you tried casting the value of the field to int or perhaps int64 as you are reading it

429897
implements	extends
i am thinking of implements an extension methods on object or perhaps extends datetimeconverter

429904
document	element
another thing to look at not to append each element individually to the document

429943
scientific-notation	digits
if it guesses wrong you end up with digits strings converted to scientific-notation

429956
ruby-on-rails	rspec
in our ruby-on-rails work cucumber stories do not substitute for rspec unit tests

429956
cucumber	webrat
if you take advantage of webrat writing cucumber can be fast and painless for a lot of your basic functionality

429959
calendar	daypilot
daypilot is a good solution if you want a calendar api that you can develop your own back-end for

429963
order	join
in order to not to make this join everytime since usually there isn t only one detail there are more than one i choose not to use id column and i make code pk of detail1

429977
assign	add
if you start with several students currently not assign you add an extra dummy section as their startingpoint

429987
contains	sorted
i currently use gzip compression for some very large-files which contains sorted data

429993
instances	private
that is i need to change some private field or call a private methods or create an instances of some internal class in a library i have no power to change

430000
value	field
so a field value maybe ford muffler and to exclude it from a basic query i would do

430002
pointers	stack
by stack is size of an integer you mean stack pointers is the size of an integer

430003
javascript	dom
any specific reason for trying to parse html with a regex rather than loading it into a dom or using the dom available in the browser through javascript

430004
value	field
note also that we want to display elements from table a at least once with null value for any field not found in tables b c possibly many times if there are multiple corresponding entries in table b

430016
pointers	stack
in that case you can put the object on the heap and put a pointers to it on stack

430021
javascript	dom
the only reason i m interested in doing this is because of the huge pain it is for front-end developers every time there s a dom structure css change so you now have to go figure out where in the javascript html building process you may have to update

430021
javascript	dom
converting the data to dom manipulation is best left to a javascript function defined in the master page itself

430028
display	width
is there any way to keep the items always aligned in firefox 3 to ensure that if someone s browser is at an odd width there are no display oddities

430038
put	get
if you put objects that are larger than the remaining stack size onto the stack you ll get a stack overflow and your application will crash

430041
variables	boolean
i ve done this with the datagridview winforms control to unset a boolean variables so i could have a companion column move when its complement was moved

430048
linux	unix
i doubt anyway that there are any kind of leaks in this thing as sockets are very used in linux unix world and this kind of problem would bubble up very quicky

430049
pointers	stack
stack pointers points to the top

430049
pointers	stack
both are pushed on stack this moves stack pointers up

430049
pointers	stack
for these a positioning is reserved on stack but first we save stack pointers so we know where the variables start by counting up and the parameters are found by counting down

430055
reflection	runtime
i find reflection combined with runtime class loading indispensable for implementing plugins

430066
pointers	stack
if you create a large stack object that fits in the currently-available space it just uses that space by bumping up or down stack pointers

430068
pointers	stack
at the beginning of the function stack frame is set up by decrementing stack pointers by the number of bytes aligned to the word size required by the function s local variables

430068
pointers	stack
all local variables are then accessed via a pointers to this stack frame ebp on x86

430071
moss	wss
for the most part my organization is happy with wss 3.0 no upgrading to moss with one exception-handling there is really just one form we d like to put up somehow

430072
icalendar	rrule
if you re using an icalendar enable library your schema is varchar 255 with rrule value in it

430085
getter	setter
they are accessible both for read write you dont need setter getter

430089
classnotfoundexception	noclassdeffounderror
in java can class.forname ever return null or will it always throw a classnotfoundexception or noclassdeffounderror if the class can t be located

430092
classnotfoundexception	noclassdeffounderror
it won t throw a noclassdeffounderror but it may throw classnotfoundexception

430096
account	api
there are api s going to from .net and gmail perhaps you could use a central google account as the conduit

430103
revision	svn
an effect of this is that you get svn revision numbers per module

430110
rar	zip
still i think the best solution would be to split your file into chunks of your choice and then compressing it with some archiver like zip or rar which support random access to individual files in the archive

430154
document	element
step 2 in the body of your document create an element with id map

430160
selected	textbox
make sure that the regular expressions icon is selected the third one along under the replacement textbox

430165
unsigned	integer
before the pointer stands the size of the following arrays which is a 32 64 bit integer dont know if signed or unsigned

430173
subclassing	base-class
in fact if your base-class and all the subclassing implements then your base-class can do this

430188
order	add
i want to be able to edit add new feeds here and retrieve those feeds in the same order - this was a big source of my confusion in my prior attempt

430189
json	xml
when considering json vs xml you should be aware of xml specific attack vectors as well

430190
shell	bash
i am assuming bash shell

430201
c++	lua
usually there s some form of javadoc-esque system involved for api documentation - luadoc for lua code or doxygen for c c++ sources those are our two big technologies

430234
contains	elements
contains a collections of all elements with name-attribute thename

430238
contains	set
without knowing more of your requirements it s hard to be more specific but as an example the string namespace class could be a key to a set of actions that depend on knowing the namespace and a single class that it contains class interface could a key to the set of actions that deal with a single class and a single interface it implements etc

430238
traversal	parent
the tree traversal algorithm could keep track of its own context parent node current node etc. form a key based on where it is in the tree retrieve the action set for that key and then fire all of those actions giving each an arguments structure that provided the actual nodes corresponding to the key pattern

430240
account	api
it has a cleaner api was rewritten to take into account apis available on modern browsers and interacts better with closure compiler

430261
variables	boolean
in many languages you can t say if variables because conditions will only take boolean values from boolean expressions

430261
python	perl
so python c# c perl on the continuum

430271
order	add
someone else later might just come and add a value somewhere in the middle that would be out of order

430272
buffering	capture
a very simplistic system would use output buffering to capture the dynamic contents and write them to a file

430288
constructor	object
the indirect object syntax is frowned upon for good reasons but that s got nothing to do with constructor

430288
constructor	object
if you re supplying arguments to the constructor or you re taking the result of the constructor and immediately calling methods on it if you don t care about keeping the object around it s simpler to say

430303
attributes	properties
i use attributes on properties to guser-interfacede the user-interface creation

430304
authentication	login
opensso runs as a java web app but it can authentication users against ad do windows desktop sso aka spnego aka kerberos to authentication users from their windows login with no additional username password step interoperate with adfs via ws-federation and protect web apps running on iis via a policy agent

430314
selected	checkbox
what does the code look like on both sides html-browser and c-cgi app for forms when you can selected multiple deletions through checkbox

430319
memcached	apc
have you considered use memcached or apc for the session data

430323
pointers	stack
stack allocations just offset a pointers and possibly allocate new memory-pages if stack has grown large enough

430323
linux	unix
under linux unix macos darwin bsd you can artificially constrain the heap or the stack to whatever arbitrary values you want at runtime

430323
tcsh	bash
but it will run just fine if he first invokes unlimit stacksize tcsh or ulimit -ss unlimited bash

430323
linux	unix
under linux unix macos darwin bsd it is possible to change the maximum stack size limitations programmatically as well as limit tcsh or ulimit bash

430324
perl	ruby
a little more context i m writing an email to the professor asking if the course can be switched to ruby or python from perl

430328
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
all of the built-in dialog use the shell api s that correspond to their action printdialog openfiledialog savefiledialog etc.

430338
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux based os as explained here

430347
.when	ready
i have a situation where i m starting a number of objects that .when they are ready to handle some input data call a handler

430353
arrays	loops
then you can use your choice of method to loops through the arrays and checking if there are any custom attributes

430364
search-engine	seo
the whole search-engine optimisation industry is a farce and this is coming from someone who has been paid more than once as a seo consultant

430366
fogbugz	trac
i wasn t particuarly excited about the way the import tool mapped the trac fields to the fogbugz fields

430371
declarative	imperative
of course i should mention the good support for properties events and nice declarative - or imperative - data binding too as part of this world conquering strategy.

430374
twitter	last.fm
there is no specific api that i need to work on but i would be interested to have a play with services such as twitter flickr google-maps facebook last.fm etc

430376
32-bit	x86
now windows-vista x64 decided to put all 32-bit files under c program files x86

430386
antivirus	security
i was searching about security programs made using c# like firewall parental control antivirus anti-spyware etc

430397
python	ruby
maybe give ruby or python a look as i ve seen many people get started using those

430417
push	pull
which kind of shoots using a dvcs in the foot in the first place barring being able to commit locally and push pull to others prior to pushing to the main repository

430420
player	movie
in essence i m looking for the best practices of how to write a java movie player or for a library that has already done it

430420
platform	gpl
the project is open source gpl and i would like it to be as simple and cross platform as possible

430429
cross-compiling	toolchain
it also includes scripting that automatically set up a proper toolchain needed for cross-compiling

430435
environment	building
some compilers offer macros to indicate a windows building environment

430435
environment	building
if you know the environment you ll be building in from the makefile then you can usually pass in the #define on the command-line like g++ -d __win32__ yourfile.c

430440
database-table	mysql
that implies 8 boolean tinyint for mysql columns in your database-table and 8 getter setter methods in your object

430450
implements	final
class is final and doesn t implements extends a class outside of the assembly

430451
addition	division
for example addition is closed over the integers but division isn t 4 2 is integral but 5 2 isn t

430451
addition	division
so addition of integers is somehow complete in a sense that division isn t

430453
contains	any
otherwise if your code contains windows specific system calls its simply not going to run on any other platform

430476
scheme	let
first of all let s define a measure of the goodness of a scheme

430485
contains	set
the issue is that if a hidden this way contains a table which uses border-collapse collapse and has a border set on it cells that border still shows through the hidden on ie

430505
hide	show
and hide or show the two containers as you choose

430509
required	checked
we use something much like the last option except with a file_exists checked before the required

430523
python	c++
if you can already run them using c++ then you can try using swig to generate python wrappers for the c++ code you ve written making it callable from python

430526
triggers	insert
in this way the triggers is able to record updates insert and deletes made to the fields in that particular table

430528
perl	c++
for a complex system - think perl python ruby a c compiler a c++ compiler a dbms - you d be laughed out of court with a 3 year throw-it-all-away cycle

430553
32-bit	64bit
still with a bit of kludging operations on unsigned values up to 32-bit aren t tooo bad and most people don t need unsigned 64bit division or comparison

430555
arrays	loops
the data are generated once prior to any rendering stored in two arrays for use in the rendering loops

430555
contains	set
for direct rendering the entire data set is rendered in a single glbegin glend block with a loop contains a single call each to glcolor3fv and glvertex3fv

430573
webforms	asp.net
i have an asp.net webforms application with a menu control

430585
superclass	subclass
if you put your annotations on the getter rather than the field when you override the methods in the subclass the annotations placed there will be used rather than the ones in the superclass

430586
solaris	linux
i m not linux shell solaris macos expert so someone else might be able to tell you what standard environment variables exist in those oses

430607
having	select
having said that these are probably the same table and you have response_to_id and response_to_uid and that makes lots of code simpler and makes the recent tab a single select as well

430608
contains	set
you can try to set the action url simply to download.php and have two hidden fields contains the file and properfilename parameters like this

430672
constructor	private
i have made copy constructor as private so that compiler will alert when someone tries to pass it by value

430680
shell	bash
my discussion assumes that scripts are written in bourne korn or posix bash shell notations

430680
signals	sigpipe
for security use non-predictable file names in a non-public directory. the second line ensures that the rm and exit commands are executed if the shell receives any of the signals sighup 1 sigint 2 sigquit 3 sigpipe 13 or sigterm 15

430684
constructor	private
i have made copy constructor as private .

430684
constructor	private
a way i don t know if it s a good way to prevent that is to declare the constructor and or the destructor and or the delete operator of the t class as private and say that simple_ptr is a friend of the t class so that only the simple_ptr class can create and or destroy and or delete instances of t

430689
firefox	opera
but for safari and opera i tried the linkrel css hack technique and it failed -- firefox was loading and interpreting the opera and safari stylesheets when i thought it might fail on the linkrel tag

430689
safari	opera
so i had to switch it to an inline css and use an import url call but that failed because opera and safari wouldn t interpret the import url call

430689
safari	opera
well the current arrangement in the file below works but it means that the stylesheet for opera and safari is loading with all browsers it s just not interpreted except by opera and safari

430689
safari	opera
i d like to know how to get the linkrel or the import working for opera and safari instead

430697
internet-explorer	firefox
for most browsers including internet-explorer navigator firefox and opera the supported and sanctioned way of doing this is to use dde

430705
any	set
any cross-compiling environment targeting win32 should set this too

430707
perl	php
how could i do this with perl php or any other unix based app which i would invoke with the exec function from php

430710
shell	bash
bin bash not bin sh as sh is the posix invocation of any shell

430717
python	java
you want to do this in java or python

430717
python	java
in openoffice you can insert java or python code as a makro

430721
constructor	private
so it s a common practice to define copy constructor and assignment operator as private for your task

430754
integer	numeric
even with the simplified integer model most java programmers don t know how the basic numeric types behave - just read the book java puzzlers to see what misconceptions you might hold

430763
python	java
ok i ve tested this in java sorry that s more my schtick than python but the principle is the same

430767
python	java
i currently know java python and some c but wanted to open this up to any established language

430780
environment	building
building this is the environment in which the program is compiled

430780
environment	building
if you are cross-compiling the build and host environment can be completely different this is common when building embedded applications but not very common when building desktop server apps and you typically cannot run the compiled binary on the system used to compile it

430780
environment	building
otherwise the host environment must be compatible with the build environment for example building an application on xp which will run on vista

430780
c-preprocessor	macros
c-preprocessor macros can not be used to tell you the details of the host system what you are running on

430787
installation	building
do you have an example of how to use ant for the building file ivy to resolve dependencies compile a .war file and deploy it to a local at the moment tomcat installation

430810
filesystems	fat
for example the root filesystems could be case-sensitive but you can have a case-insensitive filesystems an usb stick with a fat filesystems on it mounted somewhere

430810
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
also what if the user copies the data from say a case-sensitive to a case-insensitive filesystems

430810
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
this works on the original case-insensitive filesystems but not on the case-sensitive system

430811
arrays	loops
loops over the arrays object and echo variables and values

430814
click	mouse
on the left side expand your computer name then click web sites right click in the right side put your mouse over new and selected web site...

430828
json	xml
i would recommend trying out rabbitmq amqp and using protocol buffers xml or some other data format such as json to taste

430847
python	c++
voicecode claims that you can program in any language python and c c++ using its tools

430849
listitem	listbox
i would like my listbox to number each listitem using its index + 1

430856
listboxitem	selected
moreover this number will change as the user selected different listboxitem

430862
json	csv
it s not hard and if you do it that code can be expanded for other serialisation formats json csv xlsx ...

430869
constructor	object
but if you want to base one object off of another like a time stamp from a date time a constructor seems natural

430872
vbscript	vb.net
i think vbscript vb.net is good choice

430883
visualvm	jvm
visualvm great tool for monitoring your jvm instances

430883
testng	junit
testng is more flexible than junit and have multiple advantages like support for parallel testing for example

430889
.when	ready
instead you need to create a reset event for each thread and then .when you re ready loop through them all and use set

430935
haskell	lisp
it is the same reason why functional programming becomes more and more popular haskell f# lisp c# linq mapreduce ... functional programming makes parallelization easier

windows-xp	windows
i am using the windows-xp and sql-server 2005 in client side and windows server 2003 and sql-server 2005 in .net server

430956
windows-xp	windows
how can i solve this problem and also give the correct information for setting the msdtc in windows-xp and windows server 2003

430960
firefox	opera
i m going to assume you ve tried using the same stylesheets for webkit firefox opera allready and that this is the last resort because you re doing something strange

430963
scp	ssh
if you are using linux without plesk you want to upload the php files with winscp and over ssh scp

430965
continuous-integration	teamcity
teamcity continuous-integration which i love for the delayed checkin and remote runs never ever check in a broken branch anymore

430969
inlining	inline
â -noâ inline disable inlining

430972
hardware	monitor
firstly the hardware is slow it can only extract a certain number of bits of entropy in a given time period from whatever physical process it is monitor

430972
mersenne-twister	generator
most stock rng implementations mersenne-twister do not have sufficient degrees of freedom to be able to generator every possible shuffle of a 52-card deck from a given initial state this is something i tried to explain in a previous blog post

430973
compression	streaming
i know that there are many free and not so free compression libraries out there but for the project i am working on i need to be able to take file data from a streaming and put it into some kind zip or pack file but without compression because i will need to access these files quickly without having to wait for them to decompress

431017
random-seed	generator
we ve been using the protego r210-usb trng and the non-usb version before that as random-seed generator in casino applications with java.security.securerandom

431020
meta-inf	jar
unzip all jars purge all meta-inf directories jar and sign them again

431022
versioning	upgrade
we use a particular versioning until we re ready or compelled to upgrade

431022
publishing	release
you could publishing release or peg branches tag svn to help with all this

431027
host	dns
note if you use domain name restrictions the server has to perform a reverse dns lookup for each request to check the host s registered domain name

431043
library-project	libs
in short model the development and maintenance of your internal libs after a successful open source libs-project

431045
driver	kernel
most of engineers working on it have eliminated any reasonable possibility of a bug in the program itself so they re starting to assign blame to a possible hardware problem but i suspect there must be a software problem in either a linux kernel module or device driver

431045
driver	kernel
what is suspect is that a kernel module or device driver in order to do some floating-point calculations is doing fxsave fxrstor in a manner that is unsafe on smp systems

431045
driver	kernel
i m not an expert at linux kernel hacking or device driver development but i m reading that the reentrancy rules have been changing a lot

431045
driver	kernel
so my question is are there any known linux driver or kernel bugs that fit that description

431049
duplicates	elements
the principle of least surprise says that you should duplicates the arrays so that users of your api don t have to care that its implementation involves the side effect of reordering elements

431050
value	field
and then in the foreach statement i would iterate every field and get the field name and value and format it into json

431072
.net	wcf
it provides interoperability with the microsoft .net wcf stack and integration with spring netbeans maven2 and ant

431074
associations	model
i would model it with an entry associations class as follows

431081
driver	kernel
when is a kernel or driver module allowed to use floating-point registers

431128
cfengine	puppet
i ve heard good things about puppet as matli suggested and cfengine which are both listed at

431162
contains	any
as far as i know any html tag may contains any number of nested tags

431163
.net	wcf
another option would be to use something like the windows communication foundation wcf or .net remoting to send events between the processes

431165
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
i can force my app to go to landscape mode for a view using navigationcontroller and viewcontroller like this

431171
if-statement	loops
when i first started learning programming with qbasic the whole idea of flow control using if-statement and loops was great

431221
defined	declare
the order of initialization is defined in the specifications to be the textual order in which the variables are declare - but it becomes undefined when two variables are in different files contributing to a partials class

431225
value	field
however if you swap the order of the field they will also swap value

431251
scala	java
the examples are in scala but you should be able to apply the same general concepts to java

431263
hide	show
if the form has a lot of controls calling show then hide against the form in start up will also preload the forms controls further reducing the time it takes to subsequently display the form

431268
having	select
if you re going to have a lot of select boxes that you want to allow to use as redirects without having to define them independently try something similar to

431297
transfer-encoding	chunked
if you want to start sending data before you know what the content-length is you can instead use the chunked transfer-encoding

431297
transfer-encoding	chunked
the chunked transfer-encoding says i m going to keep giving you a bunch of data in chunks and i can tell you how long each chunk is but i don t know how many chunks there are until i m done. for example google uses the chunked transfer-encoding

431302
breakpoints	sigabrt
you could install a new handler for sigabrt and place a breakpoints there and then at least examine the current call stack.

431302
32-bit	64bit
as an aside the reason that lld is used instead of just d is that nsinteger changes size depending on whether you re compiling for a 32-bit or 64bit target

431302
32-bit	64bit
by promoting the nsinteger to the long long type and using the lld specifier you make sure that you won t have truncation issues in the future if you compile for 64bit and your nsinteger value requires more than 32-bit to store

431311
constructor	private
here in init private method which is called from constructor or in main function

431314
integer	short
short usually means a short integer not a single-precision floating-point number

431319
dialog	pop-up
in most cases the only thing you can really do with an exception-handling is log it and abort the operation serve the user an error page in a web app or pop-up a friendly this program has crashed sorry dialog and exit

431330
any	set
the results are then wrapped inside an asp panels and the visible property set on page load depending whether you want to display any results or not

431344
required	checked
as vb6 seemingly does not support any dependency checked itself i can t think of any purely ide based solution which does not required the double-bookkeeping you mentioned

431359
javascript	dom
control is really granular great for seo and crafting the dom to play well with javascript

431386
turing-machines	automata
in particular software runs over at least stack automata if not over turing-machines

431386
required	checked
in addition software verification without manual abstraction a-la model checked would required you to solve the halting-problem

431408
arrays	loops
for loops + arrays did it for me

431409
authentication	login
does it allow me to use the hosting web-site s login as authentication and sessionization for my web application once someone has logged into the third-party they are automatically authenticated for mine if it s built on opensocial

431410
specifications	w3c
the xml specifications requires that the system identifier in a doctype may be used to retrieve the document s dtd i link to the annotations xml specifications rather than the w3c versioning because i believe that tim bray s commentary is very useful

431473
ironpython	ironruby
f# s performance is about the same as c# s they are both compiled to il which is the important factors unlike ironpython and ironruby which are interpreter and therefore much slower

431474
response	timeout
you can certainly access that from within gae--though you might run into timeout issues while waiting for the response

431479
installation	uninstall
i think your better option is to uninstall the software and re-install it carefully reading every installation panel carefully checking for prerequisites or any other instructions

431480
progress-bar	progress
set the progress-bar to marquee instead of progress

431481
document	element
in a jtextpane with a defaultstyleddocument the document structure hierarchy of element objects ends with a leafelement that spans all the character of the enclosing paragraph

431481
document	element
is there a way to customize the document such that each leaf element will represent a single character

431514
pascal	basic
everyone else knew basic pascal etc

431533
python	c++
when i needed to write some c++ dlls for use in python i used a library called pycxx

431534
spring	seam
they also have explicit support for services exposed via spring ejb3 and seam

431563
pointers	stack
it brings my understanding of computer s ability to great heights including but not limited to efficient memory traversal stack passing a specific portion slicing of an arrays to a function treat the pointers to memory-mapped io vga address as an arrays

431571
contains	set
in the result of a selected i d like to have only one column name which should contains content of company_name if it s not null or concatenation of first_name + + last_name if the company_name is not set

431583
itextsharp	itext
i use itextsharp its a free open source c# port of the java itext library

431594
compression	streaming
on a modern system can local hard disk write speeds be improved by compression the output streaming

431606
keyboard	mouse
i haven t yet found a good cross-browser solution that supports both mouse clicks and keyboard activation of the checkbox and doesn t fire too many events

431635
spring	grails
according to the grails documentation withtransaction passes the closure to spring s transactionstatus object

431641
buffering	capture
the fastest way to get a large amount of data into a single string is output buffering to capture echo d output

431656
parallels	bootcamp
if i want c# i stick to visual-studio run it through parallels or bootcamp if you really want to use vs

431664
variables	boolean
consider that this arrays could be reduced by a factor of at least 8 by storing bit flags instead of whole-byte variables or even boolean which would require 4 bytes each on most architectures

431668
vbscript	perl
for wmi i don t have a perl example offhand but for a vbscript example see below

431670
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
for ide i suggest eclipse tools for silverlight apparently it is windows-only at the moment you should use monodevelop or sharpdevelop or something like that

431672
multiple-languages	translate
i have a project which i want to translate into multiple-languages for the php part i use zend frameworks zend_translate with gettext

431677
virtualization	parallels
i would go the virtualization route either parallels or vmware fusion

431679
instanceof	typeof
use typeof to check for primitive and instanceof to check for specific object types

431681
parallels	bootcamp
without meaning to state the obvious and miss the point if you mean a mac computer rather than a mac os you could install bootcamp or use parallels to run windows on the mac and then use visual-studio there are also free versioning of visual-studio

431739
highlight	selected
i have include functionality that allows a player to selected the option to highlight the squares a piece can legally move to when it gets click

431740
mbunit	nunit
it has a resharper plugins that lets you run nunit mbunit row tests

431755
windows-xp	windows
the method that exploits wmi b works for windows-xp but is it not working anymore with windows vista

431762
realloc	malloc
to use it just replace your malloc realloc calls with the boehm versions and you never have to call free again

431775
xquery	xslt
the xpath language is designed to be embedded in another language such as dom api xslt xquery ... and cannot be used standalone

431785
exception-handling	try-catch
if an exception-handling occurs in try-catch it will be thrown up a level and if an exception-handling occurs in notry-catch the exception-handling will also be thrown up a level

431789
exception-handling	try-catch
unless you actually intend to catch and do something about an exception-handling there is no point including a try-catch block

431791
exception-handling	try-catch
the stack will just be unwound until a try-catch is found to handle the exception-handling

431792
exception-handling	try-catch
if all you do is rethrow the exception-handling you don t need the try-catch block

431833
firefox	gecko
i would like to instead do it myself and leverage firefox gecko and safari webkit to render the image

431847
jar	war
building the war file isn t any different once you have done ivy retrieve as the jar files required will be local to the project just use the ant war task to create the war as normal

431875
postgresql	mysql
ideally it would support mssql 05 08 mysql oracle postgresql db2 out of the box

431877
inlining	inline
inlining is the responsibility of the clr jit and there are some conditional as to when a function is inline

431877
getter	setter
as you will probably find out 32 bytes is not very much in terms of code it is suitable for quick and small if-else conditional testing property getter setter

431882
distinct-values	contains
now i would like to take all distinct-values in the first column and assign them an arrays contains all values to which they point to in the second column thereby reducing index size and help me get closer to where i wish to get

431896
children	nodes
if yes subdivide the nodes into eight children then recursively do step 2 for each child

431896
contains	elements
add the elements to the smallest node that can contains it

431896
children	nodes
the basic idea is that if you can t see a nodes then you can t see its children either so everything inside that nodes and its children don t need to be rendered

431898
javascript	dom
if you have a javascript api you should take advantage of it so that you don t have to deal with the differences between browsers dom traversal techniques

431910
dictionary	arrays
in python it is easy to build a dictionary or arrays and pass it unpacked to a function with variable parameters

431912
arrays	loops
is there a way to get all alphabetic chars a-z in an arrays in php so i can loops through them and display them

431918
any	set
simply setting usehandcursor to false on any of these components will disable the hand cursor easily enough even when its buttonmode property which is responsible for dispatching click events is set to true

431936
debugging	trace
throw on its own or throw ex mess with the stack trace information and can make debugging harder

431954
webbrowser-control	xbap
i would assume yes since you can always place a webbrowser-control in your application and then call navigate with the url to the xbap application that you wish to launch

431955
triggers	insert
i don t have any triggers set on the table and the only thing my query is doing is running a plain insert into 1 table

431964
contains	set
on the other hand i find it completely reasonable for a namespace to contains only one highly special class or perhaps just a very small set of types of which one encodes the task and the others provide an api exception-handling enums for arguments â

431969
triggers	insert
the insert fires a triggers which

431978
any	set
are there any triggers set up on the table

431990
environment	building
in place building your environment so you can succeed

431990
put	get
get on your clients sponsors good side - delivery a win even if it s a somewhat stable very very small release - and then put in change management control what gets requested

431992
children	nodes
confusion occurs because jquery offers a children methods on its dom wrappers and ie offers a non-standard children collection on its native dom nodes but the two interfaces are almost totally incompatible

431996
python	java
i m trying to create a sudoku solver program in java maybe python

432005
python	java
do you need to do it in python or java

432006
constructor	object
but i ve tried instatiating an object with the second constructor with

432007
required	checked
extension methods required the parameters to be inferred from the collection type and then the predicate checked to be of the correct type

432010
decrement	increment
i think that s pretty good considering the program can only move left right and increment decrement by one

432018
firefox	safari
this works for all the major browsers safari firefox ie

432029
google-apps	gmail
one useful feature of google-apps is that it allows you to use the gmail interface to host email on google s servers for your own domain

432062
rollback	commit
you could also notice your insert updates delete statements hanging if you fail to commit or rollback at the conclusion of each transaction if you have not set autocommit property to true

432069
perforce	cvs
xcode only supports subversion perforce and cvs

432069
bazaar	git
however there are also distributed version control systems out there such as mercurial bazaar and git

432079
malloc	free
believe it or not it can be faster than using malloc and free

432083
attributes	properties
the entity s attributes are properties of the object

432083
subclass	accessor
you use key-value coding or if you implement a subclass dot syntax or accessor methods to set those properties

432128
python	c++
python pygame seems much more advanced than sdl bindings to any other language and one huge advantage compared to c++ is that don t have to compile code and with some simple hacking can even modify a running program and see the feedback live

432128
linux	osx
as for other advantages of pygame jrpg ran with very small changes on linux windows and osx

432128
debugging	trace
if you have any problems you can get good stack trace and debugging your problems live that s not really possible with c++ once you get a memory corruption or a segfault

432128
python	c++
i don t really know how easy or how hard would it be to mix c++ and python for your sdl games

432128
python	c++
i think it cannot be too hard as pygame is a pretty straightforward but very nicely made wrapper for sdl and python c++ mixing is supposed to be easy enough

432134
distance	polygons
with it comes a large collection of polygons line and distance calculation tools that can even take into account the curvature of the earth s surface if need be

432139
order	add
in order to get around this you have to move the build dir to another location so that xcode won t try to import it or manually add the discrete folders of a project one by one

432144
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but it fails in ie on the following line

432154
order	add
in order to inform other developers working on your code that they shouldn t add setter methods to your class in order to maintain the immutability requirement you could define an empty interface named immutable that relays this requirement to others working on the project

432154
methods	extend
annotations also give you the power to extend the design marker concept to individual methods in your classes

432158
jquery	dojo
there s jquery prototype scriptaculous mootools dojo and many others

432166
constructor	object
let shape be an aggregate type with a behavior member you pass a behavior object to the various shape constructor

432203
value	field
the value of this field is the

432204
base-class	inherited
the way to change a base-class function s signature is to create an intermediate class which derives from the base-class declares a new virtual function and overrides the inherited version to call the new function

432214
gethashcode	equals
don t forget that if you do override equals you really should override gethashcode also or you may get unexpected results if you are using your objects in a dictionary for example

432224
base-class	inherited
in those cases it will merge the base-classes and there will only be one base-class sub-object contains - inherited by virtual inheritance

432233
contains	any
also consider using any instead of contains i don t have reasons for choosing one over the other yet

432291
32-bit	16-bit
i m interested in 1-1 mappings of an id range stretchable or shrinkable so that for example 16-bit ids are mapped to 16-bit ids 32-bit ids mapped to 32-bit ids etc and that would stop somebody from trying to guess the total number of ids allocated or the rate of id allocation over a period

432295
haskell	lisp
i haven t yet decided which language i will go with but i ve noticed a fair amount of bias towards lisp haskell and f# amongst the community on stackoverflow

432303
scheme	lisp
they adopt scheme which is a variant of lisp as the programming language

432306
scheme	lisp
if you do choose a lisp variant i recommend scheme

432306
haskell	lisp
to conclude i suggest you choose a language following alan perlis s advice a language that doesn t affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing. lisp and haskell both changed my world

432309
haskell	lisp
if you start with common lisp or ocaml or erlang or especially haskell you will most likely get scared and you will feel lost for different reasons

432316
push	pull
for promotion to production we have another scripting that pull down all the production data and then runs rsync to push up changes

432328
common-lisp	lisp
practical common-lisp is a fantastic ebook if you re interesting in diving into lisp

432332
selected	checkbox
if a person where to fill out this form and selected more than one checkbox in either number 1 or number 3

432332
selected	checkbox
how would i insert those selected values into a database so that when i retreive the information the user inputed or selected i can see which checkbox he she selected

432340
value	field
then you can do anything you want with that wether it be sending an email or adding field to the database using ether foreach or implode to loop through the value

432344
hibernate	dozer
i use dozer for my current dto data transfer object from hibernate objects to the flex client

432346
linkbutton	onclick
why not just use the onclick event of the linkbutton

432416
revision	svn
i was able from trac ticket to see the source that changed in a revision that was linked to a comment in a svn commit

432426
value	field
the reason that you can put in a case statement but not string.empty is that empty is a field of the class string and is actually a contant value

432426
value	field
constant value are allowed in cases string.empty is a field and could be altered at run time

432429
order	add
add a char 10 field to your order table.

432444
factors	digits
if you re up for the mixed radix version it s basically the same except that i add the steps of converting the input to a mixed raddix number using the maximum range s prime factors as the digits s bases

432444
integer	digits
then i shuffle the digits around keeping the bases with the digits and turn it back into a standard integer

432458
communication	messages
if i already have an api for communication with serial ports can i have my program read send canopen messages without the canopen stack

432465
json	xml
some other things that i have run into in the xml vs json relm

432465
json	xml
that being said json can be used for about 90 of the same things xml can be used for when exchanging data in my experience

432470
put	get
since you can accept 2-3 seconds variation you could just put all your clients into long-lived comet-style requests and just get the response from the server

432495
arrays	loops
it surely is very strongly discouraged to use loops when you use a language like apl or any language naturally designed to work directly with arrays from uni-dimensional vectors to hypercubes without having to deal iteratively with each element

432501
perl	php
in php do not use die as it does not raise an exception as it does in perl

432532
reliability	scalability
for example s3 trades sophistication for scalability reliability performance you can t do a complex sql like query

432538
qthread	qobject
if each allocation is an instances of qobject why don t you just parent it to the current qthread object

432542
where-clause	sql
i am not sure if i understand your question clearly but it seems like you need to use a where-clause in your sql query

432556
python	php
i would like to be able to start a second script either php or python when a page is loaded and have it continue to run after the user cancels navigates away is this possible

432564
rollback	commit
if you used to have one versioning of a file in commit a and then later made two changes in two separate commit b and c so what you are seeing is the third iteration of the file and if you say i want to rollback to the first one do you really mean it

432567
boost	stl
debugging with gdb any c++ code that uses stl boost is still a nightmare

432567
boost	stl
use checked debugging stl boost library such as stlport

432575
erlang	lisp
i hop you chose erlang or lisp

432575
erlang	lisp
where should i go after erlang lisp and forth please leave a comment

432580
account	api
example the rich api will be responsible for creating a new user account by creating a lead entity that s linked to an account entity via the thin api

432610
forwarding	port
i m pretty sure i shouldn t have to forwarding any ports or anything but i did try forwardinging port 80 to my workstation on my router

432618
show	next
it will still show the loading animation though so i think karsten s suggestion is probably better i ll try that next time i need to do this type of thing i think

432642
scheme	lisp
from what i know scheme is a simplified version of lisp think of it as lisp but with only the bare essentials

432643
scheme	lisp
i would start with lisp specifically scheme because it is simple

432653
contains	set
i realized this could be more efficient and asked a css friend if i could set the element to hidden based on whether or not the contains link has been visited

432664
easymock	jmock
then use a mocking library like easymock or jmock to assert that your hibernate-veneer layer is correctly called by your application classes

432677
configuration	logging
that doesn t enable logging to log4j you do that through log4j configuration it just dumps to the console

432713
fopen	fread
the only way i could think of off the bat to serve this file is by loading it into memory fopen fread ect. setting the header data to the proper mime type and then just echoing the entire contents of the file

432725
readfile	fopen
even less lines if you use readfile which doesn t need the fopen call.

432731
element	dynamic
the canvas element is part of html5 and allows for dynamic scriptable rendering of bitmap images

432739
lighttpd	squid
software - lighttpd memcache varnish nginx squid pound lvs eaccelerator etc

432739
configuration	logging
configuration - static hashing upstream module memcache for x minutes after n requests disable logging image requests etc

432747
readfile	fopen
if you just want to dump the contents of a file to the output buffer without first modifying it or seeking to a particular offset you may want to use the readfile which saves you the fopen call. â php manual

432749
lighttpd	apache
it is supported by lighttpd and apache with a plugin

432759
cryptography	security
well a cryptography hash shouldn t compromise security as long as it is salted and has reasonable complexity

432774
oracle	mysql
i ve successfully used ruby rails activerecord migrations on oracle sql server 2005 mysql and sqlite

432774
sql-server	oracle
any cross-platform system has to deal with issues like this i acquired a lifetime hatred of crystal reports for example after wrestling with a version that tried - catastrophically - to apply an oracle outer-join operator in a sql-server query

432777
where-clause	sql
but as you only have to specify a simple where-clause in your mapping there isn t really much difference between hql and real sql

432789
contains	any
but is there any reason you can t make a web accessible directory contains symbolic links to the actual files

432793
uiscrollview	subviews
i have got my own custom uiviewcontroller which contains a uiscrollview with an uiimageview as it s subviews

432799
hash	md5
the main difference between this and basic is that digest is a challenge-response authentication whereas the client has to fulfill a challenge on every request and the response is just a md5 hash

432805
directory	folder
if your files are not accessible by the webserver because the path is not in your web serving directory htdocs then you can make a symbolic link symlink to that folder in your web serving directory to avoid passing all traffic trough php

432809
user-roles	userid
user-roles - userid int role string

432814
contains	elements
i change that content to contains a elements

432817
google-chrome	opera
it looks like in both opera and google-chrome the browser is treating the area outside the browser s initial viewport as part of the html tag but not part of the body

432825
selected	checkbox
please i need come help i have a form of checkbox i want to save the name and value of the boxes that registered user selected into a table now i have registered users information saved in a table how the table that saves the registered users selection is to be created to have a relation with the table of users

432826
internet-explorer	google-chrome
internet-explorer 7 and google-chrome both behave as expected returns a well internet-explorer 7 doing something right was a bit unexpected...

432841
constructor	object
whenever i make an immutable object it doesn t have any setters or getters only one parametrized constructor and all fields are public like this

432841
reasoning	rule
the reasoning of course is that since firstname and lastname are immutable in this class i can actually break the rule about not exposing inner members of class since they re immutable

432844
boolean	int
the xor operator on two boolean is logical xor unlike on int where it s bitwise

432844
bitwise-xor	xor
and logical xor is equivalent to bitwise-xor when the domain is restricted to 0 and 1

432849
fireworks	photoshop
i m interested in people s opinions on the pros and cons or downright hell no s on designing websites in the browser and moving away from photoshop fireworks etc

432862
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome or firefox

432885
firefox	gecko
firefox gecko defines regexp as an extension of function

432885
google-chrome	firefox
it seems this is specific to firefox -- ie opera and google-chrome all throw exceptions for it

432916
primitive	int
but if the ole_color is a object instead of an int string or other primitive

432919
google-chrome	firefox
i find that firefox and google-chrome work faster than ie

432934
worksheet	excel
imho ado is not suitable for use in excel worksheet functions poor performance and cannot easily be used on the worksheet containing the data

432957
required	checked
as already mentioned required that no such checked takes place

432982
ole-automation	com
within the constraints of the dva it is fairly well written in that there is no significant program logic in the user-interface and anything that can be done using the user-interface can also be carried out programmatically using a com ole-automation interface

432986
any	set
asp.net offers the ability to set specific cacheability to controls and make the cache vary by userid or any other parameter you want you could take advantage of that

432990
hyperlink	embed
i am failing on the simplest thing how can i embed hyperlink into the text

432990
uilabel	uiview
i m current using a uiview with a uilabel for the text

433022
entity-framework	ado.net
note while doing a web search i did find an open letter to microsoft titled ado.net entity-framework vote of no confidence that seems to imply that there isn t a good way to add in a clear separation of concerns

433033
imageview	textview
for controls -- like textbox textview or images imageview -- this will wrap the text or image being shown

433083
lighttpd	apache
what you need to do is configure your web server itself iis apache lighttpd whatever to direct requests to a specific script or resource

433102
contains	elements
i need to create an expected configurationcollection which contains 1 elements in order to test if me configuration contains that elements

433104
web-services	api
i find a lot of examples from 2003-2005 but they are all out-of-date and give errors it seems that amazon s cloud web-services have obfuscated their simple rest api documentation for their books

433109
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
i wouldn t make my own base classes to create a custom argumentexception argumentnullexception or invalidoperationexception

433124
ruby	php
but you can t go wrong with php and asp.net or ruby on rails

433142
detect	move
git will automatically detect the move rename if your modification is not too severe

433142
git-add	git-rm
just git-add the new file and git-rm the old file

433163
entity-relationship	diagram
as mentioned in anothentity-relationship so question this programs has the capability to genentity-relationshipate a simple entity-relationship diagram

433164
linux	unix
if so what will the iterator after the erase equal to in unix linux

433190
multiplication	multiplying
so for example if say floating point add and multiplying instructions each have a throughput of 2 and a latency of 5 actually for multiplying it s a bit greater i think that means that adding a register to itself or multiplyinging it by itself will likely take two clock cycles since there are no other dependent value whereas adding it the result of a previous multiplication will take something like or a bit less than 2+5 clock cycles depending where you start finish timing and on all sorts of other things

433190
arrays	loops
hotspot 1.6.12 jit-compiles the inner loops sequence to the following intel code consisting of a load-add-store for each position in the arrays with randomval being held in xmm0a in this case

433195
put	get
how does the cache know to invalidate the multiple-farm get when it sees the put go by

433195
put	get
how does the cache know to invalidate the single get when it sees the put go by

433203
subtract	add
how do i add subtract etc

433206
http	ssl
http cache servers cannot cache ssl because to do so would require them to decrypt the pages as a man in the middle. doing so would be technically challenging decrypt the page store it and re-encrypt it for the client and would also violate the page security causing invalid certificate warnings on the client side

433207
decrement	increment
you can t increment decrement or read it out write to it anymore

433219
boost	stl
note that the difficult to inspect structures are not only stl boost but also from other libraries like qt kde

433237
python	ruby
ruby and python are the big dynamic languages these days and will offer a different perspective

433254
keydown	keyup
when i was trying to tackle the problem i thought about starting a counter on the keydown and resetting it on keyup

433257
multiplication	division
multiplication and bit-shifing should be faster than division but probably are not precise enough

433263
superclass	subclass
i couldnt able to mock the protected variabless defined in the superclass.i could able to mock the protected methods in superclass but couldnt to mock the protected variables in to the subclass wherein am writing the testcase for subclass please if anybody out there has any soluton for it .please reply

433269
defined	declare
you need to defined this as a function and declare the abi by using extern c

433276
revision	updates
there should not be possibility for anyone to updates to old revision before the split and get see the files

433279
sql-server	mysql
i myself was using ms sql-server first and switched to mysql without problems

433282
value	field
additionally i d use a database constraint to prevent storing negative value in the field

433283
instrumentation	profiling
so if you re developing a resource intensive application you should be using profiling tools specific to each os you re targeting like for example instrumentation on os x and of course test the performance in each browser

433305
selected	button
click the arrow on the add resource button add existing file and selected your .cur file

433311
arrays	loops
if you have a multidimensional arrays you can set their lengths in a loops

433322
javascript	dom
to be perfectly honest the more i discover and experience in javascript jquery and dom the less i use asp.net controls and related garbage on my pages

433351
updating	updates
and frequently updating the templates after the designer updates the html mockup is a nightmare because your templates are no longer compatible with the original htmls

433384
windows-xp	windows
it runs my asp.net program faster in ubuntu than when it is running on my development machine windows-xp s iis though i haven t yet compared the speed when running on windows server

433384
pascal	forth
languages supported on mono c# java boo nemerle vb.net pythonnet ironpython oberon php object pascal cobra component pascal delta forth dotlisp #smalltalk

433384
postgresql	oracle
for database use postgresql it is dubbed as the oracle of the opensource database

433391
instrumentation	profiling
so if you re developing a resource intensive application you should be using profiling tools specific to each os you re targeting like for example instrumentation on os x and of course test the performance in each browser

433394
display	width
2 put a div with a pre-set height and change the width according to the value you want it to display

433408
vcard	vcf
pycocuma appears to have a vcf parsing built into it and it ll generate vcard output

433422
onmousemove	onmouseover
it would be expensive to do serious programming on every onmousemove instance so you might find it better to create several zones around the page and poll for a onmouseover event

433424
webforms	asp.net
do you think for the purpose of web application development specifically asp.net webforms mvc

433426
sqrt	cos
x cos theta sqrt 2 rect.width + x.center

433426
sqrt	sin
y sin theta sqrt 2 rect.height + y.center

433429
dictionary	arrays
these are mostly in place to reduce the amount of code written for classes that are created often such as strings arrays dictionary numbers etc

433451
parallels	vmware
vmware on the desktop or other parallels on other operating systems is superb because a your devs can run a full instance of your server environment including multiple virtual servers connnected in a virtual network - this is about as close to the real thing that you can get minus hardware costs and minus devs messing with each other s servers

433476
data-structures	tree
other examples include the construction of tree structures lists or other data-structures

433493
any	set
i have long recognized that any set of whitespace in an html file will only be displayed as a single space

433494
benchmarking	profiling
if it s just used to check security once per request and cache various things i can t see how it s likely to be significant - but that s why you should profiling and benchmarking your app

433501
space	input
collapse input white space sequences

433526
derived-class	base-class
now i see that i cannot convert from a base-class to derived-class and i see that it doesn t have anything to do with generics

433538
display	outline
this means that if the user has not selected the show windows contents while dragging option in the display properties dialog this will effectively ignore that setting it won t show a drag outline

433545
derived-class	base-class
you can only cast from a base-class to a derived-class if the object is actually of type derived-class

433556
derived-class	base-class
as for the implicit operator you can still create a constructor in the derived-class which receives a parameter of type base-class

433563
datagridview	propertygrid
re data-binding for some binding targets propertygrid datagridview etc you can do this with a typeconverter see below

433563
datagridview	propertygrid
anyway a typeconverter example works with propertygrid and datagridview

433594
tstringlist	tlist
if your arrays is no longer static you might want to consider using a tlist a tstringlist or one of the many containers classes in the contnrs unit

433605
prawnto	prawn
prawn with prawnto for sure

433611
instances	self
as you say it also self document which instances s a new one you re working with

433614
defined	declare
you need to defined this as a function and declare the abi by using extern c this needs to be a standard function with c interface

433614
pointers	stack
2 it seems like once you have the function pointers the calling conventions what gets pushed on stack to make the function call just has to be the same between c++

433616
forms-authentication	security
json can utilize forms-authentication security just like pages

433624
value	field
if you want to have checked enum values it s not clear when exception-handling should be thrown in this case - zero value may sneak to you code when you for example create an instance of a class contains this enum as a field

433628
average	min
the idea of the program is that i should use functions to read an arrays of 10 elements then get the average of the elements then get the the max and min

433628
average	min
i ve got the max and min right but the average is showing weird stuff

433646
constructor	object
the new operator in c# maps directly to the il instruction called newobj which actually allocates the space for the new object s variables and then executes the constructor called .ctor in il

433646
constructor	object
when executing the constructor -- much like c++ -- a reference to the initialized object is passed in as an invisible first parameter like thiscall

433647
.net	wcf
i am an asp.net web developer exploring .net remoting with wcf with sql clustering and am curious as to what other approaches exist such as the â cloudâ

433651
multiplying	addition
you ve got some problems with counting starting with zero and multiplying before addition rules

433660
.when	ready
frankly it was production ready .when 3.0 came out

433680
value	field
to control and sanitize the value written to field

433698
python	java
java coding convention actually would avoid that since they require class names to start with a upper case letter and method names to start with a lower case one and probably that s the way python avoids confusion in this case

433704
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu and anything else that s based on debian you do that like this

433712
calloc	malloc
try setting the nodes child property to null c doesn t automagically zero out memory so it looks like your may have garbage in child or your could use calloc instead of malloc

433715
arguments	default
now then you re only passing a char so bare x tells the function to use the full int that got passed instead â due to default arguments promotion for .

433718
webserver	upload
i have a bash script to upload some files to my webserver

433722
debian	linux
ideally the tool would run on debian linux but windows os x is fine if necessary

433723
contains	any
there are two schools one says its ok to check param in setter school style and second one says beans should not contains any logic and just data enterprise style

433723
getter	setter
when you put logic in your setter and getter you make it harder to understand whats going on since many people will never look at its implementation

433723
getter	setter
if you disagree i urge you to look at every setter and getter implementation before you use it just to check if its not just a bean

433734
pointers	stack
on the other hand in c++ you need to be very careful when publishing or sharing references to stack-based objects because stack-based objects are automatically freed when stack frame is unwound leading to dangling pointers

433738
enterprise	platform
could the sql-server ide ever become an application development platform for enterprise applications

433739
getter	setter
you keep the internal value in one measurement system but you convert from all others in the setter and convert back in the getter

433743
textbox	button
now i have another button that the user would click after they have filled in all their dynamically-created textbox

433748
instance-variables	metaclass
if you really want to insist that instance-variables be declared before referenced there are some metaclass tricks you can use

433748
base-class	metaclass
you can create a common base-class that using metaclass logic enforces the convention that only variables that are declared when the subclass is declared can later be set

433765
value	field
for example a surrogate primary key usually so my data-access layer can seemlessly add update it a field for the value of the item plus a candidate candidate being in quotes since it s not required so it s either unique or null

433773
callback	methods
make a methods to act as a callback for the textbox when their value changes

433776
freebsd	linux
see for example the byteorder 3 manual page on a freebsd or linux system

433788
mbunit	nunit
we have a cruisecontrol server running various antunit mbunit and nunit tests via ant

433788
mbunit	nunit
this works however mbunit output the tests in a different xml format than nunit and antunit

433788
mbunit	nunit
for example nunit seems to use testcase to signify a test result whereas mbunit uses run among other things

433788
mbunit	nunit
does anyone know how to transform the mbunit output into nunit compatible format xml that we can then merge together to produce a full set of test reports by applying the nunit unittests.xsl

433803
decrement	increment
python doesn t have the increment ++ and decrement -- operators but it does have the + operator and - etc. so you can do this

433821
superclass	subclass
while javascript tends to allow anything and maybe such an example could be considered normal i don t really know in python this is mostly a negative byproduct of omission of type declaration which can help speeding up development - if you at some point change your mind on the type of a variables fixing type declarations can take more time than the fixes to actual code in some cases including the renaming of a type but also cases where you use a different type with some similar methods and no superclass subclass relationship

433832
contains	any
the flex compiler can compile pure as3 swf files that don t contains any flex component bytecode

433870
python	java
java c# python 3.0 switched to that model exactly for simplicity

433874
order	add
another option is firebug lite which is pretty good for most situations but you need to add a scripting reference to every page you want to debugging in order for it to work

433878
contains	elements
then traverse through all li elements classed result checking if the a contains within it has a colour of #000 or #111

433883
opensolaris	solaris
setxkbmap was added to solaris express and opensolaris solaris versions newer than solaris 10 but has not yet been backported to solaris 10

433918
methods	extend
so i set out to extend the sort methods for using the same signature that is used for orderby

433926
base-class	inherited
they all inherited from an abstract base-class so i could use reflection to map the properties but i m wondering if there s a better way

433945
python	java
i was wondering if there is something similar to java s jfilechooser for python

433959
constructor	object
a copy constructor basically means you have a single parameter which is the object you re going to copy

433959
shallow-copy	deep-copy
also do a deep-copy not a shallow-copy

433959
deep-copy	object
a deep-copy really gets the actuall values and puts them in a new field of the new object whilst a shallow copy only copies the pointers

433970
value	field
there s a message table and then a replies table that has an reply_id field that can be null to indicate a top level response or a value that indicates a threaded response

433980
difference	count
the same count for protected inheritance with the only difference that the base class now isn t private to the own class any more but rather to any derived class as well

434007
widget	button
when i try to add any widget label button ... to main application windows in gorm the windows does not accept the widget

434007
selected	button
when i selected and left click on button widget in palette windows the curson changes to 2 green squares

434012
put	get
thats why i prefer open apps this way you get more open people to whom yo can actually talk ask then questions propose new ideeas that actually gets implemented or at least put on an open todo-list thus you get some kind of evolution

434014
base-class	inherited
i am generating my domain objects from my hbm files with hbm2java and now i want them to all inherited a base-class

434027
implements	extends
basically you want to use a meta tag here with attributes extends for a common base-class or implements for a common base interface

434075
jpql	hql
don t write sql if you can help it use hql or jpql is on java ee whenever possible

434079
entity-relationship	diagram
also you should generate entity-relationship diagram which are useful additions to database documentation though erd s don t tell the whole story either

434085
memset	malloc
many of the standard c library fwrite memset malloc functions have direct equivalents in the windows api writefile fillmemory zeromemory globalalloc

434107
functional-programming	imperative
wadler s work for example imperative functional-programming 1993 presented monads as practical tool

434133
export	csv
i see you had written if they have excel export to excel and if not export to csv - i would personally just export it as a csv file in both cases because excel can handle csv files no problem

434134
truncation	formatting
you can use it to control how rounding or truncation is applied during formatting

434148
order	add
so there is no need to add a scripting reference to every page you want to debugging in order for it to work

434171
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
for example if you have a uiviewcontroller and add a uinavigationcontroller as subview you must add this code to the uiviewcontroller if you want viewwillappear animated to be called when uinavigationcontroller.view appears

434180
document	element
web browsers tend to be fairly forgiving of this in the initial parsing of a document but when changing innerhtml i would expect that the browser would ignore any elements because that type of element is not expected there

434182
variables	boolean
a jit compiler can instead use 1 byte for boolean locals while keeping other variables aligned by reordering fields without performance impact if the additional overhead is worth it

434209
webforms	asp.net
today asp.net webforms and wpf programmers regularly write code without knowing or caring how it will be implemented

434229
account	api
all you need is request standard login with federated login for google account users from your api domain

434250
perl	php
the equivalent of this in php perl

434277
json	xml
now that you accept more than simple get post json or xml your model will have to distinguish between each request type and know how to parse them

434278
debian-based	linux
pdftk is included in debian-based linux distributions and perhaps others as well

434279
contains	elements
get the elements that contains this and has a class of qa the box that contains both question and answer

434279
contains	elements
get the elements that contains this and has a class of qa the box that contains both question and answer

434305
contains	any
these may contains small errors but the basic idea is that this version will ship absent any major flaws found at the last minute

434306
markup	xhtml
also silverlight seems to mix content layout styling and behavior and into a single markup whereas i like the xhtml way of separating them out in code but bringing them together in the user s web browser

434311
vbscript	basic
like cmd.exe vbscript or visual basic for applications

434351
hide	show
i m not familiar with the flickr methods you reference above but generally the approach to these sorts of things is that you show the gif before you make the call and then hide it when the call completes

434358
contains	any
however with modern multiprocessing operating systems if the program runs long enough it could be swapped out-of-memory and when it is swapped back in the data segment contains the hello string would be read from the program s executable on disk and the very next call to func might print hello hewwo or even hello hello or hello hewlo or hewwo hello or any other combination you can think of since time slices could occur at any point during your execution

434365
constructor	object
c# 3.0 has something similar in that you can both instantiate an object using a default constructor and assign properties in the same statement

434376
triggers	insert
originally i had a triggers on any insert against the table so when the data is entered the slug is then determined

434377
png	gif
first - go here and create a spinning gif or png -

434413
stderr	stdout
i would guess that the reason is to be backwards-compatible with pthreads c++ standard i o in which stdin stdout and stderr the c++ equivalent of system.in system.out and system.err respectively are byte streams

434424
mousedown	mouseup
imagine a custom view where the mousedown mousedrag and mouseup methods are overriden so the user can drag a point nsrect on the screens

434429
administration	enterprise
in enterprise level development this means the administration has the centralised membership control panels they are used to using to manage the domain level security

434429
authentication	login
obviously you will then need to plan how the enterprise would handle the maintenance of multiple login and authentication providers

434450
markup	xhtml
the goal here is to allow my jquery code to figure out which elements need to be validated this is already done and still have the markup be valid xhtml which is what i m having a problem with

434450
duplicates	elements
when i run my page through the w3 xhtml validator i get 80+ errors because it s getting duplicates definitions of all the xhtml elements

434458
actionscript	mxml
there are two different compilers one that is used for compiling actionscript code to avm bytecode and another mxmlc that compiles mxml files into actionscript code which is then in turn compiled by the first compiler

434498
python	java
switching from java to python and discovering them was a good day

434502
contains	set
you ll need to set your img s src attributes to contains the information you need

434528
sniffing	packets
i m looking for something other then packets sniffing

434529
typedef	struct
for example typedef extern and function prototypes are all declarations while things like struct int and function bodies are definitions

434564
multiplication	division
multiplication and division would accumulate that error faster but it would still take quite a while

434565
carbon	cocoa
one of the biggest problems in the past has been apple s refusal to open up the nib format for cocoa carbon nibs were open xml files years ago

434565
python	ruby
another approach worth investigating is using a dynamic language like python or ruby

434565
ironpython	ironruby
i m not sure which is more mature at present between ironpython and ironruby but both are now supported by microsoft people

434569
development-environment	virtual-machine
at my work i currently have my development-environment inside a virtual-machine

434571
value	field
i would like to change the query so that i can get these missing records with 0 as the value for the numstudents field

434584
bazaar	git
a distributed decentralized version control system solution will suit your needs git bazaar mercurial darcs.

434586
buildpath	libs
you should be able to see jre system libs jdk1.x.xxxx when you look at your project s java buildpath

434592
arguments	default
so based on type member functions are available.calling member function that is not available should throw an exception-handling.similarly when a getter of uninitialized is called again a exception-handling should be thrown i am using default arguments to check for the uninitialized object

434594
python	ruby
however if you re leaning towards a dynamic language rubycocoa will let you use ruby which i think you ll find easier to pick up than python

434601
recording	playing
i look at this article in msdn recording and playing sound with the waveform audio interface and download the p invoke library sample that record using wave in and wave out

434613
required	checked
but fortunately we had a source control server tfs configure so i use to work only from the local virtual machines stored on my external drive and than checked in the required files to the tfs as an when required

434631
textbox	button
for example one using a textbox and a button

434650
messenger	skype
video communication on top of that as in for instance windows live messenger or skype or ... really did change the way we are communicating

434652
lgpl	gpl
it and the corresponding modules are licensed under the lgpl gpl which means you can use ffmpeg to generate videos thumbnails without restriction as long as you have the rights to the original movies that you re transcoding

434652
lgpl	gpl
the gpl lgpl license restrictions only apply to the ffmpeg code binaries which won t matter until you decide to distribute those binaries to other people

434666
icollection	ienumerable
i don t understand why ilist implements ienumerable taking in consideration that ilist implements icollection that implements ienumerable also

434681
subtraction	addition
basic addition subtraction multiplication and division are the first things that come to mind

434691
icollection	ienumerable
it implements ienumerable precisely because it inherited icollection which is ienumerable

434694
google-chrome	firefox
when run it logs hidden on firefox but visible on google-chrome

434697
icollection	ienumerable
i assume you want to know why it declares that it implements icollection as well as ienumerable when the first implies the second

434697
icollection	ienumerable
i suspect the main reason is clarity it means people don t need to look back to icollection to check that that already extends ienumerable

434703
firefox	opera
on firefox and safari it works properly but just doesn t work at all in ie and opera

434709
tuples	any
if i had known how important tuples calculus would be to anyone writing or debugging any sort of database code i would have tried to teach myself in high school

434711
websphere	ibm
websphere app server ah ibm bless their little hearts has changed what it does

434732
adplus	dump
i d suggest using adplus when the issue reproduces and getting yourself a hang dump

434740
subtract	add
you may also choose to store tenths of a cent ie 4090 or some other constant fractional precision. you will be able to add and subtract an infinite number of times without losing precision

434765
buffering	streaming
i use a local rolling buffering which i fill before sending down to the underlying streaming and v.v.

434786
pointers	stack
if you allocate those objects on stack you must not delete them then again this is highly unlikely because your pointers will become invalid when the objects they point to fall out of scope

434786
boost	stl
as others have already suggested life is much easier if you use a container -- especially an stl container -- and smart pointers -- which for now means pointers out of boost

434787
difference	factors
if there s any one factors that explains the difference in price it s this

434805
icollection	ienumerable
if you were to open the code in resharper it would indicate that the ienumerable interface declaration on ilist wasn t required as it is already specified via icollection

434808
http	ssl
for this we use svn over ssl http

434815
web-config	app-config
i read from so and elsewhere that it s best to use app-config or web-config to manage the connection string

434825
selected	checkbox
selected the a_i checkbox when creating editing a column

434832
panels	grid
with different slices of the shape in a grid stackpanels or with a clipped panels and etc

434848
binaries	objdump
btw with objdump from the mingw project and activeperl or with cygwin you should be able to do that also on windows and also on binaries obtained with other compilers

434855
ethernet	lan
10 100 ethernet lan card for connecting to server broadband --- connect etc

434855
keyboard	mouse
touchpad mouse in built in the keyboard

434863
google-chrome	safari
this works on safari 3.1.2 consequently on google-chrome

434870
linux	osx
and since this tool will work not only on windows but also on linux or mac osx investing your time to learn it quite easy actually makes sense

434877
maven-release-plugin	release
maven-release-plugin and roll a new release of every component

434899
unsigned	short
ironspigot mspinstallert class atl cstringt unsigned short class atl strtraitatl unsigned short class atl chtraitscrt unsigned short performmsioperation

434899
unsigned	short
ironspigot mspinstallert class atl cstringt unsigned short class atl strtraitatl unsigned short class atl chtraitscrt unsigned short performmsioperation

434913
any	set
a reference-type field s get set ldfld stfld is iirc guaranteed to be atomic so there shouldn t be any risk of corruption here

434915
32-bit	64bit
references are of a type are guaranteed to be atomic int32 on 32-bit systems and int64 on 64bit

434917
value	field
however when getting and setting a reference-type field as a property like this then adding a lock statement doesn t add any value

434926
textbox	button
click on the browse button browse to the file click on it click the upload button and the textbox that should show the filename is blank

434933
32-bit	64bit
i could parsing the csv line by line or run the app in 32-bit mode but ideally i d just like to find a different driver that runs as 64bit

434951
numeric	zero
a numeric literal that starts with a zero is interpreter as octal so writing 01004 is exactly the same as writing 516

434951
decimal	octal
some other answers suggesting using parseint inside the function to convert the octal value to decimal

434951
numeric	zero
the way to fix this is either to lose the leading zero or if the zero is required make it a string literal rather than a numeric and use parseint num 10 inside the function

434962
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i get security exception-handling when using system.net.webclient to do http requests which is due to the fact that crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml on the target server are either missing or are too restrictive

434964
language-features	operators
my preferred strategy for really getting into a new language is to read a book which covers most of the base language-features so that you hear about all the little operators functions and other details which you might not pick up from random web tutorials

434982
transactional-replication	database-mirroring
to be more specific about my sql-server architecture i have an active active cluster of 2 nodes which are used for load balancing and i have another server for replication which will be used only for reporting i want to make sure which technology best provides both availabilty and performance transactional-replication or database-mirroring

434983
profiling	debugging
the commercial oxygen xml editor has a feature for profiling and debugging xslt files

434997
defined	declare
can i add arbitrary tags to an xml document without having to defined declare a namespace for them

435000
put	get
higher values decrease the space overhead but increase the lookup cost reflected in most of the operations of the hashmap class including get and put

435025
children	tree
building the logical tree adding children

435039
selected	button
but if i click the arrow down button instead the selected item will be the sixth one

435045
variables	boolean
dowork may well loop forever despite the write to the boolean variables being atomic - there s nothing to stop the jit from caching the value of stopping in dowork

435049
params-keyword	ref
there is a way to make the params-keyword work with ref keyword or something close to that

435068
defined	declare
can i add arbitrary tags to an xml document without having to defined declare a namespace for them

435068
mathml	xhtml
this is what for example the xhtml plus mathml plus svg doctype does

435076
linux	unix
grep is available on all unix linux with the gnu tools or on windows using one of the many implementations unxutils cygwin ...etc.

435082
folder	dir
added this is how the source control structure looks the deployed app would just have the configuration dir with no sub folder or course

435122
wamp	php
since you said you are a beginner in php i would suggest installing wamp

435122
wamp	php
wamp contains apache php mysql perl all in one installation and ready to go

435128
value	field
your composite object can have a save methods that builds the resulting valid object from the value of all the various field

435130
updating	updates
you are responsible for updating this repo and testing plugins updates first for currently developed projects - so devs do not need to worry about compatibility

435131
oprofile	gprof
- some profiling if you can get it to work i ve done profiling with netbeans gprof even oprofile but i was never able to make it work with eclipse - it s anyway more complicated to do profiling than in netbeans

435131
ubuntu	linux
- maybe on linux i d like rpms for gcj-compiled versions of eclipse like ubuntu and redhat provide

435156
json	xml
a great alternative to json xml when you need a performance boost

435162
jax-ws	cxf
either cxf jax-ws ri or metro metro jax-ws ri + wsit seem to be the best implementations around that can take any wsdl contract and generate the pojos or vice versa

435191
forwarding	port
just setup a svn server at home forwarding your router port and get on with your life

435218
contains	elements
my top level web.config file contains as well as all the standard stuff this location elements

435231
user-controls	treeview
i have implemented a user-controls and put a treeview control on that

435231
hierarchicaldatatemplate	binding
i am using a hierarchicaldatatemplate for data binding with the treeview

435233
innodb	myisam
if you are on myisam switching to innodb if you can - it has no full text indexing opens up more options for this sort of thing as it supports the transactional features and row level locking

435293
web-config	app-config
so what you need to do is look for the tag inside the web-config file of your asp.net project and change it to and add the tags that are contains in the app-config file of the library-project

435298
any	set
much much much easier to set up than any other alternative

435302
web-config	app-config
copy the connectionstring section from your library s app-config file to your web-config file

435329
any	set
are there any references set to copylocal false common with infragistics or gac ed refs that dont make it to the destination

435334
constructor	object
the reason is because the object is created and the constructor destructor are called

435352
toolchain	gnu
my understanding is that the gnu toolchain can optionally restrict visibility just to symbols explicitly declared

435369
any	set
in your project properties set the target-platform from any to x86

435369
32-bit	64bit
in windows x64 a process may be started as 32-bit or 64bit process

435369
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit process can only load 64bit dlls and a 32-bit process only 32-bit dlls

435369
32-bit	64bit
if your platform target specified in the project properties of your .net application is set to any cpu the intermediate code will be compiled to 32-bit or 64bit code depending on the target platform on a x64 system 64bit code will be generated

435371
cross-compiling	toolchain
realbasic is a lot easier to pick up then the recommended toolchain for mac os x and it has the advantages that it is somewhat similar to visualbasic and that it can be cross-compiling to windows and even linux

435371
carbon	cocoa
other than that they seem a larger than i would think they need to be they are carbon not cocoa

435382
entity-relationship	diagram
as bill said you centity-relationshiptainly need an entity-relationship diagram

435403
any	set
i applied what you told me and it somehow worked the exception-handling is no longer exist but the problem now is that it did not return any value i used a data gridview an set its data source to

435406
order	add
first we ll add a string for a different sort type and then we ll add a boolean to denote whether we re sorting in descending or ascending order and then add a field which determines which field we want to search by

435410
checkbox	button
another alternative would be to have a checkbox whose value is the id of the member being approved that the admin can select for each member to be approved and a similar one for reject and one each approve reject button for the entire form

435427
testng	junit
my advice is simply ditch junit and use testng

435427
testng	junit
once you get used to testng junit looks like stone age

435476
compact-framework	.net
i have a c# project in vs2008 which i wish to build for two targets - x86 and the compact-framework for dot .net cf..net depending on a chosen configuration say debug smartdevicedebug etc

435479
click	mouse
this is true in a narrow technical sense the mouse click exists independent of the button that s underneath the cursor when you click but it isn t a helpful distinction

435495
display	outline
i quess i could have all my functions be part of a required file but i was wondering if any homesite jocks might know of a more reliable way of creating an outline profiling that would display user defined functions

435524
value	field
if you mean to send an arrays to a httpservice with the same field name you can pass an arrays as field value

435544
value	field
you can have a confirmation field any type mentioned above and it sets the correct value

435552
order	add
after this sublist add line and then order list of the rest of the countries

435553
constructor	object
does creating an object using reflection rather than calling the class constructor result in any significant performance differences

435564
sqldatasource	gridview
in principle you need to configure the sorting at the data source whether its an objectdatasource or a sqldatasource not at the gridview

435579
udp	tcp
they are checking the datagramsocket as well to check if the port is avaliable in udp and tcp

435605
boost	stl
maybe not the sort of tip you were looking for but i have to say that my experience after a few years of moving from c++ stl to c++ boost stl is that i now spend a lot less time in gdb than i used to

435605
boost-test	cppunit
boost-test s auto macros mean it s an absolute doddle to set up test cases easier than cppunit

435617
methods	extend
here is a good example trying to extend static ms unit-testing class assert i want 1 more assert methods areequal x1 x2

435647
click	mouse
i am not able to restrict this code to scroll only the front_mc and back_mc in the front_mc are nested button that work and showing content on click - but the mouse-movement gets captured all the time so also content of the menu gets scrolled when mouse is moved

435685
nstextview	nswindow
i have a transparency nstextview on a transparency nswindow

435685
nsbezierpath	nsimage
the view s drawrect methods draws some content nsimage s nsbezierpath s and nsstring s on the view but leaves parts of it transparency

435685
click	mouse
click on the regions of the view that have been drawn on invokes the usual mouse event handling methods mousedown and mouseup

435685
mouseenter	mousedown
this appears to only add support for mouseenter mouseexited mousemoved and cursorupdate methods not mouseup and mousedown

435687
any	set
it can be any number you like and you d want to set it so that on balance many more people are helped by the omission than are hurt by having to choose other .

435692
revision	svn
you could omit the svn date and it would still be a valid svn repository but queries by date wouldn t work just like they don t in any case where the dates are not monotonically increasing with revision

435719
google-chrome	firefox
edit google-chrome and firefox do not have this issue

435775
tracking	robot
this is exactly what i m doing here as my last year project except one thing that my project is about tracking the pitch of human singing voice and i don t have the robot to play the tune

435799
value	field
i realize how to put value and expression in the max min and the gridline interval field although its more of a question what expression i should put there

435814
linux	osx
runs on windows linux osx

435830
document	element
unfortuantely the nodes aren t really in any particular order and apparently .net requires the configsections element be the 1st child of the document

435831
vb.net	vb6
if costs are a constraint you could try this there is a wizard in visual-studio that will attempt to upgrade vb6 to vb.net

435842
vb.net	vb6
in case you were able to migrate it to vb6 you can use the code advisor to see how you can fix your project to be compatible to vb.net then you can migrate to vb.net in case it success you can use this tool to convert it to c# or the reflector

435846
any	set
i did not set any values to the session so .net would not pass a cookie

435853
webforms	asp.net
i have a simple form with some plain html input like bellow using asp.net webforms not mvc

435853
contains	elements
when i do a postback to the server the values of the textbox are not contains in the request.form elements

435855
jquery	dojo
javascript libraries like jquery prototype and dojo can help with this

435865
javascript	dom
the best way to include files via javascript is to insert a new dom element

435892
children	tree
this is made worse by the fact that the tree is collapsed by default but expanding the roots doesn t really help as each has many children and it would look cluttered

435895
python	java
implicit in your question is the assumption that a high-level language like python or perl or java or ... is fast enough small enough .

435927
compact-framework	.net
so can anybody recommend a .net compact-framework component for producing pdfs

435948
vb.net	vb6
there are applications out there that do a rather good job migrating from vb6 to vb.net

435949
hide	show
first you can use tree.setrootvisible true to show the root node or tree.setrootvisible false to hide it

435949
children	nodes
second you can use tree.setshowsroothandles true to request that a tree s top-level nodess â the root nodes if it is visible or its children if not â have handles that let them be expanded or collapsed

435954
mstest	mbunit
mbunit and mstest have timeout attributes

435965
foundation	cocoa
cocoa is a development framework it s actually an umbrella framework which combines three other frameworks foundation appkit and coredata

435965
nsstring	nsobject
for example cocoa defines things like nsstring and nsobject

435965
python	java
cocoa can currently be used with other language bindings such as python or ruby and used to be used with java as well

435978
deployment	install
if you want to install the .net with your setup you should add it under pre-requisites on the property pages of your setup and deployment project

435999
directory	folder
your newly created jar should be in your project directory s dist folder

436032
smalltalk	lisp
you can write a complete high performance os in a high level language like lisp or smalltalk with only a few minor parts in c

436040
double-quotes	spaces
added double-quotes for all file names so that files with spaces can still be found by the merge tool i tested this in msys git from powershell

436076
swing	awt
swing or awt which are the java ui toolkits both handle events - check out the official swing event tutorial for examples

436083
.net	wcf
can a client running .net 2.0 access and consume the wcf service

436093
ruby	php
php s advantage over java python ruby etc is that you can quickly hack up web pages with some logic in them and that s all well and good

436094
shell	tcsh
people familiar with the readline editline capabilities for modern shell such as bash and tcsh will find most of the command editing features of jline to be familiar

436106
any	set
no databases no locking problems and if you use a directory for which a quota is set or a ramdisk with fixed size you shouldn t run into any problems

436116
contains	set
you have a set which contains publishdates

436119
compact-framework	.net
unfortunatly cultureinfo.getcultures method is not supported by .net compact-framework but you can iterate through available cultures on the device by checking on culturetype enumeration

436147
constructor	private
methods defined inside the constructor have access to private variables because all functions have access to the scope in which they were defined

436147
getter	setter
you can still have private variables but if you want methods defined on the prototype to have access to them you should define getter and setter on the this object which the prototype methods along with everything else will have access to

436153
click	mouse
the only way i can think of off the top of my head is to use quartz event taps to capture all mouse click and then figure out if they re over a transparent area of your windows manually

436154
firefox	safari
it works on safari but in firefox i just get an almost-empty page with nothing but the following text

436169
dialog	pop-up
i don t think enabling anonymous access would make sense here since i want access to the website to be password protected pop-up username password dialog when you first navigate to the url

436171
web-services	api
currently i m testing mediawiki api web-services interface but my intended usage will most likely conflict with the gpl license

436186
callback	methods
here s the problem in step 5 even though server receives nothing ondatareceive the callback methods is called and the server finds itself in an infinite loop

436206
google-chrome	safari
webkit has a few bugs that prevent our software from running in this browser and safari google-chrome etc

436206
google-chrome	safari
most bugs are related to standard compliance so i expect safari and google-chrome to copy the patches once webkit accepts them

436211
double	int
value types int double object

436217
contains	any
one of the examples of integration with bug-tracker and commit policy enforcing could be trac s svn pre post-commit hook scripting which can refuse commit if commit message doesn t reference any ticket in bug-tracker and add comments to existing tickets based on message contents commit message may contains something like fixes #1 #2 and #8 where #1 #2 #8 are the tickets numbers

436265
constructor	object
this seems to be better than duplicating code in the constructor but i wondered if is a common approach when wanting to clear an object

436276
configuration	logging
i haven t been able to find any documentation on how to configure hibernate s logging using the xml style configuration file for log4j

436276
configuration	logging
is this even possible or do i have use a properties style configuration file to control hibernate s logging

436281
radio-button	selected
an implementation of a radio-button -- an item that can be selected or deselected and which displays its state to the user

436281
selected	button
used with a buttongrouping object to create a grouping of button in which only one button at a time can be selected

436302
mbunit	nunit
it seems like fitnesse is yet another testing framework like nunit or mbunit or any of the others because you define inputs and output that you want to see but it seems to be aimed at testing the application as a whole rather than as units

436309
environment	building
not having a trusted building environment and having to figure out how to rebuilding is a nighmare

436329
webforms	asp.net
i d like to start using asp.net mvc for pretty much all the reasons that makes it different from webforms logical urls no viewstate more control over html unit testing etc.. but don t want to make the dev process over complicated so

436329
any	set
any reasons you can t set asp.net-mvc websites up as website projects instead of apps so they don t have to be explicitly compiled throughout the dev process

436397
malloc	free
allocate with malloc a sufficient buffer which then becomes your problem to free

436400
boost	stl
i am a quite capable gdb user but stl and boost easily crush my debugging skills

436408
mbunit	nunit
the difference between nunit mbunit and fitnesse is that nunit mbunit are intended to be used for unit tests while fitnesse is for acceptance tests

436409
complex-numbers	numerical
assuming this is a situation where complex-numbers are not involved. if i m not sure about the numerical error i would probably evaluate sqrt max y 0 instead

436410
derived-class	base-class
this is why you cannot create a derived-class that doesn t call a base-class

436413
hide	show
how can i hide the navigation bar when the user puts the iphone in landscape orientation and have it show again on portrait view

436416
derived-class	base-class
yes - this happens with any constructor in the derived-class if you don t explicitly call a base-class constructor

436417
firefox	safari
this is currently supported in ie safari and firefox 3.1 alpha

436421
virtualbox	vmware
what s your choice vmware virtualbox or ms virtual pc server

436423
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc allows you to use webforms as the default template language but i d advise looking into cleaner templating languages such as nvelocity

436427
installation	environment
the penalty you pay is waiting for django installation in each of your virtual environment

436432
internet-explorer	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox but in internet-explorer it does nothing.also if i open the site from my harddrive it works but it only works for the link once then i have to reload the whole page.

436438
vb.net	vb6
theoretically you could convert vb5 to vb6 and then vb6 to vb.net and then vb.net to c# but that just sounds crazy to me as i type it

436440
vmware	esx
we have both the full blown esx for virtual servers and the vmware workstations for development testing

436442
macports	fink
i wouldn t use macports or fink for any critical apps

436442
macports	fink
perhaps it s just me but i ve had about a 50-50 success rate in installing apps using macports and fink

436443
copy-constructor	constructor
similarly it is a good way to shrink to fit a container as well but using the copy-constructor instead of the default constructor

436445
worksheet	excel
there are 35 worksheet in the original excel containing many recursive calculations all of which i ve converted to javascript

436452
ubuntu	osx
verified on osx ubuntu and rhel

436454
contains	any
unit tests tell programmers whether the code contains any defects and acceptance tests tell business analysts that the applications meets user expectations

436460
spawn	exit
when you redirect the output it spawn a child shell process changes the directory in the child process and exit

436466
lookup	any
so i wonder if anyone knows of any sort of an existing library or has a nice routine that can handle this formula parsing and database lookup aggregate-functions resolution requirements

436477
web-config	app-config
you must set the maxconnection parameter at the app-config or web-config file

436494
virtualbox	vmware
i ve used vmware when the company would pay for it vmware server when the company would not virtualbox because it s free decent and supports snapshots parallels on the mac which i bought and xen

436498
webforms	asp.net
if you re used to the postback model of asp.net webforms it may be a little harder to grasp at first but it s very easy to understate

436498
webforms	asp.net
any controls that work with asp.net webforms will work with asp.net mvc as long as it does not rely on postback

436503
google-chrome	firefox
currently there s somewhat of an arms race between google-chrome firefox and webkit s javascript interpreters which has really improved the speed situation with javascript

436506
document	editing
i d like to document its features with a tool that will keep all the functionality and actions organized and grouping for easy editing and can export the documentation in various formats html pdf

436526
virtualization	vmware
my reason is simple before vmware released vmware and vmware server the virtualization platform formerly known as vmware gsx the market for vm hosts was limited and expensive

436535
multiplication	division
can be fast or it can be awfully slow even if division is done entirely in hardware if it is done using a div instruction this instruction is about 3 to 4 times slower than a multiplication on modern cpus

436535
cpu-architecture	32-bit
the code below assumes that you want to divide an unsigned 32-bit integer by three and that you c compiler knows about 64 bit integer numbers note even on a 32 bit cpu-architecture most c compilers can handle 64 bit integers just fine

436535
32-bit	64bit
in a 64bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32-bit application in a 32-bit application multiplying two 64bit numbers take 3 multiplications and 3 additions on 32-bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32-bit machine

436535
multiplication	division
you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate them on the fly that would be slower than hardware division

436540
python	c++
there s a series of blog postings starting here that extensively covers getting started with python-enabled gdb and offers several tutorials on using python for defining new gdb commands and pretty printing of c++ data structures

436550
noclassdeffounderror	classpath
the point is a noclassdeffounderror is not necessarily a classpath problem

436550
hosts-file	hosts
on many operating systemd this would triggers a hosts lookup that would use the hostss-file etc hostss on nix systemd windows system32 drivers etc hostss on a windows system.

436559
contains	elements
i have a rather large list of data that contains 5 properties per elements

436561
any	set
1 objects declared as characters char shall be large enough to store any member of the implementation s basic character set

436584
sharing	share
services can share baseaddress value including port # s if the net.tcp port sharing service is running

436589
perl	php
os x already comes with apache php perl and python

436604
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
it could be any number of things but i suggest you start with your viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods as well as viewwilldisappear and viewdiddisappear

436606
void	main
static void main string arguments

436637
decimal	hex
utf-8 encodings are just as unintelligible as html entity encodings for those who don t understand them but they have the advantage of rendering as special characters rather than hard to understand decimal or hex encodings

436648
breakpoints	hang
when i m debugging threads in delphi bds 2006 with updates 2 my ide often hang when the execution runs into a breakpoints that i have set after the app started

436652
oracle	mysql
i m thinking of applications like database management systems mysql oracle sql server web servers apache iis or even we browsers look at the way chrome was written

436655
mouseover	mouseout
i think the best approach would be to leave the hover behavior as a fall-back for non-javascript users and then use jquery to create mouseover and mouseout event handler to create a different effect for javascript-enabled users

436666
firefox	safari
while this works like a dream for us in firefox and safari it explodes with delight in ie 6 and ie7 with the error object doesn t support this property or method

436669
any	set
are there any instructions or best practices about how to set up a development environment so that when i sit down at either machine i have the same files to work with and the ability to utilize version-control

436675
authentication	login
if you want the first option then the login page they re getting forwarded to will need to read the currently logged-in user and act based on that since they would have had to correctly authentication to get this far

436684
linux	unix
systems programming that directly uses unix linux or win32 system calls

436687
debugging	trace
nb most of the loggers use the debugging level however org.hibernate.type uses trace

436687
debugging	trace
in previous versions of hibernate org.hibernate.type also used debugging but as of hibernate 3 you must set the level to trace or all in order to see the jdbc parameter binding logging

436690
static-classes	static-class
vb.net does have static-classes just like in c# because in vb.net a module is a static-class

436690
protected	public
perhaps you haven t marked your public private protected access correctly

436719
assign	add
referencing by node id good but you ll need to add ids to the original xml if you don t have already and you will need to update the ids if the original changes so you may need an id counter to assign id or otherwise use generated guid as ids

436742
implements	extends
given a class bar that extends class foo which implements interface deedum

436742
inherited	accessor
in other words bar doesn t inherited accessor from foo and can t override properties

436742
inherited	accessor
why can t java inherited accessor and why did they choose such an odd alternative

436742
inherited	accessor
if you have another class bar that extends foo and sets the inherited accessor in an initialization block

436747
hide	show
so it can check a conditional and then decide to show or hide a section

436754
instance-variables	accessor
accessor methods themselves getdee are inherited but instance-variables are not

436758
inherited	subclass
you are hiding the inherited variables with ones defined in the subclass

436759
ref	out
i really meant by reference versus out ref

436759
pointers	stack
far as i understand unlike ref where it copies the pointers and creates a new space on stack to use that pointers but won t change the pointers

436769
ref	out
ref and out is exactly the same as far i know with the exception-handling that an out parameter cannot be initializer

436770
constructor	object
this seems to be better than duplicating code in the constructor but i wondered if this foo is a common approach when wanting to clear an object

436773
pointers	stack
just because the variables lives on stack if it s a local variables doesn t mean you can t create a pointers to it - and indeed that s the case with reference-type as well

436773
pointers	stack
the pointers within refmethod is to the outer variables - and the variables itself lives on stack as it s an uncaptured local variables

436773
ref	out
as leppie said ref and out are identical except for the rules on definite assignment - in fact the only difference in il is an attributes applied to out parameters

436773
ref	out
see my article on parameter-passing for more details about ref out in general

436781
ip-address	proxy
you could track by ip-address but proxy servers and nat

436798
value	field
otherwise you wouldn t have been allowed to call it on a bar instance variables in the first place. that methods returns the value of the dee field but it s the dee field defined in the foo class â the class where the methods itself was defined

436798
delphi	c++
but that s simply not the way java or c# or c++ or delphi or any other language i know of works

436802
unsigned	integer
the type signed char was introduced to make available a one-byte signed integer type on those systems which implement plain char as unsigned

436818
expression	evaluation
as efficiency is concerned it could well be that evaluation a single xpath expression may turn out to be more efficient too however to find if this is true we need to write an application that will compare the timings of the two methods

436823
punctuation	words
they are used for respectively hyphenation and joining words indicating a range punctuation and a mathematical symbol

436829
google-apps	gmail
i use google-apps for my domain email and i was wondering if i could use that account for openid instead of the regular gmail account

436848
constructor	object
i haven t looked at the smo code but have you tried using the constructor on the database object

436890
pointers	stack
i remember code from a previous workplace that sounded similar having explicit bounds checks on stack pointers and throwing an exception-handling manually

436893
duplicates	contains
you need to make a decision on duplicates titles or titles that contains other title as substring either take longest title or link to most recent article or prefer article from same category

436895
constructor	object
since the contract of std auto_ptr is that assignment transfer of ownership your constructor now states implicitly that an a object has ownership of the pointer to b it s passed

436897
deployment	install
maybe you want to create a separate project of type setup and deployment to create an msi install instead which does not start your application

436912
paradox	bde
you can change the default location of the .net file if you go into the bde administration in the control panels and go into configuration - drivers - native - paradox and change the path to somewhere that is writable my document for example

436942
bazaar	git
git mercurial and bazaar are three options

436943
ref	out
actually using ref or out on reference-type also creates a pointer...not to the object but to the reference to the object

436944
value	field
is it returning a string or the actual expected value of the field

436945
overlap	margins
on column2 setting a left margins of the width of the image + the amount of separation you want for example 160 should work but you can play with it then making the width of the column2 100 of the remaining width should prevent your overlap

436946
hashmap	arrays
i m not familiar with java hashmap but could you try using a cell arrays to store the data instead of a struct

436996
versioning	upgrade
why do you want to do this and why don t you want to upgrade the delphi versioning

436997
perl	php
languages like php and perl use for variables making it a non-issue

437001
value	field
in the abstract data model entities have identity independently of the value of their field

437001
json	xml
you might be better off representing chunks of xml as simple values in m just as in the json world you often get strings containing chunks of html

437002
webforms	asp.net
i m used to doing everything as click event handlers in asp.net webforms

437010
static-methods	unit-testing
in microsoft s unit-testing namespace microsoft.visualstudio.testtools.unit-testing there are assemblyinitialize and assemblycleanup attributes you can apply to static-methods and they will be called before and after all tests respectively

437016
haskell	lisp
in haskell you can define an if function which is impossible in lisp

437024
debian	linux
it s free and you can install ubuntu or debian linux on the simulated arm core

437034
semantic-web	ontology
the sioc semantically-interlinked online communities core ontology provides the main concepts and properties required to describe information from online communities message boards wikis weblogs etc. on the semantic-web

437035
if-statement	loops
this can also be used in expressions like for loops or if-statement

437050
cruisecontrol.net	mbunit
i m most comfortable with mbunit for unit-testing and cruisecontrol.net for codeigniter so right now they are the front runners

437055
order	join
the only times i ve used a right join have been when i want to look at two sets of data and i already have the join in a specific order for the left or inner join from a previously written query

437075
mouseleave	mouseenter
essentially i m going to create the linklabel from a textblock and handle mouseenter mouseleave and mouseleftbuttonup events

437092
order	add
in order to get my wordpress install running without the index.php in the url all i had to do was add

437098
python	java
i know most of you don t read smalltalk but the code should be readable even for non-smalltalkers and a corresponding perl python java c# piece of code also written and executed in 1 minute or so taking the above as a guide

437135
order-of-operations	operators
the order-of-operations is evident in the typed order of the operators and the variables

437160
web2py	django
has anyone used any of these pylons web2py django with ironpython

437165
contains	any
ash clarified that it s de-normalization by design it s a pivot model where each row can contains one of any four data types. yeah that kind of design can be cumbersome when you normalize it

437168
queue	fifo
should fifo queue be synchronized if there is only one reader and one writer

437177
queue	fifo
yes if the reader and writer interact with the fifo queue from different threads

437229
alter-column	alter-table
upgrade all the tables alter-table alter-column

437233
ruby-on-rails	rspec
after doing some work with ruby ruby-on-rails and rspec last summer and i learned to tatft

437258
binary	hex
looks like it converts the binary source of clr stored procs as some kind of hex encoded text

437263
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it s such a large derivation from webforms that you will find many developers that don t live and breathe coding will not be able to use it correctly and you will constantly be fighting to keep the asp.net-mvc usage correct as most developers will treat it the same way as webforms

437265
getter	setter
if adding a setter and getter to a class exposes information not meant to be exposed you should consider friends if you can t find your design being faulty using friend is valid

437265
getter	setter
if you can add a setter and getter without that being destructive to the interface then you should avoid making other classes friends

437271
32-bit	64bit
how do i force my application to run as 32-bit on a 64bit machine

437273
checkbox	button
imagine that b is a mediator class and a and c are components that need to be managed do you really think it makes sense that a button should need access to the implementation of a checkbox

437295
linux	unix
sysdeps unix sysv linux init-first.c

437295
any	set
you will see that argc argv and environ alias for __ environ are set before any global constructor are called the init functions

437296
bazaar	git
what do folks here see as the relative strengths and weaknesses of git mercurial and bazaar

437296
bazaar	git
git mercurial bazaar and also darcs monotone and bitkeeper are distributed version control systems

437296
.when	ready
they allow to use publishing .when ready

437296
bazaar	git
git has git-svn bazaar has bzr-svn and mercurial has hgsubversion extension

437296
bazaar	git
i know mercurial and bazaar only from their documentation various discussion on irc and mailing lists and blog posts and articles comparing various version control systems some of which are listed on gitcomparison page on git wiki

437317
contains	set
another option though i don t like this one as much but jquery solution may not suit you is to have your model object for your view contains all the view data so that all you need to do is set the single model object and all the lists are loaded directly and strongly typed

437390
controller	routes
user interaction calls methods on the controller which then routes them to the model

437398
environment	building
first get a working local environment with source control ide building and release steps all up on running locally

437407
command-line	cmd
there s a long history of skinning rogue like games or command-line apps in general which isn t quser-interfacete classic asp.net-mvc - it already has a full user-interface instead you re adding a decorator to that user-interface with either a direct translation or another metaphor such as gparted the gnome partition editor which allows construction of a sequence of partition editing cmd by direct manipulation

437413
javafx	swing
i just saw a article on swing being used in javafx

437416
delphi	c++
i currently use delphi 2007 so i m very comfortable with c++ builder s ide its the same as delphi as well as the vcl and rtl

437440
groovy	java
java .net groovy ironruby and f#

437441
any	set
does anyone know if there is any way to set those values or what fields are available

437452
delphi	c++
coming from delphi you ll find the vcl straightforward to use with c++ builder

437452
delphi	c++
there are a few oddities like c++ doesn t hide the fact that tobjects are all really pointers which delphi hides from you and some things like arrays properties are accessed differently

437464
adplus	dump
adplus attaches the cdb debugger to a process in crash mode and will generate crash dump for most exception-handling the process generates

437467
configuration	installation
if there s an installation and configuration script for the application then the place to start would be running that and configuring the dev host to address all issues until the installation succeeds

437467
configuration	upgrade
most server platforms iis or not are capable of being installed on a windows box for exactly this reason among others. in fact non-microsoft server platforms are usually less demanding about windows version and configuration because they don t have any stake in having the host upgrade to a more expensive license

437469
shutdown	restart
when the system is restart all queued up attempts at installation then go through their exit paths with pop-ups that report the installation is being aborted due to system shutdown having been requested

437475
directory	folder
eclipse sets the working directory to the top-level project folder

437478
for-loop	loops
so for example if you have a loops instead of using a for-loops use a while loops make sure the scope of the loops variable is at the form level

437481
hide	show
so you need to show hide it inside every dialog independently

437495
virtual-machine	vmware
they can run it in vmware and will have a virtual-machine complete with operating system and the application you need them to test

437496
python	ruby
the upshot of being a library is that code contracts will work for any .net language c# vb.net f# ruby python javascript lisp smalltalk boo you name it

437507
constructor	object
this allows things like copy constructor where you can access the private member of another object even though there is no real accesses

437518
32-bit	64bit
or if the windows loader is confused by 64bit dlls in the path with the same name as the 32-bit dll it needs

437523
display	width
the menu list items don t have a width defined so they display at 100 width in ie7

437535
delphi	c++
i second going for c++ builder given that you already know delphi

437546
hosts-file	hosts
in particular i m looking for an ip-address that i can put in my hosts that will black-hole a given dns name

437580
gethashcode	tostring
i believe that calling tostring equals and gethashcode result in boxing if the structure does not override the methods

437588
jquery-slider	slider
is there a function on the jquery-slider that gets called on release of the slider

437604
textbox	button
i m trying to write a c# program where when a user enters some data into a textbox and clicks on a save button the information is stored in some sort of file that when the program is opened the next time around the information is automatically loaded in

437609
hosts-file	hosts
i ve used 0.0.0.0 in my hosts to block ad web sites

437631
google-chrome	firefox
it displays them in safari os x firefox 3 windows and google-chrome windows ie displays all the divs in a big stack in the corner.

437635
positioning	slider
function that gets called on slider stop but only if the sliderr positioning has changed

437640
32-bit	16-bit
there are platforms with 16-bit and 32-bit bytes hence char will take up more bits but it is still a byte

437648
callback	methods
unless it throws an exception-handling you don t actually call dispose until the callback methods

437666
default-value	arguments
if you have a methods that takes an arguments and you know t is a type whose default-value is null your methods can use firstordefault to test the object to see if it s empty

437672
http	ssl
i grepped through the files in the subversion .svn directory for the phrase http only to discover that in the file entries the directory itself was still pointing to the non-existent ssl subversion server

437675
disposable	dispose
what if the disposable object is created in one class module say a factory and is handed off to a different class module to be used for a while before being dispose of

437722
executable	upx
i m not sure how to stripes the executable but another thought is to compress it for example using upx which will decompress it and run it in place.

437738
contains	any
the html file does not contains any content-type settings in the head section

437762
msbuild	nant
does anyone know of any msbuild or nant tasks for controlling wise installation studio

437763
return-type	arguments
other than varargs functions though functions which return an int do not have to be declared and functions that return something other than an int do need a declaration that shows the return-type but do not need the prototype for the arguments list

437775
updating	updates
the updates thread controls updating the in game objects positioning

437805
configuration	environment
bringing up a system in a standalone configuration .net cable unplugged wireless radio disabled will seem very slow at first then once the timeouts and various retries have been exceeded should zip along especially if you are still running in a limited startup environment

437808
python	ruby
other options i m looking at are python ironpython ruby ironruby powershell and maybe vb but i m not sure about the ease of implementation with vb

437811
literals	hardcode
hardcode literals should appear in unit tests for the test value unless there is so much reuse of a value within a single test class that a local constant is useful

437812
project-management	project
the reference was to project plans with line items like implement system fred six weeks where project-management consists of conversations like how s it going fred

437814
32-bit	64bit
otoh i stand by my original comment - i believe that 32-bit values are pragmatically adequate and i would use long anyway which would be 64bit on 8-bit machines

437826
shell	bash
change the shell script to i use bash i don t know if ksh is the same

437830
integer	short
on most systems the address of the string will get pushed on the stack and then m as an integer assuming it s an int short char

437847
printf	scanf
in fact one of the main reasons c has optional-arguments is to support the printf scanf family of functions

437847
printf	scanf
as pointed out in one of the comments to my answer some compilers have lint like capabilities that can actually detect erroneous printf scanf calls

437859
safari	opera
it also works for opera and safari too

437865
selected	button
to login to stackoverflow with opera i have to click login selected myopenid from the list type my username hit enter press ctrl+enter to autofill the password on the myopenid site then press the continue button

437868
protected	public
further does the scope public protected private etc. of said methods change the above answer 1

437891
configuration-files	app-config
also don t version-control configuration-files app|web.config instead create an app.default.config and in your projects beforebuild task copy this file to app-config

437903
getter	setter
pointless testing testing the same basic case more than one way or testing things so trivial that they really do not need to be tested like auto-generated getter and setter

437910
cursor	row
run the cursor for each fetched row

437912
pivot-table	crosstab
crosstab pivot-table workbench

437918
required	checked
indexes improve searches by limiting how many checked are required

437918
aggregate-functions	sum
an aggregate-functions count max min sum avg has to run through all the entries in a column regardless

437927
postdata	request
more specific info if needed i m confused as to how to configure the post request i mean when you normally postdata to a form don t you usually load the page your posting to

437945
aggregate-functions	sum
an aggregate-functions count max min sum avg has to run through all the entries in a columns being summed regardless.

437960
protected	public
checking parameter validity is clearly more important for all public functions than protected or private

437960
protected	public
i will often dispense with checking for certain private methods although you take the risk that someone maybe you makes then protected or public someday and you also skip the chance to catch a data inconsistency one step closer to the source

437965
value	field
i believe if you have multiple field named amount the value will be comma delimited

437989
numeric	digits
numeric strings consist of optional sign any number of digits optional decimal part and optional exponential part

437994
checkbox	textbox
i want to create a kind of 4 x 3 matrix with textbox and checkbox

437994
checkbox	textbox
whether the element is checkbox or textbox depends upon the values in database.i want it to be dynamic

438000
.net	wcf
for remote configuring with the .net software which can go across firewalls i am considering using wcf

438000
.net	wcf
i know only a little about wcf so far but i ve read that it is supposed to be interoperable with environments other than .net

438024
selected	button
then you can hit that letter to selected the menu button or other input control

438053
value	field
then if you need that value on the server-side either store the value in a cookie or in a hidden html field for easy access

438057
quicksort	in-place
you can usually only get 2 of these at once - quicksort gets you 1 and 3 mergesort gets you 2 and 3 and an in-place mergesort gets you 1 and 2

438061
environment	building
if you re looking at a remote server call and your built-in support in your embedded environment is basic http look at building your server-side as rest-formatted methods

438084
derived-class	base-class
if unlike your example the methods in the base-class is abstract and you must provide an implementation but it doesn t make sense for the derived-class to provide one then there is probably something wrong with the design of the classes

438090
command-line	cmd
takes a cmd-line as argument with a number of seconds for that cmd to run

438095
handler	service
so i wrote the following generic service that i call from the activityâ s async event handler and that can reused by various async activities error handling omitted

438096
debian	linux
debian linux has a really awesome tool called pbuilder which creates an image of a freshly installed system and then attempts to build your code

438096
environment	building
automate your building from a chrooted environment or a virtual-machine that looks like a fresh install

438100
put	get
most of the articles i have read involving the industry suggest that someone with no professional experience looking to get break into gaming should put together a portfolio of small games you have written demonstrating your abilities

438107
worksheet	excel
if ihis is the case or even if it s not but you want unformatted data one way off the top of my head would be to copy the worksheet to another worksheet and transform the excel column with the val address function and reformat it without leading zeroes

438112
jruby	mri
to do this i want to use ruby-on-rails on on mri - not jruby or rbj

438112
ruby-on-rails	rspec
how can i use rspec to test ruby-on-rails models that depend on external processes having access to the tables managed by ruby-on-rails

438116
sqldatasource	gridview
the gridview is bound to a sqldatasource object

438142
any	set
are there any other security settings that can be provided set

438144
windows-xp	windows
msi 4.5 hotfix - error message when you use windows installer msi 4.5 to install multiple msi packages in windows server 2008 windows vista windows server 2003 or windows-xp api call rejected - no actions in context

438188
contains	elements
that is i want to divide the collection into sub-collections which each contains a subset of the elements where the last collection can be ragged

438233
dictionary	arrays
you might consider writing a lightweight class of your own to express nodes and store links to other nodes in a dictionary or arrays

438243
ethernet	packets
if you re not using tcp then the packets will fall out of the ethernet hole and evaporate into the atmosphere

438294
smalltalk	scheme
smalltalk already has one seaside and plt scheme has one in it s distro but i think it d be a good all-round project to try as it covers networking multithreading i o user-extensibility etc etc

438325
constructor	object
so we would like to know can the clr really instantiate an object after the call to the constructor and return a null

438331
swt	awt
i implemented a osk in swt and awt for my company

438331
swt	awt
for swt it works very good but in awt their are some threading and focuss issues

438334
constructor	object
other than that a constructor will always either return an object or initialize a struct or throw an exception

438335
click	mouse
when a mouse click event happen inside the canvas for a location x y in pixels

438335
click	mouse
i want to check if the click mouse positioning is inside within a specific shape considering the rotation angle and measurement unit conversion

438339
constructor	object
a constructor always returns a constructed object or throws an exception

438365
lazy-evaluation	maybe
a large exception-handling hierarchy is useless because clients are known to be lazy-evaluation and will end up checking only for the top nodes maybe only for the hierarchy root

438381
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
i ve tried doing this in viewdidload viewwillappear and viewdidappear with no success

438388
contains	set
the problem i now face is that when i set child.parent the parent.children collection doesn t automatically contains the new child

438389
exception-handling	try-catch
having a try-catch clause in your main thread doesn t catch and exception-handling from another thread running

438398
revision	updates
i d like to updates the highest revision number to a file inside a subversion repository after each commit

438398
revision	updates
i have a file version.php where i have the version revision numbers but only updates anotherfile.php in my commit - this won t change the version revision information version.php has

438412
exception-handling	try-catch
so even surrounding all the code in main with a try-catch block will not catch all exception-handling generated by that code

438431
children	nodes
when the user expands a nodes the children of the nodes are generated from the results of this property

438433
contains	set
so to do this i use various variables in the thread accessed by get set routines that use critical sections to contains status information

438435
revision	svn
the deployment pulls the latest code or a particular revision along with the svn revision number puts the version in the relvent places assemblyinfo php version file etc. then deploys it to test uat live whatever

438454
internet-explorer	firefox
for firefox there is the firebug extension safari webkit has web inspector opera has dragonfly and for the internet-explorer there is the internet-explorer developer toolbar

438458
buffering	streaming
is it as simple as creating a buffering for the input streaming and then break up the transmission into separate messages according to the sof and eof

438461
versioning	upgrade
to make matters worse because of contractual limitations it is not always possible to upgrade the clients to the latest and greatest so we must branch fix test and release on the versioning they currently have yielding yet another versioning number

438463
dialog	pop-up
my problem here is i need joptionpane dialog to pop-up on time according to what i set but problem here is when i minimize it the dialog will pop-up but not in the top of windows when other application like explorer firefox is running anyone know how to pop-up the dialog box on top of windows no matter what application is running

438480
temporary	rvalue
on of the advantages of the new semantics is that you can pass to the move constructor also a temporary or any rvalue

438482
administration	account
then you can continue with advanced features like account administration and login statistics

438493
registration	login
have a look at the asp.net membership provider and also the login controls which provides the user-interface for the login as well as registration screens out of the box

438526
virtualbox	vmware
i would suggest creating a virtual machine in vmware virtualbox whatever with these specifications in terms of ram and diskspace and then do some experiments

438532
required	checked
slow parsing - there is no static checked of the grammar neither to hint about excessive lookahead required nor to verify basic errors such as for instances usage of left recursion which leads to infinite recursion in recursive-descent parsing ll grammars

438534
savepoints	rollback
dbmss support savepoints which allow partial rollback

438541
constructor	object
it s true that you can t use the constructor to create a closure over it s variables but you can of course surround the prototypical methods with an anonymous function and get private variables shared between instances of the object

438546
lookup	any
i am looping over xml files and performing a lookup using value within this file if the lookup doesn t return any value i d like to report on this and then not perform any other tasks for this file

438557
value	field
as we keep tracks of all these sql statements and as inserts are global inserts a track of all field value is kept in the insert statement it is then possible to

438566
http	ssl
one of the sites has an ssl certificate installed and was running fine on http

438566
http	ssl
the problem i have is that when i publish my app from vs2005 to the site with ssl the https urls stop working and i can only use http

438594
python	java
i have a python program which runs on the cpython implementation and inside it i must call a function defined in a java program

438602
solaris	linux
completely portable between linux solaris hpux and windows apps run out of the box without a need for a single change

438602
haskell	lisp
pps if i had to give up smalltalk lisp or haskell would be my second choice but both do not offer ide s which are anyway near to what i am used to these days

438604
getter	setter
is it synthesized or did you write your own setter and getter

438606
buffering	streaming
as a final thought - if you are dealing with bulk data you can get better throughput using idatareader since this is a streaming api where-as datatable is a buffering api

438624
attributes	properties
does it read an attributes of the properties

438630
contains	set
if you set a breakpoint on the line contains the declaration and then go into the advanced properties for that breakpoint i believe you can set options for modification and access of that variables

438635
malloc	free
malloc and free and other memory-related functions are weak symbols which means that you can simply reimplement them and your versions will be used

438635
malloc	free
if you compile a shared library with malloc free and friends you re all set

438637
cvs	git
hundson is easy to install and comes with a trac plugin svn cvs git plugins and a doxygen plugin and others for almost anything you can think of

438639
fogbugz	svn
we successfully have fogbugz working with svn although our svn is hosted locally

438641
any	set
if its immediate attributes has been set to true the button logic cannot read the submitted component values using getvalue or any object the component is bound to

438643
python	java
i don t know for python byt last time i had to call java from c application nt service i had to load jvm.dll

438655
click	mouse
what i usually do is right-click the stringcollection in the editor and click go to definition then a windows will pop up with the title stringcollection from metadata then i just hover the mouse pointers to the title and a tooltip appears with the location of the assembly where the class comes from

438658
python	java
you ll have to create a python c extension that embeds java - based on something like or else you ll have to start java in a separate subprocess

438675
contains	elements
how in jquery can i selected just the links inside a div elements and not the child div elementss contains within that div

438689
realloc	malloc
but as a programming excercise and seeing that you work with c++ you will need to override the global new and delete as well as malloc free and realloc

438689
realloc	malloc
you d think that only overriding new and delete would be enough but the std string and other classes are likely to use malloc and especially realloc

438693
python	java
i count 6 lines of java 3 lines of python and you re up and running

438695
gethashcode	equals
equals and gethashcode result in

438704
filtering	sorting
i wanted it to be fairly easy to use in other places and didn t feel like hardcoding the sorting and filtering into query expressions so i looked for a way to build the expressions dynamically and the best way to do this i found was with dynamic linq

438707
internet-explorer	firefox
it is working fine in firefox but the images are not showing up at all in internet-explorer ie7 8

438711
select	union
i cant use union since the tables aren t the same and the multiple table select times out

438717
lookup	any
to allow for partials and explicit specializations when the compiler parsing a class templates it does not perform any lookup in dependent base classes

438717
using-declaration	typename
note the 98 versioning of the standard didn t allow typename to be used with a using-declaration and so the above fix was not possible

438763
contains	set
get a set of elements contains all of the unique immediate children of each of the matched set of elements

438768
pascal	delphi
.inc - delphi pascal include files

438782
msbuild	nant
however since i m not using nant and not using msbuild proj files i am unsure on how to get this

438783
opensolaris	linux
linux opensolaris on top of virtual box on top of linux

438792
internet-explorer	firefox
so firefox was showing them using approximate colors while internet-explorer was totally ignoring them

438795
contains	elements
i was hoping that since i was able to tell a storyboard to begin by referencing it with a binding expression that i should be able to do the exact same thing from a windows that contains this user-controls as a child elements

438827
linked-list	arrays
it is a resizable arrays not a linked-list

438830
numeric	nan
in addition to the previous correct answers it is probably worth pointing out that not a number nan in its general usage is not equivalent to a string that cannot be evaluated as a numeric value

438830
numeric	nan
nan is usually understood as a numeric value used to represent the result of an impossible calculation - where the result is undefined

438830
zero	nan
in c# nan is defined as a property of the single and double numeric types and is used to refer explicitly to the result of diving zero by zero

438835
any	set
i can probably just set up a forward within iis to do this but i m looking for a more elegant solution that doesn t require any custom iis configuration like that

438852
any	set
with the advent of xp you can set vectored exception-handling handler that gets a chance at stack overflow prior to any stack-based structured exception-handling handler this is being the very reason - structured exception-handling handler are stack-based

438854
python	php
php arrays are much more like python dicts than they are like python lists

438858
dictionary	arrays
sounds like what you need might be a dictionary rather than an arrays if you want to insert into specified indices

438876
any	set
however it should give you enough to change or set any or all of the other fields available

438876
configuration	environment
i pass in lpath and i get the buildnumber from the available environment variables in cc.net and i can use this script over and over again just changing what i pass in on the command line in the configuration file

438885
contains	set
file name can t be relied upon to contains anything usable as a filename and an attacker could easily set it to something including a .. path part to overwrite files outside the uploads folder

438891
directory	folder
if your host is running apache you can secure folder using .htaccess on iis you can do the same through directory security

438909
contains	elements
does the elements contains links which link to each other

438916
latex	tex
tex latex

438949
environment	building
but your site will building and publishing fine to whatever environment you send it to with the debugging set to true

438954
internet-explorer	firefox
the main problem i m trying to solve is that internet-explorer 7 flashes blinks the page even if only some of the content changes firefox does this much more smoothly

438954
internet-explorer	firefox
now the footer comes from the server a little bit later than the parts before it and so it flashes in internet-explorer firefox displays the page smoothly

438963
contains	any
the detours package also contains utilities to attach arbitrary dlls and data segments called payloads to any win32 binary

438965
stream	send
i ve made a server httphandler in .net which never closes the connection and send the events to the client by writing out bytes to the http response stream connectedclientcontext.response.outputstream.write etc and i have a .net client application which can read these messages okay

438971
windows-xp	windows
this solution works as expected in both windows-xp sp3 x86 and windows vista sp1 x64

438976
fflush	gets
in addition if the output buffering gets too big it will fflush anyway

438985
javascript	dom
you then have to securely communicate the pass phrase to the user s and write some javascript to download the encrypted content prompt for a passphrase decrypt the data and incorporate it into the dom

438986
smalltalk	lisp
1 smalltalk s rpn-like control flow by messages is like lisp - it s regular and cool but weirds people out

438990
any	set
this query assumes that the id is a unique value at least for any given business_key and that it is set to not null

439012
jquery-dialog	themeroller
it seems that the filament group made their own version of the standard jquery dialogs specific to jquery ui for use with themeroller and the standard jquery-dialog won t work

439017
communication	messages
it is however not necessary to use messages to communication with a thread

439024
communication	messages
the question delphi multithreading messages loop also contains a few examples of communication between threads

439040
blender	ogre
i would start by looking at blender or the viewer tools from ogre openscenegraph and similar tools

439049
checkbox	button
my suggestion is to use a checkbox instead of a button

439076
checkbox	button
thus after the page is reinitialised the first click of the button will enable all checkbox

439076
defined	declare
of course this wouldn t work in the current location as it is declare before the form is defined

439076
document	element
you would either need to register this as a closure to be run once the document has loaded or alternatively pull this line out and put it in scripting tags that occur after the form element in the document this isn t the cleanest way to do it but works for quick-and-dirty development

439076
checkbox	button
if i clicked this button with all checkbox checked i would expect it to behave consistently regardless of how those checkbox got to that state which should be irrelevant

439076
variables	boolean
and asides from the fact that we re hopefully getting rid of this variables it ought to be a boolean rather than an integer as it only has two states.

439105
restart	reload
if you create long running worklfows that are persisted in a database to the runtime will be able to restart these workflows are not reloaded into memory until there is some external event that reload them

439133
oracle	mysql
now if you are designing a commercial application where you want the customer to be able to use one of several back-end options when they implement it then you may have to specify we support oracle ms sql or mysql and code to those specific options

439143
environment	building
however i know that i need to use an automated building scripting to set up a codeigniter environment but i ve never used one and don t know where to begin

439143
msbuild	nant
i ve heard that nant is the really good one although msbuild is similar

439144
sql-server	oracle
to that end sql-server oracle etc

439156
arguments	default
can you override the constructor arguments for a named instance it seems you can only do it for a default instance

439162
debugging	trace
do you use the above as i have a feeling many are using just that or do you create named loggers such as debugging trace error modulea etc

439173
click	mouse
the dialog is displayed and responded to click hooray but it appears that the primary app no longer is processing or dispatching windows messages because it quits painting and no longer responds to mouse events

439193
gradient	clipping
you can use the kcgtextclip drawing mode to set the clipping path and then fill with a gradient

439196
python	ruby
some sort of basic python ruby i think not...

439222
administration	credentials
you say that the windows service is started using administration credentials

439222
administration	account
do you mean the actual administrator account or a user in the administration grouping

439231
mobile-safari	safari
the best i ve seen is launching a page in mobile-safari with instructions on how to manually add the bookmark or telling the user to add it on desktop safari and sync the bookmark back to the iphone

439253
authentication	login
in other word how do i call the authentication service from the login control

439253
authentication	login
ok what i mean is that by default you can set the membershipprovider property in a login control for authentication

439280
value	field
in your codebehind it is important that the value of the inserted item is string.empty for the required field validator to work

439282
integer	digits
you have to know how many decimal digits of precision you want in your random number at which point it s easy to just grab an random integer and divide it

439286
simplemodal	jquery
so i ve been able to get greasemonkey and jquery 1.2.6 to work together without issue but now i m wondering how to embed additional jquery plugins into my greasemonkey script such as eric martin s simplemodal plugin

439286
simplemodal	jquery
the following code gets jquery loaded but i m not sure how to get simplemodal loaded properly

439309
administration	account
how can i configure my wcf service to run under the administration account

439328
administration	account
if you are hosting it as an asp.net service you should run iis process as the administration account

439344
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know that this doesn t exactly answer your question but i would seriously consider whether an asp.net-mvc architecture will truly make your customers happier than a webforms architecture - especially since they ll never really notice

439363
any	set
i do this in c# so i don t know if this will react any differently but i set up an empty test class with the main methods and then set the project to startup with that class file

439378
jquery-plugins	jquery
most of the jquery-plugins are not available like the jquery api but you can host it yourself

439402
header-only	boost
so my question is basically is there a way of selectively building boost that only copies the headers for the libraries i m interested in and only building library files for the non header-only libraries i m interested in and the boost libraries they are dependent on course

439426
rendering	redraw
but you can t control when the browser chooses to rendering short of doing it all in javascript with all the downsides that entails and even then the browser might redraw slowly

439443
any	set
is there any way to programatically set what the unique cache key for this particular request should be

439444
shutdown	restart
iisreset can cause a service unavailable message to display for a short time as iis is shutdown and restart

439450
radio-button	selected
what about adding a radio-button next to each option and allowing the selected radio-button to determine which option is used

439463
jquery	.post
how do i simply get get and .post values with jquery

439475
value	field
i m not sure exactly what you re trying to do here but you could add a hidden form field then attach a function to both the file input and the url inputs onchange events that would set the hidden-field to this value

439475
value	field
fundamentally i m not even sure that the approach you re currently taking is appropriate - firefox 3 for example doesn t let you edit the contents of a file field directly and as far as i can tell gives you no way to unset a value

439475
radio-button	selected
for example a radio-button to selected between the file upload box or a url resource which disables and enables fields as appropriate

439489
contains	any
the most unfortunate part is there is no longer any source code for the vb6 dll which contains the meat of the logic

439492
virtualbox	vmware
i ve never run vmware in vmware but i ve run virtualpc inside virtualbox without problems so there s no fundamental reason it shouldn t work i suppose.

439497
device-driver	hardware
or if that s impossible to write a filtering device-driver similar to the parport driver but for serial-ports instead of parallel ports which would sit on top of the serial-port hardware driver and which would expose more than one connection point one used by the other application which passes through to the underlying real driver and another back door used by your own application .

439505
double-quotes	single-quotes
use single-quotes for literal char s double-quotes for literal string s like so

439508
filesystems	fileinfo
if you re working with the filesystems using fileinfo and directoryinfo is much simpler than using strings

439529
constructor	object
if the destination of the emitted opcodes is an instance of a class like file for instance try giving your emitter class a constructor that takes an object of that type to use as the destination for emitted code

439553
google-chrome	firefox
note it works fine in firefox 3 and google-chrome

439556
pointers	stack
if you ve got a c++ background and aren t afraid of pointers stack heap etc then this book clr vi c# will give you a superb understanding of .net

439569
overlap	padding
this produces proper results in ie and with a little padding for the internal form fields there s no worry about overlap

439572
dictionary	arrays
my intention is to create a dictionary in c win32 using variant arrays etc and pass it to call a vb

439580
xlsx	xlsb
i need to support all excel formats from 97 through the present including the xlsx and xlsb formats

439589
integer	digits
therefore the integer value for any digits is the digits minus 0 or 48

439608
value	field
then use validators add a required field validator and set the initialvalue property to the value of the new list item unknown in our example

439617
command-line	cmd
this cmd-line runs fine when i just do it from a cmd shell but it hangs in my app

439625
dictionary	map
dictionary is hash based map is a tree based container

439629
contains	elements
the wsdl rightly contains elements with the xs id and xs idref attributes to represent this

439630
constructor	object
if i use the javascript date constructor that takes numbers then i get a date object for my current timezone

439634
constructor	object
i don t want to sound like a wise-crack but you should also check to make sure the data you are passing around really should be passed around passing stuff to a constructor or method for that matter smells a bit like to little emphasis on the behavior of an object

439634
getter	setter
this kind of smell since we are talking about refactoring this horrible word seems appropriate... might also be detected for objects that have a lot read any properties or getter setter

439639
hide	show
if what you are really looking for is a show hide effect you could use javascript to show the larger image if the user click on the smaller image

439641
python	ruby
i m comfortable with ruby but interested in learning python

439647
arrays	loops
there ends up being duplicate teacher names in the arrays when the loops finishes

439653
value	field
so how do i get the correct startinfo field value without peeking into process memory by hand in other words - i d like to steal this code from somewhere instead of hack the process memory myself

439656
value	field
a. i could create the database with 15 field and just fill the field with null value whenever the data is smaller than 15

439657
xsd	xml
i am trying to create an xsd schema for the following xml

439657
abstract	extends
i have successfully validated the xml using an abstract type defining the type attributes and two extends types defining the child elements

439670
any	set
then i wanted to also get the count of the number of times a character is used in any stripes within the result set

439681
highlight	cell
but when i go to a new cell the entire text in it is highlight

439681
keyboard	mouse
how can i use my keyboard to say i want a cursor so i can modify the text without clicking in it using my mouse

439689
contains	any
for example svn commit only looks at files in the project not at any files in externals contains within the project

439726
children	nodes
i m presuming that in this specific situation you d want clients to be able to alter the child nodes themselves but not the children collection

439744
google-chrome	firefox
however after trying it out it works successfully in firefox google-chrome and opera but fails in konqueror invalid date safari invalid date and ie nan

439746
value	field
if i m going to be requiring a count field like this reasonably often then i create a user defined function to return the value and just use that inside a normal selected

439752
unique	words
three tables one for the original string one for unique words after word-rooting

439752
unique	words
words varchar 14 not null unique

439752
unique	words
unique index words asc

439759
python	php
i d like to separate the three layers of presentation domain logic and data using php python and postgresql respectively

439777
vmware	esx
this question is probably better phrased how does running a java server on a hypervisor such as vmware esx affect the java heap

439793
python	php
speaking about php in my opinion you can use python also for presentation there are many solutions zope plone ... based on python

439795
base-class	inherited
couldn t you have a loggingrepository abstract base-class that would handle logging for your different get add update delete make them virtual and then inherited from them

439796
authentication	login
i m rewriting a website and going from a home-grown authentication model where users logged in with their account id numbers and password to .net forms-authentication where users will login with a username that they choose or is available and a stronger password

439796
account	userid
or i can allow the user to login with their existing userid and password and then optionally give them a grace period to convert their account

439796
authentication	login
i m hesitant about the latter because it s special code and a possible threat vector because it bypasses the standard authentication mechanism and allows users to login using less secure credentials

439798
postgresql	mysql
mysql or postgresql are more-or-less equivalent from within django

439798
python	php
no code at all is superior to python or php

439798
python	php
this is html css stuff no python or php

439800
associations	model
the final caveat is that the model associations are affected by the value of model- recursive

439805
macros	vba
are you looking for a macros solution or a vba solution

439805
macros	vba
for the macros run through the steps using the macros recoder for a vba solution start with jon s answer

439811
uniq	grep
if you don t have the ability to use uniq and want to preserve order you can use grep to simulate that

439814
factors	primes
i need to find out the primes factors of over 300 billion

439814
factors	primes
edit im trying to find the largest primes factors of the number 600851475143

439815
selected	textbox
this parameter is selected via a textbox text100 that has a pop up calendar

439815
selected	textbox
the filename needs to reflect the date that was selected by the user in the textbox from the pop up calendar

439818
python	php
just skip php and use python with django as already noticed while i typed

439818
postgresql	mysql
i have never used postgresql myself but i think it s mostly a matter of taste whether you prefer it over mysql

439840
dynamic-linking	static-linking
i cannot use static-linking as boost.thread requires dynamic-linking for dll projects i maybe could mess around here but as this problem seems to happen only on my machine i do not want to mess with this as i m sure the boost-guys had a reason to place that check in there in the first place

439846
factors	primes
you only ever need to check up to the square-root of the number if you find no factors by then then the number is primes

439846
factors	primes
if you do all the above each new factors you find will be primes since any smaller factorss have already been removed

439850
factors	primes
finding primes factors is difficult using brute force which sounds like the technique you are using

439850
factors	primes
don t bother testing each potential factors to see whether it is primes--just test likely primes numbers odd numbers that end in 1 3 7 or 9

439850
factors	primes
when you find a primes factors make sure to divide it out--don t continue to use your massive original number

439858
put	get
you can t because there s no installer redist for the debugging runtime and in fact the software license forbids distributing it so you d be breaking the eula even if you did get something put together

439866
factors	primes
64 only has one primes factors 2

439877
declarative	imperative
is there an equivalent way that is less imperative and more declarative ie

439879
factors	primes
the rsa encryption algorithm which is commonly used in secure commerce web sites is based on the fact that it is easy to take two very large primes numbers and multiply them while it is extremely hard to do the opposite - meaning take a very large number given which it has only two primes factors and find them

439880
factors	primes
if you multiply two large primes numbers you get a huge non-primes number with only two large primes factors

439884
factors	primes
you only need to check it s remainder mod n where n is a primes sqrt n where n is the number you are trying to factors

439892
cryptography	security
cryptography algorithms generally rely for their security on having a difficult problem

439895
number-theory	primes
most basic and general explanation cryptography is all about number-theory and all integer numbers except 0 and 1 are made up of primes so you deal with primes a lot in number-theory

439895
factorization	primes
more specifically some important cryptography algorithms such as rsa critically depend on the fact that primes factorization of large numbers takes a long time

439895
factors	primes
you can make the public key public and everyone can use it to encrypt messages to you but only you know the primes factors and can decrypt the messages

439897
gethashcode	icomparable
i also read at msdn that when you implement icomparable you ll need to override the equals methods and gethashcode by extension i presume

439898
factors	primes
because nobody knows a fast algorithm to factorize an integer into its primes factors

439898
factors	primes
yet it is very easy to check if a set of primes factors multiply to a certain integer

439919
factorization	primes
i think what are important in cryptography are not primess itself but it is the difficulty of primes factorization problem

439919
factorization	primes
by the way there is a published paper on algorithm which can solve this primes factorization problem in acceptable time using quantum computer

439919
factorization	primes
so newer algorithms in cryptography may not rely on this difficulty of primes factorization anymore when quantum computer comes to town

439925
iequalitycomparer	icomparer
implementing iequalitycomparer is like implementing icomparer - instead of comparing this object with another one the equals compare methods takes two value to compare

iequalitycomparer	icomparer
implementations of iequalitycomparer icomparer rarely override object.gethashcode or object.equals unless they want to allow comparisons of comparers - rarely useful

439927
arrays	map
hash map _ 1 arrays

439927
arrays	map
hash map _ 1 arrays

439935
lookup	any
i always go for the database option as that has several advantages one of the main ones being you can change the names descriptions of items in the lookup lists without having to change any code

439962
factors	primes
primes numbers have the unique property in that they have exactly two factors 1 and themselves

439962
factors	primes
if you try to factors a primes number--especially a very large one--you ll have to try essentially every possible number between 2 and that large primes number

439962
factors	primes
even on the fastest computers it will take years even centuries to factors the kinds of primes numbers used in cryptography

439974
textbox	button
i have a form with button textbox and usercontrols on it

439974
textbox	button
during this 10 seconds what ever textbox or button the message box was over still displays the messagebox they are not getting repainted

439979
.when	ready
this is pretty rough and ready as the stored-procedures generally crash .when they come across any difference between the schema but it does alert you to any changes you haven t been told about

439980
arrays	map
in the + indicates that the doesn t refer to an argument list so it is interpreted as map + _ 1 arrays

440000
arrays	map
map applies the block to each value in the arrays list and creates a new list

440016
instances	private
i m trying to new up a localcommand instances which is a private class of system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommandset

440029
http	ssl
if ssl isn t configured on your server that would explain why the url above works but the url visual-studio is using same but with http wouldn t work

440036
python	ruby
as i start to learn more about python ruby and other languages i m wondering does all of that work have to be re-created for these languages

440036
python	ruby
will there be or does there need to be a doug lea of python or a brian goetz of ruby who make similarly powerful contributions to the concurrency features of those languages

440037
filtering	sorting
i d like to essentially copy the range into some native class that supports filtering and sorting so i don t have to reinvent the wheel and use that class to return a result to calling code

440037
listobject	worksheet
listobject looked the most promising but it appears to require being tied to a worksheet range to work properly

440061
perl	awk
i m running on a windows platform but i have access to sed awk perl python and tcl in addition to the usual windows tools

440069
32-bit	64bit
32-bit and or 64bit linux operating systems

440069
sql-server	oracle
what good libraries are available - either free open source or pay - that support multiple dbms from a single api including oracle and microsoft sql-server and can be used from native c++

440086
concurrent-programming	java.util.concurrent
the java.util.concurrent library was similarly derived from previous code and research papers on concurrent-programming

440098
postgresql	mysql
just to address the mysql vs postgresql issues - it shouldn t matter

440104
profiling	debugging
second the runtime profiling uses the debugging memory manager when it runs the child processes

440118
linux	unix
this can be a real pain when you pick a development stack that really works best on unix linux and then someone tries to force onto a windows server admined by someone who s never touched anything but asp.net applications

440118
python	php
unless there is a particular php module that you intend to use that has no python equivalent i would drop php and use django

440118
python	php
if there is a compelling reason to use php then i d drop python

440118
postgresql	mysql
as for postgresql versus mysql either works

440168
vbscript	vb6
look in the microsoft.visualbasic namespace to get access to the old vbscript vb6 functions

440175
authentication	login
this program on computer a handles login authentication etc

440204
double	int
for the answer to this question to be yes all int within the range of an int have to be exactly representable as double and floor must always return that exactly represented value

440222
double	int
since double uses 53 bits for mantissa it can store all 32-bit int s exactly

440226
factors	primes
general idea you re checking an increasing sequence of possible integer factors x to see if they evenly divide your candidate number n in c java javascript check whether in which case n is not primes

440226
factors	primes
if you have the memory to save a bunch of previous primess use only those as the test factors and don t save them if primes p fails the test since you ll never use them again

440226
factors	primes
even if you don t save the previous primes for possible factors x just check 2 and all the odd numbers

440226
factors	primes
for factors of numbers less than 2 64 those factors x are less than 2 32 where about one out of every 20 numbers is primes one out of every 10 odd numbers is primes

440226
factors	primes
if you re just testing whether a number n is primes and you don t actually care about the factors themselves use a probabilistic primality test

440239
double	int
in a compiler with a 64 bit double and a 64 bit int you ve got more problems of course...

440239
double	int
this shouldn t come as any surprise - there are more long values than double given the nan values and plenty of double aren t int so we can t expect every long to be exactly representable

440239
double	int
however all 32-bit int are representable as double

440242
quickbooks-online	quickbooks
i don t have quickbooks in front of me now but you can find the download link by searching for iif in the quickbooks-online help

440243
associations	model
the movie_id and actor_id fields below correspond to the belongs_to associations in the role model above and are the foreign keys that allow the roles table to join actors and movies

440243
attributes	properties
as i have proposed modeling it the character_name is a properties of this relationship and is thus an attributes of the role

440262
put	get
of course i can put in a cast and get the compiler to shut up but i m wondering if i m doing something wrong here

440343
pointers	stack
memory for the string literals are allocated on stack and all your assignments do are change the str pointers to point to those memory addresses

440355
debugging	trace
please contact the application s support team for more information. unlike usual this dialog only has an ok button but no debugging button so ie then terminates and i m not left with so much as a stack trace or even a hint of what part of my code could have been so buggy

440379
communication	messages
typically communication between a front-end application and back-end service are done through some form of ipc sockets named pipe etc. or through custom messages sent through the service control manager

440408
arguments	default
the library follows the usual conventions the installation root is usr local by default and can be modified with the --prefix arguments to . configure

440415
windows-xp	windows
the msstdfmt.dll appears to be available on windows-xp and windows 2003 servers

440418
windows-messages	spy++
you might be able to glean some information using tools such as spy++ to look at windows-messages

440429
linux	unix
the completed completed is expected to work in windows linux and a small handful of other unix environments

440463
sftp	ssh
while looking for an sftp client in c# ssh file transfer protocol sftp i ve come across these two suitable projects - one and two

440463
sftp	ftp
what is difference between sftp and ftp over ssh

440463
ftp	ssh
no library seems to give support for ftp over ssh if it is different

440470
player	movie
he specifically mentions waiting for the movie to dl and attach to the player

440475
ftp	ssh
ftp over ssh is plain ftp protocol tunneled through ssh

440475
sftp	ssh
sftp is the file transfer mechanism offered by ssh and it s a completely different protocol

440475
ftp	ssh
i haven t seen anybody using ftp over ssh

440480
ftp	ssh
ftp over ssh is using ftp once you re connected via ssh

440493
sftp	ssh
sftp ssh file transfer protocol is a protocol that provides file transfer and manipulation capabilities

440493
ftp	ssh
ftp over ssh uses the regular old ftp protocol but an ssh tunnel is placed between client and server

440493
ftp	ssh
you probably won t find libraries for ftp over ssh because typically the tunnel is set up by running an ssh command and once it is set up clients and servers don t need to know about the tunnel

440493
ftps	ftp
btw yet another option for you might be ftp over ssl ftps which is supported by .net

440496
python	php
i can only repeat what other peoples here already said if you choose python for the domain layer you won t gain anything quite on the contrary using php for the presentation layer

440497
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and i d guess all other debian distros if not all linuces the file var log auth.log records successful and unsuccessful login attempts

440524
sftp	ssh
the only way i know of to do this is to open a parallel sftp session and cd to my current directory in the ssh session which is a real pita when administering a server remotely

440524
sftp	scp
edit i am aware of the possibility of using a reverse sftp scp connection but that involves more typing

440533
scp	ssh
at school if i am transferring a file from one linux system to another i usually remote using ssh and then use scp to transfer the file from the remote system back to my computer

440552
restart	reload
finally restart your syslogd and get your inittab reload init q and it should work

440568
updating	updates
i m updating my website at the moment and figure that if i am to updates my login security mode now is a good time

440574
filtering	grouping
next we join a new reference to pages in on the section id and filtering by sortorder being the minimum from the section grouping

440574
order	add
finally we add an orderby to order the pages and we return the page note you can change this to certain fields if you prefer

440584
rar	zip
if the data is still too big you can try using an external library executable to rar or 7zip the data as that will be half the size of the zip d copy

440588
localization	translation
all articles i ve read about localization of a winforms application assume that i already have all the strings translation

440617
.when	ready
modified and new pages can be created manually on the site and published .when ready

440630
gzip	zip
php has native zip support via gzip may not be enabled by default

440633
any	set
if it does this even once then we are on the plus side the requirement is beneficial because normally the functionality does not make any difference â the good guys write the comments anyway whereas the bad gals can always get around the requirement no matter what technical barriers you set up

440646
factorization	primes
to compute the euler s totient function of n efficiently requires knowing the primes factorization of n

440646
number-theory	primes
number-theory is a rich source of such trapdoor functions such as multiplication of large primes numbers and primes numbers are absolutely central to number-theory

440662
ready	live
i assume what you re referring to is the fact that you ve already made a bunch of changes that you re not necessarily ready to move live but need to move a built-in an emergency

440662
.when	ready
obsolete the first function so that people will at least be told they shouldn t use it and then upload assemblyc .when you re ready to make the change to it

440667
png	ico
use this syntax for getting the ico or other items png xaml etc out of the assembly

440693
any	set
are there any tutorials on how to set up asp.net development on a local server

440696
put	get
it really lowers the barrier to entry to the lowest common denominator allowing anything that can use basic http get and post also put and delete for the proper way of doing it to use the api

440715
host	dns
update as an alternative to a commercial hoster to temporarily make one of your applications available to others you can host them on your pc and use a dynamic dns service such as dyndns to make your pc accessible from the internet

440723
web-hosting	hosting
as for hosting godaddy provides asp.net-capable web-hosting plans for as little as 5 usd per month

440740
sql-server	oracle
not all database vendors sql-server oracle etc. implement update syntax in the same way.

440740
sql-server	oracle
you can use a join in sql-server but oracle will not like that

440761
order-of-operations	parentheses
the first parentheses are for if you will order-of-operations

440772
contains	set
the first set of parentheses contains the expressions to be executed and the second set of parentheses executes those expressions

440774
sql-server	firebird
i use the native generator because when adding support for sql-server to our program the only thing in nhibernate i had to change was the generator types to native because firebird and sql-server implement their auto incrementing identity columns differently

440774
sql-server	firebird
in firebird it used the named generator and in sql-server it ignores the sequence parameter and uses the auto-increment built in

440779
integer	numeric
why would someone use numeric 12 0 datatype for a simple integer id column

440779
numeric	digits
you can see that the numeric 12 0 uses 9 bytes of storage and being limited to 12 digits theres a total of 2 trillion numbers if you include negatives

440780
variables	boolean
if these variables are mostly short strings or boolean flags i think that your answer will largely rest on what you ll be able to maintain well

440790
constructor	object
after doing some research i have discovered that i cannot hook up events to dynamic activex object the ones that are created by the new activexobject constructor in javascript

440802
protected	public
you can test protected methods from unit tests in another package by creating a subclass of the class under test that overrides the methods you want to test as public and having those overridden methods call the original methods with the super keyword

440807
windows-messages	spy++
you might want to use spy++ and look at the windows-messages that are being sent to the control when the autocomplete display

440811
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
visual-studio express is not bad sharpdevelop is surprisingly good imo even better than express

440811
sql-server	mysql
i m with lunarpages at 9.99 per month importantly they support the latest flavour of .net so you have access to all the .net 3.5 goodies - plus unlimited sql-server and mysql

440821
initializer	getter
you can add your own notes property to your person class and initializer it in it s getter function

440868
environment	building
perhaps best to try building boost yourself in your specific environment

440874
pkcs#12	pfx
you have your certificate you only need to pack the certificate and the private-key inside a pfx or pkcs#12 file that microsoft csp recognizes

440878
subdirectories	archive
the source of bcp is available in the archive too in the tools bcp subdirectories

440891
output	cat
the cat --show-nonprinting methods others have used in other answers is better for lots of multi-line output

440942
csv	tsv
another possiblitly is to export the html tables as a csv or tsv file but you would need to setup the formatting in your code

440956
32-bit	64bit
there are some difference in their performance between the 32-bit and 64bit abis as well as the interaction between objective-c exception-handling and c++ exception-handling

440976
dependency-injection	factory-pattern
to implement dependency-injection and factory-pattern

441007
hide	show
i used div tags around the tables i wanted to show and hide like

441007
hide	show
this allows me to show or hide the tables without taking up blank spaces on the page when they are hidden but still rendering them so they ll work with validation controls that was my ultimate goal while hidden or showing

441057
protected	public
the point here is that junit forces me to make process public or at least protected or to put it in it s own utility class

441060
subclassing	inherited
the forms are subclassing of various different classes and i really don t want to do make some kind of intermediate tform descendant which overrides the scale property - partly because i tried briefly to do this and discovered that setting the scale property to be false after the inherited create made no difference to the form and setting it before the inherited create caused an exception-handling

441064
ghostscript	imagemagick
i m pretty sure imagemagick a c library can do that though i believe it requires ghostscript and there s a jni wrapper for imagemagick called jmagick that allows access to imagemagick from java

441087
arrays	loops
i m looking for exercises that will help me to learn php complex loops arrays tricks etc

441095
http	ssl
5 false in order to authenticate the service callers you don t necessarily need to have any transport-level security such as ssl http

441095
credentials	security
a use transport-level security on the wshttpbinding with windows credentials http

441095
credentials	security
b use message-level security on the wshttpbinding with windows credentials http

441095
credentials	security
for wshttpbinding this is accomplished with message-level security by using the client s credentials which is the default setting for the binding

441098
webserver	host
there is ultidev cassini which is a free light-weight and redistributable webserver that can host asp.net 3.5 3.0 2.0 and 1.1 applications and static html sites

441106
constructor	object
you will need to iterate through the datarows and convert them into your objects at some time anyway but you could write a custom collection with a constructor that takes a collection of datarows and that converts each item into your object type when requested instead of all at once

441106
constructor	object
your object would probably need a constructor taking a datarow or you would need some sort of factory to create them but that is another topic

441111
contains	set
that is the foreign key column contains an id value that must exist in one of a set of target tables

441111
associations	model
there s no way to model polymorphic associations using sql constraints

441112
header-only	boost
you can use bcp but remember that using the boost libraries only makes you pay for what you use - the smart pointers are all implemented in header-only fashion meaning there s no os calls no compiled library to link to etc

441112
any	set
thus if you re not distributing source code you can download the full boost set and use only the bits you need without causing your application any unasked for grief

441117
folder	dir
the solution i found for word templates is to read the install dir from hklm software microsft windows currentversion app paths winword.exe and install to the startup folder underneath the path contains in that registry key

441117
any	set
make sure to set the templates to read-only as well to avoid any permissions errors later on

441120
constructor	object
that not only means that they have a copy constructor but that also means that if you copy the object the copy and the original are the same

441125
updating	updates
it s my understanding that as long as you ve selected the entire primary key from every table you ll be updating you should be fine since ado.net will know what to do with the updates data automatically

441138
value	field
i ahve also tried in place of i have other items in the tablerow which are being successfully manipulated but the value of this form field never changes

441143
frame	width
is there a way to scale a silverlight app to 100 width and 100 height of the browser frame that the application is embedded in

441162
key-value	key
another approach is to create key-value pairs for each item you need to sort put them in a treemap and then ask for the values as these are sorted according to the key

441165
vbulletin	phpbb
phpbb3 and vbulletin are good choices for php phpbb is open source but vbulletin is a private product unfortunately

441166
sharing	share
as for #2 sharing state between the processes your life will be much easier if you share an absolute minimum and then only share it explicitly and in a well-defined way

441168
postgresql	mysql
we re migrating mysql to postgresql

441186
ms-access	mysql
why don t you export it from ms-access into excel or csv files and then import it into a separate mysql database

441188
32-bit	x86
even on a plain x86 32-bit platform you can get a variety of pointer sizes try this out for an example

441189
virtualization	vmware
the technical limitation with running vmware inside vmware is that vmware virtual pc etc takes advantage of the virtualization features present in modern cpus

441193
seam	jsf
yet seam is still a new approach to developing jsf web-applications

441213
constructor	object
using the rectangle class from an earlier answer as an example the constructor which takes parameters for x y height and width could factor x and y out into a point object allowing you to pass three parameters to the rectangle s constructor

441236
instances	destroy
for many others serialization may be problematic because it destroy uniqueness constraints or simply forces you to deal with instances of different versioning of a class which you may not want to

441269
entity-framework	nhibernate
see nhibernate subsonic linq2sql entity-framework yet to be released

441275
swing	swt
can i put a java control swt swing ... on a c# control

441295
superclass	inherited
the only case in wich i would use inherited in this situation is if the conditional themselves use many common code that can be completely implemented in the superclass without need to override anything in the subclases but the practice of using inherited for java style interfaces is not usual in ruby

441299
user-controls	ascx
i ve created a regular asp.net user-controls including the ascx file

441318
linux	unix
optionally you could also install mingw or cygwin to get the same commands available in windows as in linux unix

441320
svnadmin	dump
if the export was created using svnadmin dump you can import it into a new empty repository using

441336
constructor	object
we wound up seperating the data into a different class and using an instance of that as a parameter for our display object constructor

441340
rewrite	rule
he used a rewrite rule

441340
put	get
i guess i wasn t anticipating this approach but as long as the pages can get spidered and ranked as more information is put in i m cool with it

441355
search-engine	seo
this technique is a common technique used by seo people companies because then the search-engine will not have send the

441371
constructor	object
you can separate the concerns in your model even deeply if you use dto classes which are object with properties or to be more strict a constructor and a bunch of readonly properties

441379
rewrite	rule
please tell is the rule redirets or rewrite request

441384
tostring	equals
however i recommend you to both define the tostring as above and also an equals

441394
double	int
as well as this you have to remember when you code that x is an int or that y is a double

441398
debugging	exit
my suggestion is to patch your executables to put maybe an int 3 debugging at the entry point to exit if it s statically linked or if it s dynamically linked patch up the import and also patch up any imports of kernel32 terminateprocess to throw a debuggingbreak instead

441398
shutdown	exit
of course exit and or terminateprocess may be called on a normal shutdown too so you ll have to filtering out the false alarms but if you can get the call stack for the case where it s just about to go proof you should have what you need

441400
global-variables	call
for example i know the memory is divided into global-variables call stack heap and code for c++ yet i don t know if the heap s address is higher than the stack s or if that depends on the implementation

441400
pointers	stack
is it because stack frames only take care of stack segments and the runtime constant pool must also have pointers for the heap allocated memory

441406
vba	vb6
long answer vb6 which is what vba really is is pretty much a dead unsupported language last updated a decade back with an ide from the same period

441406
python	ruby
now legacy vba will continue to run just on a different modern supported interpreter and into the bargain we can program excel macros in python ruby or whatever other dlr language takes our fancy

441442
decrement	increment
they are responsible to increment the reference count and decrement it freeing the resource when necassary

441445
stdin	tail
have you tried file tail to handle the actual tailing instead of trying to coerce stdin to do the job

441448
contains	any
i m using substring and indexof to locate a value within a string but my code doesn t work if the string stroldvalue below contains any of the string in a different case

441455
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
the second comparisontype parameter of the indexof methods specifies how to search for the value parameter using the current or invariant culture using a case-sensitive or case-insensitive search or using word or ordinals comparison rules see for the full documentation

441476
hash	md5
i think about it and found a solution i ll md5 all books strings and save the hash books strings

441478
value	field
if it is a value that might or will change some time in the future and you cannot guarantee that all other assemblies are rebuilt simultaneously a readonly field is more appropriate than a constant

441479
manpage	bsd
bsd license wikipedia page - reasonable manpage entry

441502
textbox	button
but if the user clicks the browser s back button after submitting the page with the autocomplete textbox the textbox is empty

441526
tree	trie
a suffix tree is a type of trie mentioned by divo

441554
double	int
int double booleans and other primitive-types do get allocated on the stack

441554
coff	elf
the c++ standard has some language about a similar technique but the implementation is left up to the binary format elf a.out coff pe etc.

441554
double	int
the standard expects constants that are integral data types bool int long etc. or c-style strings to be actually kept in a constant part of the binary while other constant data double floats classes might be stored as a variables along with a flag saying that the variables is not modifiable it s also acceptable to store them with integral and c-style string constants but many binary formats don t make this an option

441569
data-structures	tree
there are many algorithms for searching in strings ranging from simple methods like the boyer-moore algorithm to complex data-structures like suffix tree

441606
numeric	digits
for most cases this will be numeric 10 2 or decimal 10 2 - will define a column as a number with 10 total digits with a precision of 2 decimal places

441611
base-class	inherited
similarly if you declare a class as final which prevents it from being extended -- prevents it from being used as a base-class for inherited you are implying that you know more than any future programmer might know about what is the right and proper way to use your class

441613
decimal-point	digits
display 12345.679 3 spaces 5 digits 12345 a decimal-point and three decimal digits 679

441631
google-chrome	firefox
tested it on google-chrome firefox 3 ie 7 and ie 6 and it s working

441636
javascript	dom
i want to write some javascript and have it call into the dom for a page i am loading from a 3rd party domain

441664
perl	ruby
many programming languages start out as macro tools and writing a script using an xml-based tool does not make it less of a program than if the same script is written in perl python or ruby

441664
python	c++
don t fall for the mental trap of thinking that some formats like xml or even html are dead data and other formats like c++ and python are code

441683
convention	standards
it seems to be a convention more or less that headers without a suffix are standards libraries and those with a suffix other than the old c headers are non-standards

441692
getter	setter
however this leads to a rather anemic domain the user class is nothing but getter setter

441696
stream	send
when a server send a file it doesn t just stream over the wire instantly there are ack packets that have to go between client and server sending the file out one chunk at a time

441697
lookup	any
if you are just holding a block of data you iterate through without any special lookup append remove or splice needs i would prefer vector which makes your intentions more clear than std string which many libraries and functions will assume holds a null-terminated c-style string

441707
getter	setter
however this leads to a rather anemic domain the user class is nothing but getter setter

441717
ruby-on-rails	django
i m trying to decide whether to use a ruby-on-rails or a django guru to create a web app for me

441722
any	set
my first step in solving it would be to set the key code keycode whatever it s named in the event variables to #0 or null as well as any variablesiables such as e.handled in the event call prior to returning

441732
export	csv
update after seeing the comment from dance2die thought of putting together a sample powershell scripting to export the type name to a csv file

441739
ftps	ftp
http http ftp ftps callto mailto and any other one not listed

441743
value	field
i have an aggregate field in a client data set and i use a function to get the aggregate value if the client data set is empty the function should return 0

441780
ruby-on-rails	django
a good developer will do well on either ruby-on-rails or django

441792
google-chrome	firefox
client uas are diverse ie5.5 - 7 firefox 3.0.5 iphone google-chrome

441805
value	field
when you have no record dataset empty you don t have a field for which the value would be null reading from the record buffering so the isnull function of the field returns false

441806
financial	banking
having worked for banking institutions in the us i can say there are lots of laws governing the storage display and distribution of financial information

441809
mstest	nunit
mstest is essentially nunit slightly reworked with a few new features such as assembly setup and teardown not just fixture and test level and missing some of the best bits such as the new 2.4 constraint syntax

441816
keyboard	mouse
edit when i specified user-interface techniques i left it open to both using existing hardware mouse keyboard and some other things like multi-touch gesture recognition augmented reality see hitlabnz for some great examples

441824
python	java
it s seems rare to read of a python virtual machine while in java virtual machine is used all the time

441837
malloc	free
for each malloc or calloc there should be exactly one free

441858
decrement	increment
re comment - the reason built-ins aren t double deleting is because they aren t deleting at all and the implementation of boost shared_ptr i use wouldn t double delete since it uses a special atomicity increment and decrement so it would only single delete but then the result would could have the pointers from one and the ref count of the other

441861
getter	setter
i d also advise you to keep the getter and setter as restricted in scope as possible to reduce coupling

441884
contains	any
in this example the mysql class will accept only what settings are contains in configuration and it isn t possible to use any configurationuration except that contains in configuration

441892
environment	execution
interpreter languages used a couple of different scheme but essentially the language syntax was converted into an intermediate form and then run in a interpreter an environment for execution the code

441901
perl	ruby
beyond that the differences between python s interpreter or perl or ruby s and java s virtual machine are mostly implementation details

441901
python	java
one could argue that java is more fully sandboxed than python but both ultimately provide access to the underlying architecture via a native c interface.

441904
class-members	accessor
you can specify subtyping for your class-members that will be enforced when set by accessor or constructor the same system can be used with the moose methods package for functions

441926
python	ruby
a more strict interpretation of an interpreted language only becomes useful when discussing performance issues of the vm for example compared with python ruby was is

441935
getter	setter
recently i read about someone who got an assignment to write a bunch of setter and getter -- in a better language this would be a job for its metaprogramming facilities

441936
screens	tablet
there are more alternatives than just a mouse or a touch screens or a tablet

441939
order	join
problem that i am facing is with the order in which i join tables

441941
button	popup
if i have a button or data field or some other library function and i declare some properties in the viewcontroller.h file i launch interface builder by clicking on the .xib file and attempt to make a connection by dragging from the referencing outlet in the connection viewer and the only possible connection presented present in the popup box is view

441943
any	set
f# has visual-studio integration so you can attach the debugger to your program and set breakpoints watches etc just like with any other .net language

441949
export	csv
the typical survey will be multistep with multi-dependencies between form fields questions public access most of the time and export results to pdf + csv

441949
cakephp	symfony
have been studying testing some php frameworks codeigniter symfony and cakephp

441949
ruby-on-rails	django
i like cakephp but i read a lot of good stuff about django and ruby-on-rails especially ruby-on-rails for form building... .

441950
hash	md5
you should verify that your md5 hash is correct by also comparing the string that was used to generate the hash so you don t have any false positives

441950
hash	md5
although an md5 sort of hash is fast the techniques presented in the other answers should be considered as well to find the best benefit cost balance for your circumstance

441953
synchronous	.when
maybe they have the same issues uses some janky thread pool underneath the covers even .when your requests are synchronous

441960
updating	updates
2 updates require the cumbersome mechanic of querying for an object updating it and then committing the changes the initial query shouldn t be necessary

441963
document	element
with my cam pdf library you can compute positioning for any element in the document

441973
any	set
a virtual-machine is a virtual computing environment with a specific set of atomic well defined instructions that are supported independent of any specific language and it is generally thought of as a sandbox unto itself

441979
ruby	php
if you are very proficient in php and haven t ever seen ruby or python then one of the php ones is certainly a better fit if you wish rapid development

441984
internet-explorer	firefox
for my software i simple wrote the extension in firefox s javascript and then created an internet-explorer bho which i haven t finished yet

441990
document	element
i creat two document object now i want to move one element and it s child elements to another.how can i do that .can anyone tell me thank you. _

441991
external	root
once the first frame is loaded it can display initial content while later content loads and even if the root swf file is loaded it may need to load more external content before it can display anything

441996
interface-builder	iboutlet
in your controllers s header file make sure you are using iboutlet on your controls and ibaction on your methods that you wish to link to link up in interface-builder

442025
base-class	inherited
i ve introduced an interface called iobject and use virtual inherited to ensure that there is only one copy of this base-class

442037
traversal	parent
you need a recursive function and based on how it looks like you re traversal the list it would probably be better to store id and childid rather than parent id

442059
command-prompt	command-line
it basically gives you the output from the command-line as you would see it at a command-prompt

442077
solaris	linux
i store everything in a c projects directory on my windows machine and projects on our unix-oid linux solaris environments

442088
python	ruby
those who like the magic congregate around rails or frameworks which try to emulate it those who don t congregate around django or frameworks which try to emulate it and in a broader sense these stances are somewhat stereotypical of ruby and python developers

442088
python	ruby
ruby developers tend to like doing things one way python developers tend to like doing things another way

442088
difference	factors
in the long run it probably doesn t make a huge difference for the factors you say you re concerned with -- billable hours -- so let your developer choose whatever he or she is most comfortable with since that s more likely to get useful results for you

442108
javascript	dom
so all in all what i would do is write a little javascript ajax function to php which does the curl and then returns the fp variable via echo to the javascript callback and then maybe insert it on the document using innerhtml or the dom and bam you have access to all the stuff

442110
value	field
also read the document on key-value validation that i mentioned above to understand why proposedname is an autoreleased copy of a field s string value instead of just its string value

442151
updatepanel	gridview
we have used updatepanel to ajaxify the functionality adding the rows to the repeater gridview but the time it takes for the server trip and rendering back on the browser is not acceptable

442169
environment	building
building environment support both java development and .net will be on to separate vmware machines running on the same physical computer

442169
environment	building
i am trying to figure out the building environment now

442179
webserver	host
i use notepad++ on my host for editing recent convert from jedit and with drive mapping in the vm software sun s virtualbox my dev webserver guest machine has no problem serving up the ever-changing source files

442181
postgresql	mysql
in-query variable modification doesn t work in postgresql for instance this will work in mysql but not in postgresql i haven t tested this recently maybe it does work now.

442181
postgresql	mysql
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

442181
postgresql	mysql
the way postgresql stores tables is utterly different than how mysql does

442204
rollback	commit
if your dbms supports savepoints then the procedure could establish a savepoint on entry and commit or rollback to the savepoint on exit

442216
python	java
three main candidates are java python and ruby on rails ror

442216
python	java
the choice i have to make is between java and python

442216
python	java
i slightly favor java because it is a typed language but my good friend favors python because it is more concise

442227
python	java
or you can pick django on jython to get best of java libraries and python speed-coding

442240
python	php
for mostly presentation i would go python django or even php

442241
contains	set
so you can grep for one other property that only tform has which is set in all of your forms to a value that is stored in the dfm oldcreateorder would be a candidate and replace the lines with another line contains two properties

442248
jmonkeyengine	lwjgl
since you are also interested in java i recommend you to look into jmonkeyengine and the lwjgl

442254
python	ruby
and by stable i dont mean that it has fewer bugs than python or ruby i mean that it doesnt change as much

442254
ruby-on-rails	django
use django or ruby-on-rails if you want rapid development and dont care if you need to rewrite a lot of the app in 1-2 years

442261
selected	checkbox
selected the text tab and switch off the read only checkbox

442273
exception-handling	try-catch
the obvious trouble is that the usercontrols are event driven and can throw exception-handling in a million different places so i don t have one thing to wrap in a try-catch block

442289
any	set
is there any setting i forgot to configure or set

442291
haskell	perl
two of the languages i regularly ab use overload by return type perl and haskell

442291
scala	java
this is used for example in scala and can be accessed directly through java as well by playing around with internals

442298
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a new versioning we decided

442302
selected	button
in many guis when i select a section of text and then hit the tab or shift + tab button the selected section will indent in or out

442314
administration	account
or you can set user unser who s account console app runs as site collection administration

442319
stderr	stdout
task will be stuck when you won t read what it is sending on stdout stderr

442326
core-animation	core-graphics
the core-animation transition is a flip however when it is drawn the core-graphics code is not used drawinrect is not called to provide the calayer with my rendered image

442343
exception-handling	try-catch
how can i write a general try-catch where i can debugging all exception-handling

442343
ubuntu	linux
i have a django app that on the my comp ubuntu linux 8.10 works fine both through runserver and mod-python

442343
callback	methods
the callback methods for secondary keys uses pickle to format the keys

442366
python	java
you can do this with hobby ruby low implementation python languages but you can t imagine how many apps are written in java around the world

442366
swing	awt
swing depends and uses awt as it s basis

442398
versioning	upgrade
the reason i left php is that they alter the api available functions between major versioning upgrade

442423
configuration	installation
in which cases except development would you prefer xampp over a complete installation and configuration of linux apache mysql php

442429
numeric	zero
the way i would approach this would be to add leading zero to the numeric value in the name before comparing them

442443
windows-xp	windows
when i say windows i mean windows-xp sp2 or later

442457
attributes	properties
set the encrypt attributes on your folder or file from the properties page click on the advanced button

442461
attributes	properties
the extra advantage of implementing it in this way is you can use attributes to mark up bits of the source and can then use a properties grid to quickly give you user-edit control of settings the properties grid manipulates class properties at runtime using reflection

442468
malloc	free
and that allocated using malloc should be deleted using free

442491
hide	show
i found this out by observing the keyboard show hide events

442503
contains	sorted
i have a column contains items that can be sorted by the user

442504
.when	ready
entity-relationship wouldn t the document already be ready .when the content is loaded

442541
nspersistentdocument	nsdocument
remember nspersistentdocument is a subclass of nsdocument .

442557
any	set
when the form is submitted you ll get an arrays in _post col indexed by column name but only for those boxes which are checked so you d set to false any columns which are not set

442558
required	checked
to suddenly change ints to integers for example would required masses of tedious code changes for everyone as well as having to add extra null checked etc.

442558
backwards-compatibility	deprecated
however adding a new feature that happens to break backwards-compatibility closures or removing methods that have been deprecated for years will have little effect on existing code

442560
children	nodes
the children for each nodes are retrieved using a linqtosql query

442560
children	nodes
fire off a thread to do the db fetching on completion create the corresponding tree nodes for the children

442561
linux	unix
the os cannot allow your program to write outside the space allocated to it so it sends the program some kind of message windows exception unix linux signal that the write was rejected

442574
synchronous	.when
.when you have synchronous data-access one connection is usually enough if you remember to open close between reads

442586
directory	folder
since few days it creates a new visual-studio 2008 directory in the same folder that my .sln file exists

442594
webserver	security
the problem is about security settings of the subversion repository served trough the apache webserver

442596
value	field
cascading forms is basically forms whose field values change if and when another field value changes

442604
jax-ws	cxf
jax-ws is full supported in cxf

442607
any	set
sorry to disappoint but i ve just been informed that moss does not do any load balancing on its own you need to set this up yourself outside of moss

442613
attributes	properties
the following seems to at least create string properties for elements attributes of type xs idref

442614
any	set
i have a page base class that has no .aspx file and so i therefore cannot set the page directive asynch true - but i want pages that inherit from this base class to operate asynchronously - is there any way to set asynchmode programatically in my base class

442621
order	add
i know that msft did change something in the junction points in order to add some functionality they wanted to use

442674
carbon	cocoa
this should happen automatically with qt mac 4.5 both carbon and cocoa ports - since qt s registered as a cfrunloopsource in cfrunloop and the callback will invoke sendpostedevents

442678
webforms	asp.net
this ofcourse does not count for asp.net webforms because post doesn t matter as much

442699
double	int
__declspec dllexport void __stdcall getdoubles int count double values

442717
sequences	unique
if the page where the form appears is dynamically generated you can add a hidden-field which contains some sort of sequences number a hash or anything unique

442728
silverlight	wpf
maybe silverlight could give wpf a push

442733
superclass	subclass
i though that a subclass should be able replace a superclass without any modifications to the subclass

442748
directory	folder
smarty for example employs this approach by placing the library one directory above the htdocs folder

442758
normal-distribution	probability
in these formulas a cumulative standard normal-distribution function exists that takes a float and output a probability

442761
32-bit	16-bit
beware that the size of the encoding utf-32 needs 32-bit utf-16 needs 16-bit must not exceed the size of wchar_t gcc uses

442761
32-bit	16-bit
the option is called -fshort-wchar and will most likely then be 16-bit instead of 32-bit which is its usual width for gcc on linux

442763
multi-module	subproject
if your project has that many subproject or modules needed to actually compose your final artifact then it is time to look at having something like maven and setting up a multi-module project

442764
revision	updates
you can either checkout the most recent revision to updates the server or do an export

442769
continuous-integration	teamcity
i m not sure what it is you are trying to do but there is a separation between svn source control system and a continuous-integration system like cruise control or teamcity

442778
expression	brackets
regular expression cannot match nesting brackets

442784
defined	declare
if that s right that should mean that a trivial destructor is one which doesn t have to do anything and hence it will be declare implicitly but not defined

442798
defined	declare
an implicitly definedd trivial destructor is by definition trivial the difference between the declare and defined thingy is that in order for the compiler to even see that a destructor is available there must always a declaration

442798
having	union
objects having non-trivial versions of them can t be put in union for example

442833
driver	kernel
is there a way in linux to force a driver to be associated with a known device that do not involve kernel module recompilation to add a pid vid pair

442850
struct	unions
trivial destructors exist because c programmers put struct in unions

442852
ethernet	packets
a packets sniffer like wireshark is especially interesting if you don t have admin access to the database server but you have access to the network for instances because there is port mirroring on the ethernet switching

442872
credentials	security
the login credentials will not be hard-coded into your binaries so decompilation will not pose a security risk

442872
authentication	login
first case user is authentication to know the database login credentials

442872
credentials	security
the user can simply open the preferences xml file and read the login credentials but that is not a security risk because the user knew the credentials to begin with

442891
uitextview	nsstring
if you want editable text you will have to parsing it using a library like tidy to get just an nsstring and then pass that to uitextview s -settext methods

442897
getter	setter
never put getter and setter for actual business value on your view

442901
asp.net-mvc	wcf
you ll get an idea of asp.net-mvc wcf and linq

442911
click	mouse
most people won t like having their settings automatically changed even if it s triggers by a mouse click or other action

442912
administration	enterprise
if it is 10+ and if you have administration access sysdba then you can relatively easy find executed queries through oracle enterprise manager

442921
perl	php
apart from that i have perl php python apache all up and running

442921
winscp	putty
in addition i have jetty server maven winscp putty vim and a several other tools running quite happlily on my desktop

442926
webserver	upload
i always upload the javascript to the webserver

442935
hash	md5
md5 is a hash algorithm not an encryption algorithm in short u cant get back wat u hash u can only compare

442937
versioning	upgrade
since your question title asks if there are any disadvantages to hosting this at google the most obvious answer that springs to mind is they may upgrade their versioning at any time potentially breaking your code or causing unexpected side effects

442941
click	mouse
the problem is that the dialog does not respond to mouse click

442941
keyboard	mouse
moreover if i press alt+tab to switch to some other running app and then press alt+tab again to switch back to my app it responds to both mouse and keyboard input

442945
put	get
i did get them to put me and the other developers in a special collection so that we could block breaking changes if needed how could ie7 be a security update

442948
firefox	opera
what might i be able to change in the firefox settings so it is as fast as opera and explorer

442960
literals	hardcode
hardcode literals should appear in unit tests for the test value unless there is so much reuse of a value within a single test class that a local constant is useful

442966
json	xml
if you think xml is too verbose have a look at json

442969
tokenize	parsing
so â œ â will tokenize but will not parsing

442970
json	xml
also most oo systems can convert objects to standard representations like xml or json or yaml

442970
json	xml
json yaml is less verbose and much easier to parse than xml

442971
spring	guice
you can use ioc techniques even if you dont use an ioc framework spring guice ...

442982
cassini	iis
for me closing the ide shutting the web site iis or cassini deleting all of my temporary asp.net files launching the ide and doing a full compile does the trick

442992
silverlight	wpf
i convinced them to go for an initial wpf desktop port to be followed by a silverlight version

443032
entity-relationship	diagram
or you could go even further and reverse engineer an entity-relationship model with an accompanying diagram

443032
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram wentity-relationshipe really useful to me when discussing the data with people who wentity-relationshipe neithentity-relationship programmentity-relationships nor database expentity-relationshipts

443032
entity-relationship	diagram
sometimes a few manual fixups to the entity-relationship model and entity-relationship diagram wentity-relationshipe necessary before it was a useful communication tool with stakeholdentity-relationships

443033
contains	elements
is it possible to have an editable div elements that can only contains text and images

443037
value	field
finally in your save methods check for the existance of your known string in the password boxes and if it s there you know to ignore the value and if the field are blank and the current password is also blank then nothing will have changed

443061
synchronous	.when
a reliable mechanism is to ensure that either the web service responds to the upload with an ack after the data has been received a synchronous call or that .when you start the upload you get back a transaction id that you can then send back to the service at a later point to ensure that it has been delivered before local deletion

443075
32-bit	64bit
looks like the 64bit version works - has anyone tried it on 32-bit windows 7

443079
value	field
but can t seem to find any options for its dynamic prompt settings such as field used to fill the default value cascading prompt settings etc.

443080
while-loop	loops
in your case adding proc.stdin.flush in the main while-loops and a sys.stdout.flush in the child loops after the print should fix your problem

443081
selected	cells
and what i would like is some vba code that will selected all the cells in b that have a 1 in column a - i will be using this set to do some tasks in another part of my code

443114
versioning	upgrade
contrary to what others have claimed they do not automatically upgrade you to the latest versioning

443120
driver	kernel
c on the other hand is used for kernel and driver programming for a reason

443207
global-asax	web-config
eliminating web-config references entirely you can add a module into global-asax if you re careful with the life-cycle

443216
triggers	insert
add an instead of triggers to your table that manually checks the foreign key constraint by selected from the linked server and comparing the value you re trying to insert update

443227
32-bit	64bit
i want to know at run time whether i m running on 32-bit or 64bit windows

443232
javascript	dom
you don t really have a context in which to execute javascript...there s no dom or javascript engine unless you have a browser to give you those things

443243
authentication	login
is there any way i can detect at the client or server if the authentication has timed out and redirect the entire page to the login page

443250
document	element
once i get the document started how do i get the namespace and schema into the doc1 element

443253
hash	md5
on a page that automatically lists several small files 100-500kb that are contained in a specific folder is there a way using vbscript to automatically generate md5 hash of each file and display it on the page

443253
hash	md5
cliff notes can i generate an md5 hash of a file on the server machine

443276
onsubmit	onclick
i tried to attach a javascript function which uses ajax.updater to onsubmit on the form and onclick on the input but the form is still non-ajax submitted after the function ends so the whole page is replaced by the results

443296
buildpath	libs
there you can either add the libs directly or add another project into the buildpath of the current project

443297
installation	uninstall
i d second trying to uninstall reinstall and reapply sp1 just to make sure it isn t something with your installation

443310
superclass	subclass
i d like for a subclass of a certain superclass with certain constructor parameters to load an xml file contains information that i d then like to pass to the superconstructor

443315
pure-virtual	base-class
when i call delete me from delete in my base-class i get the error pure-virtual func call

443333
uitextview	uiwebview
the text displays perfectly fine when i use uitextview and it shows scrollers as well but the problem is that my content is rich text so i don t have any other option but to show the content in uiwebview

443361
fileoutputstream	filewriter
use a fileoutputstream rather than a filewriter

443383
32-bit	64bit
if you are a 32-bit process and want to know if you re running under wow64 ie. a 64bit os call iswow64process

443385
click	mouse
i have a map for my game i have a scripting that on a click displays an alert of the mouse coordinates on the map

443391
command-line	cmd
you can invoke it be means of cmd-line cmd or just use an ant script

443392
constructor	object
a variation of this is to create objects that managed to preloaded data and pass those into the constructor of the object

443397
cassini	iis
i d imagine the stack is immense though i would expect cassini to replicate iis as closely as possible

443397
cassini	iis
it s surprising that something that runs in vs wouldn t run in iis and i d even consider filing a vs bug with microsoft since it seems that the whole point of cassini is to replicate the functionality of iis and provide an ideal debugging environment since any web projects you write in vs will inherently be deployed against iis

443411
value	field
however one of the settings is a password - and i d like it to display asterisks in the field rather than the plain text value of the password setting

443411
attributes	properties
i m wondering if there is an attributes that can be applied to the setting properties to mark it as being a password

443414
constructor	object
this is probably the best option for you given your particular circumstances you don t really want to use the convenience constructor because you want the string object to hang around to be used later

443418
derivative	inverse
you multiplying the derivative vector by the inverse of the second derivative and the result is the negative step-vector to your next trial point -v 1 a

443441
assign	add
the prof is probably just referring to having to take the value add 1 to it and then assign it back to the variables

443459
dialog	pop-up
error dialog will pop-up and add a

443542
contains	sorted
specifies that if the field being sorted contains numeric number int uint values or string representations of numeric values the comparator use a numeric comparison

443542
value	field
if this property is false field with string representations of numbers are sorted using strings comparison so 100 precedes 99 because 1 is a lower string value than 9

443695
children	tree
i have a tree that consists of several objects where each object has a name string id int and possibly an arrays of children that are of the same type

value	field
it would figure out the field names and value and send them out to a string

443739
np-complete	subset-sum
subset-sum is np-complete and you can polynomially reduce your problem to it so your problem is np-complete too

443763
windows-xp	windows

if you do not explicitly write a methods s access level public protected or private then it will default to package-private and these methodss will probably been show in content assist

443891
superclass	subclass
try debugging an error where you see a message generated by the superclass class when the error is really being logged in the subclass class

443899
modifiers	final
for what it s worth java has this feature using the final modifiers and i ve very rarely seen it used other than in cases where it has to be used to allow the variables to be captured by an anonymous-inner-class - and where it is used it gives me an impression of clutter rather than useful information

443908
superclass	subclass
the major difference asides from the superclass logging with subclass name of course is that you ll have one logger object per member of your class

443908
instances	private
plus from an abstract point of view the logger really does belong to the class and can be shared between all instancess rather than each instances needing its own private copy so it makes sense to declare it as static

443910
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
i ve been having a look at several mvc frameworks like ruby-on-rails merb cakephp codeignitier and similars...

443910
value	field

i ve installed visual c# 2008 express on a clean windows-xp pro sp3 machine started a new windows forms project double-clicked the form to create a form1_load method then typed

443974
put	get
its always a bad idea to put data from a get request directly into sql and there are many easy ways to prevent sql injection

444000
value	field
the constructor is called before the static field have all been initialized because the static field including those representing the enum value are initialized in textual order and the enum value always come before the other field

444001
hide	show
if the validate parameters function is successful you hide the error panels and show the report panels if not you do the opposite

444002

444002
hash	md5
calculate the md5 hash with system.security.cryptography.md5cryptoserviceprovider

444014
background-image	height
if you have fixed pixel height for the entry lines you could always use one single background-image with the gradients on it

444014
font-size	height
if you want to to keep the line height font-size flexible you can work with multiple classes one for every color tone

444020
getter	setter
here s a good rule of thumb if you have a variables that has nothing but a setter and a getter you have data not code--get it out of your class and place it into a collection or something

444020
getter	setter
having a variables with a setter and a getter just means that either you never do anything with it it s data or the code that manipulates it is in another class terrible oo design move the variables to the other class

444040
callback	methods
once the flow methods is done callback to the user-interface thread to let it know

444057

444075
virtualization	vmware
you could consider running a windows virutal machine on a linux host using virtualization software like vmware

444077
ruby-enterprise-edition	passenger
we re having great results with the phusion stack passenger and ruby-enterprise-edition in house but i haven t been able to find much in the way of data on their use in the wild particularly ree

444089
xsd	xml
you can use the validate method of the xmldocument object to validate the xml up against a xsd

444157
account	api
using api you can get list of documents in your google docs account you can even search em

444188
stream	send
you could create a new stream class that send the output to two streams

444189
mouseover	mouseout
look at the slidedown and slidetoggle functions and it would basically require you setting up hidden divs and then on the mouseover event you would slidetoggle your text out and the hidden image div in and on mouseout do the opposite

444192
output	mode
the second one uses a streambuffersource sends the output to an mpeg-2 demultiplexer sending the video to the arcsoft video decoder and on to a video mixing renderer 9 set up in windowless mode

444216
constructor	object
when you create an object using an object literal is the constructor varying on browser

444217
getter	setter
this property is available to all javascript-objects you create and allows you to add properties or functions to the object declaration so you had a object with 2 properties and later on you added 4 functions getter and setter

444217
getter	setter
in the example 2 you inline the declaration of these getter and setter in the object declaration so in the end they are the same

444217
getter	setter
this will give you the same object without getter and setter

444224
contains	elements
the style property of a dom elements contains all the css declarations for that elements

the community and me have been updating the gcc and newlib to the latest stable versioning and everything seems to work with the old binutils

444336
children	nodes
from there selected the nodes with children but no parents and iteratively build your tree from the top down

444345
silverlight	wpf
you could also look at xbaps which are sandboxed wpf apps that run in the browser works on ie and firefox but requires the full .net to be installed client-side whereas silverlight does not have this problem

444356
duplicates	contains
linking the static libs into the plugins is not an option since they contains singletons which would be duplicates app and dlls each have their own copy of static variables

444547
worksheet	excel
but this was more for programmatically creating and updating excel worksheet

444579
value	field
that said processing a json document as a stream is often problematic in that many objects are not simple field value pairs but contains other objects as values which you need to parsing to process and this tends to end up a recursive thing

444579
push	pull
i am sure if you search the .net you will find pull and push based parsing for json

444580
postgresql	mysql
note the interval syntax varies slightly between databases and that s the one for postgresql so you might have to change it slightly for mysql

444584
document	element
do note the use of the xslt document function in order to access the required simply as an element in an xml document

444588
attributes	properties
it is a data model that is used in circumstances where the number of attributes properties parameters that can be used to describe a thing an entity or object is potentially very vast but the number that will actually apply to a given entity is relatively modest.

regarding a i think profiling are meant for different building or execution environment

444666
environment	building
using profiling might become problematic when real profiling for different execution or building environment come into play

444677
decrement	increment
once s has been decrement 3 times all threads will block until one of them increment the counter

444695
exception-handling	try-catch
second use multiple try-catch statements in a function where you need to be sure which function call threw the exception-handling

jar	war
to deploy a war can i just copy the jar to catalina_home webapps

444733
put	get
there is a slight difference between remove get and put although my guess is that you have a threading issue

execute	prepare
you also said you don t want to mess with perl did that include a prepare perl-script that he just needs to execute

444739
click	mouse
what can potentially happen is that the user keeps his mouse over the item for one second and then click

444741
lookup	any
our applications that establish connections via jdbc don t seem to have any issues but we do when going through something that does a tnsnames.ora lookup or that s my hunch at least

444754
methods	extend
however i don t have the addeventlistener and dispatchevent methods on this class because it doesn t extend uicomponent

444755
null-terminated	c-strings
for char arrays specifically it could be the null-terminated 0 which is used for standard c-strings

444755
contains	elements
of course then your arrays itself cannot contains the sentinel elements as content

444757
integer	short
these methods take object arguments so if you pass them an int it will be converted to an integer and will never match any item in your map because they will all have short keys

444775
implements	extends
extends the eventdispatcher class or implements the ieventdispatcher interface from the flash.events package

444814
binary	hex
as greg said you can use struct if you are dealing with binary values but if you just have a hex number but in byte format you might want to just convert it like

444822
reflection	runtime
reflection is the feature in .net which enables us to get some information about object in runtime

444822
constructor	object
also it can get the names of the methods that are inside the class and constructor of that object

444825
textbox	button
one way to minimize this in a web app and a common mistake devs do is to have a datagrid full of textbox of data to edit with a save button per row or on the whole table

444851
revision	svnadmin
i would use svnadmin dump to create a history of revision into a dumpfile which can be restored to a working repository

444913
contains	set
the response contains the pound sign is being sent in the utf-8 character set but is being interpreted in a different character set probably iso-8859-1

444913
any	set
check what character encoding you are specifying for your jsp and if the problem still persists use a sniffer to investigate the response that the form posts and specifically any character set it specifies

444927
click	mouse
such case may be a menu that when you hover your mouse on it or click on it its get displayed

444927

if you re running on windows or linux vmware server mentioned by another poster and virtualbox should both do what you want and they re both free

444984
internet-explorer	gecko
step 1- use a javascript library so you can have the code be as cross browser as possible - otherwise you have to cater to two different event models between internet-explorer and gecko webkit based browsers

444984
javascript	dom
the clickshield could easily have javascript code expand it to the width -height of your page post dom rendering using the methods of any of the aforementioned javascript libraries

445002
append	input
using this code to append file input s does not upload the file in firefox

445006

xml-serialization	xml
if the structure of the xml is constant you can see my blog post on easy xml-serialization

445014
any	set
make sure any dependencies have copy local set to true

445038
exception-handling	try-catch
if you use exception-handling as if they were super error codes then you end up writing code like you mentioned - wrapping every methods call in a try-catch block

445038
exception-handling	error-handling
now in the real world it is often the case that methods throw exception-handling where you d rather they didn t endoffile for example in which case you have to use the try catch wrapper anti-pattern but if you get to design your methods don t use exception-handling for day-to-day error-handling - use them for exceptional circumstances only

445042
.when	ready
if you use the gd library you can reuse the same image resource for each step and then just write it to file .when you re ready re-use the same image resource to create the thumbnail

445075
enterprise-architect	visio
however for uml i use a true uml tool enterprise-architect rather than stuffing around in visio

445086
flyweight-pattern	factory-pattern
if your answer is memory i would suggest your overthinking your application and if you re really concerned look into the flyweight-pattern or perhaps a simple factory-pattern

445093
.net	wcf
i m trying to come up with a simple easy to use design pattern for error handling in a .net wcf service specifically a silverlight enabled wcf service

445093
exception-handling	try-catch
so for a wcf service you need to wrap each methods in a try-catch catch each exception-handling wrap it in a faultexception-handling and throw it

445098
contains	any
your proposed assembly should contains only types and not any implementation lest ye be plagued by redistributing dlls on a more frequent basis

445107
export	csv
finally when you export to the customer if you set the mime type to text csv excel is usually mapped to that type so it appears to the user to be an excel file

445127
constructor	object
can i pass this to a function as a pointer from within the class constructor and use it to point at the object s members before the constructor returns

445135
constructor	object
when you instantiate an object in c++ the code in the constructor is the last thing executed

445135
constructor	object
the code in the constructor is really just to perform additional initialization once the object is constructed

445135
constructor	object
so it is perfectly valid to use a this pointer in a class constructor and assume that it points to a completely constructed object

445143
hidden-field	checkbox
keep a hidden text field on your page and everytime you check a box call a javascript method that will write the id of the checkbox to the hidden-field

at the top of this tab you will see a checkbox followed by stop the task if it runs for then there are two textbox to enter hours and minutes

445152
contains	elements
create a bufferedimage contains the constant elements maze

445155
xml-serialization	xml
by far the simplest method i ve found for dealing with xml in c# is to use the xml-serialization tools

445164
updating	updates
look at only updating parts of the gui that you need to updates

445171
arrays	map
i d also recommend that you use a 2d arrays for your stage map since it makes a number of things easier both logistically and conceptually

445182
space	input
what i m trying to do is determine how i can have the phone default to numeric input on an address field then go alpha once a space has been inserted

445197
hosts-file	hosts
try updating your hosts for windows-users c windows system32 drivers etc hosts with an entry that will route all requests from your live domain back to your machine

445214
64bit	x86
on plain x86 you wouldn t notice the problem on x86 with pae or 64bit amd64 intel 64 bit machines you d get a segfault

445218
32-bit	64bit
on 64bit windows 32-bit programs run

445234
linux	unix
even rcs and sccs the grandfather vcs for most of what runs on unix linux these days permit concurrent editing access to files and i m not referring to separate branches

445239
python	java
however the computer science courses having given me a small amount of experience in a few languages c++ java and python leave me wondering where to go for development on my own

445247
virtual-machine	vmware
i plan to do it using virtual-machine software either vmware or microsoft virtual pc

445247
windows-xp	windows
i would like to be able to test windows 7 windows vista windows-xp and windows 98 in both 32 and 64 bit flavors and possibly at differing service pack levels

445253
mbunit	nunit
if you use gallio to run both your mbunit and nunit tests then the output will be in the same format and you can use the gallio reports

445253
mbunit	nunit
alternately just modify your dashboard.config file to include the mbunit report in addition to the nunit report

445270
strcpy	gets
countless mistakes in the c design exist ranging from gets to strcpy to the strncpy api it should have had the strlcpy api since day 1

445274
vba	vb6
the closest msdn articles i find reference .net i m stuck in the vba vb6

445285

445290
virtualization	virtualbox
another virtualization tool you should consider is virtualbox by sun

selected	button
i ve got a problem on a webforms application where a user selected some criteria from drop downs on the page and hits a button on the page which calls this method

445306
configuration	environment
i can only confirm that it is an environment bug and suspect maybe configuration differences like maybe rewrite rules

445312
javascript	dom
when specifying a dom event name in javascript does casing matter

445314
python	java
given that you know c++ java and python already a next language i might suggest would be sql and ddl defining databases and getting data in and out of them

445319
web-config	app-config
all the configuration can be done within app-config instead web-config of asp.net

445325
implementation	instantiation
my thought on it is that the user-controls is part of the view implementation and the presenter should not know what is going on inside the view implementation which means that the window-level presenter by extension should not know about the user-controls s presenter and hence there should be no communication between them including instantiation of the latter by the former

445330
haskell	lisp
if your cs course didn t touch on it i highly advise spending a bit of time with a more functional style of language like erlang haskell or even lisp

445331
32-bit	64bit
there are 32-bit and 64bit versions of all their os and servers plus legacy stuff going back to ms-dos

445333
put	get
get a vanilla hard drive for the os and a pair of fast drives wd velociraptors etc and put them in raid 1 for the webserver for redundancy

445338
pascal	delphi
delphi object pascal properties

445340
value	field
then you are going to have to parsing the xml that comes back to find the item and the item field with the value you require

445348
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream is not required to be slower but it is generally slower when implemented

445348
buffering	streaming
additionally streaming operations often use growable buffering internally

445372
google-chrome	safari
it s the browser safari google-chrome etc that expands www.google.com out into so that you can actually visit the site

445373
cout	cin
one reason i know that the printf family of functions are faster than the corresponding c++ functions cout cin and other streams is that the latter do typechecking

445373
cout	cin
in fact in programming competitions it is often recommended that you use printf et al rather than cout cin for precisely this reason

445428
jquery	.post
is it possible to add data to a .post request using the ajax model under jquery rather than having everything in the query string

445440
jquery	.post
according to jquery s documentation you can use jquery..post to .post data

445456
cinema-4d	maya
if it helps i used to be okay with 3d studio max and cinema-4d although every single course seems to use maya but haven t touch it in about four years

445494
scrollable	grid
in the past i ve impelemented a fixed height gridview with a frozen header and a scrollable div wrapped around it so i always at least knew the max height of the grid obviously if you don t hit that max then the height is still variables

445500
revision	svn
i have an old svn repository with around 7500 revision and part of those 7500 revision are some pretty large .fla files

445506
protected	public
if you re trying to expose protected methods from an inheritor you can wrap them in public methods

445508
inherited	subclass
your subclass will be able to access the protected members of the class you inherited

445522
defined	declare
you can use the internalsvisibletoattribute class defined in system.rutime.compilerservices to declare a type as accessible to code in the same assembly or a specified assembly only

445524
display	width
how do i calculate the min width that the last column needs to be to display the data and if it is large to keep the column header on the page

445534
perl	php
this will turn into a religious war between the ruby on rails camp and the python camp with a good smattering of the php and perl

445576
ruby-on-rails	django
instead some apps are made with ruby-on-rails some with django some with cake and so on and so forth

445579
telnet	ssh
i d like to access files in an iphone such as using remotely connecting via ssh and telnet

445579
telnet	ssh
but it appears that the iphone s ssh or telnet are not supported

445579
telnet	ssh
i can ping it but cannot use telnet or ssh

445579
telnet	ssh
is there an official way to ssh or telnet into my iphone

445585
triggers	insert
when dynamically insert an iframe into a webpage the jquery load event allows me to triggers a callback function when this iframe is loaded see also this stackoverflow article

445599
icefaces	dwr
there are already many frameworks dwr icefaces that support this pattern

445605
user-interface	flicker
i already did one using very primitive screen drawing and it is not as good as the histogram user-interface in task manager as it is not resizable and flicker like crazy on certain monitor i m thinking of rewriting the user-interface using the same user-interface like the one in task manager

445611
user-defined-functions	udf
actually one of the nice features of firebird is the ability to write user-defined-functions udf s you can call the udf directly from a triggers and the udf could in turn notify your app using standard interprocess communication that an updates has occured this then becomes a notification model rather than a polling model and much more scalability

445611
delphi	c++
caveat the udf needs to be a native dll i believe c++ or delphi there would most likely be quite a bit of sample code out there in delphi

445637
formatting	printing
in itself streams are just the hull that keep formatting and error flags in place and call the right i o facets of the c++ standard-library for example num_put to printing numbers that printing the values well formatted into the underlying stream-buffer connected to the c++ stream

445643
webserver	upload
i went to upload a new file to my webserver only to get a message in return saying that my disk quota was full.

445644
upgrade	migrate
depending on how many new projects you ve added is it possible for you to restore the 2005 databases to the new server upgrade them to 2008 and then migrate the newer projects into this newly updated database

445653
directory	folder
with that many files i would write a scripting for my command-line ftp client that goes to the folder in question and performs a directory listing redirecting the output to a file

445658
any	set
the problem is that the user can set any of them because

445659
latex	tex
i having written an all in one tex latex - html and ascii text and rtf converter

445670
authentication	login
if by login parameters you mean sending credentials using basic http authentication it s done using request.setchallengeresponse like so

445689
right-align	padding
left-align the header to make it stay put you can add padding on the left to fake a centered or right-align header

445690
arrays	map
a queue or just a simple arrays map would work

445703
put	get
i ll put a calculation on a read-only get or a set

445704
put	get
you should only put calculations on get if the value is likely to change every time its queried

445711
ruby	php
i am very familiar with php and mysql and somewhat familiar with python and ruby so a php solution would be preferred

445716
access-control	authentication
click the edit button in the authentication and access-control box

445724
typename	typedef
instead of typename you want to use typedef

445739
put	get
if the calculations simple and does not take a long time then put it in the get

445739
variables	boolean
you could set a isdirtytotalprice boolean in all the dependant sets and then do the calculation on the fly in the get and cache it so that the get only calculates the variables when it needs to

445748
variables	boolean
you could also use a for-loop with a boolean condition such as looping while a variables is equal to true

445748
for-loop	loops
so you could either find a workaround or just use a for-loops instead of a foreach loops

445754
any	set
i have set the employeeid is primary key.i want that employeeid field will be incremented automatically whenever adding any new records

445765
digits	base
it is much easir if you work with hex since every number i mean every digits but digits is for base 10 hexgit represent four bits

445768
identity-column	database-table
the employeeid field should be an identity-column in your database-table

445769
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
thinking-sphinx is a better alternative than ultrasphinx which seems abandoned but in general xapian has a more powerful engine than sphinx and is easier for implementing realtime search

445771
digits	base
if digits is the name for a number on base 10 what would be the name for a number on base 16

445779
digits	short
the only exception-handling are bit which is really just short for binary digits and trit which is short for ternary digits

445800
database-project	datadude
we re not using vsts database edition datadude but the standard visual-studio database-project with a scripting batch file which tears down and recreates the database from t-sql scriptinging

445807
webserver	host
host isn t actually a valid header field in http 1.0 and depending on how fascist the webserver you are contacting is about standards it would reject this as a bad request based on the protocol you claim to be speaking

445807
value	field
it is possible that your request function is returning something for the request-uri field -- you substitute in the value of request as the contents of this part of the request-line -- that is bogus in one way or another badly escaped characters etc.

445852
64bit	x86
x64 exception-handling model gets you to the msdn article everything you need to know to start programming 64bit windows systems which contains the quote the downside to table-based exception-handling-handling relative to the x86 stack-based model is that looking up function table entries from code addresses takes more time than just walking a linked-list

445855
arraylist	treemap
i would like to put two small constant objects one treemap and one arraylist somewhere in the servletcontext of a struts2 webapp running under tomcat 6 such that those objects may be accessible from any jsp through the application scope

445858
factors	primes
this transformation produces the correct result the maximum primes factors of 600851475143 in just 0.109 sec

445879
directory	folder
edit strangely enough if i put the jar somewhere else say in a directory inside of my user folder and change the path to it in my build.xml it works

445903
any	set
can i place any global image in any global positioning that would change automatically whenever any remote object is called and the image would be set as default whenever the response comes back from the server

445905
xsd	xml
i have to write a c++ application using the qt framework for the gui that can edit data stored in xml files described by a xsd schema file

445907
key-value	key
the only exception-handling that i have ever recalled seeing work half-decently is the key-value editor that lets you edit values for a fixed set of key this also works in a tree

445935
instances	private
if the synchronization is not to make each instances of the class as a whole threadsafe in the invocation of it s public methods then you should use a private internal object

445943
default	reset
bottom line never name your inputs submit or any other default property or methods of the form element action or reset

445947
any	set
as jon skeet quite correctly says you ll need to use ixmlserializable with the xmlserialization if you don t want to have a public get set for the properties because it s designed to work in a partial-trust environment so won t access any data that you couldn t have accessed anyway to answer his last part - yes some struct like datetime do have explicit support in that serialization

445947
getter	setter
depending on what you re trying to achieve and what versioning of .net you re using you could consider using the datacontractserializer which doesn t require things to be public for example you could put a datamemberattribute on a private field or a property with public getter and private setter

445948
xsd	xml
altova xml spy can generate c++ from an xsd it s commercial but there s a 30 day free trial if you want to try it out

445955
firefox	opera
for the specific case of needing a more screen-friendly view of the msdn or on any other site like stackoverflow that makes poor use of screen real estate i would suggest applying a custom stylesheet to the page using a tool like ie7pro ie greasemonkey firefox stylish fireox or the built in stylesheet picker in opera

445967
any	set
but at times i will also need to change the same element to which means that i will need to remove the css class that i set without removing any other styles that i might have assigned

445971
zend-framework	cakephp
i would say try to use an oo framework zend-framework cakephp symphony and create a configuration xml based to tell the loader which class should be loaded that mean you can redifined class when you need to add a functionality to an existing feature or load new class

445979
updatepanel	formview
easiest way is to nest a formview inside the updatepanel

445987
teamcity	gallio
i m using gallio and mbunit 3 and i have teamcity 4 installed

445991
controller	routes
but another issue you might experience is that your css request could risk being mapped to a controller action depending on your routes and webserver setup so that you would also have to modify the routes collection on global.asax.cs

446005
put	get
what do you want to happen if you put a 5l then try to get 5 5 ..

446005
double	int
if k is int then check if the object passed is long short float double ... then convert and compare

446012
primitive	int
and your example above is that with primitive an implicit widening of the int value can occur however with object types there are no rules for implicitly converting from int to a long

446033
compact-framework	.net
is their any ioc controllers available that will work on .net compact-framework

446056
look-and-feel	substance
i m using the flamingo ribbon and the substance office 2007 look-and-feel

446067
selected	checkbox
package configuration wizard selected properties to export traverse the following tree nodes and tick its checkbox

446073
order	add
and in that administration panels i have a textbox to the user add the username and password in order that entering the administration page i will jump directly to the service in the iframe so the user does not need to enter user pwd to login every time that is way i m trying to add those values dynamically

446077
message	alert
one approach i have in mind is to show a transparent view with a progress windows much like the message alert windows - which allows the user to interact with the message alert windows only

446121
interop	tlbimp
i know that i can generate the primary interop assembly manually by running tlbimp primary on each individual ocx file but i could not find a way to generate the activex wrapper unless i do it via visual-studio user-interface

446147
textbox	button
the question is how to make default button be focused on form focus and response on enter hit but not focused when the caret is in textbox with multiline property set to true for example

446171
contains	set
i m not sure what the proper way to do this is but i ve found that what works best for me is to set the size of the windows and the widget contains within it usually size themselves correctly

446226
executable	jar
but you should in general avoid making a java application executable on one platform just because you don t like double clicking jar files

446230
cvs	git
vcs like svn git cvs etc

446232
arguments	default
your action could take a few default arguments

446244
cvs	git
i have a git repository originally cvs then svn now git containing a ruby-on-rails project that has been deployed on linux for a while now

446247
error-handling	try-catch
i would suggest you to centralize the error-handling of your wcf service instead of putting try-catch on every methods

446254
linux	unix
if want to automate the startup phase like cron in linux unix use the built in scheduler for windows

446256
xsd	xml
the netbeans ide has a wizard for generating xml documents from an xsd schema

446282
oracle	mysql
for smaller websites which are view-only or require light online-editing sql server 2008 oracle and mysql are overkill

446298
contains	any
this will find any string that only contains non-white space spaces new lines tabs etc

446301
version-control	bazaar
edit there are other decentralized version-control systems out there mercurial and bazaar

446316
display	width
in a column defined as text with width 50 dataaware textfields always display 50 characters even when the actual string value contains less characters

446320
constructor	object
edit oops - as rightly pointed out there d be no way to know whether the constructor for the class in question is sensitive to when or how many times it is called or whether the object s state is changed during the method so it would have to be created from scratch each time

446325
push	pull
use pull push to sync with another parent repository on an external harddrive for backup

446336
postgresql	mysql
both of the big oss db s mysql and postgresql can scale to extremely large sites

446351
cpu-architecture	x86
if you compile your modules using the platform x86 x64 ia64 switch the compiler will include this information in the resulting pe file so that the clr will jit the code into the appropriate cpu native code and optimize the code for that cpu-architecture

446351
environment	execution
ngen can t make as many assumptions about the execution environment as the jit compiler can and therefore will produce unoptimized code

446359
webforms	asp.net
in asp.net webforms i am normally for small to medium size project using following project pattern

446387
mathml	xhtml
xhtml really only comes into its own when you re using other namespaces such as svg or mathml

446440
selected	button
you can selected your button with this syntax assuming button1 is the server id of the button

446501
versioning	upgrade
the fix suggested by them is to upgrade it to versioning 2.2.6

446507
return-value	arguments
-p you can always pass the updated value back as a return-value or declare a delegate type with ref arguments i don t recommend it though

446512
click	mouse
it is also possible to bring up the context menu move the mouse outside and then click completely bypassing the whole check above or even move the mouse very fast past the border so i often add a timer that fires after the mouse hasn t moved in say 2-3 seconds

446545
sniffing	packets
if so use ssl to stop any packets sniffing

446547
user-input	output
the most important rule when handling user-input is validate input escape output

446552
any	set
just set is as per any other reflection code

446571
directory	folder
hence all the apache related dlls are located in the application folder s sub directory c program files mywebapp apache2

446574
file-not-found	access-denied
setting keepalive false on the connection makes it fail on the second request with error 550 file-not-found access-denied

446585
execute	prepare
it s still possible to screw it up -- for example if your stored procedure just builds a sql string internally and execute it trusting the input -- but prepare statements with parameters mean that no unescaped data will ever get to the db server completely cutting off that attack vector

446615
boost-serialization	boost-interprocess
boost-interprocess boost-serialization and protocol buffers should be platform independent so technically it could work on linux mac as well

446617
contains	any
i have graph and somehow i need to find all closed contours in graph that doesn t contains any other edges of the graph

446622
response	timeout
you can t recall the request but you can set a timeout value after which the response will be ignored

446626
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
as of jquery 1.5 the returned object is a wrapper for the native xmlhttprequest object called jqxhr

446644
risk-management	research
am new to software project-management and currently doing some research on risk-management in s ware development

446659
ready	live
the web designer adds modifies content types forms and layout on the test server and ports it to the live server when ready

446671
order	add
also note that i ve explicitly specified the code instead of using the ordinal value - this makes it easier to change the order and add remove errors later

446685
perl	ruby
any ideas on how i can use a perl python ruby type language without all the headaches of getting the interpreter on their computer

446716
perl	ruby
there are similar solutions for perl and ruby but i believe py2exe is both free and reliable

446729
any	set
so far i can t find any places in our application where we set the isolation level to anything other than read committed and the xml below also indicates that we re using read committed

446732
javascript	dom
if your document is error-free on this layer you get fewer suprises to debug when writing javascript or css that works with the dom

446774
arguments	default
alternatively the arguments can be on the query string and will still get default using the value from the anon-type

446788
unmanaged	c++-cli
probably the easiest way to do this is to create a c++-cli project which will enable you to mix managed and unmanaged c++

446790
unmanaged	c++-cli
i learned this by doing it so i don t have a good tutorial but there are a couple things you need to be aware of - managed c++ and c++-cli both integrate with unmanaged code with very few ugly seams

446833
codedom	.net
for a comprehensive tutorial please see microsoft .net codedom technology - part 1

446849
key-value	key
i am able to retrieve some information like column and table names but i would also like other information like the name of the primary key field the primary key-value

446856
hide	show
i am using a collapsiblepanelextender in the ajaxtoolkit 3.5 to show hide search filtering options

446861
click	mouse
click on the page and hitting ctrl + a or some other shortcut key may selected the text anyway and it may be impossible to block all key and mouse events that can get at the text

446861
webserver	security
someone could steal your applet but would have difficulty making it talk to your webserver due to the same-origin security policy note this can also be worked around

446883
.when	ready
.when i m ready to take that next step what options are best for non-native compiled formats.

446911
extends	super
let s have two objects foo of class super and bar of class sub which extends super

446916
json	xml
json is way easier to parse than xml and there are a lot of options to do so

446918
typechecking	type-safety
moreover gcc provides static typechecking on printf -style function-calls so the benefit of type-safety is reduced

446926
webforms	asp.net
so the scenario is the user opens a pdf document in an asp.net webforms fills out the form and then clicks either the print button or save button

446936
json	xml
xml is heavier than json so it uses more bandwidth but powerful for validating and transforming data

446962
nvidia	ati
are there any third-party reports that compare ati s stream framework to nvidia s cuda framework ie not from ati or nvidia talking themselves up

446995
python	java
think c# java python perl etc.

447019
contains	set
using phpmyadmin i have set a mysql database to utf-8 and have imported a textfile contains utf-8 data into it

447036
windows-vista	windows
support statement for visual basic 6.0 on windows-vista windows server 2008 and windows 7

447036
windows-vista	windows
the core visual basic 6.0 runtime will be supported for the full lifetime of windows-vista windows server 2008 and windows 7

447036
basic	vb6
i spoke to paul yuknewicz who is a program manager on the microsoft visual basic team and who is quite involved with everything related to vb6 and its migration process

447036
windows-vista	windows
supported runtime files â shipping in the os key visual basic 6.0 runtime files used in the majority of application scenarios are shipping in and supported for the lifetime of windows-vista or windows server 2008

447036
windows-vista	windows
this lifetime is five years of mainstream support and five years of extended support from the time that windows-vista or windows server 2008 ships

447036
windows-vista	windows
the visual basic 6.0 ide will be supported on windows-vista and windows server 2008 as part of the visual basic 6.0 extended support policy until april 8 2008

447040
e-commerce	product
the issue i have is as follows my company s supplier gives us an access database which i import into sql-server contains their product information the alternative is to use xml and i m trying to massage this into a more usable format for use in an e-commerce website

447057
scala	java
you should be able to use both java and scala within the project after these setup steps

447082
attributes	properties
what is the best way from the mybase class to get the uniqueid attributes find the matching properties name and get the underlying value

447083
order	add
so i have this query that is relatively fast at 0.5 seconds but when i add an order by clause it jumps up to nearly 30 seconds

447101
stderr	stdout
the last line is supposed to return the stderr back to where it was before which i have only supposed is the same as stdout

447104
32-bit	64bit
i 0bcd efgh which is not unlike what a c shift function would do if you are say on a 32-bit instruction set operating on a 64bit number

447115
relational-database	schema
the only exception-handling is when the database is not a typical relational-database but a star or snowflake schema

447121
compact-framework	.net
i m developing this app using the .net compact-framework 3.5 in c#

447128
listbox	textbox
i haven t used ownerdraw on a textbox but i ve used it on other controls such as the listbox and listview and i ve seen other people do this with textbox

447137
for-loop	loops
in javascript the for-loops does not have it s own scope - so a var you create inside a loops is not different from one defined outside of it

447144
build-server	teamcity
have a build-server teamcity with 2 build configuration

447146
oracle	mysql
i don t know mysql very well but with oracle you could boost performance even more by indexing column1 column4 column2 which would make the optimizer do all of its work from the index and not touch table data at all

447147
profiling	trace
you need to run a deadlock profiling trace while the errors are occurring

447176
python	perl
1 double click this .msi file to install python or perl or whatever

447217
web-deployment	web
i m using a web-deployment project in visual-studio 2008 in order to prepare my asp.net application asp.net web application not asp.net web site for being copied to several servers

447218
put	get
if you put the rev keyword inside a file and enable keyword substitution with the svn keywords property you will not get what you want

447218
contains	any
you will get the last revision that affected the file that contains the keyword instead of the last revision that affected any part of the project

447218
revision	updates
you will probably need to write a little script that invokes this command captures the output and then uses the revision number to updates a project file or source code file somewhere

447224
configuration	environment
this would easily allow for different environment as you would simply need scripts to generate the ide specific portions based on the maven configuration

447230
hide	show
you can use these to hide navbars ads or show different ads

447247
macros	vba
when a worksheet is protected with this flag set vba macros are still allowed to make changes

447271
stderr	stdout
that way the scripting preserves the separation of stdout and stderr for the scripting ie

447271
stderr	stdout
the scripting stdout and stderr can be redirected separately

447281
arrays	loops
what you re likely seeing is the result of your optimizing compiler seeing that most or all of your native arrays loops can be removed

447285
environment	execution
i ve got common code that can run in a number of execution environment - within iis within a wcf service in a stand-alone application or in a windows workflow instances

447300
value	field
not the identity field or the smart key but rather some type of abstract value or abbreviation

447315
variables	boolean
a slight hack but you could use a timer control and a boolean variables

447315
variables	boolean
start the timer on the click event set the boolean variables to false

447315
variables	boolean
set the boolean variables to true on the doubleclick event

447315
variables	boolean
when the timer tick event fires check the boolean variables to see if the user did a click or doubleclick

447317
licensing	lgpl
qt jambi does allow you to use qt on java as an alternative to swing and qt 4.5 is going to be available with lgpl licensing

447317
type-safety	generics
also they will have to be nice wide generics varchars so you will get no type-safety from the database

447356
paintcomponent	draw
now your view who s likely to be a jpanel or the like can just call draw using its own graphics object from within its paintcomponent methods

447359
gridview	formview
it works with a gridview which then displays the data but with this formview it doesn t display the data

447379
instances	private
i found that if there is a need to restrict the user to create the stack object we can make destructor private and provide an interface to delete the instances

447388
click	mouse
activeperl and strawberry perl are dead easy to install on windows with just a couple of mouse click

it allows you to have the object be dynamic yet still be able to write some custom code that runs whenever properties are accessed similarly to getter and setter -- see getproperty and setproperty .

447622
arrays	loops
the reason why i prefer the first method the one with the arrays is that i always have the option to loops through the arrays for database insertion updating purposes

32-bit	64bit
note that this seems to not work if using code compiled from 32-bit windows on a 64bit windows os but since our modules are compiled from source on the target that should be ok for our purposes

447914
contains	set
ok in your class it.___.web.actions.visualizationaction you must return a string value contains input then on struts.xml you have to set something like this

447965
triggers	insert
the triggers that i insert is this

447968
controllers	routes
however with this scheme all controllers that inherit from this class and are routed appropriately with the routes listed above expect what i perceive to be redundant uneeded parameters in their action handler

447997
required	checked
however sometimes doing this can be overkill if your only dealing with one variation that won t change implements it using a type checked and when if you find you were wrong and it required more checkeds then refactor it into a more robust solution

google-chrome	firefox
the following simple block of code renders as i would expect it to in safari firefox google-chrome and opera

448026

sql-server	oracle
i m trying to access a large oracle through sql-server using openrowset in client-side javascript and not having much luck

448077
sql-server	oracle
a sql-server view that accesses the oracle using openrowset works perfectly so i know i have valid connection string parameters

448077
sql-server	oracle
however the new requirement is for extremely dynamic oracle queries that depend on client-side selections and i haven t been able to get dynamic or even parameterized oracle queries to work from sql-server views or stored procedures

448077
sql-server	oracle
therefore access to the oracle has to be through the sql-server database using views stored procedures or dynamic queries using openrowset

448077
sql-server	oracle
my idea was to define a function that would take my own version of a parameterized oracle query make the parameter substitutions wrap the query in an openrowset and execute it in sql-server returning the resulting recordset

448079
malloc	free
when free ing the piece first goes into a free-list for quick reuse by another malloc if the size fits

448079
malloc	free
when free pieces arrive so that multiple fragments can be joined free usually does this but sometimes fragments remain depending on size and orderof malloc and free

448079
malloc	free
but usually malloc keeps things in its pocket dependig on the allocated free ratio many heuristics and sometimes compile or flag options are often available

448079

i could upgrade to ie8 and they might work but i would have to check every site that doesn t work with opera and if i found any that also didn t work with ie8 how do i downgrade

448196
value	field
by django 1.1 you ll be able to do this in a single sql call via the orm using f objects to reference field in the update value

448199
background-image	height
unless you use a fixed height probably not a viable solution or use the faux-column technique by using a background-image which you ve already labeled as a problem you re pretty much out of luck

448204

well you haven t shown all your code - in particular where you re setting target and how you re checking the value of the field afterwards

448222
any	set
this is the case for any client using a fixed width character set

448226
background-color	width
the imagetile.gif should be a 1px by x px slice of the background-color where x is the width of the page

448245
python	java
i don t know of any automated tools that would generate non-disgusting looking python and having ported java code to python myself i found the result was both higher quality than the original and considerably shorter

448245
getter	setter
it also is considerably shorter for example 99 of getter setter can just be left out in favor of directly accessing the fields

448246
websphere	ibm
i came across an article on the ibm web site where it says that hibernate s cluster aware caches in conjunction with websphere application server has not been determined yet

perl	awk
i know this is possible with a perl or awk script but i am having difficulty with the expressions to isolate the number

448295
derived-class	base-class
in c++ calling a virtual methods in a base-class constructor will simply call the methods as if the derived-class doesn t exist yet because it doesn t

448295
constructor	object
the effect of making a virtual call class.virtual to a pure virtual function directly or indirectly for the object being created or destroyed from such a constructor or destructor is undefined.

sftp	ftp
what are the options for having a simple blog content management system that will deploy the full site as static html over ftp sftp and any blog api

448519
web-services	api
unfortunately both the econnect api and the gp web-services both return generic errors just be glad you don t have to parse the econnect ones

448521
associations	model
the partial belongs to model a but has an associations with model b so it is applicable to model b as well

448533
profiling	trace
use sql profiling to trace activity on the server then recreate the problem

448533
profiling	trace
you can trace these handles through the profiling output to see what else is being executed using that handle

448572
hide	show
if you re just presenting a lot of static data in a compact spaces - load it when the page loads and hide show as appropriate

448577
strncmp	strcmp
as far as i know you re absolutely right--there s no reason to use strncmp instead of strcmp

for c++ the base constructor is called before the derived constructor which means that the virtual table which holds the addresses of the derived-class s overridden virtual-functions does not yet exist

448790
any	set
in fact it s even more amazing that you could just download a set of every snes game ever or any atari 2600 game ever considering that when these systems were popular having free access to every cartridge would have been a dream come true

960.gs seems to be fairly popular with designers lately although i have never quite seen the point to css-frameworks myself

448806
abstract	super
abstract the sql away 95 of the time so not everyone on the team needs to know how to write super efficient database specific queries

448809
derived-class	base-class
either your example is missing some fundamental information which changes the situation or there s simply no need to chain back up to the derived-class with the information from the base-class because it has just told you that exact information

448810
contains	set
change the response object to contains a status filed and error message or only error message and check at the receiver if empty and set it properly instead of throwing an exception-handling

448819
virtual-functions	base-class
in c++ it is perfectly safe to call virtual-functions from within the base-class - as long as they are non-pure - with some restrictions

448819
constructor	object
that problem can indeed be solved by changing the c++ standard and allowing it - adjusting the definition of constructor object lifetime and whatnot

448828
linux	bsd
now the application znc an irc bouncer in case you re interested supports loading modules from .so shared library files on linux bsd etc

448850
web-frameworks	pylons
there are other alternative solutions if you want something a bit more fancy like mod_python and web-frameworks like pylons but i think the cgi solution would suit your use case better

448859
realloc	malloc
but in addition to that things allocated with malloc and family can be resized using realloc

448860
webserver	nginx
you should look into cherrypy as your http request handler which can be configured to run on top of a very light nginx webserver or apache if you prefer

448865
parsing	comma
i am trying to figure out the best way to parsing this comma delimited text file

448868
value	field
there are several field queried like that and now they are all throwing the following exception-handling the null value cannot be assigned to a member with type system.int32 which is a non-nullable value type

448883
any	set
this philosophy was worth cash money or at least labor hours which are almost more valuable when our new hire was able to check out the project from subversion into eclipse and immediately run a functional system with a small real data set without any fuss or bother on his part

448892
flv	mp3
i would recommend using mp3 audio and flash using the free jw flv media player which should do everything that you want except for the low high quality thing but maybe you can just use two players if you need

448909
python	java
the framework language isn t helping me filter out frameworks as i have varying levels of experience with java python ruby and c# and don t mind frameworks in any of these languages

448927
python	ruby
i d say choose a ruby or python one

448932
ruby-on-rails	django
the usual suspects are django and ruby-on-rails of course

448944
keypress	ctrl
alternatively is there a way to catch a ctrl - c keypress to do cleanup before the program closes instead of non-blocking io

448945

signals	sigint
on unix systems you can use sigaction call to register a signals handler for sigint signals which represents the control+c key sequence

448966
digits	zero
similar question how many numbers can you form with 5 digits in the decimal system counting the leading zero

448974
groovy	java
if you re happier in java you could also look at groovy + grails a very similar framework with a java slant groovy is kind of like a cross between java and ruby and you can mix and match java and groovy classes in the same project

448984
joomla	modx
i find that the default admin interface isn t very intuitive compared to other cms like modx or joomla mambo

448986
perl	ruby
squatting is a small perl based web framework thingy inspired by ruby s camping

448989
32-bit	64bit
and you can t run both 32-bit and 64bit code together in the same process

448992
implements	extends
but if you create an interface for your modules and then each class you load unload implements that interface as well as extends the flex module class you can load and unload them cleanly

448996
32-bit	64bit
even then i m not sure how easy it will be to get the 32-bit and 64bit process to talk with each other

449001
32-bit	64bit
in windows x64 a process may be started as 32-bit or 64bit process

449001
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit process can only load 64bit dlls and a 32bit process only 32-bit dlls

449001
32-bit	64bit
if your platform target specified in the project properties of your .net application is set to any cpu the intermediate code will be compiled to 32-bit or 64bit code depending on the target platform on a x64 system 64bit code will be generated

449001
32-bit	64bit
therefore the code can no longer load a 32-bit dll on a 64bit system

449005
specifications	w3c
read the w3c specifications

449007
show	next
instead of display the normal page where it show the image and info date desc user comments etc i want it to go to the next prev image

shell	bash
maybe you should protect the pattern with quotes if bash or anything equivalent for the shell you are using

449048
children	nodes
for extensibility i would use the first solution the one with the children nodes

449048
children	nodes
if you ever wish to store any data about all of the children then you have a convenient nodes on which to place attributes

449067
delphi	c++
let me suggest something really out of the zone here build an isapi dll or the apache equivalent if that is your preference from bare-metal c c++ or even delphi

449075
callback	methods
jquery provides the methods name as a callback parameter on the querystring which the jsonp endpoint must then take and wrap the json in then send the response back

449084
delphi	c++
you can build one in delphi or c c++ but to make it auto-downloadable you need to sign if i remember correctly long time since i made one

449085
linked-list	tree
you can either maintain a queue of unvisited nodes while iterating or add additional pointers to the tree for easier iteration making the tree for purposes of iteration act like a linked-list but either way you have to allocate extra memory for iteration

449089
contains	elements
an a elements must not contains any other a elementss

mac-address	packets
if you watch the response and see your mac-address in one of the packets in the red rectangle than someone has the same mac-address as you do.

449102
exception-handling	try-catch
from reading that question it sounds like you can have another try-catch structure in the finally statement if you think it might throw an exception-handling

449120
any	set
if you have variables www html set up as your webserver s root and have a file called index.py in the python directory in there then any request to should call the foo function in index.py or fail with a 404 if it doesn t exist

449122
environment	building

checkinventory and emailwarehouse are objects deriving from workitem which has an abstract execute methods that the subclasses implements encapsulating the behavior for those actions

449156
capacity	storage
however a strict definition of turing completeness implies infinite storage capacity which is of course not physically possible

449159

if you re using a callback methods when the thread finishes it s easy to check the property and see if it s valid or not

449354
value	field
auto_increment key field are not supposed to have any meaning so you really shouldn t care what value is used

449356
dictionary	map
in the simplest case the dictionary has a key which would map to the primary key of a table - so that when you specify the values of the key you can immediately find the matching data via a simple lookup

ip-address	proxy
it is also possible to block legitimate users if ip-addresses are used since proxy make many different clients appear as a single ip-address

449387
key-value	key
program one you open a transaction and insert into a table foo which has an autoinc primary key arbitrarily we say it gets 557 for its key-value

449398
tic-tac-toe	chess
if so chess will be solved as easily as tic-tac-toe

449430
pointers	stack
the way gc s work is by looking for objects that do not have any pointers to them the area of their search is heap stack and any other spaces they have

449450
iteration	set
if you only want to debugging dostuff on iteration 23498938 then you can set a conditional breakpoint in that function

449481
defined	declare
if a methods is declare as static you don t need the object s instances in which it is defined to invoke it

449481
void	main
public static void main string arguments

449484
portrait	screens
i had to do a linear layout and include 3 images that look like real tabs so i can try and mimic the operation of the tabs while rotating the screens to landscape and keep the visuals as portrait

449504
implements	extends
it s far more flexible to implements a common interface than try and force things to extends from a specific base-class or sometimes it s impossible

449505
getter	setter
a and b are independent variables so they have simple setter and getter that merely get and set a filed

449511
methods	extend
extend the listener type by overriding the appropriate process methods for each subtyping you are interested in

449511
compact-framework	.net
this is also a big performance win in implementations such as .net compact-framework in which narrowing casts are extremely slow but virtual dispatch is fast

449514
ruby	php
php doesn t have a cron scheduling any more than ruby does

449516
datepart	getdate

when i have a markup error in my xhtml page mozilla firefox displays the yellow screen of death showing only a large red error message on a yellow background

449560
value	field
i am using an xml file which contains size field that specify the size of value

449560
value	field
when i want to change the value of a particular field i will check the size field of that value

449576
getter	setter
the contract class would store the capabilities document and some generic getter setter

449576
value	field
the set and get would check if the field is supported in the capabilities before setting or getting the value

449582
display	width
since span tags are display inline by default switching to inline-block and specifying a width of 33 on those spans should do the trick

449584
contains	set
well you have #header set to 100 of it s contains block which would be the body

449591
value	field
it sounds like you might need more of dictionary sort of structure that can dynamically pull field based on database configuration value stored by year

449608
terminate	timeout
does it mean that until the program is terminate or the connection timeout due to inactivity the database can accept no more connections

449633
python	java
but if you want a high-level object-oriented language there are much better candidates c# java lisp python etc

plugins	add-on
i need to write an add-on plugins for ie 6 7 that will intercept any javascript print call and automatically print the page on the default printer bypassing the standard print dialog

449686
apache	vhosts
you might be able to set up apache with 2 vhosts and then in each of their blocks put a proxy of the appropriate site on your local network

449687
apache	squid
there are implementations in apache squid and mircosoft isa server

449687
webserver	host
it does tend to screw up your web logs on the webserver though traffic will all appear to come from your internal proxy host that s doing the redirection rewriting

449726
lighttpd	apache
i don t use iis so there may be some additional configuration necessary on the server but with the http servers that i ve used apache lighttpd that s all that s necessary to get the site up and running

449734
python	tcl
are there any other tools out there which could be used to convert vb6 projects to python ruby tcl whatever

449738
any	set
just log into your registrar account find the dns management tools create a new or otherwise make there there s at least one a record pointing to your static ip-address make sure that record is either www or and you re done -- assuming you don t have any software or hardware firewalls in the way and you know how to set up the site in iis as you say

449745
datamapper	poeaa
there are plenty of alternatives described in poeaa such as table data gateway row data gateway and datamapper which often provide a better solution and certainly help to provide a better abstraction to storage

449761
csv	tsv
if the file is something like csv tsv similar then csvreader is highly recommended

449765
any	set
in the user-controls you can easily set the bounds of any child control such as textbox or write a custom layout and place the textbox wherever you want

449768
derived-class	inherited
if you really need to do it on a per-instance basis you could probably do a bit of class inherited and just build a derived-class instead and or dynamically create new packages

449779
python	ruby
you could compile your vb6 functionality and expose it as a com object and connect it to python with ironpython or ironruby which are python and ruby implementations in .net thus allowing you to access .net functionality although im not quite sure if com exposed objects are easily pluggable to those interpreters

449788
authentication	logout
what is the correct way to logout of http authentication protected folder

449796
authentication	logout
afaik there s no clean way to implement a logout function when using htaccess http-based authentication

449801
versioning	migrate
you could also look at using a tool like sql compare to scripting the difference between various versioning of a database allowing you to quickly migrate between versioning

449808
png	gif
are there any ways providing an alternate gif png image in case the user has no adobe flash install and or deactivated

449827
abstract-class	class-design
in my class-design i use abstract-class and virtual functions extensively

449832
member-function-pointers	virtual-functions
an excellent article that talks about virtual-functions and more is member-function-pointers and the fastest possible c++ delegates

449851
void	main
why do we need to use int main and not void main in c++

449864
void	main
while some compilers allow for void main for the sake of consistency and simplicity the ansi standard requires one single prototype of main

449864
return-value	undefined
however if the setup-routines that call main expect an int return-value and instead don t find one behavior can undefined

449866
virtual-functions	abstract-class
so don t worry use virtual-functions and abstract-class as much as you need

449877
delphi	c++
for c++ delphi etc - the tricks will be different

449905
execution	exit
you can use exit or die in the scripting to stop scripting execution would that do what you want

449918
webrequest	webclient
webclient is simpler to use than webrequest

449925
.net	wcf
if you want to build a service in the web side that you can consume then today and in .net please choose and work with wcf restfull style

449926
firefox	opera
the following should work in at least firefox and opera

449940
contains	elements
i do have specific cases where i tend to create huge amounts of sets maps which contains usually less than 10 elements and i do really want to have less memory pressure

449962
versioning	upgrade
i m new to the project and relatively new to asp.net-mvc itself - soon we will be looking to upgrade to either the beta or rc versioning

449972
constructor	object
when you reassign the whole prototype property to a new object you re replacing the old constructor property with the new one

449978
value	field
i have a field in a table that is composite it comprises of 3 or more other sub-fields each of which have a true or false value

449978
value	field
these field are combined to form a byte value comprising 8 bits with the first 3 bits have values of 0 or 1 which the user chooses as false or true

449978
value	field
if the user chooses all fields as true the main field would have a value 7 and if he chooses all fields as false the main field would have a value 0 and like wise

449983
scp	ssh
i copy all files using the scp task then execute the rpm command remotely using the ssh task

449998
gzip	zip
i know #ziplib which supports zip gzip tar and bzip2

450006
selected	button
highlighting the selected button in a buttonbar

450010

450011
xcopy	cmd
we are experiencing a lot of problems with postbuild xcopy cmd

450011
xcopy	cmd
and we decided to avoid xcopy cmd

450027
uninstaller	msiexec
but in order to uninstaller the msi file it seems you have to call the msiexec program and give it a x or uninstaller

450027
uninstaller	msiexec
how can i uninstaller an msi from the command-line without using the msiexec routine

450034
arguments	default
the default arguments allows to define

450037
arguments	default
thus typing in a filename with an .msi extension really runs msiexec with the msi file as arguments and takes the default action install

450037
uninstaller	msiexec
for that reason uninstallering requires you to invoke msiexec with uninstaller switch to unstall it

450043
command-line	cmd
if you look in hkey_classes_root msi.package shell open cmd you ll see the cmd-line that windows actually uses when you run a .msi file

450057
build-process	ant
i use seperate folders for my java and html wicket source files but my ant build-process then copies the html to the classes folder of my web app so i avoid issues of having to setup wicket resource settings

450070
selectedindex	selecteditem
you have selecteditem or selectedindex

450080
linux	unix
this posting has quite a lot of links to unix and linux resources - in particular the books by mark sobell go into shell programming in some depth

450106
user-input	output
i m trying to find out if a child process is waiting for user-input without parsing its output

450107
command-prompt	cmd
unfortunately as soon as i issue the above cmd i am returned to the cmd-prompt

450115
value	field
field like from to subject already filled up with certain application determined value

450130
signals	sigpipe
this is more convenient in libraries where you might not want a global signals handler for sigpipe

450130
signals	sigpipe
with this in effect instead of the sigpipe signals being generated epipe will be returned

450136
contains	any
yet it bugs me that a button should contains any context-specific information such as a function pointer

450148
scp	ssh
set up a linux machine separate pc or virtual-machine and kit the rpm remotely via scripts see ssh scp samba

450148
environment	building
this strikes me as a safe approach that avoids full building environment migration

450153
compact-framework	.net
the .net compact-framework on smartphones doesn t know the button component the reasons are unknown to me

450167
hosts-file	hosts
it might not fit the bill but you could use the hosts

450167
ip-address	hostname
hosts file will only work for this purpose if the program is not connecting by ip-address but a hostname

450177
macros	vba
i have a word template which uses vba s declare statement to link to a dll whose path can be determined within the vba macros

450177
environment	restart
i don t want to permanently change the user s path environment variables temporary would be ok but this doesn t seem to work as they don t get refreshed until application restart

450180
callback	methods
for example a user can register a task with a dead line and the timer could notify a user s callback methods when the dead line is over

450180
response	timeout
i want to use this timer to detect an idle socket connection close the connection when no message is received in 10 seconds and write timeout raise an exception-handling when the write operation is not finished in 30 seconds. in most cases the timeout will not occur client will send a message and the response will be sent unless there s a weird network issue

450191
webserver	upload
you can just upload the cv to the webserver and then use your application to send an email using your account

450212
salesforce	sugarcrm
i played a lot yesterday with sugarcrm zoho crm and salesforce

450218
erlang	lisp
it was this one thing that keept popping up in google results when searching for lisp and erlang stuff

450243
scite	jedit
i like scite and there s also jedit

450248
object-reference	instances
if you get object-reference not set to an instances of an object. in exception-handling it means the ddltypelistingrid control was not found

450251
protected	public
part of the recommendations for writing cls-compliant libraries is to not have two public protected entities that differ only by case e.g you should not have

450292
click	mouse
the problem is the user has to click on the label with a mouse to get into edit mode

450312
text-editor	editor
there are many great editors for windows but i found crimson editor to have a really nice interface and every feature i could want in my text-editor so i ve always come back to it for any time i m not using vim gvim

450314
any	set
is there any scripting that keep track users referral and set cookie on users referred so whenever they leave site and come back it still will be count as referred by person

450316
firefox	safari
it works fine in safari but in firefox and ie the stays small in the top-left corner of the browser

450322
ruby-on-rails	camping
in the ruby world you have the big player ruby-on-rails but you also have much lighter ones like merb sinatra camping and a couple of others

450349
command-line	cmd
indeed i submit that a gui or web front-end over a cmd-line backend is actually more stable since you have a very very clean interface between gui and cmd

450349
command-line	cmd
the cmd can evolve at a different pace from the web as long as the cmd-line options are compatible you have no possibility of breakage

450351
duplicates	contains
list only not what is containsed in it or do you want to include the actual data pointed to in which case you need to deal with duplicates references and how to prevent double-counting when two objects contains references to the same object

450375
windows-xp	windows
but it does not work in windows-xp sp2 and windows server 2003 sp1 or above

450387
filtering	sorting
if the list offers extra features sorting filtering etc via ibindinglist ibindinglistview etc then more functionality might be available

450418
contains	any
a nativemethods class is any class which contains a name ending in nativemethods and is intended as a placeholder for win32 or com wrappers

450429
hide	show
within that new stylesheet show the containers element and hide the old elements and anything else that you do not wish to print

450455
qtcore	qtgui
i think qtcore and qtgui are required

450456
integer	short
a short summary is that any integer can be defined as

450456
integer	modulus
so the definition of modulus will nearly always depend on the definition of integer division

450456
integer	modulus
the manual page says note that when use integer is in scope gives you direct access to the modulus operator as implemented by your c compiler

450456
integer	zero
if use integer is not in scope the manual says if b is negative then a b is a minus the smallest multiple of b that is not less than a the result will be less than or equal to zero

450459
switching	screens
parsing screensshot generated by java.awt.robot is neither platform- nor version- or even configuration-independant and in general i don t think screens is locked is a well-enough defined concept to be used in this sense - on linux there can be more than just one screens x server you can switching to console terminals you can have applications running one or more machines display their guis on another machine over the network.

450480
derived-class	base-class
you basically pass the derived-class as a parameter to a base-class templates so at compile time the base-class knows what its derived-class is in each instance

450480
polymorphism	override
won t let you store multiple different derived classes in a collection of base types that s run-time polymorphism but from a static sense if you want to make a class y that is the same as a preexisting templates class x which has the hooks for this kind of overriding you just need to override the methods you care about and then you get the base methods of class x without having to have a vtable

450490
any	set
then for any given order and user you can then find which fields are editable for the order s current status and the users role and as you work through the fields set the access rights appropriately - however you set the controls - either dynamically generating them based on the collection you get back or statically on the page

450505
associations	model
instead of just a movies_people table you d have an additional model called somthing like favorite or viewing depending on what you re trying to accomplish with the associations which belongs_to both movies and people and in your movie model you d do

450506
shell	bash
as far as i remember invoking a script from another script like this is done within the same shell similar to bash . command

450547
contains	any
lucene seems to default to returning all documents contains any of the words entered

450554
temporary	copy
copy the data from this temporary sql-server db to your destination database

450569
temporary	copy
i you are happy with you c# code but it fails because of the constraints in your destination database you temporary can disable them and then enable after you copy the whole lot

450598
library-project	libs
when you have a connection string stored in the app.config in a class libs-project and reference that project in the main project the app.config files will somehow be merged so the class libs has it s settings

450601
callback	methods
now i can keep track of all changed objects myself and then loop through all of them and invoke their validation methods but i suppose an easier approach would be implement some callback that objectcontext will invoke before saving each entity

450607
filtering	sorting
in short adding an index on columns that you regularly use for filtering or for sorting may improve performance

450607
updating	updates
also remember that if you update or insert a record indexes need to be updates as well so there s a slight performance cost in adding updating deleting records

450609
boolean	int
the conversion of a boolean to an int is ingenious but requires mental parsing and that fiddling could be more expensive than the use of

450614
constructor	object
this in turn lets us build these as immutable object so long as they can be wired via constructor injection which is a very good thing to do anyway wherever possible

450620
linux	unix
i would like to change the name of the ruby process that gets displayed in the linux unix top command

450625
sql-server	oracle
i don t know how easy this is in access but in sql-server or oracle you can use the redo logs for this or a manual solution using triggers

450625
put	get
then after the old database is shut off you can iterate over those keys and get those records from the old database and put them into the new database

450654
keyboard	mouse
having a fairly new pc with a nice screen keyboard and mouse is a must

450666
cvs	git
for example we could consider any scm out there mercurial git svn cvs perforce clearcase ...

450670
swing	awt
the awt and swing apis for example are heavily event-based

450682
put	get
obviously if i put a value there all the fields will get that value

450701
codeigniter	cakephp
you might want to look at a framework like cakephp or codeigniter that make writing internationalized applications much easier

450703
cvs	git
i already do through svn hg git and cvs

450713
order	add
probably want to add a-z next to all the lower case versions in order to allow uppercase letters as well

450720
host	dns
if this is on a windows domain go into the dns management tool on the dc and add host entries cn records not a records pointing the desired names to the original computer name

450720
hosts-file	hosts
if you re doing this all on one non-server box edit the hosts and point the names to the right ip-address

450725
bazaar	git
this question sounds like an advert for a distributed vcs like git or bazaar you need developers to be able to commit changes often but on to their own branch which then gets reviewed before being pulled in to the central repository

450728
stderr	stdout
i had to add my own appender for logging to stderr and stdout but that was much easier than creating my own logging framework from scratch

450735
webserver	upload
is there a way i can upload a file to my webserver to test whether .net 3.5 sp1 was installed properly

450753
git-branch	git-rebase
in a very generic way you can always commit the current head of the foreign clearcase in your case repo into a git-branch git-rebase your own branch on top of that and commit the result back into the foreign repo

450814
bazaar	git
generic scm interoperability solution like fast-import exchange standard created in git but supported by bazaar and i think also by mercurial or tools such as tailor but tailor has its limitation

450814
perforce	git
specific tools which use either scm api or scm scriptability like git-svn between git and subversion uses subversion perl api or git-p4 between git and perforce

450814
cvs	git
server emulation in the case of interaction between centralized scm like cvs and other scm like git by emulating server for centralized scm but having repository in other scm like git-svnserver does

450815
numeric	zero
since it is a numeric field and zero has meaning in the report i can t simply change the web service to return zero or an empty string

450848
internet-explorer	safari
on windows check the internet-explorer settings on mac check safari

450850
implements	abstract
can you not add an abstract makenoise methods to animal that would be implements as a bark or quack by its subclasses

450855
superclass	inherited
but it really looks like you re missing the point of inherited it s that you can only treat subclasses uniformly when using exclusively the superclass methods

450865
linux	unix
is there a rough equivalent to the linux unix stdio.h popen function in the win32 api

450867
.net	wcf
but basically if your web server has iis 6.0 and .net 3.0 installed then you should have no problems running wcf services on it

450873
jar	war
a delivery unit is a small small as in the fewest number of files as possible set of packaged files jar war and ear are all an example of such packaged files but we also include sources compressed in a zip file javadoc compressed also script to execute this delivery and so on

450875
implements	super
there is a way to implements typesafe heterogenous containers thc using super type tokens but that has its own problems again

450882
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the objectoutputstream and objectinputstream can do this

450886
buffering	streaming
note that networkstreaming has a dataavailable - but this refers to the buffering not the streaming itself as discussed here

450892
hide	show
you can build functions on your page as user-controls and dynamically load user-controls on your page based on those permissions if you want or you can put content in panels and just show hide panels as needed

450900
xsl-fo	xslt
works like a charm if you re familiar with xslt and xsl-fo or willing to learn it

450917
sql-server	oracle
we run oracle 8i but are considering moving to ms sql-server

450931
hash	md5
md5 hash of

450931

450931
contains	elements
make an elements too small to show the contains honeypot field

450945
sql-server	oracle
note that this is specific to sql-server but many of the same principles will apply for oracle

450945
reliability	scalability
it can make it easier to increase reliability and scalability

450949
message	alert
if they triggers an alert redirect every request to a static page with as little db-io as possible with a message letting them know they ll be allowed back on in x minutes

450952
floating	clearfix
you can also float your div which will force it as small as possible but you ll need to use a clearfix if anything inside your div is floating

450965
jar	war
do i have to repeat this common jar in every war or is there a structure for common libraries

450969
contains	any
if you are careful about your optional unit which is referenced by the component and don t have any code in it which is executed globally everything is self contains in a class or classes then it shouldn t matter if it is in the uses clause and not used or not in the uses clause at all

450975
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
sharpdevelop is tied to windows monodevelop is fork than works on linux actually it s tied linux

450984

450993
pdfsharp	migradoc
we used a set of third party dlls from pdfsharp who in turn use dlls from migradoc

451030
put	get
you can put that in your code to get around it

451049
derived-class	base-class
any variables that references the derived-class and calls foo would do something different even with the same object as one that references the base-class and calls foo

451058
object-reference	instances
error was object-reference not set to an instances of an object

451060
coalesce	isnull
no if-statement no case statements no isnull no coalesce

451082
http	ssl

451130
coalesce	isnull
isnull or coalesce

451142
contains	any
the list appeared to contains most of the fonts that anyone would ever want to use and rather than continuously scouring around the web every time to create my own list i m wondering if anyone else knows of this or any other list of fonts with fall-backs

451182
constructor	private
is there any other method of stopping inheritance of a class apart from declaring it as final or by declaring its constructor as private

451203
cryptography	openssl
openssl is a implementation of the tls cryptography protocol suite amongst other things

451206
put	get
however both put and get should use the class literal for safety

451229
constructor	private
i would use final class and or private constructor

451240
authentication	impersonation
i don t know how many databases you are attaching to but if there is a limited number i kind of wonder if handling your authentication and authentication in a standard secure manner then connect to those databases via integrated security using identity impersonation with an account that has minimal permissions

453164
json	xml
xml datastream will be bigger than json for the same data

453164
json	xml
i would reccoment json as it s more pythonic than xml

453170
linux	unix
the property is a directory in windows i want it to be c flag in unix linux opt flag

453171
conditional	operators
ternary operators is really the way to go because most compilers are able to compile them into a native hardware operation that uses a conditional move instead of a branch and thus avoids the mispredict penalty and pipeline bubbles and so on

453171
double	int
i strongly suggest you avoid bit-manipulation of double using int operations

453171
double	int
on most modern cpus there is no direct means of moving data between double and int registers other than by taking a round trip to the dcache

453175
configuration	upgrade
in the same vein if the format of configuration files or user files changes you should provide a mechanism to automatically backup and upgrade those files

453190
zero	nan
if the dividend is an infinity or the divisor is a zero or both the result is nan

453190
zero	nan
in the remaining cases where neither an infinity nor a zero nor nan is involved the

453196
entity-framework	nhibernate
so this is how i do it note that i do not use the entity-framework but i use nhibernate

453205
internet-explorer	firefox
if i remember correctly it is possible in the internet-explorer maybe the site must be in the trusted zone but not in firefox or opera

453221
procedure	records
i have this procedure which is inserting records from one table to another

453221
triggers	insert
then i have written an insert triggers which will take leadid from inserted table and insert it to another table with other values as-

453232
value	field
i want to use thread.volatilewrite or an equivalent function to change the value of a field so that the updated value is immediately visible to all other threads

453243
shell	bash
if you ve never edited it it most likely says shell bin bash

453243
shell	bash
replace that bin bash path with the path to your desired shell

453249
click	mouse
when we received a mouse down if dragging never started then it s a click otherwise use the drop

453265
getter	setter
what you could do is having the ibar-interface having the getter and the setter there s really no point of not having this

453276
required	checked
this can be solved by using a triggers mysql 5 required or setting up a crontab job or something similar that periodically checked the number of rows in the tables

453281
triggers	insert
i don t think you can set mysql do it automatically although my mysql isn t exactly guru level so i could be wrong there so i think what you probably need to do is either create an insert triggers to delete the oldest row before you do the insert or write your app so it always runs a delete prior to an insert

453291
itextsharp	itext
you can find each image resolution for each page image by parsing the pdf using the itext java or itextsharp the .net port libraries easily

453300
bazaar	git
i m considering subversion bazaar and git

453305
freebsd	debian
ok so in the example the server runs freebsd and is sparky whereas the machine to be saved is under debian and is replica

453309
constructor	object
the order of initialisation can play havoc in complex system where static object do lots of things in their constructor

453309
constructor	object
what if a static object calls getinstance from it s constructor before singlemyclass is instantiated

453312
denied	root
i granted write permission in iis to root and destination folder and granted fullcontrol access to this users iuser_mashinname asp.net user network services everyone and all other users to the web app root folder and upload destination folder but there is access denied problem

453329
bash	zsh
the reason ipython hits the soft spots with me are very much because i generally like command prompts and especially nix-inspired prompts with inspiration from ksh csh yes chs is a monster but as a prompt it sport lots of really good features bash and zsh

453334
bazaar	git
as a side effect i ve started myself on a small project to evaluate side by side subversion git bazaar mercurial monotone darcs and fossil though in a more general version management context merges and such

453334
bazaar	git
as to mercurial i didn t include it in my list because i have tried it previously and i felt that i liked bazaar better while git seems at first sight to have a great deal of power which admittedly i may not need

453338
order	add
in order to have space and not tab add this to your .emacs

453339
itextsharp	itext
if this is the case and you want to recover the image as it was originally res-wise you can use itext java or itextsharp .net to get to the image content stream ie

453373
project-management	project
if you are looking for project managment templates prince2 is a useful project-management methodology

453374
deployment-descriptor	web.xml
you can prevent access to internal resources by using a security-constraint in your web.xml deployment-descriptor

453387
member-functions	inline
member-functions are implicit inline provided they are defined inside their class

453388
subtract	time
i want to subtract one date from another to get the elapsed time between them

453389
python	php
i often use json to move data structures between php python and javascript - again because it saves me having to figure out an xml serialization and then parse it at the other end

453422
configuration	installation
if you don t want the end user to provide the password you could put it in the configuration file at installation

453437
svg	vml
what are my options for rendering graphics encoded by java2d to vector graphics formats such as eps swf svg vml pdf and others i might not have heard of yet with open source libraries

453443
global-variables	call
when you call a function you are unable to access variables outside of that function except global-variables more on this in a second or variables passed to your function

453445
value	field
in the case of a text field there should be a text property you can get the value from

453448
ruby-on-rails	django
are there any important features in ruby-on-rails or django which do not exist in the other framework

453457
sharing	share
in your case you may be looking to share data between different views sharing a common model

453472
order	add
notice that 1 it takes time to set up the catalog 2 the catalog takes up extra space in the library and 3 it complicates the process of adding a book to the library - instead of just sticking a book on the shelf in order the librarian also has to fill out an index card and add it to the catalog

453479
put	get
will i get different sequences of numbers for every seed i put into it

453486
32-bit	64bit
i was using the printdialog class and it works great if it is compiled as a 32-bit app but doesn t even pop up when compiled in 64bit mode

453494
enterprise	platform
the jsr316 javatm platform enterprise edition 6 java ee 6 specification is according to this very specification page targeted to ship in 2008.

453495
mersenne-twister	generator
the wikipedia page on pseudo-random number generator has a fair amount of information and mentions the mersenne-twister which is not deemed cryptographically secure but is very fast and has various implementations in java

453496
author	posts
patrick smacchia author of execellent tool ndepend posts analysis of open source projects on his blog

453501
apache-fop	batik
apache-fop pdf ps svg with batik

453504
revision	svn
i ve been working on a vss- svn migration tool one task of which was to provide support for updating the svn repository with any changes made after a certain date i had to do this as we have a 16 gig vss db and it takes blinking ages to migrate around 3 million individual revision

453521
protected	public
dangerous attributes and methods of your class ones that might cause data loss should be non-public whether to make them protected or private is influenced by other factors with public methods used to provide a simpler safer interface

453531
latitude-longitude	location
some promising options worldtimeengine.com has a free interactive version and an api which appears to be inexpensive 5000 queries per british pound but the api only covers latitude-longitude queries as inputs not location as input which is something the interactive version has

453534
derived-class	base-class
suppose you have an abstract base-class b and a derived-class d

453534
constructor	object
when an object of type d is created b s constructor is called first but at that point the object is still of type b see here -- in particular calling any virtual functions from the body of b s constructor will call b s own implementations of those functions

453534
virtual-functions	abstract-class
but if b is a pure abstract-class none of those virtual-functions are defined so the program will crash immediately

453541
children	nodes
treeview - each nodes is the header and optional children are within the content

453563
boolean	int
in general though it s best to avoid runtime type checking and use as3 s primitives as defined in the docs boolean number int uint string

453568
integer	zero
even a simple expression such as integer in base 10 without leading zero can be complex enough that you d rather not have to retype it check if you made any typos and later have to recheck if there are typos when you start debugging

453578
ruby	php
how do you start the interactive console for ruby and php

453595
subclass	abc
protected the abc probably already has some pure virtual methods and therefore already can t be instantiated except as a subclass

453622
ruby-on-rails	django
my experience opinion is that ruby-on-rails is much more flexible and has a more diverse ecosystem and is developing faster while django is more stable slower changing better documented

453622
ironpython	ironruby
django might be able to take advantage of .net via ironpython i don t know anything about this other than that ironpython exists - while ironruby is only on the way but not here yet

453653
linux	unix
if you re on a unix or linux machine simply enter cntl-v and then the key while in vim

453676
stateless	stateful
no guarantee of idempotence -- depends on whether the resource is stateful or stateless not cacheable

453691
double	int
i wonder how to properly use nsdecimalnumber especially how to initialize it from int floats double

453706
virtualization	vmware
to answer your second question the term â œvirtual machineâ is an older term from the hardware world ibmâ s virtualization of the 360 in the 1960s that used to mean a software hardware emulation of the underlying machine to accomplish the same sort of stuff that vmware does

453707
capacity	storage
vector grows its internal storage arrays by a fixed amount every time it exceeds its capacity while arrayslist grows it by a fixed factors which is usually a much better approach since it gives an amortized cost of o 1 for append an item

453751
ntlm	iwa
note that when mentioning kerberos and ntlm in the same breath i have to also mention spengo and integrated windows-authentication iwa

453751
ntlm	iwa
iwa is a simple term that basically means kerberos or ntlm or spnego to negotiate kerberos or ntlm

453751
kerberos	ldap
but until recently implementing kerberos and ntlm have been difficult so using ldap as a make-shift authentication service has persisted

453751
jcifs	ntlm
for ntlm there is a free oss project called jcifs that has an ntlm http authentication servlet filtering

453751
credentials	security
however it uses a man-in-the-middle method to validate the credentials with an smb server that does not work with ntlmv2 which is slowly becoming a required domain security policy

453751
credentials	ntlm
the only correct way to validate ntlm credentials with active directory is using the netrlogonsamlogon dcerpc call over netlogon with secure channel

453751
credentials	ntlm
jespa is a 100 java ntlm implementation that supports ntlmv2 ntlmv1 full integrity and confidentiality options and the aforementioned netlogon credentials validation

453758
python	java
i m blind and have been programming for about 13 years on windows mac linux and dos in languages from c c++ python java c# and various smaller languages along the way

453759
ruby-on-rails	django
when i first started looking into ruby-on-rails and django i was steered away from ruby-on-rails by django developers who felt that ruby-on-rails was a black box which uses an excess of magic leaky abstractions

453759
ruby-on-rails	django
scaffolding by itself can seem to hide a lot but once you understand how to create a project without it ruby-on-rails seems to be as highly customizable as django

453765
numeric	nan
nonempty string - numeric value of string or nan

453765
numeric	nan
also the non empty string something is not converted to its numeric value nan it is treated as a string

453767
button	popup
if you re using an asp.net control like a button you can add the following attribute to give the user a javascript popup before the postback actually happens

453772
arguments	default
without an arguments it default to the current directory

453772
command-line	cmd
the syntax cmd subcmd is fish s way of taking the output of one cmd and passing it over as cmd-line arguments to another

453773
tostring	equals
tostring touint32 p is equals to p and touint32 p is not equals to 2 32 âˆ 1

453773
arrays	loops
also its bad practice to iterate over an arrays s entries with a for..in loops - you might get unexpected results if someone messed with some prototypes and it s not really fast either

453774
base-class	inherited
to my mind there have to be really good reasons to derive from a base-class - and in particular the base-class really needs to have been designed for inherited and indeed for the kind of specialization you want to apply

453782
implements	abstract
the second depends on abstract base classes and is a list of methods the class promise to implements

453792
arguments	default
if you store something with an index that is not a nonnegative integer it s alphanumeric negative or a floating-point number with a fractional piece it will fail on the arrays-index store and default to the object which is arrays s base class store which then converts the arguments to a string and stores by string index -- but these stored properties are not seen by the arrays class and therefore are not visible to its methods properties length join slice splice push pop etc

453798
command-line	cmd
you can see the location of home with the cmd env in the cmd-line if i remember correctly from my windows days

453800
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
this sieve is more efficient than the sieve-of-eratosthenes

453802
hash	md5
what i want to is to genate them to md5 hash

453813
subtract	time
first convert both the birthdate and the current time to epoch time number of seconds since the dawn of time ie 1970 in unix land and subtract them

453821
ruby-on-rails	django
i wouldn t take a pythonista s recommendation about ruby-on-rails any more than i would a rubyist s opinion on django not unless they could demonstrate a reasonable level of understanding of both platforms at least and there are precious few who can

453821
python	ruby
i can see how that might be off-putting to a python expert and that s probably fair - one of ruby s relative strengths is the meta-programming capabilities that make the magic happen

453821
python	ruby
perhaps because of that it generally seems that monkey-patching in python is seen as suspicious whereas in ruby it s commonplace

453832
hash	md5
alternatively you could keep an md5 hash of the .proto file the last time protogen was executed and only execute protogen if the .proto file has changed - even less to do on each build

453847
contains	any
which will return a vector contains the 3 integers which you can index and use just like any normal vector

453850
common-lisp	lisp
4 if you like opengenera that s a lisp os using common-lisp and some predecessor zetalisp

453851
value	field
the metadata is used to validate every request to the server in various aspects permissions valid fields field value etc... we are heavily dependent upon this metadata

453851
environment	building
we do have an experienced load-testing team and lots of data from customers number of projects average metadata size etc... so building load-testing environment shouldn t be a problem

453871
python	java
i have done just this for java c++ and python

453879
subclassing	inherited
i believe the consensus is that for typical application classes winform subclassing one-off utility classes et al there is no need to consider reuse of any kind much less reuse via inherited while for library classes it is critical to consider reuse via inherited in the design

453898
selected	button
when specifying the event handler you can register the same function to handle multiple events if in vs.net go to properties selected the events section lightning button click on the drop down for click

453901
any	set
it s made for doing two passes so it won t output any video on the first pass you ll need to set it to do -pass 2 to run the second pass and output the actual video

453902
children	nodes
will produce two nodes because both bars are first children of their respective parents

453913
graphviz	doxygen
doxygen + graphviz

453913
graphviz	doxygen
for pictures doxygen requires graphviz

453919
subclassing	base-class
sometimes when creating a base-class iâ m unsure about whether i should expose certain members to subclassing objects i use for synchronized

453920
inherited	subclass
if a type is meant to be immutable it shouldn t allow inherited - because a subclass can easily be mutable

453929
selected	checkbox
the linkage identifier is set by creating a movieclip right clicking it in the library selected properties clicking the export for actionscript checkbox and then entering it in the corresponding textfield

453930
python	java
if you can make your language fit into cil .net or java or even others such as python or parrot you ll save yourself all the effort of making a workable supporting environment and can get on with experimenting with language concepts

453950
keyboard	mouse
function fnidletime will tell you how many seconds it has been since the user touched the mouse or keyboard

453955
output	cat
open od | cat || die output

453962
factors	primes
or do you need the primes factors of a number

453979
private-key	rsa
then use a digital signature scheme like rsa to digitally sign the key with your company s private-key

453980
base-class	subclass
one more possible problem when you call virtual methods from constructor in base-class and subclass overrides this methods subclass may use unitialized data

453980
base-class	subclass
this is because constructor of base-class must always finish before constructor of subclass

454010
base-class	inherited
to check whether an inherited relationship complies with the liskov substitution principle ask whether clients of a base-class can operate on the sub class without knowing that it is operating on a sub class

454025
simulink	labview
to answer the simulink portion of your question it is a simulation environment that mainly uses block diagram programming much like labview

454025
simulink	matlab
simulink is an additional package beyond vanilla matlab and can come with all sorts of further additional packages called blocksets that have a library of blocks for a specific simulation area like the signal processing blockset or the aerodynamics blockset

454047
required	checked
this voter checked the configuration for the requested resource and if a specific role is required will deny the request if the existing authentication doesn t have that role

454052
constructor	object
contrary to what many people believe you can actually create an arrays of object that do not have a default constructor

454055
linux	osx
one of the biggest in my opinion is that osx and any desktop linux supports ssh out of the box

454071
mips	x86
i m interested into delving into x86 assembly and i have heard that is somewhat harder even my mips textbook says this

454071
mips	x86
what core information should i know as a mips programmer before making the dive into the x86 world

454073
methods	extend
there s methods to add and remove nodes in the defaultdatadescriptor and in the tree class protected methods in the latter should i use extend those or ignore them

454103
private-key	rsa
in rsa crypto when you generate a key pair it s completely arbitrary which one you choose to be the public key and which is the private-key

454113
selected	listbox
i want to have a gui where i can create commands which presumably will need some sort of listbox to selected what type of command to create

454121
mips	x86
x86 have more complex instructions than mips

454121
mips	x86
x86 have more exception-handling for register usage than mips that you have to keep in mind but nothing worth whining about constantly

454149
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch and exception-handling is better to be commented

454170
priority-queue	queue
if you re not satisfied with a linear arrays of buckets you can use a priority-queue of queue but you want to avoid updating that queue on every message or else you re back where you started

454182
python	java
my need is to invoke the python modules pertaining to this graph library from java code

454182
python	java
jython - which lets you invoke python modules with in java was an option.i went on trying jython to discover that it will not work in my case as the core code is in c and jython wont support anything that is imported as a c dll in python code.i also thought of opting for the approach of calling graph routines directly in c

454182
python	java
my last resort seems to execute python interpreter from command line using java

454182
python	java
also to deal with the results produced by python code i will have to write the results in a file and read it back in java

454182
python	java
isnt it very similar to what we would do if called the python interpreter from command line through a java code

454189
32-bit	16-bit
for instance 0x66 if i remember right in front and some instructions become for 16-bit gprs instead of 32-bit ones

454206
linux	unix
if you are on unix linux you can use the shell to run

454218
pascal	ada
to me inner classes -- at least private inner classes -- look a lot like inner procedures in pascal modula-2 ada they allow to break down a main class in smaller parts in order to ease the understanding

454230
windows-vista	windows
for the speed improvements alone i am contemplating moving my development pc to windows 7 over windows-vista stability issues aside i am an early adopter anyway and expect issues with beta operating systems

454235
any	set
all of the guid fields have the default value set to newid so sql-server will generate a new guid for any record

454270
document	element
i am currently saving a .net c# user-controls to the disk as a xml file by saving each property as an element in the xml document

454274
dialog	pop-up
i am creating a matching game for android and when the user gets a match a dialog box should pop-up saying match

454299
constructor	private
but basically the fact that the nested class can call the private constructor gives a lot of power

454306
platform	anycpu
the assembly contains platform specific com calls and so it makes no point to build it as anycpu

454321
put	get
put the code on powerpoint slides looks pretty bad and unless it s an image i can t get syntax highlighting to work

454337
postgresql	rdbms
i have been using python with rdbms mysql and postgresql and i have noticed that i really do not understand how to use a cursor

454344
arrays	loops
on opera 9.26 for some reason i don t get the result but if i reduce to the tenth of number of loops i get with arrays 47 with object 516

454358
fadeout	fadein
i m poking around with jquery and the fadein fadeout effects

454358
internet-explorer	google-chrome
it works perfectly on internet-explorer but it doesn t do anything in google-chrome and i get show and hide behavior in firefox

454362
keyboard	mouse
for altenative 2 is is possible to disable the mouse and keyboard

454365
fadeout	fadein
try fadeout from the callback of fadein

454371
fadeout	fadein
second try chaining the fadein and fadeout calls together

454381
value	field
the second is to combine the multiple field and count distinct-values of that combined value

454382
command-line	cmd
writing the use cases in the form of cli cmd this is a command-line application

454403
webforms	asp.net
if you want an asp.net webforms forum i can recommend you yetanotherforum.net

454405
order	add
i agree with keithwarren but i would always be sure to add an order by clause to the query

454408
webforms	asp.net
not counting those that haven t got some stable releases out most free options such as yaf are written to run as a standalone applications on classic asp.net webforms framework and will often requires that you use a certain fixed database platform and thus will require work to patch them so they integrate nicely with the mvc framework

454409
minimum	max
you could instead take a max of scrollheight and a minimum height value you have predefined or calculated from textarea.rows

454427
comm	cmp
i see that comm diff cmp all allow to pass either two files or a file and standard input - i guess that s good if i don t want to output two files...but it s still kinda sucks

454436
value	field
the bar field should be unique but allow nulls in it meaning i want to allow more than one record if bar field is null but if it is not null the value must be unique

454443
python	php
a few weeks ago i asked the question is a php python postgresql design suitable for a non-web business application

454443
python	php
is a php python postgresql design suitable for a business application

454443
postgresql	mysql
based on my understanding django would manage both the view and controller pieces and postgresql or mysql would handle the data

454443
python	php
so is it counterproductive for me to build the domain layer in python with an sql alchemy elixir orm tool postgresql for the database layer and then still use django or php for the presentation layer

454443
python	php
basically i d be looking at an architecture of django php python sqlalchemy postgresql mysql

454449
version-control	git
in my opinion i d like to see this happen in combination with a version-control system like git on a central hosted platform like github -- something that would make it easy for authors to publish their packages and would make it easy for others to contribute back

454454
any	set
this is the record we want so from that point onwards we set id to itself ignoring any ids in the table

454487
directory	folder
here are two support documents that assist 1. with the setup of virtual directory 1 and 2. how to manage folder permissions in iis 2

454496
value	field
it seems to only work if the field is actually null but not if it has a value

454497
any	set
i ve obviously got some security configuration setup incorrectly but i can t seem to find any good documentation on how to set it up correctly

454517
iteration	set
for some reason when shanesobj.tablerowevent is called the onclick is set up for all rows with the last value id that went through iteration on the loop 94

454519
ubuntu	debian
for instance the reason debian and its derivatives ubuntu etc. is so good is that you can happily use your system without ever having to install something outside the repositories and that everything on it is thoroughly tested

454551
postgresql	mysql
based on my understanding django would manage both the view and controller pieces and postgresql or mysql would handle the data

454556
any	set
yes you can point your db connection string to another server at any time but if your dal is too chatty has n+1 and unbounded record set problems than network latency will kill you really fast

454557
python	c++
c c++ and python preferred but other languages are of interest as well

454582
value	field
dbnull.value but i have a field that s a foreign key and even though when i look in the database it says null when i pull the records the value becomes 0

454587
linux	osx
for the most part ruby-on-rails applications are developed on osx and deployed on to linux

454587
linux	osx
but there is no real advantage of using a osx vs linux

454587
emacs	vim
lots of people point to textmate but the reality is among many in the ruby-on-rails cabal the move has been to abandoning textmate and moving to either emacs or vim

454588
classname	inherited
inherited and classname must point to different classes in the namespace

454588
classname	inherited
if your control inherited from mycompany.web.controls.productshower make your classname be something like that mycompany.web.controls.productshowercontrol that s how we name controls

454592
sql-server	firebird
- race to linux - race 3 reports starter kit using mono sql-server firebird

454634
web-applications	webserver
the vast majority of web-applications are 3 tier by default browser webserver database server

454649
python	java
another example is the design philosophy of the java standard library with its small very specific classes that are designed for maximum modularity and flexibility versus the python standard library with its preference for a flatter class hierarchy that makes handling the common use cases simpler

454658
arrays	loops
now i want to enable or disable that column of textboxes in the best possible way perhaps not using arrays or loops

454769
configuration	environment
update i ended up doing the dump reinitdb and restore of the database and it was less painful than i thought it would be except for a bit of a problem figuring out where the data was supposed to go because the postgresql user doesn t set the pgdata environment variables and neither does any configuration file or shell script that i could find

454774
binary-tree	tree
maps are usually implemented as binary search tree and walking a binary-tree always comes with a little overhead performing comparisons walking links etc. vectors are basically just arrays

454776
perl	php
my preference is for a perl script an index.pl file but php would be acceptable index.php

logout	login
there is also a view user control for the login logout link at the top right corner of the pages

454834
order	add
you should read up on event-bubbling in jquery as well as what order events happen but a simple solution might be to add

454846
value	field
the right way of doing it if you ve got more than a few value be to modify the table to contains the amount field so you can do

force ie6 into strict rather than quirks-mode by adding a doctype

454881
exception-handling	error-handling

i generally like to have a stylesheet for standards-compliant browsers such as firefox and safari and then use conditional comments to detect internet-explorer and serve it an additional css file containing ie-specific fixes and overrides

454951
arrays	loops
4.3 seconds difference between linq and foreach loops doesn t really justify 400 000 000 characters when you also take in the fact that you have utilized the stringbuilder while linq have the overhead of rebuilding from a char arrays

454959
business-objects	data-access
i ve built some business-objects and i ve built a data-access layer that will read update delete etc

solaris	linux
you can do that with bitrock installbuilder you can build installers for mac linux windows solaris from each of the other platforms

454988
contains	lookup
a vector has constant time lookup while std map is usually implemented as a rb tree which has a o log n lookup time and even a hashmap such as tr1 unordered_map usually has a worse complexity because the index or a hash thereof will be mapped to a bucket that can contains multiple values

455006
python	c++
it focuses on making c++ code available in python but it also provides exec and eval functions that should allow you to efficiently interact with python code

455010
arrays	loops
indeed if you perform some complex calculations inside the loops then the performance of the arrays indexer versus the list indexer may be so marginally small that eventually it doesn t matter

455015
concat	where
so using concat means that linq2sql will need to join both query into a sql union query which might be where the system.notsupportedexception originated from

455017
amazon-web-services	hosting
my experience is that the amazon-web-services uptime is better than most traditional hosting options even full-blown redundant rackspace setup...

455034
linux	unix
it can be easily integrated with ant and you can build windows installers from unix linux mac and the other way around

455060
environment	execution

455062
abstract-class	subclassing
you could make an abstract-class and create two subclassing

455074
solaris	linux
it is cross platform so you can generate installers for both windows and mac and linux solaris etc. like install4j tool mentioned in another post it is a commercial tool but we have free licenses for open source projects and special discounts for microisvs small business etc

455163
globalization	localization
read asp.net globalization and localization and asp.net globalization and localization both from msdn

455166
python	ruby
our bitnami project website provides free one-click installers for a number of open source projects that include integration with subversion and all the dependencies that are needed to run ruby on rails in the case of redmine python in the case of trac and so on

455166
redmine	mantis
the installers are self-contained they won t touch your system and take literally minutes to install or uninstall so you can easily test-drive redmine mantis trac etc

455174
exception-handling	try-catch
just try to find any other way around .net has got a lot other methods you can use to make shore that no exception-handling will occur i know it s easier to use try-catch but decide what is your aim

455176
binaries	install
it is a cross platform installation tool that allows you to do exactly what you are looking for adding users installing services install pre-compiled binaries etc

455176
debian	linux
although some of the other posts mention a number of tools that you could use in your scripts the problem is that every linux distribution is a bit different and simple tasks like adding an user or installer a service are suddenly non-trivial when you need to do them across debian ubuntu mandriva redhat gentoo etc

455180
globalization	localization
globalization and localization demystified in asp.net 2.0

32-bit	64bit
i think the os is the only different between the 32-bit and 64bit version

455218
32-bit	64bit
and you ll also need more than 4gb ram especially if you run virtual machines so i don t really see any reason to choose a 32-bit os over a 64bit one

455219
32-bit	64bit
it s just a matter of whether a 32-bit or 64bit version of the os is preinstalled on it

455219
32-bit	64bit
i would go with the 64bit option simply because in my experience you can easily run both 32-bit and 64bit vms on a 64bit platform but are limited to 32-bit vms on a 32-bit platform

455226
32-bit	64bit
it can be difficult to get 64bit drivers for exotic or very new hardware so if that s a concern for you you might want to stick to the 32-bit os

455230
decrement	increment
so for instance i could increment a counter in beforenavigates and decrement it in documentcomplete and only when it s 0 is it a user-initiated navigation

455250
windows-explorer	autohotkey
as a bonus the following snippet for autohotkey will start the file selected in emacs when you press ctrl-shift-enter in windows-explorer

455257
show	next
to do a lookup you simply start at the root node root node not show above and follow the next char in your input string

455265
32-bit	64bit
only problem i encountered so far is that 32-bit apps cannot access 64-dlls - for example the context menu of totalcommander won t show 64bit apps e.g subversion which might be inconvenient for development

455284
base-class	inherited
for the businness logic all my objects inherited from a base-class called baseentity with the following definition there are some custom objects and interfaces combined with framework elements

it s super easy to implements

455359
double	int
int and string are really quite different certainly more different than int and double

455360
hardware	monitor
updates - the solution is monitor hardware events with a windows service

455360

455433
coalesce	isnull
if column can be null then either exclude it first or use isnull coalesce - otherwise a single null will break the entire sequences

455773
contains	elements
set1 contains elements of set2

455774
firefox	opera
the fact that your media query for opera works could very well mean it ll end up working for firefox too once that supports media queries

455868
deep-copy	object
but like wvanbergen said the best way to make sure your copy of an object doesn t change is to deep-copy it with marshal

455873
telnet	ssh
if you do not care how they logged in telnet ssh the last unix command line utility shows you the last few logins in the machine

455883

in this answer to a recent question i was advised to be wary of making every property in your domain model have public getter and setter

455917
debian	linux
on debian isn t this the case for most linux distros

base-class	inherited
the current class library i am working on will have a base-class field with over 50 specific field types which will inherited from field and nested for maintain readability

a constructor can accept parameters in the normal manner which are passed when the object is created

456002
mathml	latex
is there any java renderer for mathml or latex that s open source

456016
python	java
there s much less need for static methods in python than there is for them in java or c# they are used in very special cases

456034
iteration	sorted
my best solution so far involves maintaining two sorted lists internally and conducting 4 binary searches and some list iteration for every request

456049
push	pull
bazaar was the only distributed vcs able to interact with a subversion server in a bidirectional way pull and push

456080
procedure	records
there doesn t seem to be a way to check execution history so my question is if it might be a good idea to start each stored procedure by inserting a row into a table that keeps records of the execution

456084
tokenize	parsing
i think i understand why because some of the x string values are not integers but i m thinking that there would be a way to parsing this still quite elegantly such that tokenize of the string a works a bit more directly like strtok a n t would have done when called iteratively in c

456099
any	set
with deferredloadingenabled set to true any parent or child relationships will not automatically populated

456109
credentials	security
for those who do not know whats available for windows ce s version of wcf its transport level security only and either none certificate for the client credentials type

456120
tunnel	vpn
i d try to get a vpn tunnel up between the two sites and if you can t try and use an ssh tunnel

456140
groovy	java
however over the last couple of weeks i ve become enamoured with groovy and purely from a selfish point of view but not just because it makes development against the jvm a more succinct and entertaining and well groovy proposition than java the language

456140
edifact	x12
an example in 2001 i wrote a library in c to translation edifact edi messages into ansi x12 messages

456149
json	xml
has any work been done to provide round trip from xml to json and back again

456154

json	xml
see this article for a good writeup on some ways it can be done converting between xml and json

456179
linux	unix
this is much simpler on unix linux systems that use a vfs concept

456185
32-bit	16-bit
i suspect that internally 32-bit integers are not used but instead 16-bit signed integers for the coordinates

456188
communication	messages
transport security means the communication is encrypted while the messages is transported so it can t be read and or tampered with

456189
groovy	scala
two reasons why scala might be a compelling alternative to groovy

456190
silverlight	wpf
unfortunately while wpf has drawing capabilities silverlight runs a very restricted set of the clr

456198
defined	declare
for reference my own code uses the second format so that the static functions are definedd before they are used so that there is no need to both declare them and defined them which saves on having the information about the function interfaces written out twice - which in turn reduces marginally the overhead when an internal interface needs to change

456233
arrays	loops
and for a1 i dont have to loops through the arrays and release each object first

456247
dictionary	arrays
pass a dictionary associative arrays if you want to leave a lot of flexibility

456281
global-variables	call
the other extreme is to use a bunch of global-variables and jam all your logic in public static void main or page_load in asp.net and call static-methods that call other static-methods and so on.

456292
internet-explorer	firefox
the not pseudo selector is broken for firefox and internet-explorer still works on webkit - it will put your browser into an infinite loop

456298
arguments	undefined
this is convenient if you can do it but it may not always work practically when 0 null undefined would be a valid arguments

456303

i have managed to do it as a 2nd pass over the query looking for field that sql-server won t be able to bind and injecting their value instead but if possible i d like to get it all happening at the same time

456399
contains	set
remember there is no 100 reliable way to determine this since sps contains code which could mean that the number of result sets is arbitrary especially if they do a cursor to return subordinate detail result sets based on an initial master result set

456402
display	width
it s more important to consider the width of the browser viewport rather than screen resolution -- you cannot assume that every pixel on a display will be allocated to the browser and even if it is you have to subtract browser google-chrome

456442
cvs	git
well there is this thing called git-cvsserver that lets git pretend it s cvs

456447
contains	set
if you have set your project to be a universal app contains both powerpc and i386 binaries then you will get two errors warnings provided that the error warning applies to both architectures

456452
font-size	height
also don t worry about the height as much however try to avoid making most pages more then 1-2 printed pages at your default font-size most people wont read a page that long and if a user install a toolbar that takes up vertical spaces my personal preference is that it s their problem but i don t think it s to big of a deal

456455
directory	folder
while it s true that dlls are primarily installed copied into the same folder as the .exe the requirement is to adhere to the loaders loading rules which includes system folder bad idea path current directory see loadlibrary api help documentation for a full description of precedence

selected	checkbox
i have a table with 11 checkbox in it and i can t selected them all using jquery 1.3

456465
executable	jar
you can also go a bit further by wrapping the jar in a native executable using a tool such as jsmooth

456469
json	xml
my vote is also for xml or json or another format if you have the ability to control the format

456470
revision	ignore
this resulted in a scoring system that would all but ignore minor edits and revision typos sentence structure etc but quickly reveal if the content needed to be examined again

456471
rollback	commit
the insert commit and there is no rollback no exception-handling

456473
scheme	ada
ada forces the convention and the file naming scheme on you

456473
python	ruby
most dynamic languages like ruby python etc don t generally care where if you declare things

456496
value	field
in your field editor control s onsavechange set the field s mult value to true

456544
enumerator	iteration
using enumerator allows you to do more flexible on your iteration

456546
windows-server	windows
just in case i change my mind about running on a windows-server this prevents windows network paths from being specified someserver someshare

456552
cvs	git
edit i came into this project late and was involved in the cvs to git conversion

456565
push	pull
when you commit you re only committing to your local repo so to get changes collaborations must either a pull from your local repo or b pull from some other accessible repo to which you have pushed your changes using git push

456572
disposable	dispose
if the inner objects are disposable it means we only dispose them once even if dispose is called repeatedly on the outer object

456572
any	set
you might also want to set any events to null

456572
methods	extend
while you should try to release the outer object for gc it is relatively easy to accidentally extend the life of the object for example via a captured variables anonymous methods lambda an event etc

456584
python	java
the gist is that java keeps an object around for the integers from -128 to 127 python does -5 to 256 and returns the same object every time you ask for one

456601
keyboard	mouse
it would also receive a digital packed from the second processor containing the mouse keyboard input sent from the client

456601
keyboard	mouse
it would send the compressed monitor output to the correct clients and also receive the keyboard mouse input which would be dispatched to the second processor

456616
base-class	inherited
the thing is i want to inherited the constructor from the base-class for the derived class but from what i have read this can not be done

456623
python	java
antlr is well-known and supports c c++ objective c java and python

456623
bison	cup
i ve used bison for c++ cup for java and ocamlyacc for ocaml and they re all pretty good

456624
attributes	properties
i wish to set an attributes on a public properties in .net however i do not have access to the explicit properties itself as this has been code generated in another file

456624
any	set
is there any way i can set this attributes even through web.config

456642
32-bit	64bit
as far as 32-bit vs 64bit see this question

456661
return-value	arguments
even if you are not storing return-value in a variables and you are directly passing it to some other methods even then you can change the value by stepping into that methods and changing the arguments value there

456686
put	get
this is done by using the http methods post get put delete

456712
bug-tracking	fogbugz
fogbugz for feature and bug-tracking with it integrated with subversion visual-studio and warehouse

456717
click	mouse
i am talking about those programs that you can use to record a series of events on your computer like mouse movements and button click and then you can play them back

456728
implements	final
i want to learn postgresql and implements my project in postgresql in the final versioning

456752
priority-queue	heap
to the best of my knowledge i wrote a paper about a new priority-queue which also reviewed past results no priority-queue implementation gets the bounds of fibonacci heap as well as constant-time increase-key

456756
typemock	moq
checkout mocking frameworks like rhinomock moq or typemock

456767
callback	methods
why doesn t open methods treat the callback parameter as function

456776
jeditorpane	jtextpane
you should try to use jeditorpane or jtextpane instead

456811
inlining	inline
you may want to disable inlining too as otherwise i guess there s a possibility that a smart compiler would notice you calling the function without using the return-value and inline it to nothing

456819
affinity	cpu
on a multicore system be sure to either spawn the loop like this in multiple threads one for each cpu or execute the process multiple times and to make the scheduling predictable assign thread process affinity explicitly

456820
directory	folder
something like finding the directory of the executable won t work simply because the start-up folder item that starts your program is likely to be a shortcut to it so you won t have that path

456829
gzip	zip
does anyone know a project which implements standard compression methods like zip gzip bzip2 lzma ... using nvidia s cuda library

456845
compression	streaming
lzma does not work in parallel either when you see 7zip using multiple threads this is because 7zip splits the data stream into 2 different streaming that each are compressed with lzma in a separate thread so the compression algorithm itself is not paralllel

456853
forwarding	port
the easiest way to do this would be to install a webserver on your old box then set up your router to forwarding port 80 to that box assuming you have a cable connection

456863
arrays	map
using this you can simple map a file to a memory location an read like it s an arrays

456874
directory	folder
i need to scan a directory and its sub-folders i used findfirst and findnext procedures but the tsearchrec s name property is a string thus unicode folder names hebrew arabic etc are

456889
cvs	git
the settings can be saved with the other project files cvs svn git whatever

456900
ruby	php
if someone can indicate a php python or ruby package where this type of solution is implemented i can try to copy the code from there

456915
postdata	request
if the page was refreshed then you d expect two request following each other to be for the same url path filename query string and the same form content if any postdata

456918
getter	setter
it s good practice to expose the instances of this class as a singleton and exposing the application variables you re initializing using getter and setter

456919
put	get
edit in your example recursion depth is prevented by the number of lives so that seems ok as this won t get bigger than 1000 or even 100 - this is exactly why i have considered it but now i can see it was a rather stupid idea i wonder who put this in an example program .

456937
moss	wss
depending on your needs you need either windows sharepoint services wss which is free as in beer and can be downloaded from microsoft or microsoft office sharepoint server moss which is not free and contains wss plus enterprise features such as excel server for web access to excel sheets forms server for infopath lots of site templates and goodies and all the business intelligence stuff

456938
attributes	properties
i also have a properties grid which only displays the properties decorated with a special attributes

456941
constructor	object
you can initialise a date object with your own values however you should be aware that the constructor have been deprecated and you should really be using a java calendar object

456942
boolean	int
i want to make a function that receives this matrix and a point where a zero is stored and that transforms every zero in the same area into a 2 suppose the matrix can store any int even it is initially boolean

456949
boost-python	bjam
cons if you don t have a pre-compiled boost-python library you re going to use bjam sort of make replacement

456949
python	c++
on 2009 01 20 the author of py++ announced a new package for interfacing c c++ code with python

456949
python	c++
code in cython files can call both pure python functions but also c and c++ functions and also c++ methods

456949
python	c++
it took me some time to think in cython that in the same code call c and c++ function mix python and c variables and so on

456953
python	c++
else there are several choices for binding c c++ code to python

456966
selected	textbox
when the user selected free input the value from a corresponding textbox is used

457012
deterministic	theory
given that you can t expect deterministic performance on a system that could at least in theory be subject to transient load spikes you want your performance sla to be probabilistic

457016
sendmessage	message
replace postmessage by sendmessage which will wait for the message processing to complete

457018
value	field
and don t forget to escape other kinds of value too numeric field and datetime field can all be injected just as easily as strings

457060
innodb	myisam
i have just changed a lot of the tables from myisam to innodb

457065
base-class	subclass
one option would be to use inheritance and a protected modifier but having an internal constructor on the base-class so that external code can t subclass it

457071
firefox	opera
how do i manage to do this with people that do not speak the language or again does not even have the skills to communicate with the customer you all know someone very bright that is going into deep technical issues with a customer that hardly knows the difference between firefox opera

457078
decrement	increment
when one uses a loopcounter you expect that it is increment decrement each iteration of the loop with the same amount

457084
for-loop	loops
the enhanced for-loops doesn t do anything to try to release resources at the end of the loops

457093
decrement	increment
the increment is unnecessary and balanced by the decrement

457102
for-loop	loops
i would expect a for-loops to generally have a fixed number of iterations and the only part of the for-loops condition that changes to be the loops variable i

457117
textbox	onblur
in this tablerow there is a textbox which is supposed to trigger a javascript method on the onblur event which is added by the rowcreator class

457117
textbox	onblur
i ve also tried created a subclass of textbox which implements a method that adds the onblur event

457189
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
you create dynamic-sql so your code is vunerable to sql-injection attacks

457199
uitableview	uitextview
for some reason when using uitextview with uitableview scrollers work for both

457210
variables	boolean
is a global variables in ruby that points to a boolean that indicates whether or not the user passed the -w flag to the ruby executable when they ran the script

457250
xsd	xml
second you can formulate xml queries based on the xsd and know that the xml content is compatible with your queries

457258
cassini	iis
iis and cassini are not the same and not exposing your code to production conditions can cause you problems

457262
internet-explorer	firefox
and is the height the same in firefox and internet-explorer

457273
smalltalk	lisp
it also grabs ideas from lisp and smalltalk

457275
widget	button
we love the idea of add-ons like in wordpress where any developer can add a menu button or a widget and would like to enable developers to do the same with our system

457277
sql-server	oracle
in sql-server it s the same to use 1 or but on oracle it s faster to use 1

457277
sql-server	mysql
apparently there is no difference between them in mysql like sql-server the parser appears to change the query to select 1

457306
ubuntu	linux
furthermore a previous incarnation of this project ran slapd on ubuntu linux on a dual-core server

457308
boolean	int
additionally each one only stores two int x and y coordinates and a boolean so they are going to be very small objects in the grand scheme of things

457323
ruby	php
if you host the dynamic language runtime in your application it not only means that your users can extend the application in a scripting language but even in any dynamic language scripting or otherwise for which a dlr implementation exists ruby python smalltalk scheme javascript php you name it

457325
difference	count
innodb has no row count caching so there is no difference in performance for count or count column_name regardless if the column can be null or not

457342
internet-explorer	firefox
and is the height the same in firefox and internet-explorer

457365
ruby-on-rails	django
coming from web development background i figured i can cover almost all of these crud cases with ruby-on-rails scaffolding or say django admins

457388
checkout	payment
imagine something similar to paypal providing a small piece of code to add a paypal payment option - but in this case it will add our code to work with the checkout in question

457451
order	add
basically to get closer to your question you d need to add restrict to a and b in order to promise the compiler that whoever uses this function won t pass in result as an alias to a or b

457454
vb.net	vb6
i have inherited a rather large project consisting of an application written in vb6 and several dll s and activex controls written in vb6 vb.net 1.1 and vb.net 2

457454
vb.net	vb6
my main vb6 application i will call it alpha has a configuration file alpha.exe.cnfig which contains settings used by my vb.net 1.1 dll which i will call bravo

457506
base-class	subclass
a virtual member call in the base-class ctor could cause some logic to run in the subclass before the subclass ctor is called and thus before the object gets a chance to initialize itself to a consistent state

457511
callback	methods
the document is creating a browser component called xmlhttprequest on submit event the object methods send is called during the waiting time for server response an html element is replaced with a waiting message on succesfull response a callback is called with the new html elements and then inserted in the selected html element

457526
logout	login
how can i create custom links to login and logout in admin mode at jboss portal

457530
export	report
it offers all that is in ssrs and adds master reports themes calendar data region data-visualization databar sparklines iconset colorscale ... complete object model for maximum programming flexibility royalty free end user report-designer barcode report item excel templates export and data merging and much more

457538
export	report
it offers all that is in ssrs and adds master reports themes calendar data region data-visualization databar sparklines iconset colorscale ... complete object model for maximum programming flexibility royalty free end user report-designer barcode report item excel templates export and data merging and much more

457553
triggers	insert
the ideal solution in that situation is to have a triggers when insert or updating the row to calculate the number of words in that column and store them in another column

457553
integer	short
the added required space will be minimal since you re adding an short integer to a long string but you ll find your queries scream along by just using the integer field make sure you index on it

457558
entity-framework	nhibernate
better yet use your preferred orm tool linq-to-sql nhibernate llblgen entity-framework etc to do all this for you and concentrate on your actual problem domain

457579
value	field
i always store the field as a separate value

457590
memcached	ehcache
ehcache could be an alternative for memcached but i don t have any experience with it and don t really want to intoduce yet another technology if there are better alternatives for this task

457596
uitextview	uilabel
on receiving the data i set the values of uilabel and uitextview

457596
uitextview	uilabel
uilabel values appear fine but the uitextview sometimes do not show the value until i move to subview or scroll up and down to revisit the area contaning uitextview

457596
uitextview	uilabel
i m showing uilabel and uitextview objects in uitableviewcell

457596
uitextview	uilabel
i call tableview reloaddata right after setting values in uilabel and uitextview but i do not re-create the uitableviewcell

457628
contains	set
if i have a database contains only varchar columns with strings encoded in latin-1 and collation set accordingly will converting the columns to nvarchar using alter table commands change the encoding of the column contents to unicode utf-16 or do i have to convert them myself

457645
hashmap	arrays
all possible solutions will be a kludge like container objects your hashmap idea â œmultiple return valuesâ as realized via arrays

457688
procedure	records
the stored procedure returns a table of records

457696
jexcelapi	jxl
in java with either jexcelapi jxl or apache-poi

457700
.net	wcf
the new .net standard is wcf codename indigo

457724
configuration	installation
configure error installation or configuration problem c compiler cannot creat

457744
constructor	private
won t work because the constructor is private

457744
constructor	object
if you make the constructor public it will create the object on the heap and e1 will be a pointer to that object

457745
callback	methods
alternatively in situations where i want to return a number of things from a methods i will sometimes use a callback mechanism instead of a container

457758
triggers	insert
a better way to deal with common calculations is to insert them into a new column with a triggers or in your insert update queries

457759
json	xml
examples of such have been given elsewhere but the prime ones are naturally going to be xml or json

457761
spaces	output
given that there is a limit to how much will fit in this output i d like as much spaces as possible for information i care about

457781
python	c++
the beautiful thing about this approach is that very little if any python code would be executing at 50fps it would all be in the c++ depending on how you hand your updated data to the widget

457781
python	c++
you could even push an event handler into the custom real-time data viewer from the python side to handle all the mouse events and user interaction and leave just the rendering in c++

457800
any	set
if it s a small database and i m guessing it is it probably won t do any harm other than a little extra load but if they need to make sure they don t lose data they should be doing daily full backups and log backups every few minutes instead of full backups and log shipping to a standby server or set up mirroring

457811
stderr	stdout
the exception-handling are stdin stdout and stderr which your process did not open

457814
getter	setter
some of my classes have final fields that are populate from the constructor as well as properties that can be assign from getter and setter

457837
specifications	w3c
i did go to the w3c and look at their specifications and the only thing i could find was nl tag with nested li but i tried them and they did not work in any of the browsers that i tried

457867
getter	setter
then you can have the normal setter getter based as usual

457899
exception-handling	try-catch
however it is obviously useful to catch these types of exception-handling in the normal try-catch exception ex way for error reporting and more a graceful exit of your app as jaredpar says the app is now probably in trouble

457920
checkbox	button
sorry are you talking about checkbox button

457930
void-pointers	dereference
ask your self first how you would dereference a void-pointers

457948
contains	any
this doesn t work any better than just closing the browser windows and i never have a reference directly to the embed object just to its contains div

457953
constructor	object
the regex_iterator constructor requires bidirectionaliterators but std istream_iterator is only an inputiterator so it appears that you d not be able to do this with any of the standard stream classes and or object cin ifstream etc.

457988
push	pull
avoiding git disasters a gory story about the dangers of git push --force instead of a git pull --rebase for instance

458001
linux	unix
windows users love them unix linux don t

458009
stderr	stdout
for the same reason it is probably a good idea to flush or possibly to close stdout and stderr if you write to them

458032
delphi	c++
using c++ or delphi i d like to write a plugin that adds a new section to the navigation pane

458049
httplistener	http.sys
httplistener hooks into http.sys even without iis i believe

458050
any	set
allowed character set any

458055
updating	updates
i know how to updates a div tag using the ajax.form helper methods but passing parameters and updating the partial control is beyond me

458098
activerecord	datamapper
it feels like i am convoluting the activerecord pattern with other stuff like datamapper

458164
any	set
as many have mentioned already any decent compiler nowadays will warn you if you attempt to perform an assignment inside an if-statement you can usually silence this warning by putting an extra set of parentheses around the assignment

458167
contains	any
the business layer should contains the logic to convert a data-access object dao into a rich business object which is probably just the dao plus some operations as well as any decoration enrichment

458169
value	field
i m working on an application that requires a text field to fade in with the value being loaded by ajax

458172
double	int
design-wise you should try to avoid converting nsdecimalnumber or nsdecimals to and from int float and double values for the same reasons it s recommended you use nsdecimalnumbers loss of precision and binary floating point representation issues

458172
double	int
if you have to input from an int float or double you could do something like the following

458177
message	alert
i want to use watin to verify the error message in a javascript alert box

458194
jax-ws	cxf
i used it in a jax-ws web service using cxf for streaming of attachments with mtom

458213
mouse-listeners	mouselistener
my theory is that when all the mouse-listeners registered to the table tablecell are invoked the ones install to the api classes by default will be invoked first before your mouselistener

458213
row	col
override jtable.getcelleditor int row int col

458214
rewrite	rule
i have a rewrite rule of the following form

458214
rewrite	rule
if i rename foo.php to foo_junk.php and change the rewrite rule to be

458225
superclass	subclass
ok so i m trying to make a nice superclass for data-access objects that can generate a tsql query to search all of the subclass s public string properties

458256
any	set
if you miss any then the application is likely to crash because of an unmatched case statement unless you have default set

458282
macros	basic
i made a few macros that do some search replace functions on word to do basic things like wrap tags around paragraphs and stuff like that then re-markup the whole thing from scratch

458310
getter	setter
i also have getter and setter to deal with this dictionary

458310
getter	setter
my goal then is to provide transparency access inside ironpython to this getter and setter as if they were real properties of a class

458318
keyboard	mouse
plus if you implement this your computer will have two ip addresses - one to control the video keyboard and mouse and another to say access files etc

458318
keyboard	mouse
this doesn t solve the problem you are thinking of but i think you d be better off implementing a thin client which only connects to a vnc server and processes the keyboard mouse commands then encodes them to vnc compatible ethernet commands and displays the video data on an attached monitor

458344
soft-references	weak-references
weak-references should be used when you don t really care if the object goes away while soft-references really only should be used when you would use a normal reference but you would rather your object be cleared then for you to run out-of-memory

458344
soft-references	weak-references
i m not sure on the specifics but i suspect that the gc normally trace through soft-references but not weak-references when determining which objects are live but when running low on memory will also skip the soft-references

458345
ruby-on-rails	django
although we do most of our work with ruby on ruby-on-rails we chose django for this project so we could use geodjango an add-on that supports geometry fields and extends the orm to allow spatial queries.

458347
void-pointers	dereference
however you cannot dereference a void-pointers

458347
void-pointers	dereference
and if you cannot have a dereference void-pointers that means you cannot have a void reference

458360
reflector	ilmerge
short term though you may have to go with ilmerge or reflector + copy code

458381
python	perl
can some one with expertise in python perl or any other scripting language help

458384
document	element
positioning an element typically takes it out of the document flow

458399
listbox	textbox
to this end i have put together a simple wcf service that allows for simple querying and i am currently wiring this up to a textbox listbox combination soon to replaced with the autocompletebox from the silverlight toolkit

458413
safari	opera
the css3 text-shadow is ultimately what i m after but of course only safari opera not yet released ff3.1 out of the major browsers support it

458417
derived-class	base-class
when you call a static methods via a derived-class the compiler resolves the methods so the il actually contains the base-class

458434
alignment	layout
either the runtime does not respect the layout and silently correct things or it allows arbitrary alignment historically they were less flexible than the ms runtime in this regard which is surprising

458436
puts	gets
which gets rid of all folder and puts all files in the target folder and its subfolder into a single zipfile

458451
void-pointers	dereference
when using a void-pointers you re not allowed to dereference it

458466
hide	show
yes i would like to show hide divs and such

458478
directory	folder
after adding some imports your code runs fine for me how do you call the scripting maybe you could tell us the folder structure of the .. packed bin directory

458504
attributes	properties
i have a basic properties bag table that stores attributes about my primary table card. so when i want to start doing some advanced searching for cards i can do something like this

458508
32-bit	x86
your union works in x86 since the field offset is 4 bytes which is the pointer size for a 32-bit system but fails on x64 since there it must be offset a multiple of 8

458509
.net	wcf
unless you have some specific requirements that require .net remoting you should probably take a look at windows comminication foundation wcf instead

458509
.net	wcf
wcf provides the functionality of .net remoting and more and as far as i know wcf is now the recommended technology to use

458511
hide	show
if you mean you want to show hide divs and such that s much easier using css and javascript

458514
hide	show
what you probably want to do is change css property display of the element to none to hide the element and change it back to block or inline to show it again

458525
boost	stl
edit i can use only stl and not boost old compilers

458531
authentication	login
extend the default codeigniter controller with your own and put an authentication check in the constructor check the session for a logged in flag or something and if not logged in then redirect to login page

458555
arrays	map
for a such large number i guess it s going to be a sparse arrays so maybe it would be best to use a map list and just allocate space and store a value for a 1 value for a bit

458558
ubuntu	linux
i m working on linux system ubuntu 7.04 server with a 2.6.20 kernel

458558
terminate	timeout
if i do this while thread1 is blocked in a selected with a timeout then the selected will not terminate immediately but will eventually timeout properly

458575
any	set
just copy all the fields of your entity set the new sequence and set also any relation by just assigning the old entityset reference to the new one

458576
authentication	login
then in your controller classes you can do a call to the authentication function in the constructor then depending on the outcome continue as normal or redirect them to a login screen with an access denied message

458589
contains	elements
split the collection into two collections contains the elements for which the given predicate returns true and false respectively

458599
factors	primes
since you re attempting to solve euler-problem #3 the wrong way here s a hint you re supposed to find all the primes factors of a number not all the primes numbers below a certain limit

458612
stream	send
you could make the producer send an end of stream message and have the consumer terminate upon receiving it

458627
triggers	insert
you can use a triggers to extract the data into the column at the time it is insert

458630
base-class	inherited
with that at hand you can reference dal in you biz layer and when it comes to your entities with a little abstraction you can solve all your problems for example if you have customer class you can make an abstaractoin customer class that implement the the basic operations to interact with dal like save update and retrieve data and in another class that inherited the abstraction class override the base-class methods implementation to meet your biz validation and so on

460563
attributes	properties
where reflection had failed in this instance is that older database records of mymodel were no longer in sync with the new model as the old data had null values for some of the new attributes or properties of mymodel

460563
value	field
this wasn t a problem for new records which had value in the new attributes field

460564
silverlight	wpf
the title suggests you have asp.net and want to add wpf in which case look at xbap or silverlight but the question suggests you have wpf and want to add a web page

460564
webserver	host
if you want to host a webserver look at httplistener

460570
.when	ready
this way if the user puts in the request to start the process and the connection is lost browser closed etc. the process completes and is ready .when the user returns

460592
ubuntu	linux
this one is for ubuntu linux - prints the number of connections to the mysql server

460599
any	set
basically it redirects any 404 error to index.php but if the file exists type file it will set the right root

460614
contains	set
as bruno suggests you can use a set for your fixed list of objects and then call contains

460618
firefox	opera
2 the is firefox extension which you can add to view wml pages with firefox or you can use opera which supports wml natively

460621
space	input
hash codes for use in hashtables have the same requirements and additionally they should be evenly distributed across the code space especially for input that are similar

460622
webforms	asp.net
should i pursue asp.net webforms or asp.net mvc

460622
webforms	asp.net
currently the basic idea is to create a front-end layer for our system using asp.net webforms or asp.net mvc

460622
asp.net-mvc	webforms
scenario webforms or asp.net-mvc

460628
any	set
as others have noted you could use a hashset for that or any sort of set actually

460628
any	set
if you use your own objects make sure they override hashcode required for hashset and equals if they override both they will work with any set

460634
mouseover	mouseout
the problem is that when currently sorting when i m currently dragging a list item mouseover mouseout events do not seem to be firing for any object on the page

460652
selected	button
the problem is right when i selected edit button red controls should show up but they don t

460669
ubuntu	linux
i happen to have my hands on a ubuntu linux box and a deskjet printer hp5150 but could probably use windows or possibly get another printer if absolutely required

460670
python	perl
implementing perl quote style but in python

460678
javascript-events	onbeforeunload
you have both onunload and onbeforeunload javascript-events for that

460682
asp.net-mvc	webforms
there are loads of documentation and resources available for webforms but asp.net-mvc framework has to be searched for in blogs and the little documentation that is available on the project homepage

460687
arrays	loops
for example you can decrease number cache misses processing multi-dimensional arrays by rows rather than by columns unroll loops etc

460689
silverlight	xbap
either add an xbap to your webpage or rewrite the functionality using silverlight and embed the app on your page

460693
data-structures	dictionary
how about dictionary of algorithms and data-structures from the nist

460698
subtract	time
while i was working on an university project i used a project-internal profiling made by an elder student it was very basic but good enough since its task was to subtract time between two points of the code and to give statistics

460715
hardware	monitor
when dealing with embedded code you can emulate substitute underlying hardware to effectively monitor system performance

460717
instrumentation	profiling
there are two common profiling strategies for vm-based languages anyway instrumentation and sampling

460717
instrumentation	profiling
instrumentation inserts checkpoints and informs the profiling every time a method starts and finished

460729
profiling	debugging
this kind of sampling profiling can work with standard binaries but are more useful if you have debugging symbols to work out lines of code given addresses in the program

460729
instrumentation	profiling
other profiling involve recompiling the program to insert instructions known as instrumentation to count how often each continuous set of instructions basic blocks are executed or maybe even record the sequence in which basic blocks are executed or record the content of variables at certain places

460749
asp.net-mvc	webforms
but it sounds to me in this scenario like webforms is known and asp.net-mvc is unknown so without knowing more you ve already got a bit of a hump to overcome

460768
document	element
the tricky part is that any positioninged element positioning property is not static is taken out of the document flow

460776
imageview	textview
i m not sure this is the best option since it means doubling the memory usage for a couple of seconds but you could meaning not necessarily should create a new imageview and a new textview each with opacity zero and identical to the originals with the new text and image of course and then fade out the old ones and fade in the new ones

460778
push	pull
every week the project manager might pull changes from each team into his central repository merge them and push them back out to his teams central repositories

460782
content-length	content-type
wrong content-type content-length could freak flash player

460783
rollback	commit
you can commit changes locally and rollback at will

460792
rollback	commit
doing a transaction by the book is easy if every single encompassed actions have proper transactional support otherwise it would be a nightmare trying to support commit rollback each of them individually in their own diy ways

460803
contains	elements
which allows you to control the elements as if it were a block but to the contains scope it still behaves like an inline elements

460840
environment	building
from there we have system test building that run more in-depth tests across an environment built with virtual machines with a separate domain controllers sql-server box etc.

460847
boost	stl
note i can t use boost only standard stl

460851
ncover	nant
software we used for this was nant cruisecontrol.net a custom code-generation system custom app to build an oracle schema and ncover for the code analysis

460855
environment	building
in the java spaces i ve tested most of the available building environment

460870
any	set
this file actually contains key-value pairs for any environment variables you want to set for the whole login session

460871
hide	show
back to proposal 2 build a complete report will all expected data to be display then hide show the different sections of the report

460873
value	field
i need to iterate through the field on a table and do something if its value does not equal its default-value

460873
triggers	insert
how to get the value out of the insert table remember i m in a triggers

460886
.net	wcf
windows communication foundation wcf is my favourite feature of .net

460892
version-control	git
for transferring the website and version-control i want to use git

460896
repository	entity
a pragmatic approach might be to use the data object definitions from the data layer in unit tests but not the data-context hide the data-context behind the repository interface but expose the entity types - but this is muddying the waters a little and means your user-interface etc

460904
button	popup
is there any ms api to popup the uac dialog when i click the button

460925
implements	abstract
why not abstract your data provider implements 2 versioning one with nhibernate-mapping for the legacy data item and one for the new data item

460932
web-services	webserver
axis web-services mostly are enough decoupled from the main application that it should be easy to get them running on a different java webserver instance that would run only at the port 8080 in the case if it s not possible to configure whatever webserver are you running to run also at the port 8080 and to serve the web service only at that port

460954
gnome	kde
gnome and kde look to be implements a dbus approach to this problem but in my opinion even if it becomes widespread it isn t yet widespread enough to rely on it in 3rd party code it s not the right approach

460958
rake-task	rakefile
when i run my rake-task i retrieve a solution from svn which contains a rakefile

460977
webserver	upload
how to upload a file to a webserver in asp.net by using visual c# .net

460984
contains	any
as everyone else mentioned .net 2 doesn t contains any time zone information

460984
value	field
the tzi field value contains all the transition and bias properties for a time zone but it s all stuffed in a binary arrays

460987
selected	checkbox
then you selected advanced and then you have a checkbox which says

460989
having	select
having said that to compare the data you can run a select statement like this

460990
value	field
therefore cookies in the request will have default value for these missing field as they are unknown on the server side

461001
decrement	increment
therefore it is best to put a clustered index on a column which increment or decrement and which is unique

461004
value	field
i want to copy a record from tab1 to tab2 taking all the field and adding a value for field4

461016
stripes	spring
otherwise i would suggest wicket stripes or spring asp.net-mvc

461016
stripes	spring
stripes is probably the simplest of the three spring is a little complicated and wicket is conceptually different from the other two

461050
put	get
alternatively you can just put the text in the html page hidden for example and get it from there.

461064
value	field
everything the previous posters said + if you only have two possible value for the confirmed field then make it a enum

461074
spaces	output
that is i want a function create_empty_line_of_length that output the given amount of spaces

461098
digits	zero
but i want it with the leading zero still on lower digits 1-9 so the date is 11-09-2009 mm-dd-yyyy .

461112
scrollable	panels
i would also like to make the panels vertically scrollable

461120
webserver	upload
currently i m using php to upload the generated script into webserver and there process it

461126
windows-xp	windows
this appear to work with windows-xp and windows vista

461137
ruby	php
also whenever i am able i bone up on new security risks with whatever resources are to hand articles whitepapers presentations etc. but i often feel i m missing the point maybe because most of my knowledge could well be classed as new-fangled c# mssql php some python a smattering of ruby the oldest language i know is classic asp

461145
postgresql	rdbms
we are using as you have already guessed postgresql rdbms with nhibernate orm on the .net platform

461166
python	lua
python scheme and lua all come to mind

461168
any	set
even if you didn t set v8compatible in your application you shouldn t see any difference in behavior in most cases

461170
brainfuck	forth
write a brainfuck or forth compiler

461172
reflection.emit	dynamicmethod
for example under the bonnet and out of sight code might use things like reflection.emit dynamicmethod delegate.createdelegate to generate dynamic but highly optimized code

461186
updating	updates
updating is a big negative detecting available updates requires additional tools custom programming not built in

461186
silverlight	wpf
99 wpf features as opposed to silverlight s subset of wpf features

461186
safari	opera
cross browser applications can be used by opera and safari as well

461186
silverlight	wpf
this approach is worth considering along with the wpf silverlight approaches

461186
silverlight	xbap
how reusable are controls if we develop in silverlight can we reuse our code controls in xbap

461218
account	api
some time ago i found aout about the system.directory namespace in .net 3.5 that enables me to basically manage local as well as domain account easily with native .net methods instead of using api calls and importing unmanaged dlls

461220
itextsharp	pdfsharp
so far i had a quick look at itextsharp and at pdfsharp but it doesn t seem like these are the right tools for the job as they focus most on altering and printing pdfs

461220
itextsharp	pdfsharp
does anyone know another way of reading lines from a pdf or should i keep trying with itextsharp pdfsharp

461223
aspect-ratio	scale
if you have to keep the aspect-ratio of the image intact then you should scale it by a factors so that the longer side of the image height or width fits inside the limitations for that side

461224
derived-class	base-class
virtual destructors are useful when you can delete an instance of a derived-class through a pointers to base-class

461224
derived-class	base-class
in most implementations the call to the destructor will be resolved like any non-virtual code meaning that the destructor of the base-class will be called but not the one of the derived-class resulting in a resources leak

461229
revision	svn
the revision in svn or any other version-control system is not the same thing as your product release number or even your build number

461248
temporary	rvalue
you create a temporary variables which is only an rvalue and so can t be dereferenced

461270
getter	setter
through any number of levels of getter setter

461297
ubuntu	linux
at least with sun jre 1.6 on linux you get interesting if not always informative error messages peregrino is netbook running 32 bit ubuntu with 2g ram and no swap

461399
configuration	logging
most of these logging frameworks makes it possible to configuration how logs are stored and porsibly also a setting to send a email when it logs something

461399
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you can make look at - its a demo of sending a mail using .net - webforms though but the basic things still apply to asp.net-mvc

461420
consistency	acid
there are explicit and implicit transactions if you do not start a transaction explicit sql-server will start an implicit transaction for you this is necessary to make it acid atomicity consistency isolation durability

461422
postback	ajax
if you get it working without ajax whole page postback and then add the update panel it should work straight out of the box

461446
stdin	pipe
of course you need to keep track of which fds are the pipe you write about but you probably need only stdin anyway

461448
cargo	maven
it should also be possible to execute a second instance of maven from inside ant which runs purely the cargo goal but in that case you might encounter problems with locked files and the like

461457
arguments	undefined
1 verify amount of arguments passed imagine you wanted to allow undefined value to be passed in or null like in the case of dom insertbefore function and only after that try and set their value if ommited

461490
subtract	add
in general though there are plenty of times where it makes sense to add or subtract one

461499
entity-framework	nhibernate
can this be done easily with linq to xml queries or am i really moving into the realm of an orm such as nhibernate or entity-framework no holy wars about which orm please

461535
double-quotes	spaces
regex for splitting a string using spaces when not surrounded by single or double-quotes

461536
exception-handling	error-handling
obviously you d probably want some error-handling etc in there - send can throw an exception-handling for example if the server is refusing connections

461541
mstest	nunit
when developing in .net a developer can choose from several unit-testing frameworks such as mstest - nunit mbunit xunit etc

461582
any	set
..because even 30kb application loads 20mb of unneeded dlls.am i mistaking when i think that any .net app takes at least 10mb in working set of memory when we need a form with text in it

461584
document	element
when trying to deserialise the element for a specific xml document i get the usual system.formatexception-handling input string was not in a correct format. exception-handling because in that specific document the element does not have a value

461616
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
if that s the case can t you solve your problem by using an autoresetevent or manualresetevent depending on what behavior you want

461627
revision	updates
each commit increases revision number so you could get next situation first application has no updates for a long time but it s revision number continually increases because of a second application updates

461628
temporary	copy
i think the problem is that maps do not actually store objects as pairs but as a tree with the first element as the key so boost_foreach can t get a reference to a pair but it can create a temporary copy of one

461638
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried numerous browsers ie firefox and google-chrome but they all have the same amount of information

461646
xsd	xml
i d like to convert an external xml document without any xsd schema associated with it into a fluent .net object

461656
value	field
whatever i set as value in the attributes it s always the field value

461661
contains	elements
i conducted an experiment in which saxom 9.1.07 processed an xml document that contains around one million 3-rd level elements with integer values

461661
xquery	xslt
burst-mode streaming is available in both xslt and xquery but there

461661
xquery	xslt
is no equivalent in xquery to the xslt iterate construct

461661
specifications	w3c
however the w3c document is still with a working draft status and the streaming specifications is likely to change in subsequent draft versioning

461666
build-process	ant
take time to put in place a good build-process ant maven in the java world

461692
show	next
if you can t find the offending line by turning off show friendly http error messages as wayne suggested then try adding on error resume next to the code along with response.write statements

461694
web-applications	security
changing security practices is always tough - like when i had to convince my boss that using the sa accounts in the sql connection string of our web-applications was a bad idea - but hang in there

461697
directory	folder
since you mention you don t have access to anything but the code behind and the page the only thing i can think of is actually creating those directory if you have access to do that and using a server.transfer page passing the value to your actual page in the folder above

461701
treeview	gridview
looks like my only option is to create a mutatant child of the treeview and data gridview but im mostly an asp.net developer and thus my lack of knowledge of all things windows

461707
datagridview	listview
for the list i really don t know what to choose between a listbox a listview or a datagridview or another one i don t know yet

461711
configuration	installation
configure error installation or configuration problem c compiler cannot creat

461725
value	field
i think the field initialisation will always have precedence over the defaultvalueattribute value

461730
contains	any
however once i have viewed these results trying to perform a reader.read on the oracledatareader does not contains any results

461770
google-chrome	firefox
and indeed works as expected at least in windows tested with ie firefox and google-chrome

461781
oracle	mysql
as a little bonus each of these tests and actions is configured for each dialect of sql so for example you can have an oracle dialect and a mysql dialect. this means that once you define the queries for given tests and actions for each dialect each new instance of a test or action requires no new sql and can be executed against multiple target databases

461790
any	set
additionally if you have two forms on a page how do you set it up so changes on both forms are saved when any submit button is clicked

461797
cargo	maven
cargo is not only a maven plugin it also has a java api and an ant task

461797
cargo	mojo
call the cargo ant task from your ant mojo i think you ll just need the cargo jars in your plugin s classpath

461797
cargo	mojo
rewrite your ant mojo in java and invoke the cargo api you d want to look at the sources of the cargo plugin

461800
hash	md5
while i believe crypt is using the md5 algorithm the outputs are not valid md5 hash

461800
hash	md5
is there a way of converting the produced hash into valid md5 hash 16-byte hex values

461800
crypt	md5
i m pretty sure the crypt function used is using some sort of md5 algorithm

461800
hash	md5
what i m looking to do is convert the ouput that i have into an md5 hash that looks something like the following

461809
rewrite	rule
and then i figured i would have a rewrite rule starting like this-

461820
version-control	sync
i m not interested in using it for source-code version-control but i am interested in a distributed version-controlled personal wiki that i can sync between all the machines i use

461840
macros	vba
i was wondering how to avoid using windows clipboard when you want to replicate multiple sections of a word document using vba in macros

461845
crypt	salt
crypt function and will accept salt

461852
hash	md5
calculates the md5 hash of str using the â rsa data security inc

461852
hash	md5
md5 message-digest algorithm and returns that hash

461857
hardware	monitor
i ve been down this road and eventually opted for a hardware data scope that does non-instrusive in-line monitor

461858
clearfix	margins
and if you set the and the first element in your dom-tree has the class clearfix you ll allways have a margins at the bottom of the page of 12px

461862
hash	md5
1 indeed means that this is a md5 hash but crypt generates a random salt

461863
perl	php
must be a unix shell script no python perl php

461868
jquery	.post
once you ve done that you can use the jquery ajax form plug-in to do the .post via ajax

461869
dialog	pop-up
how can a i guarantee that no pop-up dialog will appear when i automate microsoft excel through ole

461871
contains	any
how can i evaluate whether a column contains any non-ascii characters in mysql

461883
vbscript	jscript
i opt for jscript instead of vbscript

461886
authentication	login
we are currently trying to implement a web application which is using the java ee authentication mechanism with a form-based login inside the websphere 6.1 web container

461903
xml-serialization	xml
another way is to create poco objects and set xml-serialization attributes over properties then use system.xml.xmlserializer to serialize deserialize to from xml

461912
slidedown	slideup
i have two divs and two separate links that triggers slidedown and slideup for the divs

461928
forwarding	port
you can connect a physical serial-port through it so that your software uses the monitored virtual port and forwarding all traffic to from a physical port

461934
delphi	c++
that can be a new source repository an automated daily build process a new system to write specifications or documentation or even a different technology for example java when you usually develop in .net delphi or c++

461945
datagridview	listview
listbox a listview or datagridview are rather too limited given your requirements

461946
hide	show
one interesting issue i ve found is that i ve had complications with using the visibility property of .net controls when trying to show hide them in this manner

461947
puts	gets
many people believe that synchronized on puts to a map not a concurrentmap but say a hashmap and not synchronized on gets is sufficient

461960
compact-framework	.net
performance counters in the .net compact-framework

461960
compact-framework	.net
monitoring application performance on the .net compact-framework part i - enabling performance counters

461960
compact-framework	.net
analyzing device application performance with the .net compact-framework remote performance monitor

461966
constructor	object
it s not even if typeof null will yield object actually both are primitive values - which means neither undefined nor null can be returned from a constructor function as both will be converted to an empty object one has to throw an error to proclaim failure in constructors

461966
numeric	nan
the only real difference i can think of is that one evaluates to nan the other to 0 in numeric contexts

461974
export	report
whenever i click the print button it takes me to main report and export main report in a pdf instead of doing the same for subreport

461976
base-class	inherited
it becomes much more interesting when class a and class b implement a common interface or are inherited from a common base-class

461998
favicon	web
if you have a global.asa file in your web directory you could rename the file and try loading the favicon file again

462013
textarea	textbox
textbox -- mode multiline is textarea

462013
selected	listbox
listbox - selected

462019
children	nodes
in that structure sort all the arrays containing the nodes s children

462019
children	nodes
for example if your frontend is a flex app and the children of a nodes are stored in an icollectionview you can use the sort property to have them display the way you want

462019
children	nodes
another example if your frontend is some output from a php scripting you could have the children of each nodes in an arrays and use php s arrays sorting functions to perform your sorting

462024
forth	lisp
users of several modern programming languages notably those in the lisp and forth families nearly always use hyphens

462024
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
among the reasons sometimes given are that doing so does not require shifting on most keyboards that the words are more readable when they are separated and that camel case may simply not be reliably preserved in case-insensitive or case-folding languages such as common-lisp that while technically a case-sensitive language canonicalizes folds identifier to uppercase by default

462026
python	perl
i ve have used this successfully with other perl python programmers in a couple of companies i ve done work with

462071
order	join
do i need to do the order by before i do the join

462075
silverlight	wpf
much of the code in silverlight can be directly used in wpf wpf xbap apps because silverlight is a subset of wpf

462075
silverlight	wpf
for xaml to silverlight conversions you will have to do change the namespace uri as well but refactoring might be necessary if wpf elements are used that are not in silverlight

462076
spreadsheet	apache-poi
you could consider using spreadsheet parseexcel albeit it may lack features you need or apache-poi albeit it will need some wrapping to use in a perl scripting instead of calling the excel engine over ole

462089
hide	show
you could possibly find the other divs you d like to hide and put them in a print style sheet so they don t show up when going to print

462094
constructor	object
can i call object s constructor from bar instead

462100
shell	bash
i am looking for the most elegant and shortest way to create symbolic links to shared libraries for unix by means of a bash shell script

462102
constructor	private
you need to make foo s constructor package private at the very least though i d probably just make it protected

462103
constructor	private
you won t be able to create an instance of bar for as long as foo has a private constructor

462117
firefox	opera
a 1.x panel will render as a div in ie6+ - however in firefox or other downstream browsers - considered downstream because there were no details of it in the machine.config by default it will render as a single cell table - this could be resolved by supplying updated browsercaps for firefox opera safari etc either in the machine.config or web.configs

462117
registration	login
also control adapters can change the output - for example the css control adapters will output styled divs for most of the tabular controls login registration repeaters etc

462119
constructor	object
you can t call object s constructor directly from bar while it s a subclass of foo it would have to through foo s constructor which is private in this case

462119
constructor	private
when you declare foo s constructor private it does not create a default public constructor

462119
constructor	private
since bar has to invoke foo s constructor it is not possible to leave it private

462128
directory	folder
name of a file directory or folder as it would be displayed in a system file browser

462158
carbon	cocoa
i ve read there are two main apis carbon and cocoa

462196
command-line	cmd
it s also better segregation of concerns foo might be something that you use outside the cmd line but foolauncher is there to launch foo given cmd-line processing

462241
abstract-class	subclassing
you use an abstract-class when you want to define some shared behaviour in a superclass - but that class can t stand on its own it needs to be subclassing

462252
sorted	lookup
i am using a set because i want to use the quick lookup property of a sorted containers such as a set

462254
default	reset
you could always define a class of reset or similar with all of the default styling rules and then use javascript to apply that style to the elements you want to reset

462276
treeview	listview
if you are using winforms the standard is to use treeview for folders a listview for files results

462296
command-prompt	cmd
from the command-prompt run the following cmd br

462313
credentials	account
however i m not about to place the network or machine administrator account s user credentials in plain text on a web.config file

462320
button	popup
i have a toolbar with a button when the button is pressed a popup should appear mimicking an extension of the toolbar like a menu and this popup should show two columns of radio button say 2x5 and a text box..

462320
widget	button
pressing the button would re-shape the frame and draw the needed widget as requested

462328
python	ruby
the main difference i see would be if your developers users had any experience with either python or ruby that could be transferable

462335
credentials	account
instead of worrying about the aspnet user permissions would your internal process allow you to create a machine specific account and supply the credentials there

462349
freebsd	xnu
remember that os x comes from a xnu and freebsd darwin and most of his system call are based on susv3 standard

462351
abstract-class	subclassing
that way anyone who is happy with the default implementation in the abstract-class can quickly subclassing it without rewriting a lot of code but anyone who needs to do something more complex or who needs to inherit from a different base class can still implement the interface and be plug-and-play

462363
httpserver	webserver
alternatively you can look for a httpserver library which you can add your custom code to build a webserver with application embedded

462381
shutdown	restart
how could i restart or shutdown windows using the .net

462384
python	ruby
unless you have a compelling reason such as an existing user base already familiar with python ruby or boo bringing in another language just adds complexity and training cost

462389
bazaar	git
there are ways around this but with git bazaar mercurial this simply doesn t happen - they realize whether the commits have already been merged because they id each commit across the merging paths it takes

462434
integer	zero
i have a stored procedure that manipulates an integer table field which represents a sequence number based on some criteria - the criteria can reset the field back to zero

462434
multi-user	updates
in a multi-user environment there is a possibility that the field may be referenced by 1 user before it is updates by another user so i would like to prevent this by limiting the stored procedure to only run for 1 user at a time

462461
local-variables	class-variables
java decompilers often use a scheme like that for naming local-variables instance and class-variables are normally available in the bytecode but local-variables aren t and the results are more readable than you might expect in fact often more readable than the original source

462478
linux	unix
there is a web interface server 8008 on netware 8010 on windows 8028 on unix linux usually or other interfaces

462478
debugging	trace
if you enable the ldap trace option and turn off all the others you can fairly completely debugging what is going on at the server side

462479
integer	numeric
is_numeric will tell you if the contents of the variables are numeric true if it is a floating point or integer value

462481
mapping	unique
i believe that should work according to the nhibernate manual property-ref is an attributes that is useed for mapping legacy data where a foreign key refers to a unique key of the associated table other than the primary key

462486
gethashcode	equals
equals the gethashcode methods for the

462486
gethashcode	equals
derived classes that override gethashcode must also override equalss to guarantee that two objects considered equals have the same hash code

462513
gethashcode	equals
not directly answering your question but - if you use resharper do not forget it has a feature that generates a reasonable gethashcode implementation as well as the equals methods for you

462529
implements	final
the final solution we implements took a bit from every answer

462548
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is mostly source compatible with wpf

462561
contains	set
the set contains objects not just primitive values

462566
wicket	spring
the project i m doing will use wicket spring and hibernate

462566
wicket	spring
i know that wicket and hibernate uses simple logging facade for java sl4j and that spring is using the logging component from apache commons

462566
configuration	logging
for spring i guess i need some kind of configuration file for the apache commons logging component as well where i direct it to use log4j

462566
output	mode
when i ve set these up i guess to see that everything works i set the logging level to info as it s fairly certain that all three of the frameworks output some information in that mode

462567
gethashcode	equals
on the other hand msdn also states that the return-value of gethashcode should be equals for 2 objects if those 2 objects are considered to be equals

462567
gethashcode	equals
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode methods for each object

462567
gethashcode	equals
equals the gethashcode methods for the

462571
ruby-on-rails	django
i really do not want to start a troll here but i am wondering if there are any serious documented benchmarks comparing ruby-on-rails django cakephp or any other php framework

462572
put	get
if the cost is reasonable they aren t going to put an unreasonable amount of effort into using it anyway so you don t need to get into overly restrictive measures

462599
shutdown	exit
you should be checking for an exit condition set on when the service gets the shutdown message

462603
document	element
the easiest way to do this is to append a new style element to the head of document

462614
ruby	php
in terms of memory usage it s generally going to be python ruby php which of course leads to django rails cakephp

462614
python	ruby
there are plenty of usage scenarios in which ruby will beat python hands down

462614
ruby	php
i think we can all agree that ruby and python will always beat php though

462614
ruby-on-rails	django
that said it s still very easy to make a crappy slow and inefficient django application and a lean fast and efficient ruby-on-rails application or vice-versa

462618
click	mouse
in flex 3 button call their click handler when they are clicked on by the mouse or when they have the focus and the user depresses the space bar

462629
exception-handling	try-catch
client code has to handle this kind of exception-handling enforced in the compiler via try-catch or throws clause

462641
selected	button
i have first last previous next button that change the selected child node of a treeviewitem

462667
revision	updates
updates our revision in the release management database to the now very young repo

462671
configuration	logging
they permit library authors to not force users into having multiple logging library and configuration

462678
any	set
weakly typed languages do not require variabless to be any specific data type so you can set one variables as a string change it to int float and back to string without the processor throwing errors

462682
textbox	button
a possible alternative to auto-complete is to have radio button for common answers with one of the answers being other and a textbox to type the answer into

462692
logging	trace
then use trace tracesource system.diagnostics for your logging in your application s code

462696
temporary	copy
my first strategy was to write to a temporary file and then copy the contents into the live file while ensure good locking

462703
specifications	w3c
they re both valid useful elements in the current w3c specifications

462722
textwrangler	bbedit
if the text editor in xcode doesn t suit you i d recommend bbedit or its free little brother textwrangler

462755
show	next
next functionality show

462814
interpreter	runtime
in ibm informix ids - informix dynamic server most queries are effectively dynamic sql the exception-handling is queries in stored-procedures in that the sql is interpreter at runtime even though the client-side notation uses static sql

462814
sql-server	oracle
i don t know what oracle sybase ms sql-server do - my suspicion is that they hew closer to the line adopted by ids than the line adopted by db2

462814
postgresql	mysql
for mysql and postgresql i d be surprised if they did not behave more like ids than db2

462814
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
beware sql-injection with dynamic-sql

462830
textwrangler	bbedit
my vote would be for bbedit s free little brother textwrangler

462842
iframe	popup
you could probably put an iframe pointing to the page within the modal popup extender however that would be a bit of a hack

462865
administration	account
if i do the same thing as administration account not any administration account the administration acoount i can access the counter without any problem

462865
administration	account
so what is needed to access process counters from a let s say .net programm without the need of the administration account

462866
firefox	opera
pointed example does work in ie and should work in firefox unfortunately doesn t work in opera

462893
mathml	latex
for a web interface you can also use the jsmath javascript or it s successor mathjax library as a latex mathml renderer

462896
.when	ready
instead you should make your thread s features available to the user-interface and let it call the thread .when the user-interface is good and ready

462929
temporary	copy
i do this for a couple of reasons number one i like my applications to close when i tell them to close and number two by keeping a temporary copy of the file that i update with all the changes as the user works on it i safeguard against unexpected crashes and closes of my applications

462934
ruby-on-rails	rspec
we re using rspec and cucumber in our ruby-on-rails apps with good results

462934
cucumber	webrat
webrat has selenium support built in and we ve used selenium before but i m curious if anyone has had good results using watir with cucumber and what the pros and cons are of watir versus selenium

462936
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
dynamic-sql is vulnerable to sql-injection attacks but static sql is mostly not

462953
contains	any
one option for you is to use a configuration object to contains default values for any configuration settings

462953
constructor	object
you could then in the constructor for the configuration object attempt to override the default config values with values from somewhere such as app.config a database configuration table etc

462955
contains	any
namespace or type specified in the project-level imports system.xml.linq doesn t contains any public member or cannot be found

462955
any	set
any ideas where this is set

462966
value	field
if the created_at field type is timestamp then you can use the function current_timestamp to set the value of the field

462993
compression	streaming
the ability for someone to upload a video directly to a shared server and have it streaming without any additional work needed no compression needed etc.

463012
required	checked
do you required the specific error checked

463019
.when	ready
so for all existing child entities that are added to a new parent by a client will have to have this kind of work done on them .when they are ready to be persistent

463038
sql-server	oracle
i know you can do this with oracle so i m assuming you should be able to do this right out of the box with sql-server

463046
any	set
i usually use a simple changed flag which gets set on any edit action and cleared on saves and loads

463090
administration	account
and if the user shouldn t have the ability to do so then that is usually determined by an administration and the user is not given the right to uninstaller anything by virtue of their account type which again is not something you should have influence on

463105
radix-sort	in-place
boiled down the question is is there a workable in-place radix-sort algorithm

463105
radix-sort	in-place
to recap is there any hope of finding a working reference implementation or at least a good pseudocode description of a working in-place radix-sort that works on dna strings

463107
emacs	vim
vim and emacs they are the most capable editors and have been for quite some time

463125
administration	account
you can access it without the administration account but whatever account you do use has to be an administration and have administration privileges

463146
button	popup
can you call a modal popup from a gridview control s auto-generated edit button

463174
response.redirect	redirecttoaction
when an action returns a redirecttoaction result it causes an http-redirect equivalent to response.redirect

463174
http-redirect	request
data can be preserved in the tempdata property dictionary of the controllers for the duration of a single http-redirect request

463176
any	set
is there a way in c# code to send an email without having to know the smtp server configuration etc on the server or have any of that stuff set up

463180
throttling	throttle
what i was wondering basically is if there is any way to do broker rather than consumer side throttling or some other solution whereby the consumer can throttle without ultimately blocking

463190
http-post	post
the full data to post in a http-post

463203
conditional	operators
operators msdn page the conditional operators

463223
aes	des
block-ciphers such as des 3des and aes can only operate on blocks of bytes

463223
aes	des
des and 3des operate on block of 8 bytes and aes on blocks of 16 bytes

463227
radix-sort	in-place
i ve never seen an in-place radix-sort and from the nature of the radix-sort i doubt that it is much faster than a out of place sort as long as the temporary arrays fits into memory

463249
python	java
java arguably has the most well-defined memory model and execution semantics of the most commonly used imperative languages java c++ python ruby etc

463249
haskell	erlang
as others have mentioned there are also other models for concurrency actors in erlang and scala agents stm in clojure fp s rise in f# scala haskell the ccr and plinq stuff in clr land etc

463263
calling-convention	extern-c
note that jni calls are c and not c++ calls so you will have to specify the c calling-convention on your c++ functions extern-c

463302
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
since extension methods are nothing but static-methods you could argue that it should be argumentnullexception but on the other hand they re used like instance methods so it might be more natural to use the nullreferenceexception

463302
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
i think i favor the argumentnullexception that s what i ve use so far but i still think there is at least room to argue for an against the nullreferenceexception since it seems more natural in most places where the methods is going to be used

463307
any	set
if you are sure the application can run unattended safely by this i mean it can never throw up a modal user-interface element like a message box and it doesn t need any interaction until shutdown where it will simply be terminated then run it as a scheduled task with the triggers set to system start up

463307
shutdown	restart
if it can run unattended but it may need to be shutdown and restart manually or it can t just be terminated at shutdown then use the xyntservice as recommended by enocnroll

463318
.when	ready
if you are so fortunate that you can read the data asynchronously that is you can .post some kind of read request and be notified .when some data is ready and then you can build a chunk of the heap while you are waiting for the next chunk of data to come in - even from disk

463335
decrement	increment
of course it also gives your users the ability to hit the up and down arrows on the keyboard to increment and decrement the current value

463337
hash	md5
i would also consider saving and comparing an md5 hash of the file to see when it changes

463339
oniguruma	pcre
for the sake of completeness here s another versioning from regexbuddy s library that uses the recursive grouping syntax supported by perl pcre and oniguruma onigmo

463340
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
in that case i would certainly not except a nullreferenceexception but instead an argumentnullexception

463343
selected	button
it is called funicons you can selected a character and then create an animation by drawing a path on the face with the mouse press and hold the mouse button to do so and then by clicking on the save button you will get an animated gif with the sequence you just plotted

463345
authentication	login
we use it to run ssms and login using integrated authentication to a sql-server that sits on a different domain

463346
checkbox	button
the only way around this is to use checkbox instead of button and make it one big form â or to use javascript

463376
oracle	mysql
what if you switch the repository and have a mysql oracle xml files web service or whatever data provider repository

463377
value	field
i generally have some fields that will include 1 a date field and 2 a value field

463377
value	field
and every other field is the value field summed for that month except for total which is the total value field for the year

463379
dialog	pop-up
i guess you could open a pop-up windows and call that a dialog box

463397
swing	swt
i m looking for a way to display a vnc viewer in a thick rich java client specifically i m using swt but if i can get it into awt swing i can integrate that specifically. this is not an applet but a real live thick java client

463415
sql-server	mysql
when your application needs a customer object it shouldn t have to know whether it is coming from sql-server mysql an xml file or asp.net membership

463425
put	get
have one or more threads get records from this table perform the request and put the completed record back in the table

463438
32-bit	16-bit
in other words ntohs swaps bytes within a 16-bit short and ntohl reverses the order of the four bytes of its 32-bit word

463459
json	csv
if someone provided it in multiple formats eg sql ddl xml csv json yaml.

463487
windows-xp	windows
using wix windows installer xml i have created an msi installer which installs word templates into the users application data folder on windows-xp

463488
google-chrome	firefox
i have this javascript code working in firefox google-chrome and safari

463501
adplus	dump
will it make any difference if i grab a dr watson crash dump on a hung process instead of adplus hang dump

463513
arrays	loops
the indexed-for is still the canonical javascript arrays loops

463519
licensing	lgpl
laurent de soras fftreal is very fast and lgpl d meaning that you can use it in commercial software without needing to pay licensing nor make your software open-source

463526
solaris	sunos
i am using xdrawstring on solaris 10 as well as sunos 2.6

463532
queue	fifo
feed all the lines as separate atomic transactions through an asynchronous fifo message queue with a good mechanism for detecting and appropriately logging and routing failures

463535
checkbox	button
i am implementing an html form with some checkbox input elements and i want to have a select all or deselect all button

463562
python	java
keeping in mind that i need to service java python and .net clients

463564
uninstaller	msiexec
edit the user still has full control to uninstaller via msiexec via a custom uninstaller shortcut that you provide all this does is hide the entry in add remove programs arp

463576
dialog	pop-up
you can do a modal dialog inside the windows using a user-interface framework or you can have a pop-up windows with a scripting that auto-closes after a timeout.

463586
duplicates	elements
the key part is to make sure that the recursive side always has the leftmost elements this way you don t get duplicates

463604
integer	numeric
i have a python function that takes a numeric argument that must be an integer in order for it behave correctly

463607
sql-server	ms-access
i have an ms-access database that was converted to use sql tables using the microsoft sql-server migration assistant 2008 for access aka ssma and created linked tables so the ms-access interface still works but is linked to sql tables

463607
sql-server	ms-access
so my underlying question is without using dsn how do i add an additional sql-server table to ms-access as a linked table

463608
arguments	default
you could also argue that 2 should throw an exception-handling but then you d have to provide a better more explicit mechanism for default variables arguments

463612
value	field
if i were to venture a guess i d say that this looks like part of a xml document defining some kind of schema and that the firstname field can have a null or nil value meaning empty or unknown

463627
json	xml
soap json pox plain old xml coexist endpoints for wcf services would solve your problem

463627
json	xml
soap json pox plain old xml coexist

463633
value	field
char takes up less storage spaces than varchar if all your data value in that field are the same length

463664
silverlight	xbap
xbap like silverlight but only for windows

463664
silverlight	wpf
xaml can be reused for silverlight wpf xbap

463664
silverlight	wpf
minor changes in wpf silverlight

463670
javascript	dom
in some cases a dom node should only be visible when javascript is enabled in the browser

463696
findcontrol	asp.net
asp.net will stick some html content in there as a literalcontrol you ll need to look to see which index is your checkbox or stick with findcontrol

463700
document	element
just a thought i m not sure if this will work but you could try putting some javascript in the document head to write a css style element that would hide the button

463703
callback	methods
in your situation you need to inline the logic of this query the logic won t cross the boundary of a function call because you are dealing with an expression tree the sql-server can t callback into your getregions methods

463705
textbox	button
i have a data templates with a textbox and a button with some styles on it

463705
textbox	button
i would like to have the button show the mouse over state when focus is on the textbox beside it

463719
64bit	x86
this will exist in 64bit systems c program files x86 microsoft visual-studio 9.0 common7 ide

463784
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
it depends on the collation of the field - if it s codeigniter case-insensitive or cs case-sensitive

463816
value	field
the usual way to fix this is to double up and apostrophes you want to be part of the field value

463816
value	field
for example if i want to add george s to field owner the sql query would be insert into table owner value george s

463842
emacs	vim
there is a netbeans add-in emacs mode and vim syntax highlighting

463847
sqldatasource	gridview
so far the only examples i know of are telerik s grid cost implements sorting and paging in the grid and sqldatasource + gridview implements sorting and paging in the datasource but requires ms-sql to be available

463865
svnadmin	dump
checkout svnadmin dump svnadmin load and svndumpfilter

463868
sql-server	oracle
i don t mean basic sql but strongly the specs and the difference between the specs and the implementations between great databases like sql-server oracle etc

463880
project-management	project
who actually inputs them into your issue management system bug tracker project scheduler project-management software fogbugz is literally whatever team member he she directs to do the job

463894
selected	listbox
i have this method verify_x which is called during databind for a listbox selected value

463908
failover	san
if you do not perceive dfs as a viable approach you may wish to consider failover clustering of your file server tier whereby your files are stored in an external shared storage not an expensive san which i believe is overkill for your case since dfs is already out of your reach connect between active and passive file servers

463912
contains	elements
can contains other block level elements like p h1 table ul blockquote div

463912
contains	elements
can contains other inline elements like img strong em input a span

463912
contains	elements
can not contains block level elements

463912
contains	elements
can contains other inline elements like img strong em input a span

463912
contains	elements
you can always change their default display property with css but you cannot change the type of elements they can contains regardless of the display property value

463912
specifications	w3c
finally for more information you can check the official w3c specifications topic about divs and spans

463922
postgresql	mysql
give it a hint that you re on mysql or postgresql and it can add a limit clause to your query or rownum over a subquery for oracle and so on

463926
oracle	mysql
sql server oracle and mysql all offer free express editions

463939
wicket	grails
few other goodies to look into are groovy on grails wicket

463939
spring	seam
i don t recommend anything like seam and spring they are more of a container and sophisticated large frameworks which give you almost everything solution for almost all of your problems

463944
stdin	eof
if you want to read everything from stdin up until the eof try

463954
firefox	safari
i use firefox and webkit for web debugging and safari for regular web browsing however

463954
firefox	safari
firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall

463973
vba	vb6
i understand it is possible to do so using excel macro see programmatically extract macro vba code from word 2007 docs but what i want to do here is to use vb6 to make an application which does the same thing

463989
csv	xml
surely there is an export button or a way to save reports as excell csv txt xml ..

463989
export	report
so we haven t been able to follow dviggiani s advice of automated jde report export

464000
lgpl	gpl
i am looking for open source non-copyleft kind of library available for commercial use gpl is out lgpl should be ok

464006
delphi	c++
note that despite their names the ansix functions accept unicodestring parameters not ansistring in delphi and c++ builder 2009

464012
while-loop	loops
note that the tail test in the main loops means that if the jobs running queue has space when the while-loops iterates - preventing premature termination of the loops

464012
perl	tcl
i can see how to do that in c fairly easily - it wouldn t be all that hard in perl either and therefore not too hard in the other scripting languages - python ruby tcl etc

464032
postgresql	mysql
ansi sql99 oracle mysql postgresql and sql server

464082
triggers	insert
triggers are mandatory for the insert update delete operations

464096
jcifs	ntlm
for example for years the way to do this in java was with the ntlm http authentication servlet filtering from a project called jcifs

464101
exception-handling	try-catch
never wrap an entire methods in a try-catch simply to catch all exception-handling

464146
.net	wcf
was rest an afterthought for wcf that was added in .net 3.5 sp1 and hence not baked in well or is it well integrated

464146
silverlight	xbap
i ve been reading that some people are having problems getting wcf to play well with xbap and i would assume there are similar problems with silverlight

464149
toolbar	tabs
does someone know an open source project or code snippets which demonstrate how to create a google-chrome like interface with similar tabs and toolbar in swing

464159
g++	gcc
according to g++ -v i have gcc version 4.3.2 debian 4.3.2-1.1

464159
g++	gcc
did you maybe accidentally compile â or link â with gcc instead of g++

464165
copy-constructor	temporary
the problem is that your copy-constructor doesn t accept the temporary that you give the throw

464165
temporary	rvalue
it s a temporary and thus an rvalue

464173
spring	grails
grails comes with a whole bunch of stuff that it configures under the covers including hibernate and spring

464173
groovy	java
the disadvantage with grails is not so much that it is written in groovy which is easy to learn for java programmers but that the ide support for groovy is still maturing

464180
g++	gcc
well just figured it out seems code block was using gcc instead of g++ to compile the file

464187
click	mouse
the idea is you have a list of images and only x number of them are visible at a time and instead of click next previous to scroll thru the images they scroll relative to the offset from center positioning of your mouse

464192
arrays	loops
you have an arrays of json objects so you need to loops through the arrays to get each individual object

464200
populate	row
if you need to put a default or calculated value into every row of the new column you ll need to run a massive update or perhaps a little utility program that populate the new data

464214
instances	self
the dbadmin is a singleton class and the getinstances methods returns the self invoked instances

464214

464230
boolean	double
looks simple to me matlab passes numbers to java as double instances strings as string instances boolean as boolean instances and arrays as java arrays

464249
look-and-feel	substance
i think you should opt to substance look-and-feel and make a chrome-lookalike skin for it substance is a skinnable look-and-feel which sort of extends swing s functionality on the graphical side and use that won t be the easiest way to do it but if you have the time and willpower you ll get exactly what you want

464251
silverlight	wpf
my personal expierence is that silverlight is easier to work with wcf than xbaps as the security model is better defined than the sillyness of running xbaps why not just use click once + wpf and you get the exact same as xbaps without headaches - i ll get off my soap box now

464261
teamcity	nant
i ve written a console application that has a number of unit tests and i m wanting to include it in my nant build script so that it will be run on our teamcity cis

464262
implements	extends
if i ve been misreading your question and you actually want each database query to execute in its own thread then i d suggest making a class called something like sqlquery which implements runnable or extends thread - actually you could even consider using java.util.concurrent.callable which allows you to return a value from its call methods which is like run

464265
adplus	dump
i created a full dump with adplus -hang and drwtsn32 and used dumpchk to compare the two

464265

or has anyone modified their jquery lightbox to do so

464418
music	pcm
that task reading a file from the disk and sending it via http should not use any significant amount of cpu especially at the bitrates required for music streaming unless you re talking about multi-channel uncompressed pcm or something like that but even then it should be i o-bound and not use a lot of cpu

464423
perl	c++
download and unpack then using visual c++ 2008 express + active perl

464432
perforce	cvs
its simpler to install than subversion perforce or cvs and no server component is required

464463
wxpython	pyqt
i am also interested about the possible implications this will have on their bindings with the most common scripting languages pyqt wxpython wxruby

464463
wxpython	pyqt
why pyqt is so under-used when it has a professional grade designer and wxpython not

464469
cross-compiling	binutils
you will need either a cross-compiling toolchain or to build your own cross binutils

sql-server	oracle
i ve found ways for sybase sql-server oracle but nothing that works for all databases

464476
spaces	output
is there any known algorithm that can generate a shuffled range 0..n in linear time and constant spaces when output produced iteratively given an arbitrary seed value

464488
stderr	stdout
what is a little tricky is passing stdin and reading stderr and stdout at least for non-trivial sizes thereof because you need to start seperate threads to make sure the respective buffering get cleared

464493
mouseenter	mousehover
edit mouseenter or mousehover doesn t catch menu selection via the keyboard

464499
data-access	nhibernate
use constraints in the database but for any sophisticated logic i would place that in a data-access layer or use one of the standard object relational mapping orm tools such as hibernate nhibernate

implements	abstract
if you have to support multiple database systems you should implements your code against an abstract interface with specific implementsations per database system

464515
selected	button
if you click the change button there you can selected to use both the original dotnetconfig schema and your own newly created one

464516
directory	folder
within that database there is a table called moz_bookmarks which contains all the bookmarks tags and folder within the bookmarks directory

innodb	myisam
on the other hand if myisam has advantages over innodb in your context why would you want to create foreign key constraints at all

464535
wxpython	pyqt
for python there are pyqt bindings and wxpython bindings

464535

464615
.when	ready
i suppose an application could be considered enterprise ready .when it is stable enough that a large company would use it

464630
oracle	mysql
most os projects default to mysql as the database which is a good and sensible choice for most small projects however if your enterprise has an oracle site license and a team of highly skilled oracle dbas in place the mysql option looks distinctly unattractive

464636
treeview	listview
but the wpf databinding support in default controls is pervasive and consistent the winforms data binding support not so much treeview listview i m looking at you

464661
execute	prepare
there is no need to actually execute the prepare statement

464691

464744
forwarding	port
port forwarding can also be a pain if the routing hardware is not great at the end users endpoint

464761
order	add
if your project manager wants you to add a new feature send a copy of your list and ask where you should insert it in the priority order

464775
contains	any
now the question is about libraries - they contains functions that may be used in any class and sometimes they use some other function from another library and sometimes they need to access some core class

464795
if-statement	loops
typically you abstract them away as simple if-statement for each loops you test that its body was executed 0 times for one test and at least once in another test

when served as a page from a webserver either the built-in cassini server or iis in ie firefox or when you switch to design view in visual-studio

464804
firefox	safari
it s possible that if it s been built to look nice in safari that it will work in firefox but there may be issues with the rendering layouts in ie - this is a fairly well known issue

464813
double	int
then when i start to get used to the idea that the objects i am using like string know how to perform operations i am used to using external functions to achieve like to upper tolower substring etc they change the rules with numbers numbers don t know how to convert themselves from one numeric type to another for some reason instead you have to invoke convert class static functions to change a double to an int and math class static functions to achieve rounding and truncation

464818
constructor	private
from my java point of view i would say constructor public methods private methods in that order

464825
png	gif
i also tried converting the sample gif to png with gimp and using the png as an input for the java code

464835
actionscript	haxe
if you are not interested in haxe you will basically need to write your own compiler that compiles objects down to abc actionscript byte code

464889
attributes	properties
i was told that in c# attributes are not allowed on the auto-implemented properties

464889
attributes	properties

how you interpreter and act upon that to get that element is up to your implementation and certainly xpath xslt to change the document is just implementing xpath to do this is a strong way to do this

464989
security	owasp
i have found the reference to owasp most helpful so far i m about to install some of their project software to see how it works once i feel that i m better off security wise for having a look at their site i m marking that answer as accepted unless something better comes in in the meanwhile

464997
vcproj	csproj
then open the vcproj csproj file in text-editor by right-clicking- edit on the project

465055
bug-tracking	bugzilla
we use bugzilla for bug-tracking and there are rules like

465056
handler	service
this can help you if the code you want to debugging is executed before you can attach to process if your code executed in handler of service start event for example

465056
debugging	trace
edit you can attach to any service even if you don t have debugging information for it but in this case you wouldn t be able to see stack trace above your function call

465085
h.264	mp4
in the first case your only option is to transcode your video files to quicktime h.264 m4v or mp4 extension

i am confused about how you could use apache for this -- i always thought apache either just serves static files or runs scripts interpreted by other programs perl php etc

465390
dialog	pop-up
com automation has the disadvantage of not always being reliable mainly because applications tend to hang due to modal pop-up dialog

465393
directory	folder
i ve figured out another approach though you put a file httpd.ini holding specific rewrite s to a specific virtual directory domain in the root folder of that virtual directory domain

465419
subtract	add
most wcf tutorials and examples i have seen tend to use fairly trivial models often a calculator service offering add subtract etc

i have a ruby program that puts a question to the cmd line and i would like to write a python program that can return an answer

465437
constructor	object
but what if the constructor of the object to resolve takes 1 2 or any parameters

465438
linux	unix

465455
output	cat
this will send the output of the first command cat .profile .shrc to the more command using the pipe character |

465455
python	ruby
i m don t know how ruby handles this but in python you can run a program and get it s output by using the popen function

so i ve been trying to write something that would create the correct arrays of script map objects

465559
google-chrome	firefox
i tried with ie 7 firefox 3 and google-chrome and none of them copy the numbers google-chrome seems to copy them in the selection but after pasting they are not there

if you ve ever peeked at the string source code you ll have seen that it doesn t just have field for the char arrays value and the count of characters but also for the offset to the beginning of the string

465682
constructor	private
the copy constructor on string allows you to create a private string instance from a string literal

465691
value	field
i think the solution is to simply compute the required value from the coordinates and the size of the field from my understanding that should be simple

465712
varchar2	clob
so write a database pl sql function that does the dbms_xmlgen and return a varchar2 or clob depending on the size of your xml

465723
version-control	cvs
i d recommend reading the two pragmatic programmer books on svn and cvs called pragmatic version-control using cvs and pragmatic version-control using subversion

465728
subtraction	addition
i know the basic division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

465730
any	set
mainly because any case where predecence is ambiguous can be solved with a simple set of parens

465762
linux	unix
btw there is probably less than a 5 chance that i will ever need to setup anything other than a windows platform so while it is nice to be able to setup a unix linux box its not a requirement

bugzilla	fogbugz
iâ ve used several different types of bug tracking systems over the past 10 years including nothing a word document fogbugz bugzilla and remedy

python	perl
do you known a perl or python library that does that

465803
scrollbar	widget
it s worth mentioning though that qt comes with special styles for mac os x and windows-xp and vista that use native apis appearance manager on mac os x uxtheme on windows-xp for drawing standard widget primitives scrollbar or button exactly like any native application

465829
arguments	default
you can specify a second arguments but it default to dbms_xmlgen.entity_encode .

465859
perl	tcl
i never have a 100 grip on the precedence rules because i work in several languages c c++ perl bash and once in a while a dash of tcl tk.

i would advise using msbuild instead of nant

465864
qt-designer	pyqt
i recommend pyqt now from nokia which uses qt-designer

465864
qt-designer	pyuic
qt-designer produces xml files .ui which you can either convert to python modules using a utility called pyuic or load dynamically from your python program

465884
ebnf	bnf
bnf ebnf - context-free grammers the syntax rules

465909
python	perl
i m not aware of any python or perl libraries but you could encode your stop word list in a binary tree or hash or you could use python frozenset then as you read each word from the input text check if it is in your stop list and filter it out

465912
directory	folder
i think you should prefer the appdata folder but if you want to combine all the logs in one folder then use all users directory environment.specialfolder.commonapplicationdata and create sub folders inside your app folder for each user

465918
32-bit	64bit
the only limitation i ve come across with ms vpc is that you can t install a 64bit guest os if the host os is 32-bit

465923
javascript	dom
i don t have the ability to remove it server side so i m looking for some jquery or classic javascript that will allow me to capture all the child elements of the form remove the form i don t need and finally re-append the child elements back to the dom

465924
instances	private
your ide should make clear which variables is public private static instances .

465946

the routes you have seem appropriate using those routes you have a bunch of helper methods available in your controllers and views such as user_galleries_url user and user_galleries_url user gallery and others

466039
subdirectory	rename
second the filtering logic is entirely path-based so if the subdirectory you are mirroring was rename at some point in the past your mirror would contains only the revision since the directory appeared at the url you specified

466039
subdirectory	rename
and likewise if the source subdirectory is rename in the future your synchronization processes will stop mirroring data at the point that the source url you specified is no longer valid

466042
lookup	any
if it isn t include in the framework anywhere does anyone have any ideas more elegant than a digit place specific lookup

466066
pointers	stack
within main you allocated on stack an arrays of 100 pointers to the book structure

466082
png	gif
this works for png to jpg and gif to jpg

466090
versioning	upgrade
upgrade from minor versioning number is free

466098
attributes	properties
you have to add the xmlelement attributes to each properties as well setting the namespace properties to an empty string as the namespace is not inherited in your situation

certainly these teams could each maintain their own git repository and push pull between each other as necessary which would quickly turn into a nightmare in many situations

466161
notepad++	emacs
editor of your choice i use emacs on linux notepad++ handles actionscript well in windows

466167
perl	c++
sample programs in perl python c++ and grep all give the same output

466215
actionscript	mxml
you may have to learn actionscript and mxml dtd

466216
sequences	unique
the resulting pin must be unique for each number in the sequences so that if you generate 100 000 pin codes they must all be different

466216
multiplying	subtract
to generate the verification digit you must perform some arithmetic operations on the number you have generated for example adding all the digits in the odd positioning and multiplying them by some other number then subtract all the digits in the even positioning and finally adding all the digits together you must vary the algorithm a little based on the value of certain digits

466217
base-class	subclass
other things being equal i prefer the simpler solution a single concrete class which takes a string as a constructor parameter to the more complicated one using a base-class and a subclass

push	pull
the master repository offers other advantages as well such as ease of continuous-integration as the push pull triggers can be configured on the master repository to fire off the unit tests and build-system

466227
exception-handling	try-catch
rather you need to wrap the code in the overload of the onstart methods on the myservice class in a try-catch block as that is where the exception-handling is occuring

466254
ref	out
i needed to do something similar once and ended up returning them all as out ref cursor s one for each result set

466276
attributes	properties
if you specify a value like 20 for the textbox.columns properties which maps to the input size attributes they ll match up

466284
contains	any
now people can write titles contains any utf-8 character but most are not allowed in the url

466287
versioning	upgrade
if you need to run test those types of apps you may have to upgrade to a not-free versioning

466295
shell	bash
please windows fan boys downvote me because my answer involves the bash shell and not the windows shell despite the original post never mentioning an os

466321
unix-timestamp	julian
how can i convert from a unix-timestamp say 1232559922 to a fractional julian date 2454853.03150

466321
perl	c++
solutions can be in c c++ python perl bash etc.

466329
digits	zero
use if all the output numbers will be the same length including zero they re all for example 10 digits

466329
value	field
add a field to your table to store the original length of the numeric continue to store the value as numeric to leverage sorting indexing performance gains of numeric vs

466349
sql-server	oracle
i would imagine you can do the same for sql-server as in oracle where i have more experience

466352
base-class	inherited
i have a class descendant1 that inherited from a base class base-class

466394
mediator	facade
and what happens when requirements change and your module wasn t abstracted using a facade or potentially a mediator thus making it overly difficult to swap out

466400
arrays	loops
i used double in the method signature and printed the arrays in a loops and it worked

466425
updating	updates
i dont see a solution to that if the count somehow will change and need updating you re stuck with the insert into on duplicates key updates which i don t really see the issue with

466425
triggers	insert
the insert will fail instantly because of the duplicate key violation and triggers the update in that case

466456
nebula	swt
if you were to use the jface-type viewers swt table or nebula grid both support this style of asp.net-mvc architecture as do some others mentioned in this question it should be possible to implement paging in the content provider just by setting some custom offset into your dataset and then refreshing the grid

466456
selection	cell
this requires a grid control with cell selection

466456
nebula	swt
nebula is one swt table isn t

466456
selected	cells
if cell selectedion is available this is just a matter of catching the correct selectedion event clicking on a header probably and iterating over your rows to selected the correct cells

466458
audio	ogg
i am looking for a free library that allows for an extensive list of audio formats to be played for example mp3 wma wav ogg etc. thats pretty much the basic functionality i would need

466482
authentication	login
i m trying to check in application_authenticaterequest if the page accessed in this location needs protection or not and if yes to know if the user have been authentication already or i need to redirect to login

466482
order	add
in order for me to grasp it better here are 2 bonus questions please edit other answers to add these thanks

466485
rhino-mocks	moq
i m a fan of the aaa syntax so i ll probably switch to moq for my next project it s a bit newer than rhino-mocks

466487
rhino-mocks	nmock
rhino-mocks vs nmock

466508
base-class	subclass
if you still want to favor inheritance without necessarily thinking in terms of base-class and subclass you can simply define an interface ex

466521
ftp	ssh
this makes listing the files in the directory through ftp or ssh client take a few seconds

466521
ftp	ssh
but i m not sure that there s any reason to do so except for the occasional listing of the directory through ftp ssh

466529
contains	elements
in many cases it would be enough to catch for soapexception-handling which could contains some business errors transmitted through the soap fault elements and every other exception-handling could be considered as a non handled error

466530
selected	checkbox
and if i selected a node that node s checkbox will be checked

466548
easymock	junit
i have designed a small test case class that is designed to make mocking easier in this case with junit 4 and easymock

466580
ubuntu	linux
it was on an 32-bit ubuntu linux laptop and even nautilus displayed the directory contents albeit after a few seconds

466589
swing	awt
has sun changed internal working of awt or swing in java1.5

466590
attributes	properties
according to the documentation the effectiveprivatebyteslimit properties can be set with the privatebyteslimit attributes of the cache element for caching asp.net settings schema element in the application s configuration file

466598
revision	svn
you can have all of that information just through the svn revision logs

466612
queue	fifo
given that a queue is fifo you have to assume that all messages that are in a queue arrive at a time equal to or later than the time than the first message in the queue

466620
arrays	loops
i was expecting to be able to loops through each row of a datagrid and write that to the arrays collection but the only method for accessing data in the datagrid that i can find is selecteditem which doesn t help me

466637
postback	ajax
i have the following jquery code which does similar functionality like stackoverflow where the user clicks on the comment link and it displays the comments or in this case replies to a member s status update generally it works great except when a member posts a new status update which updates the list of status updates using an ajax async postback in asp.net-mvc

466645
attributes	properties
if you are using data contract serialization the datacontractserialization then the getter setter will be called if you apply the data-members attributes to the properties not to its backing field

466645
value	field
if you are using the original serialization mechanism in .net iformatter implementation then this scenario isn t possible because it will only serialization value stored in field

466664
font-size	height
to get pixel-perfect results but in order to get results that are as predictable as possible i try to use a line height that produces a nice round value when multiplied by the font-size

466664
font-size	height
if the user agent s starting font-size is indeed 16 pixels then the line height of 1.5 comes out to a nice even 24 pixels

466664
font-size	height
starting from a base font-size of 16 pixels the line height will be 24 pixels

466664
font-size	height
within a element the font-size becomes 12 pixels but the line height does not become 18 pixels rather it remains 24 pixels

466664
pixels	line
when is used the line height for is 18 pixels

466667
instances	private
just make it a private instances class and keep a reference to it

466672
contains	set
100 on the iframe in css will not set it to 100 of the content inside the iframe but relative to the the page or contains element a div or something

466684
linux	bsd
using python how can information such as cpu usage memory usage free used etc process count etc be returned in a generic manner so that the same code can be run on linux windows bsd etc

466685
value	field
when using multiple submit button i like to use javascript to set the value of a hidden form field which describes the action that should take place

466692
any	set
and is there any way to set these metadatas with pypdf

466695
contains	set
in case of other controls which are directly contains in the page you can consider using a private methods which will set their properties whenever you feel appropriate

466699
textbox	button
for example consider this simple wpf windows that has a button to paste text into the textbox

466705
pixels	line
that will occur if your line is only 1 pixels wide in the original

466708
getter	setter
the sometimes so-called javabeans-pattern getter and setter for every field

466712
selected	button
they can be overkill for some things but you do get some nice benefits like canexecute which can automagically enable disable button menu items when the command is not available such as no text selected etc

466727
singleton	facade
why just the other day i had to implement a visitor facade for a singleton just to get the adapter strategy to work -p

466729
swing	awt
swing is thread-hostile so do your swing manipulation in the awt event diaptch thread edt

466730
drawrectangle	draw
you can see a variant of the same problem if you create a 100x100 bitmap and then call drawrectangle using a 100x100 rectangle as one of the parameters you will not see the bottom or right sides of the draw rectangle

466737
document	element
however in this case you could simply add an img scripting or iframe element to the document to get it to request the third party url and send it to the server

466755
gnome	kde
if i were you i would download the source code for ps or top or the gnome kde versioning of the same or any number of system monitoring graphing programs which are more likely to have all the necessary unix cross platform bits see what they do and then make the necessary native calls with ctypes

466775
instances	destroy
the instances you added the control to last time was destroy as soon as the http-request finished mdash

466795
subclass	nsobject
with a variables typed you can only send it messages declared by nsobject not methods of any subclass or else it will generate a warning

466803
text-editor	editor
in that case you are in fact in a text-editor with some interesting ways of dealing with things and this set of commands may help you out so that you can get past your first commit and then configure an editor you are familiar with or use it as an opportunity to learn how to use it

466806
http	ssl
if so you could investigate using http digest access authentication or issuing clients their own ssl certificates to uniquely identify and authenticate them

466810
contains	any
before doing the pythagoras you could also quickly eliminate any point that falls outside of the square that can fully contains the target circle

466815
profiling	debugging
you d probably find that you can do this if you use the profiling debugging api but i don t believe you can do it from normal .net code

466817
keyboard	mouse
if you are not familiar with windows messaging it is a way for win forms to communicate with the os for things like drawing keyboard events mouse events and everything else

466822
subclassing	nsobject
id means an object means an instances of nsobject or one of its subclassing

466828
rhino-mocks	moq
rhino-mocks is great and very complete but i found moq was much simpler to learn and use

466828
rhino-mocks	moq
i also use rhino-mocks and it s great but i guess i find moq s api very discoverable and the short documentation very helpful

466828
rhino-mocks	moq
even phil haack wasn t aware of all of rhino-mocks capabilities when he compared it to moq which is a statement about discoverability

466837
low-level	hardware
readability can make the code improved or substituted 6 months after it was created with litte effort on the other hand if performance is critical you may want to use a low-level language to target the specific hardware you will have in production so to get faster execution

466839
handler	service
when you define an axis2 service you can define what handler it has in the services.xml file

466841
bufferedreader	ioexception
bufferedreader actual throws ioexception

466845
document	element
you could simply add an img scripting or iframe element to the document to get it to request the third party url

466849
stdin	pipe
to change this behavior and make windows pipe work as expected for stdin stdout redirection you can add this value to the registry tested on my box and verified this works as desired

466855
openlayers	mapserver
for web development start with mapserver and openlayers

466858
convention	standards
is there some official sun-recommended naming convention or de-facto standards

466860
versioning	packaging
there are lots of ways you can do this - either build up your own homegrown versioning somehow we are currently packaging database change scripting into a dll as embedded resources and have an engine that ll run those on the client machine at install and or update time or you can look at readily available .net products like redgate sql packager which can save you lots of time and effort

466861
singleton	facade
there is a narrow way to think of it basically as a collective name for the oo concepts listed in the gof book singleton facade strategy

466861
haskell	lisp
but for your specific purposes if you re working in lisp or haskell or whatever and writing a server sometimes it s enough to just follow the server pattern implementing it as good old functions and objects without trying to make an instantiable abstraction of the whole thing

466878
jvisualvm	jvm
this is not something i want to connect to the jvm for as would be with jconsole or jvisualvm

466889
recording	playing
how are you creating your selenium tests by recording them and playing them back

466893
appdata	temp
java.io.tmpdir c users donal appdata local temp

466895
webserver	security
what i d personally like to see in the future is rock solid security on all incoming requests by default on webserver frameworks and cmss and then explicitly define resources that will parse request from outside sources

466897
python	ruby
i m curious about how .net will affect python and ruby applications

466897
ironpython	ironruby
will applications written in ironpython ironruby be so specific to the .net environment that they will essentially become platform specific

466897
ironpython	ironruby
if they don t use any of the .net features then what is the advantage of ironpython ironruby over their non .net counterparts

466899
subclassing	base-class
perhaps this is more complicated than what you are looking for but it seems that perhaps you could setup a base-class for your bins and have subclassing of video or clip

466904
build-server	msbuild
i ve run into instances where my solution builds if i open it in the ide and compile but fails if i run from a command-line either msbuild or devenv. in each case the problem was due to a bad reference - likely from paths not matching between your local box and the build-server

466907
interpreter	runtime
many languages today such a java and c# usually compile into a bytecode that is not machine code but one that easily be interpreter at runtime to produce machine code

466930
ironpython	ironruby
ironpython ironruby are built to work on the .net virtual-machine so they are as you say essentially platform specific

466930
python	ruby
apparently they are compatible with python and ruby as long as you don t use any of the .net framework in your programs

466942
document	element
you could simply add an img scripting or iframe element to the document

466953
push	pull
i don t have to choose which one is the single central repository i can pull and work from the github repository and later push to my own copy

466954
firefox	opera
it doesn t appear to be a browser issue as i ve tried in ie 6 7 firefox 2 3 opera safari 3 and the problem does not occur

466967
dictionary	map
if you want to map particular numbers to particular objects consider using a key-value pair structure like a hash table or dictionary instead of a list

466972
show	next
i had it before where it would grab the data as a single matrix show it in real time and then proceed to process the next set of data

466990
multiplication	addition
it starts out with such simple concepts as addition and multiplication but as it explains the concepts it also explains how computers do the calculations

467008
json	xml
unfortunately i have no control over the response data it varies from xml json to simple text

467031
python	ruby
well if you want python or ruby code you now need to support another framework need to distribute install take care of version problem etc.

467053
git-status	gitignore
as detailed in is there a way to tell git-status to ignore the effects of gitignore files

467059
firefox	opera
also works in firefox and opera but with a warning

467067
ruby-on-rails	django
it would be cool to run ruby-on-rails django under iis rather then apache mongrel type solutions

467082
put	get
i couldn t get fop.bat to work even running as local system but i could call java so i put the entire fop command-line into my asp scripting similar to this snippet

467085
32-bit	64bit
you may be assuming int to be 64bit while you may be using 32-bit windows where it is 32-bit

467105
contains	set
this should give you the set of entities where the list of tags contains at least one of the items in searchtags

467112
widget	button
let s say that on the widget 12 s view page returned by http-get i want to include a form with just a single submit button to delete that widget

467113
put	get
i have a few months of experience with web application development with an asp.net-mvc framework cakephp so i get the basic but i began to see a theme that made me think i m taking a flawed approach to where i put my logic

467113
associations	model
i have all business logic in the controllers and nothing besides associations and validation rules in the model

467117
required	checked
how should the checked be done by a central structure or should each action check for the required rights itself

467120
single-table-inheritance	datamapper
for example i m currently refactoring the code for one website to use datamapper so that i can use single-table-inheritance uses inheritance mapping

467140
32-bit	64bit
my previous install of windows was 32-bit but when i rebuilt my pc recently i went with the 64bit version

467142
buffering	streaming
if you expect users to streaming at 500 kb s and there is a network latency of up to 0.1 sec then the buffering size should be around 50 kb

467151
contains	any
you would have to be very careful that the templates did not contains any request or user specific information and also synchronize any methods calls

467170
naming-conventions	conventions
the naming conventions was developed to make the code easier to read but it ended up doing just the opposite because developers ran with the implication that good naming-conventionss meant readable code

467173
internet-explorer	gecko
most html email clients use internet-explorer bits webkit bits or gecko bits to render the html

467178
put	get
at this point it seems as though the calls to the com object get put on a stack and they get processed on a fifo basis

467185
perl	ruby
i happen to really like ruby and perl but wouldn t suggest it as a new path for your intended purpose

467190
xsd	xml
i have an xml column in my table which contains this xsd snippet

467240
value	field
will it be separate table for each class of objects and altering table each time structure is changed or 1-to-many relationship between object and it s property value like table stringproperties with field objectid propertyid stringvalue

467261
required	checked
you could start a timer system.timers.timer from one of the application event in global.asax.cs in application_beginrequest after checked that it is required for that request

467268
tiff	png
the story around pdf a is a lot more complex than format conversions like tiff to png

467268
pdf	xmp
in both pdf a-1a and 1b metadata in xmp rdf format is mandatory

467276
user-roles	userid
anyone got an idea how to have the user-roles object saved with the userid as its primary key

467293
windows-xp	windows
i m running 20 vms at the moment and if any one gets seriously messed up they re used for testing i ve got clean base images of windows 2000 windows-xp vista and server 2003 at the ready so i can be back up and running in 20mins or less

467299
hash	md5
for example when generating session ids on a server why just not do something simple like apply an md5 hash to the concatenation of an appropriate subset of the following client machine ip address sequentially incremented counter fixed secret constant of your choice output from random number generator of your choice etc.

467325
silverlight	xbap
i wouldn t be so quick to dismiss xbap as silverlight for windows only

467325
.net	wcf
also as of .net 3.5 wcf does work in xbaps under partial trust

467329
distinct-values	duplicates
how do i query this table so that i get only distinct-values of a b c and if there are duplicates take the maximum of the corresponding set of n values

467332
click	mouse
instead of simulating the mouse messages necessary to click a button for instance eliminate the middle-man and simply call directly the function that the button-click event would have called

467333
windows-xp	windows
for example just tring to adhere to font recommendations in windows-xp you have to know the system default font should be tahoma verdana should be used for title bars in floating windows and trebuchet ms should be used in the title bar of windows....sigh...i assume its all different for vista -

467336
tablerow	layout
i m trying to add a row to a table and have that row slide into view however the slidedown function seems to be adding a display block style to the tablerow which messes up the layout

467342
average	min
other potentially useful aggregate-functions include min average and count

467345
post-increment	pre-increment
since either loop can easily be rewritten to use either a post-increment or a pre-increment i guess that the compiler will always use the more efficient versioning

467346
sql-server	oracle
i ve worked on projects that used this approach with table sizes stretching into the tens of millions of rows on sql-server oracle -- i can t vouch personally for others without issue

467353
debugging	exit
while you are debugging do you exit the program normally or do you use the ide to force debugging to stop kill the application

467384
arguments	default
if t is 0 in the specialization it will match the default arguments and the specialization is taken

467384
arguments	default
but really we instantiate a templates with the arguments because the last is a default argument

467384
arguments	default
the partial specialization matches when the third parameter matches the third argument which is zero by default and if the third and second arguments are the same because both are t

467394
processor	cpu
i m interested in creating software games for sony playstation 2 consoles since they contains powerful processor for graphics gpus floating-point calculations and general cpu

467402
hide	show
i have a datagridview form in my .net application and i d like to be able to show or hide additional columns based on a boolean value at run time

467402
hide	show
what s the best way to show hide these columns in code as opposed to in the forms designer

467418
double	int
the surprising thing is that a single matlab data type may match different java data types logical matches boolean byte short int long float and double in that order of precedence

467429
shell	bash
in particular you can run bin bash or whatever path it is to your shell

467432
firefox	opera
according to w3schools window.top is supported in ie since v4 firefox v1 and opera v9

467537
output	mode
i set the output to text mode and then sp_helptext sproc

467555
postgresql	oracle
i am not an oracle programmer postgresql but i do know that oracle is supposed to have one of if not the best metadata support

467575
git-repo	repo
having independent branches in a git-repo is similar to having independent projects in a subversion repo which is a common practice because of svn s overhead

467596
action-filter	controller
you could create an action-filter that implements onactionexecuting which fires before the controller action is invoked

467599
linux	osx
oftentimes hooking refers to win32 message hooking or the linux osx equivalents but more generically hooking is simply notifying another object window program etc that you want to be notified when a specified action happens

467603
show	next
click on a column header triggers javascript that makes the gridview sort and an icon showing that the column is sorted show up next to the column text similar to below

467616
document	element
that s because by placing the id class name on an element they can then use javascript to modify that element or hook in to the page document

467618
boolean	int
if you try parsing as in the first instance with an invalid int you ll get an exception-handling while in the tryparsing it returns a boolean letting you know whether the parsing succeeded or not

467621
exception-handling	try-catch
tryparse does not just try-catch internally - the whole point of it is that it is implemented without exception-handling so that it is fast

467629
boolean	int
oh and by the way now i look at your question again perhaps one of the reasons it isn t working is that the line will return a boolean rather than the int you want it to

467632
python	ruby
naturally there are a number of other ways to create a chain of hooks from writing directly to memory to using the metaprogramming facilities of languages like ruby or python

467653
any	set
i have my project set to any cpu and it shows in task manager without the 32 flag

467657
japplet	jwindow
swing is lightweight but even it has heavyweight components like jwindow jframe dialog and japplet

467678
methods	extend
these allow you to extend an existing type by adding methods

467696
virtualbox	vmware
it was developed with only various versions of windows in mind and from my experience there s always some sort of problem running any linux distro under it. i would recommend vmware as suggested above or alternatively virtualbox which has worked very well for me in the past it runs certain linux distros best though i can t remember which ones

467699
textbox	button
try creating a blank project and creating a form with one textbox one button set the properties and see what happens.

467705
swing	awt
i suppose in theory you could have some sort of framebuffer device and have swing draw directly to that but a as you noted swing is based on awt and awt does not work like that and b it would still be the os that implements the framebuffer device

467706
swing	swt
if you re worried about the performance or bloat of swing check out swt

467707
updating	updates
for updating the workingcopy ankhsvn does a recursive updates on the project roots in your workingcopies most likely the working copy root unless you changed it in file- subversion- change source control

467711
contains	any
i m interested in developing software for sony playstation 3 consoles which contains a multi-core cell processor targeting any ps3-compatible linux distribution

467711
kdevelop	cdt
c++ ide kdevelop eclipse cdt code blocks

467731
itextsharp	acrobat
the easiest way to do this is with a full version of adobe acrobat but you can also add fillable form fields using nothing but itextsharp

467731
itextsharp	itext
also remember that itextsharp or just itext is also useful for combining pdf documents or pages from different documents

467739
textmate	vim
i m getting back in touch with my inner g vim due to an unscheduled macbook mother board of a meltdown my emergency backup linux box won t run textmate

467739
display	width
by default with an 80-character width vim display this as

467741
boost-serialization	boost
boost-serialization library boost don t leave home without it

467749
command-line	cmd
command-line tools contains a complete list of all the platform builder command line cmd

467752
expression	evaluation
i d implement it by translating to a python expression as the input is parsing instead of building a tree of objects to evaluate unless you expect to be doing more operations on these things than evaluation

467754
kdevelop	cdt
as far as a proper ide the above utilities should integrate fine with about any ide kdevelop eclipse cdt code blocks so long as you can find syntax-highlighting files available for most popular ides

467754
ubuntu	debian
the cell sdk is available as well and could potentially provide better integration and packages are available for rhel 5.2 and fedora 9 should be able to use alien to pull these into debian ubuntu but not sure on that

467765
twitter	tweets
is there any framework that would allow me to integrate paypal with twitter such as to send a tweets once payment for an item has been recieved

467772
csv	tsv
i would be far more worried about a custom backup restore based on a fragile format like csv tsv failing

467772
parsing	comma
are you sure that all your quotes comma or tabs that are in your data would get escaped correctly and then parsing correctly by your restore tool

467776
udp	tcp
real streaming protocols such as rtsp are a lot more complex and usually use udp instead of tcp

467787
low-level	hardware
personally i d opt for c++ or c or maybe even d for the low-level hardware interface but then i d wrap that code up in a nice clean api and i d write all the user-facing gui stuff in c# with wpf and xaml

467789
versioning	upgrade
and even in the future if we do upgrade to .net i think most of the tests that i ve written should be helpful in validating the correct behavior and should be upgradable to a .net versioning too i guess

467789
basic	vb6
some basic googling send me to this tool call simplyvbunit but i can t find enough guides etc to get me started and yes i m not that proficient with vb6 either

startup	launch
i have no interest in creating 1 million objects i just want the app to launch as quickly as possible so what i m looking for is any information about di containers startup costs whether it be blog posts anecdotes or even something as simple as here s a way of making objectbuilder faster

467882
constructor	object
i m trying to decide whether it is better to use static-methods for loading saving object or use constructor instance methods instead

467890
constructor	object
however if the project object needs to have state then the constructor instance method should be used

467896
instances	private
however if you do this then the details of the data contains in project are no longer private and instead these details must be shared with the class which loads and saves the project instances

467927
alt	src
normally you have an image tage with the src as the source of the image and the alt as the alternative text

467927
alt	src
so that means the src has an image source and the alt also has an image source

467934
any	set
also if it s of any consequence i have already set up symbolic links to usr lib

467944

a methods i often use for this sort of problem is to iteratively add and subtract code until i can narrow it down to the one thing that caused the problem

468006
command-pattern	composite
actually i d be tempted to turn it into command-pattern along with composite

468015
datamapper	poeaa
write the relationship logic into the native datamapper which is what the examples tend to do in poeaa and then call the native datamapper function within the domain-object

468019
click	mouse
shows the full size image while the mouse button is click and held down

468029

468140
textbox	button
the only gui controls that these non-computer savvy users were able to get right away were textbox and button

468140
checkbox	button
one option if you have a checkbox would be to have to take action button on the screen with each having a implied value that you would have used a checkbox for

468140
checkbox	button
for example you could have a button labeled come straight home from work and stop at the grocery on the way home from work instead of a checkbox for the pick up milk option

468140
checkbox	button
by putting the checkbox values on the action button the user has to consider the option and make a conscious choice

468143
directory	folder
if you get the properties of a large directory in explorer the time it takes to give you the folder size is proportional to the number of files sub-directories it contains

468180
deep-copy	object
if you had a car class that had an object for each wheel and the body - a deep-copy would make a copy of the entire car and make copies of both the wheels and the body

468180
deep-copy	object
a deep-copy operation would only make sense if performed at the list level. a deep-copy of a node would copy the data that the node points to - but would not assign itself to be part of a list as a node should be unaware of the master list object

468183
firefox	opera
or if you want get firefox or opera go to any site say stackoverflow.com or w3schools.com view the source edit away and then apply the changes

468214
copy-constructor	deep-copy
one could of course deep-copy the whole list but this would be a quite unexpected behavior of a copy-constructor of a single node i think

468223
primitive	int
as you can see a type is an abstract term for not only definitions of classes but also struct and primitive data types like float int bool

468224
search-engine	seo

468239
boolean	int
type generally refers to the classification of primitive values - int strings arrays boolean null etc

468245
base-class	metaclass
that is you ll have a variables of the base-class metaclass type and it will hold a value of a derived class and you will call a constructor on that variables

468245
base-class	subclass
a subclass of the base-class will need to override the constructor to provide class-specific initialization

468245
constructor	object
next call the constructor on the instance passing the tapplication object as the owner

468245
constructor	object
third is the notion that it s unusual for an object to call a constructor on itself

468245
constructor	object
every time you call an inherited constructor you re calling a constructor on an object that already exists

468245
constructor	object
the inherited constructor is not allocating a new object

sqlcompare	redgate
we are currently using sqlcompare from redgate but i am curious to know if there are better tools on the market

468342
physx	glut
since you only have 32-bit physx you must compile all other code that will be linked into the executable main.o in your example in 32-bit mode by using the -m32 gcc flag and install 32-bit versions of all other libraries glut libgl libx11 libc etc.

468348
contains	any
note the code above will break if any of your columns contains a comma

here i believe update table name set field value ......

468451
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome come hand in hand as both working off a similar engine which makes them the next logical step for compatibility tests

468451
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is a logical choice because if you get it on safari it will work on google-chrome and it has a pretty strong start in browser stats for being so new

468488
xsd	xml
if you are working on sql2005 you have the possibility to create a table with strongly typed xml columns so that each value is validated against an xml schema collection an xsd

the migrate versioning is fully unit tested

468652
versioning	migrate
this solution is improving hugely the code quality of the migrate versioning as they understand how to architecture things in a way that makes testing easier

468655
decimal-point	numeric
this scripting was a basis for entering numeric value only however it needs to be adapted so it can take a decimal-point followed by only up to two decimal places

468656
contains	elements
because the compiler won t know the number of elements it contains it looses this information during the conversion pass another argument specifying this as well

468657
getter	setter
is this level of abstracting things so important that i shall spend time on writing 3-4-5 levels of getter setter

468946
triggers	insert
this is because i believe an on insert triggers would cause a bad slow down if a batch of over 5000+ insert statements is submitted

468954
contains	elements
the objects are pretty simple - a root object that contains enough information to construct the namespace along with a collection of other objects representing the elements type name etc

468981
constructor	object
your best bet is to add a string argument to the object constructor and give it a name when its created

468986
linux	unix
if you are on unix or linux your process would receive some termination signal which you can catch except sigkill and fflush in your signal handler

468986
sigaction	signals
for signals catching see man sigaction

468998
constructor	object
you can use the constructor property if your object has been created from a class from the docs if an object is an instance of a class the constructor property holds a reference to the class object

google-chrome	firefox
if you were designing a core business intranet app for a small business and wanted it to be as responsive-feeling as possible where the staff are indifferent to being stuck with a certain browser would you design for firefox google-chrome or test more widely than you need to just to avoid lock-in

469507
google-chrome	firefox
technically we re an ie shop here but i make sure all my apps function on at least ie and firefox and i m doing more testing in google-chrome as well

469516
space	input
all i am trying to achieve is to allow the user to enter multiple space separated words that respresent either the entirety or a prefix of the words they are searching on in any order - and drop noise words such as the from their input otherwise when they search for the castle they get a big list of items with the result they need somewhere in the middle of the list

is there an event-based way or do i need to spawn a thread to block until exit then delegate the event myself

470267
double	int
this one s an overflow but i think it illustrates the unreliability of isnumeric in general especially for int - for double it s much more reliable

470294
directory	folder
the gratuitous new names of directory unix folder mac windows etc

470306
.doc	xls
even better if you make the zipping intelligent and use no compression when you re zipping large already compressed files mp3 zip .docx xlsx jpg gif etc and using high compression when you have simple text files txt xml .doc xls etc as they will zip very quickly even with heavy compression

470595
button	popup
if you re looking for the behavior where when the user clicks attach file and the file browsing dialog automatically popup that can be done via javascript but doesn t work in firefox which has the security precaution of requiring the user to invoke the browse button directly rather than programmatically through script

470602
order	add
in order to match a whole paragraph you need to anchor the regex at both ends and add a final to consume the remaining characters

470664

default is a default-value for the parameter

470664
default-value	default
when a parameter of the function has a default-value the keyword default must be specified when the function is called to retrieve the default-value

470683
malloc	free
are decent implementations of malloc free garbage-collection fast enough that it s only a bottleneck in a few corner cases or would most performance-critical software benefit significantly from trying to keep the amount of memory allocations down or having a faster malloc free garbage-collection implementation

470692
perl	php
client-side scripting w javascript server-side scripting with php ruby python perl

in games i ve seen calls to malloc free consume as much as 15 of the cpu in poorly written products or with carefully written and optimized block allocators as little as 5

470721
virtual-memory	paging
the calls in modern operating systems have to go all the way down to the kernel so that the operating system is able to deal with virtual-memory paging mapping execution protection etc

470726
double	int
particularly the new int add and new double add

470726
put	get
i can omit the new but then i just get compiler warnings which amount to i think i m hiding this methods you need to rename it methods or put new on it

470806
debian	linux
i only have debian linux on hand so please don t offer windows or mac solutions

470811
constructor	object
you should also try to construct objects so that after the constructor has been called the object is in a valid state

470811
constructor	object
on the other hand you should try to avoid doing too much work in the constructor itself - this is where static factory methods tend to be nice as they can do significant work to grab all the data needed to construct the object then pass it on to a simple constructor to create a complete valid and potentially immutable object

470812
constructor	object
it really depends on the language because some languages cannot guarantee the state of the object until the constructor and all base constructors have finished executing

470816
constructor	object
a constructor creates an object

470835
arguments	default
notably the tricky areas are i decoupling magiciterator from containers somehow default templates arguments don t cut it and ii avoiding heap allocation

470875
contains	any
is it possible to run a selected on a table to quickly find out if any one or more of the fields contains a certain value

470876
configuration	environment
the configuration for each environment is different so i have a build that contains just the code and then a separate build for each environment that contains just the environment specific config files

470876
configuration	environment
the configuration file builds puts the files in the same location regardless of environment so the code can always load c myapp myconfiguration.xml which will contain the settings for that environment

470876
environment	building
most articles i read about this such as scott hanselman s involve different building for each environment but this won t work because the checksum value will be different

470883
required	checked
of course you would only rendering what you need by checked the paint eventargs in your control and renderinging the thumbnails that are in view and that required renderinging

470890

when a user logs in if they authentication with the main site that id is pulled and passed in to the forum login api to login the correct person

470930
value	field
it has a field called type which in the database is an integer value that designates which type of object this note belongs to 1 customer 2 sales lead etc

470930
value	field
so for example dataobjecttype.customer is the same as a value of 1 in the type field

470937
properties-file	jar
then put the properties-file in the same folder as the jar

470942
attributes	properties
this problem is related if not the same problem when i fix the invalidcast by commenting out needed functionality i will far less frequently but intermittently get this invalid attributes when the attributes properties is in fact there

470953
constructor	private
i would use a factory-pattern and make the constructor private protected and make a static newobject method

470971
managed-code	unmanaged
having had to do a couple of managed wrappers has taught me the value of exposing the absolute minimum unmanaged functionality even if it means you have to rewrite some things in managed-code

470996
numeric	digits
it sees a leading digits so expects to begin reading a numeric literal then barfs when it sees a letter

471048
json	xml
if this is the case i would suggest at least some server-side support which would return your data in correct order and properly structured for subtables in xml json whatever you use

471058
lgpl	gpl
there are lots of open source licenses out there gpl apache mit bsd mpl lgpl etc

471065

there s a statistics_info methods in dbi but unfortunately the only dbd i ve seen it implements in so far is dbd odbc

471195
python	perl
a simple python perl

471220
python	php
obviously by using pre-compiled code you can eliminate step 2 this applies python php and others

471224
integer	zero
a zero where i would expect a positive integer value

471256
contains	elements
if however your subsequence selection contains an elements of randomness to it then the subsequences would vary on sequential otherwise identical runs and the subsequences could be considered random

471259
bugzilla	trac
trac s issue tracking is little better than bugzilla s...i know a lot of folks love trac but i find it very inflexible

471279
emacs	vim
i want my application to be extendable in an emacs vim sort of way via scripts

471291
click	mouse
e.g. a custom action would respond to a pre-defined event say a mouse click a custom triggers would be faking a mouse click via scripting and a custom event would be a listener that s not defined by the language or isn t readily available

471291
onclick	onload
the browser usually handles the triggers of events -- either for browser events onload or user events onclick

471314
numerical	nan
nan is unordered so the numerical

471324
spaces	output
there is no need to recursively output the spaces one by one

471330
.when	ready
an object should be 100 ready for use .when it s constructed

471330
constructor	object
if you find that your constructor has too much code perhaps it s time to consider refactoring that object

471352
show	next
the presenter will be implemented as 1 step of many in a wizard on a form asp.net but that doesn t make any difference and the wizard will catch the nextstep event and show the next step in the wizard

471360
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

471360
object-reference	instances
--- system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

471360
object-reference	instances
--- system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

471367
value	field
what circumstances are appropriate to use nullable field and null value

471367
value	field
ok - i understand the semantic difference between and null as well as the performance-agnostic circumstances in which null is the appropriate field value

471398
directory	folder
it turns out that when validation is turned off typing in a directory name that ends in a will still change the folder being displayed but typing in a directory name that does not end in a will not

471402
value	field
i never use it to signify empty field when the emptyness has no meaning other than the absence of a value

471410
oracle	mysql
on some databases like oracle may be somethinkg on mysql is true

471424
installation	upgrade
configuring installers for new installation and upgrade

471434
callback	methods
how do you access an integer increment ncount++ in the main form from the methods of an asynchronous callback

471434
required	checked
i know that with methodss you have to checked if invoke is required then call begininvoke for the intended methods as a delegate as to avoid an illegal threading operation but how an you perform a simple operation such as ncount++ from another thread

471463
python	perl
i d like to reimplement a program that s currently in perl in python instead but the terminal ansi colors are key to its function

471471
contains	set
eeach package contains it s own bootstrapper manifest file where the prerequisites are set

471475
contains	any
the reason being is that oracle returns a generic parsing exception-handling if the query contains any invalid syntax such as a not operator without a following term etc. and the idea is to give the user some helpful feedback rather than a generic your query failed error message

471477
constructor	object
you are using a constructor to create an instance of a service class which is different from a normal class also here wcf is handling object marshaling

471478
constructor	object
note that the classes in the .net that behave similarly to your banana example where only certain values are appropriate to instantiate the object with don t use constructor but instead use static factory methods

471481
contains	set
set and multiset significant memory overhead per contains object

471481
key-value	key
use where you want to store key-value pairs and look up values by key quickly

471485
required	checked
my initial thought was some trickery with a stack but i quickly realized that would required users to uncheck back in the reverse order they checked items

471490
selected	checkbox
the following assumes that the class rowcheckbox has been applied to all of the checkbox but you could selected them however you want

471490
highlight	selected
it relies on the highlight class being defined to override the background-color for selected rows

471498
hashtable	set
you could modify the methods above so that you use a hashtable like structure and store the id of the row tr against its original colour so when it comes to unchecking the checkbox you could then lookup its original colour and set it accordingly.

471516
key-value	key
if you have a lot of key-value pairs and you want to sort them by key then a map is useful...but it will only hold one value per key

471516
key-value	key
it s not in the stl but it is in the tr1 update to the stl if you have a lot of key-value pairs that you re going to look up by key and you don t care about their order you might want to use a hash - which is tr1 unordered_map

471545
base-class	inherited
i wrote a framework which involved a base-class that everything had to inherited from

471571
time-complexity	quicksort
quicksort has worst case time-complexity of o n 2 but it is usually considered better than other sorting algorithms which have o n log n time-complexity in the worst case

471592
data-access	ado.net
this is a data-access technology built by the ado.net team

471618
versioning	upgrade
when versioning 2 of that code is released i want to be able to upgrade my customised versioning with all of the versioning 2 changes retaining my customisations

471622
order	add
that would certainly save having to add pas files to the library path in order to step through code

471634
perl	c++
worse is better can be seen in languages too for example the ideas behind perl python ruby php even c# or java or whatever language that isn t assembler or c c++ might fit here or not

471636
firefox	opera
i have a centered ul styled like a table ala cssplay that is having li elements added to it after page render and it seems to work beautifully in everything but firefox and opera

471636
firefox	opera
for whatever reason it seems like firefox 3.05 and opera 9.63 keep the ul at the initial draw width after the third li is added even though there is no width specified anywhere in the css

471651
bamboo	hudson
my suggestion would be to use a continuous-integration server like hudson or bamboo

471664
jquery	.post
i would use the jquery .post method

471668
mouseleave	mouseenter
the top div is hidden but slider in to partially cover the bottom div on mouseenter and then out again on mouseleave

471709
revision	updates
for the from revision selected the revision at which you exported your copy in this case revision 1 or the revision that you last updates your local copy to

471709
revision	updates
for the to revision selected the head or the latest updates you want to apply

471723
web-services	api
but if you have server-side code web-services or rest api s talking to your mysql db that server-side technology would need to work on linux

471725
wxpython	pyqt
you can write cross platform guis using a number of different frameworks like wxpython pyqt etc

471739
cobertura	emma
further a code coverage tool like cobertura or emma

471753
entity-framework	ado.net
if ado.net data services astoria adds a rest layer on top of microsoft s ado.net entity-framework is there an equivalent project that adds a rest layer on top of nhibernate

471754
stderr	stdout
also for reasons that i forgot i immediately fork again and then in that child re-open stdin stdout and stderr

471762
oracle	mysql
as another note at least in oracle i am not sure about in mysql the between functions returns items matching the end items also

471774
32-bit	64bit
if you are on a 64bit processor then 64bit ops are exactly as fast as 32-bit ones

471784
publishing	release
the other possibility is with java 7 just over the horizon they re waiting to publishing the new jvm spec until the new release

471786
restart	reload
if the server is being restart regularly between calls to the templates ensure the save class files setting is enabled in the administrator under caching to prevent the templates from being recompiled after each server reload

471790
checkbox	textbox
a big usability improvement is edit-in-place rather than a read-only grid have an arrays of appropriate controls for the fields textbox checkbox comb boxes etc. within your grid or instead of your grid

471790
value	field
pick two field and represent their value for each record by x and y coordinates used to locate an icon on the page

471792
push	pull
however both examples listed by you are using ajax to pull information not push it

471794
click	mouse
this is because the main thread has to print the lines before it can process any user-interface events button click mouse movements etc

471821
language-features	operators
part of this involved overuse of advanced language-features in c the ternary operators and the comma operators and writing in an obscure personal idiom for example replacing pointers- item with pointers .item everywhere that no-one else would ever be able to maintain

471872
variables	boolean
if you want to know really how ridiculous some of these managers get try this i had one manager bawl me out for declaring a variables as a type of boolean because he didn t feel the other programmers could handle it

471876
object-reference	instances
so now i can use pattern to redefine the current regex by assign a new object-reference to the holding variables instead of replacing the instances itself

471889
64bit	x86
for example when a .net application is running in 64bit systems the clr can either be loaded from c windows microsoft.net framework64 v2.0.50727 anycpu x64 compilation targets or from c windows microsoft.net framework v2.0.50727 x86 compilation target

471905
nsstring	nsdata
fyi the property list classes are nsdictionary nsarray nsstring nsdate nsdata and nsnumber

471915
push	pull
sorry if i have misunderstood you but i think you just want to do the standard pull and push

471917
selected	checkbox
click to selected the network dtc access checkbox

471920
nskeyedarchiver	nsarray
i found out one alternative before save i encode the root object nsarray object using nskeyedarchiver which ends with nsdata

471936
recurring-billing	payment-gateway
the payment-gateway we will be using is paymentexpress as it s one of the few supported gateways that has recurring-billing and doesn t have any special conditional for companies operating outside of the usa

471946
json	xml
converting xml to json using python

471946
json	xml

i m also trying to use django.utils.simplejson to convert the parsed xml document into json

471991
ncurses	sdl
some libraries attempt to provide portable keyboard input facilities such as sdl and ncurses

471994
rewrite	rule
you can also just rename pages.php to something else and updates the last rewrite rule as well to avoid the multiviews conflict

472004
compareto	equals
especially know the difference between equals hashcode and compareto and what it takes to implement them correctly

472015
alloca	malloc
is there a way to use the new keyword to allocate on the stack ala alloca instead of heap malloc

472028
pointers	stack
to allocate on stack either declare your object as a local variables by value or you can actually use alloca to obtain a pointers and then use the in-place new operator

472028
alloca	free
however while using alloca and in-place new ensures that the memory is free on return you give up automatic destructor calling

472036
firefox	opera
i m wondering if you might have found a bug in firefox and opera i guess where the page isn t reflowed properly when things are inserted via javascript

472039
ruby	php
i have a very large ruby on rails application that i would like to port to php 5.2 or maybe php 5.3 if 5.3 ever gets released

472039
ruby	php
we have a framework that is similar enough to rails - the real issue is conversion from ruby to php rather than rails to php

472039
ruby	php
and left the innards as ruby in php comments that would still make the job easier

472044
performance-testing	benchmarking
you can always run ngen see the above article or have a warm up period in your performance-testing scripting where it runs through the scenario a couple of times before actually benchmarking performance

472045
pointers	stack
you now have a pointers to an object allocated on stack

472059
value	field
by the time i leave the field onblur canada still is the selected value

472064
json	xml
jacob smullyan wrote a utility called pesterfish which uses effbot s elementtree to convert xml to json

472066
groovy	java
the really cool thing about groovy in particular is you can mix and match java and groovy in the same project and it all runs on the vm

472068
keyboard	mouse
you ll never be able to block users from refreshing either with their keyboard or pushing the refresh using their mouse

472079
application-pool	was
so far the only workaround we could come up with was to do an iisreset we also have application-pool recycling configured to happen once everyday in iis but it doesn t seem to help since the issue sometimes persists over several consecutive days

472113
object-reference	instances
whenever i am calling the server methods i am getting object-reference not set to an instances of an object

472133
malloc	free
i know i can manage my own memory by overriding new and delete to use malloc and free but if i did that i d rather the garbage collector not run at all

472146
32-bit	64bit
incrementing a 64bit variables on a 32-bit cpu probably won t be atomic unless you go out of your way to make it so

472146
interlocked	atomicity
read and write using atomicity interlocked functions example interlockedincrement on windows

472148
opensolaris	linux
getting a java development setup up and running is much easier on linux opensolaris

472148
linux	bsd
bsd is the preferred development platform for man system- hardware- and kernel-level coders because this parts a usually better documented than on linux and you have a official target while on linux distributions vary in patches etc

472153
key-value	key
you might want to look at and though - they still have key-value lookups but allow you to sort based on the key

472158
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
take a look to sorteddictionary and sortedlist

472158
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

472158
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

472162
command-line	findstr
regex support is included in most of the major programming languages in use today in editors and ide s in command-line tools like grep and findstr and lots of other places

472174
malloc	free
if you want to use malloc and free use std.c.stdlib

472180
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the issue you have is that objectoutputstream writes a header and objectinputstream reads that header

472180
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
solution always create the objectoutputstream first and fflush it before creating the objectinputstream

472185
selected	cells
will selected all cells in all rows except of the cells in the last column

472189
profiling	debugging
you d have to use the debugging profiling api

naudio is an open source .net audio library that can play back wav mp3 wma aac and aiff files making use of acm or media foundation codecs install on your computer for decompression purposes

472210
exception-handling	try-catch
a basic workaround is to just put the offending statement in a try-catch and discard the exception-handling

472222
linux	bsd
do keep in mind that while all development tools you can run on bsd are also available on linux the opposite is certainly not true especially since linux has gained more commercial traction

472227
any	set
alternatively i can use has_many_and_belongs_to to set up a many-many between the task model and the relationship model but i m not sure if this accurately describes a relationship that should only ever link two task models in any one relationship model although of course the tasks may belong to more than one relationship hence many-many

472258
for-loop	arrays
for arrays the c# compiler emits largely the same code for foreach as it would for an equivalent for-loop

472259
google-chrome	safari
everything was fine until i tested using google-chrome and safari and found it didn t work

472266
directory	folder
the folder you see in visual-studio are not normal folder directory

472266
updating	updates
for most tasks you should always updates on either the solution the project level or a single file as updating a subdirectory without the project referencing the files inside is an operation that can leave you with a broken project

472283
for-loop	loops
the conclusion of the article is that using for-loops is generally better and faster than the foreach loops

472295
report-designer	crystal-reports
one thing that helps with this sort of thing is not creating your reports connected to the database directly but first you create a data dictionary for crystal-reports this is done in the report-designer

toolstrip	winforms
i have a .net 2.0 winforms application with a toolstrip on my main form

472301
click	mouse
sometimes the toolstrip icons don t resppond to the first mouse click so i have to click the icon twice

472312
ironpython	cpython
are always integrated in cpython first and you have to wait until they are implemented in ironpython

472312
ironpython	cpython
extensions one of the strengths of python are the thousands of extensions which are all usable by cpython as you mentioned mathematical problems numpy might be a suitable fast package for you which might not run as expected under ironpython although ironclad

472312
wxpython	pyqt
especially under windows you have a native gui-toolkit with wxpython which also looks great under several other platforms and there are pyqt and a lot of other toolkits

472312
ironpython	cpython
platform independence if this is an issue cpython is ported to really a lot of platforms whereas ironpython can only be used on the major platforms recently read a developer was sad that he couldn t get mono to run under his aix

472312
ironpython	cpython
ironpython is a great work and if i had a special .net library i would have to use ironpython might be the choice but for general purpose problems people seem to suggest using the original cpython unless guido changes his mind

472315
ruby	php
in this case it s even worse because of the dissimilarities between php and ruby

472316
directory	folder
however if i add a file to that directory let s say an test.sqlite file in the app_data folder or say images created by some other program then these files do not appear in my solution explorer even if i click the refresh button

472321
selected	button
on the solution click the right mouse button and selected add existing item and pick the file from the solution root directory

472347
ubuntu	linux
our current automated build consists of 1 master box and 4 core-2-duo pizza boxed at around 2.5ghz with 3 gb memory each all running ubuntu linux

472348
getter	setter
the entire application is extremely simple it contains only code that initialize some of the supporting objects however this particular location type would initialize just fine but on first invocation of property getter setter it would throw the above exception-handling

472355
ironpython	cpython
we are also hosting the ironclad project to run cpython extensions under ironpython and that is going well we plan to release a beta of resolver one numpy soon

472355
emacs	vim
each of us has his editor of choice textpad emacs vim wing and everything works fine

472379
pthreads	fcntl
i have very little experience with windows apis but from what i ve heard they have good pthreads support so you should be able to use fcntl as long as they support pthreads.1-2001

472396
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql or javadb would all handle this elegantly at little or no cost

472427
constructor	object
value instanceof constructor is the same as constructor.prototype.isprototypeof value and both check the prototype -chain of value for occurences of a specific object

472443
value	field
i am absolutely certain that no single quote value will be passed these field are not editable at the application level only selectable hence my requirements are pretty mild in this aspect

472466
build-process	release
as part of our build-process we copy the private pdb files and the release exe dll files to a symbol server

472469
webserver	host
since svn is not a protocol natively supported by most web browsers you need a svn-to-web gateway that is the svn host must also run a webserver that in turn must access the svn repositories and make them available over http

472481
xsd	xml
no there isn t a design surface for linq to xml - i guess someone could do something with an xsd though that would be interesting

472486
constructor	object
if you re using a constructor this is simple enough as you will end up calling the constructor when the repository creates the object from data anyway

472497
message	alert
on the iphone when your phone is locked and screen off if a sms message comes in the screen turns on and an alert shows up

472515
tuples	set
you somehow set some function to a tuples

472526
entity-framework	data-access
it may be that entity-framework or some other data-access model nhibernate will work better for you

472531
subclass	nsobject
either as a subclass of nsmutabledictionary or nsobject

472559
directory	folder
it should be possible to just load it from the libs directory inside of our product s source folder

472569
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch finally can be reasonably simulated in vbs good article here here and there s an event called class_terminate you can watch and catch exception-handling globally in

472571
paint.net	photoshop
it s not the best tool for creating artwork anyway you can use paint.net and inkscape for that which are both free or photoshop and illustrator if you have the money

472571
actionscript	mxml
you don t want to use the flex framework so if you re using flexbuilder you ll want to do an actionscript project not an mxml project as someone else noted

472581
vbscript	jscript
there are two approaches you can code in jscript or vbscript which do have the construct or you can fudge it in your code

472596
continuum	hudson
i m aware of continuum and was recently told about hudson but i ve never used either

472634
push	pull
if the contents would need to be dynamically loaded you would then need to use ajax or similar to pull them from the server and push them into the second box

472636
any	set
outlook will load as many vevent entries as are in the file and no amount of changing uid sequence or dtstamp values changes this if you change any data and re-import it you just get a duplicates set of entries

472637
getter	setter
having said all this here are some old style methods for getting getter setter and properties i wrote a long time ago

472646
haskell	sml
this module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from the haskell and sml programming languages

472647
configuration	environment
if you don t run a local webserver already grab something like xampp to get a local webserver environment setup where you can play directly with mysql configuration and tools

472664
windows-server	windows
for example have a svn server containing your operating system of choice a linux server to do linux builds and a windows-server to do windows builds

472676
design-view	designer
deleting tables in the design-view of the dataset designer throws errors

472706
malloc	free
malloc is entirely unmanaged though the runtime libraries are free to use reserved areas of the managed heap to do this

472706
unmanaged	c++-cli
there is no clear distinction in source c++-cli as to whether code is managed or unmanaged

472706
native-code	unmanaged
on compilation some parts will be cil intermediate code others plain native-code the important thing is whether the variables used are managed or unmanaged

472748
smalltalk	forth
wikipedia mentions the term was used by forth programmers in the 80s fowler also spoke about the smalltalk community

472750
function-templates	non-type
if in the declaration of a function-templates with a non-type templates-parameter the non-type templates-parameter is used in an expression in the function parameter-list and if the corresponding templates-argument is deduced the templates-argument type shall match the type of the templates-parameter exactly except that a templates-argument deduced from an arrays bound may be of any integral type

472754
selenium	sahi
it is different than selenium sahi or watir in the way that it controls the browser natively not using javascript and is not affected by many issues other solutions have

472762
fixnum	hash
values in the params hash are always strings not fixnum s so my code compares strings

472813
scrollbar	popup
setting this value to auto will popup the scrollbar on an as needed basis

472833
value	field
i use to repopulate the test database and even though i do not rely on the value of identity field it was a bit of annoying to have different value when populating the database for the first time from scratch and after removing all data and populating again

472851
type-safety	generics
if ilist was implemented implicitly you d have two add methods directly accessible on the class add person item and add object item which will break type-safety provided by generics

472851
type-safety	generics
calling list.add foo will compile just fine as the add object overload will get chosen automatically and type-safety provided by generics is gone

472853
conditional	operators
the syntax you re referring to is often called the ternary conditional operators and it s semantically equal to an if else clause and it performs just the same

472860
conditional	operators
the conditional operators should be pretty familiar to most devs

472860
variables	boolean
this const variables is to avoid the issue of vs but since c# doesn t treat numbers as boolean it is very rare that this is an issue and it is more common in c# to see the clearer

472867
conditional	operators
i find that the ternary conditional operators

472869
jquery	.post
if you have jquery you can call a page method read through this .post be sure to check the comments i m not sure if he updated his article -

472870
button	popup
here s a bigger question though does it really make sense to popup an entire help topic even if short when a user just hovers over a menu item or button

472870
button	popup
the accepted practice here is to popup a toolhelp windows with a very short 1-4 words descriptor of the button open or open file

472884
ssas	olap
i m trying to let my users connect to olap cube in ssas 2005 using excel 2007 over the internet

472896
web-inf	maven
it would be easier to have it in my war in web-inf lib as i could get it using the maven repository that way

472907
digits	zero
uk telephone numbers vary in length from 7 digits to 10 digits not including the leading zero

472915
conditional	operators
the conditional operators sometimes referred to as the ternary operators but that s not technically correct see marc s comments isn t really an alternative control structure there s a few important difference

472915
conditional	operators
the conditional operators is an operators and provides a value it s used in an expression

472915
conditional	operators
the alternatives in a conditional operators must also be expression

472915
expression	evaluation
in general if you are evaluation alternative expression for the side-effects that is to do work instead of to return a value then using a conditional operator can be more confusing to maintainers than using an if-else structure

472915
conditional	operators
that s the kind of thing that especially when found in legacy code turns people off to the conditional operators altogether

472926
bazaar	git
it sounds to me like you could benefit from using a distributed vcs git mercurial bazaar etc.

472937
build-process	ant
when running msbuild.exe with ant s exec task errors in the .net code do not result in the build-process failing

472951
google-chrome	safari
can someone please help me out with printing the contents of an iframe via a javascript call in safari google-chrome

472951
google-chrome	safari
but i can t get anything to work in safari google-chrome

472952
msbuild	nant
i use nant to run some msbuild tasks

472961
selected	listbox
c# which event should i use to display data in a textbox when i selected an item in a listbox

472961
selected	textbox
i want to selected an item in a list box winforms and then a textbox near by show some data related to that item but i don t know which event to use

472973
filtering	sorting
i have two pages a report page where you can pick data do some filtering and sorting etc

472978
msbuild	nant
right now i m not using nant anymore i use msbuild instead

473003
listbox	textbox
assuming you have a form with a textbox and a listbox

473009
jar	war
you need to ensure that the cxf jar is in the web-inf lib directory of your war

473021
32-bit	16-bit
the key issue is that a glyph in a string takes 32-bit 16-bit for a character code but a byte only has 8 bits to spare

473023
boost	stl
generally i ve used boost object_pool or boost pool_alloc as an stl templates parameter

473031
ruby	php
it sounds like an expensive thing to consider both in time and money with no clear advantage -- unless of course you ve hit a wall with ruby where it simply can not do something php can do

473059
value	field
now i need to add the foreign key and i want to populate its value based on this other field that is already populate

473068
jar	war
my war depends on another project packed inside a jar i m working on

473068
jar	war
but when i save a file in this project the jar project jboss tools republish the compiled classes of the war project but does not re deploy the classes changed in the jar project. actually the war project is deployed exploded in the deploy directory but the jar project is deployed as a jar in the web-inf libs directory

473068
jar	war
i would like eclipse and jboss tools to republish the classes from the jar project like they do for the jsps and classes inside the war project..

473069
conditional	operators
this is a very fundamental xpath feature composing a number of conditional with the logical operators and or and the function not

473078
forwarding	port
setting up port forwarding is a pain in the behind

473078
forwarding	port
that makes the whole business of port forwarding a non-issue

473087
for-loop	loops
changing the for-loops to a foreach loops resulted in the following benchmark result

473097
python	java
languages used for production code inside google are limited to c++ java python and javascript

473098
selected	checkbox
keep the windows open showing the gdi handles of your process right-click on the columns choose selected columns and then check the gdi objects checkbox in the process memory tab

473100
factors	primes
i am working thru the project euler problems as well and in fact just finished #3 by id which is the search for the highest primes factors of a composite number the number in the

473100
factorization	primes
i looked at all of the info on primes the sieve techniques already mentioned here and on integer factorization on wikipedia and came up with a brute force trial division algorithm that i decided would do

473105
bmp	png
also as mfc relies on gdi and it doesn t support natively png at least on xp i didn t try on vista or win7 you will need to convert them to bmp anyway

473111
temporary	copy
for a while i thought that i could maybe solve the problem by making a temporary copy of the collection mark it clean and then go and serialization the copy

473112
configuration	environment
we ve set up tfsbuild to also generate transforms .mst files with the configuration for our different environment

473117
xcopy	cmd
how can i pass the path it might contain spaces to my script and use it with the xcopy cmd

473119
google-chrome	firefox
it looks fine in ie6 7 firefox but in google-chrome safari it has big problems with what looks like either margin padding or positioning

473122
for-loop	loops
2 try using a foreach loops instead of a for-loops - it may well be simpler

473145
msbuild	nant
that means that you can run msbuild nant or other scripting

473155
google-chrome	safari
will fix the display issue in webkit-based browsers safari and google-chrome for example

473163
primitive	int
it s kinda straight forward to save primitive like int and java.lang.string objects with the rms

473169
document	editing
it would need full wysiwyg editing to gain the support of other authors and the ability to produce a deliverable ideally a professional looking hard copy of each document is a must have requirement

473169
mediawiki	dokuwiki
aaron s suggestion to look at moinmoin led me into a long evaluation of wiki software which i eventually narrowed down to moinmoin dokuwiki and mediawiki

473231
constructor	object
you can add a parametrized constructor - should take an object that has the details specific to each view

473246
constructor	object
edit it s up to the programmer to handle object state in constructor and or manual initialization methods like init

473255
boolean	double
if your double can take on any value then i suggest you put a boolean next to it assigned to false initially and test set that one when you want to do your calculation

473285
local-variables	function-call
in fact it may actually be safer since the parameters immediately go out of scope after the function-calls return and there is no need to create local-variables for value just to pass them to the next function-call

473298
listbox	textbox
in the below code the listbox gets filled with the names of the colors from the xml file but those names strangely do not appear in the textbox

473300
background-image	width
you also need to set a width on the selected li - a background-image won t escape even with overflow visible

473308
display	width
notice that a consequence of setting display block is that you have to fix the width of columns.

473321
directory	folder
don t forget that in vista they ve also added a little more security on the program files folder itself so that rogue programs can t mess up other programs in the same general directory area

473333
managed-code	unmanaged
does malloc allocate an unmanaged memory even though it s used in managed-code

473338
duplicates	contains
i ve checked using some python code that the file contains no duplicates but when i execute the query i get this error message from sql-server

473367
for-loop	loops
i is check to be in range three time in the loops once in the for and once each for the two ca i s which makes a for-loops slower than foreach

473367
spaces	output
however since here we must treat ca 0 as a special case to prevent a leading spaces on the output we can t triggers that optimization

473377
managed-code	unmanaged
does malloc allocate an unmanaged memory even though it s used in managed-code

473390
strong-typing	types
the disadvantage with a generalized table is losing the strong-typing which i ve usually solved by adding a types table componenttypes for the generic component table

473409
margins	padding
have you reset your margins and padding

473415
order	add
in order to add something to a dictionary you need a key value pair

473437
order	add
to sort you need to add an order by in the last selected

473456
document	element
the legend element has to stay nested within the fieldset element of course for the x html to remain valid but if we absolutely positioning it it will be removed from the flow of the document and treated by elements outside of it â including its parent â as if it didn t exist

473463
if-statement	arrays
i am currently trying to validate a form server side the way it works is all the data is put into and arrays with the form field as the key and and the field data as the value however i need to check that all the keys have a value associated with other wise i want the submittion to stop and the user having to edit there details and then re-submit is there a quick check i can run rather that break the arrays apart and check that or check before it is put in the arrays with a switch or losts of if-statement

473503
instances	self
if you are not going to return self from an init methods for instances it is a factory or something odd like that you should remember to release self

473519
.when	ready
run .when the dom is ready

473520
show	next
problem is when i do have an error added to tempdata it show up properly on the first request but also show up again on the next request as well - which is obviously very confusing and not a desired behavior

473522
export	csv
the client needs to be able to enter the data in excel export them as csv and upload them to the database

473522
difference	count
or acme company and acme comp. should also have a small difference index even though the character count is different

473528
submission	contact
for instances you may have a contact field that contains a phone-number entry option that isn t mandated and rejecting the submission for that reason would be problematic

473531
sniffing	packets
it might be easier to diagnose if i could view the soap request .net has wrapped but i cant work out how to do this without sniffing the packets

473532
temporary	copy
when copying files always copy to a temporary filename and rename the file when you are done writing

473544
ip-address	hostname
the hostname for this ip-address or if the operation is not allowed by the security check the textual representation of the ip-address

473546
32-bit	64bit
i m migrating my development workstation from 32-bit vista to 64bit vista

473554
metaphone	soundex
metaphone similar to soundex and possibly more effective for you

473555
margins	padding
does my custom control already implement margins and padding shrink the border according to the padding set on the custom control or do can i decide myself where margins and padding are applied set the margins and padding properties on the border element to etc

473557
malloc	free
the gc can be removed and replaced with a simple wrapper around malloc free

473568
puts	gets
so i have a little wpf xaml that gets the titles of my rss feed and puts them in a listbox

473575
attributes	properties
so it seems that using the dependency attributes in unity only works for public properties

473605
text-align	display
rather than setting the to display table leave it as display block the default and give it text-align center

473616
order	join
you can use both inner and outer join in the same query but their order is important

473625
32-bit	64bit
i had much trouble with adding 3rd party 32-bit isapi handler to iis on 64bit w2k3 server php i had to make iis run in 32-bit compatibility mode

473628
javascript	dom
i know for internal resources such as internal javascript or css the loading order is from top of the page to the bottom unless in ie use the deferred script as here says getting notified when the page dom has loaded but before window.onload

473631
32-bit	64bit
generally your biggest problem will be the wow64 emulation layer - which means that 32-bit processes and 64bit processes see different versions of the same resources registry keys system folders and so on. in .net there s an enumeration system.environment.specialfolder which will give you safely abstracted access to program files application data and other potentially risky system folders

473631
32-bit	64bit
you ll also need to force iis to run in 32-bit compatibility mode it can t run 64bit and 32-bit web apps simultaneously - instructions at

473631
32-bit	x86
there s nothing insurmountable though - i m successfully compiling com-visible .net assemblies on vista x64 setting the compiler to target x86 cpus and then deploying them alongside asp.net and legacy asp code running 32-bit com objects on a 32-bit server and it s all working very well

473635
postback	ajax
if your report is using ajax and partial page postback then you won t get the viewstate on the page anyway

473697
methods	extend
i d suggest that you may want to extend the authorizeattribute and add your ip address restrictions on it so that you can simply decorate any methods or controllers that need this protection

473701
environment	building
as necessary to ensure that you can recreate an old release building environment if needed

473715
instance-variables	local-variables
other people put the local-variabless in an instance-variables by passing it to function and then think that nullifying the local-variables somehow eliminates the variables which is of course untrue

473729
3d-engine	rendering
i would suggest using some sort of polygon model in memory to implement them the worlds use a file to store them and rendering them using some sort of 3d-engine

473737
constructor	object
if an exception is thrown in an object constructor the destructor will not run

473740
implements	extends
each class would implements or probably inherited from a user class instead the user-interface for the common functionality and then extends with their specific functionality

473748
xbox360	xbox
there will be several difference between them but one of those difference will be that the xbox 360 platform will defined a conditional symbols xbox360 which you can use in your source code with a following idiom

473748
difference	factors
you could of course factors out these difference using a strategy design pattern and control via ioc which one gets instantiated but the conditional compilation offers at least three major advantages

473782
function-call	inline
note the answers almost entirely deal with the ability to inline functions a manual or compiler optimization that replaces a function-call site with the body of the callee. if you are interested in anonymous a.k.a

473785
any	set
under ubuntu you need to set the java compiler javac to use sun s jdk instead of any other alternative

473804
spring-annotations	spring
on the plus side you can probably really easily convert to spring-annotations which is probably the reason the original author of your code didn t do the correct spring

473806
command-line	cmd
1 active - the developer would send some type of cmd to the program either via a specially crafted cmd-line or input during execution

473839
linux	unix
cut paste on linux or unix no problem - the selection box wraps around nicely so you can cut multi-line expressions

473866
foundation	cocoa
the original code for the cocoa frameworks came from the nextstep libraries foundation and appkit those names are still used by apple s cocoa frameworks and the nextstep engineers chose to prefix their symbols with ns

473879
.when	ready
feel free to try this it s very attractive and seems slick but be ready to abandon it .when it doesn t meet some need such as two menu items with the exact same name in different sub-menus

473887
worksheet	excel
i m using automation to get_text from an excel worksheet

473888
csv	xml
this would probably be easiest done by storing a query in a database field that you run and then an export format xml csv excel that you need to support

473910
log4net	nlog
but maybe you should take a short less painful route and use any of the great loggers available log4net nlog system.trace or even spring.commonlogging

473915
boost	stl
should i make my own framework by wrapping up the stl classes and or boost libraries so that if i need to change the implementation of the string vectors lists etc

473917
restart	reload
there is a known issue in tomcat where restart a deployed application with many jsps causes permgen issues because tomcat recompiles and reload all these classes again

473921
flv	mp3
i extract the audio from a bunch of flv files as an mp3

473930
authentication	login
i ve been told integrated authentication is a little more secure as it doesn t pass sql login information across the network

473931
virtual-machine	vmware
whatever tools you use house them in a virtual-machine ie. vmware

473974
boost	stl
as long as you re using standard collection classes an algorihtmns such as stl boost it shouldn t be very hard to plug in a new allocator later on in the cycle to fix the portions of your code base that do need to be fixed

473986
sql-server	oracle
i did this in oracle but i expect you would have a similar result in sql-server

473986
expression	evaluation
it can also apply in an and expression -- if the first condition is false there is no point in evaluation the second condition since the whole expression cannot possibly be true

473998
perl	ruby
i am looking for a way to do this automatically and possibly use this as an opportunity to learn a new language i know minimal perl and ruby which seem like they may work for this task

473998
perl	ruby
would perl or ruby be a good choice for this task

474021
difference	factors
another possible factors in this myth is that it can make a difference to null out a local variables if you are done with it before the end of the methods

474028
contains	lookup
i can envision some control tables that contains the searchable fields their types associated lookup etc

474031
common-lisp	scheme
the scheme standard requires that implementations be able to do this optimization while the common-lisp standard leaves it up to the implementation

474040
insertion-sort	mergesort
however this could be fixed quite easily i use insertion-sort for small subsets 20 strings â instead of mergesort as suggested by the random hacker

474043
unsigned	integer
you can use an unsigned char to read the float byte by byte into the integer arrays

474047
attributes	properties
in the configsectionhandler class i am using attributes on the properties to validate the settings like this

474050
entity-framework	ado.net
i ve run into a snag with a ado.net entity-framework model and a ado.net data service that is making it available

474071
font-size	width
as an example sets the font-size to 8pt linestyles of all new lines to all be solid and their width 0.3pt and the xtick points to be 1 3 5 7 9

474081
abstract-class	base-class
if you have access to the base-class code and the functionality you re trying to implement is logically part of the inheritance heirarchy then you should put it in the abstract-class

474085
methods	extend
extension methods aren t a replacement for inheritance they re a technique to extend the functionality of a class using typically it s already-visible interface

474089
put	get
similarly if you execute a sql statement with an invalid variables name sql plus will get the column and line position and put a under the offending character

474093
ruby	php
try looking at cakephp symfony or qcodo in php or ruby on rails django if you are not bothered about using php

474103
reflection	runtime
i m looking for a simple clean and memory-efficient way to create and apply a reflection effect you know the one popularized by the famed iphone user-interface to the bitmap images i ve loaded into a flex app at runtime

474108
methods	extend
base classes should contain all base functionality extension methods should obviously extend the base functionality

474108
implements	extends
the only exception-handling to this that i ve seen is if you have multiple type that have different class hierachies like winform controls you can make a subclass of each that all implements and interface and then extends that interface thereby giving base functionality to a grouping of different controls without extendsing everything like control or object

474117
versioning	upgrade
sandribbon best of all when you buy it upgrade versioning are free and the author constantly updates improves fixes a new release almost weekly and you can contact him directly very smart guy and will accept any feedback

474117
windows-applications	silverlight
he makes a version for web pages silverlight and windows-applications with live demos available

474136
debugging	trace
then you can compile with debugging dcu s and trace in and see what it is crashing on

474140
time-complexity	radix-sort
radix-sort has time-complexity o n for fixed-length inputs but quicksort is more often used despite the worse asympotic runtime because the per-element overhead on radix-sort is typically much higher

474142
sequences	unique
i ve tried wrapping the associated pairs of error other tags in an xsd sequences but that doesn t do the trick because i m still effectively breaking the unique particle attribution rule

474153
webforms	asp.net
for example in asp.net webforms the viewstate postback would just let us have the frobnozzle grid fire off events without messing up the rest of the page

474164
difference	count
the difference won t be much in small cases but could be significant for larger count

474192
google-chrome	firefox
the issue i m having is that both ie and firefox are making 2-3 lines worth of cities while google-chrome keeps it in a nice horizontal line

474213
button	popup
when the more info windows pops up click on the popup button and choose frameworks

474215
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
i would try odp.net instead of system.data.oracleclient

474216
scheme	let
for simplicity s sake let s assume that this is a large table 100 rows and that the color scheme is alternating odd even rows

474224
datagridview	listview
either with a cheap control or the existing datagridview or listview

474231
any	set
if you cannot do any server-side processing i would recommend having the javascript set the class tags for each row rather than manipulating the styles directly

474251
packaging	building
building packaging and deploying everything each time keeps scripting and processes simple and repeatable

474270
space	input
checking if isn t quite enough because i want to avoid any blank whitespace input like say a few space characters

474275
expression	evaluation
if parsing fails for a given expression due to a macros for its syntax not being available the compiler halts evaluation of the function block and generates the code it already has with a stub where the unknown expression is

474275
tokenize	parsing
however this wouldn t affect many cases grouping operators like and still need to be paired requirement of my tokenize list parsing and top-level syntax like classes and functions wouldn t be affected since their runtime is really load time where the syntax is evaluated and their objects are generated

474277
e-commerce	product
however i have existing data that i need to load into the application like i said it s an e-commerce app and we have the product data

474293
put	get
in general put as little in common as you can get away with

474303
installation	environment
on windows it looks like all of the installation are recorded in the hkey_local_machine software javasoft java runtime environment registry key

474316
data-structures	hashmap
hashtables hashmap are one of the most if not the most useful of data-structures in existence

474357
callback	methods
callback basically work by passing a methods by parameter to your class that is changing the arrays

474365
getter	setter
if with properties you mean javabean properties represented bay a getter and or a setter methods then you can use a dynamic proxy to intercept the set methods

474377
put	get
i wanted to create a powershell scripting for a sharepoint upgrade so i put 4 or 5 books in my library and had plenty of info to get me started

474381
driver	kernel
while i m no guru on windows i believe that in order for you to access the usb stack directly you would have to write your own device driver and plug load it in the kernel

474389
.net	wcf
assuming you have control over the protocol being used you could go for a higher level of abstraction like .net s remoting or wcf

474409
any	set
when set to false any transparent colors are merged with black

474497
communication	messages
i understand the lack of state and mutability makes it impossible for multiple threads to alter the same data but kevin said if i understood correctly all communication takes place through messages and the mesages are processed synchronous again avoiding concurrency issues

474535
compareto	equals
the equals methods is now consistent with the compareto methods

474545
webforms	asp.net
you can use the same routing mechanism that asp.net mvc uses inside of an asp.net webforms application

474546
any	set
set iis up to process any request with asp.net and add an entry to global.ashx

474549
updatepanel	gridview
i have a user control that has a gridview there is an updatepanel in the uc

474551
subtract	add
you ll probably also want methods to add subtract etc. and maybe some way to get the representation in various string formats

474552
subtract	add
in constrast with some other comments about adding methods to add subtract etc...since you didn t mention needing them i m assuming you don t

474558
updatepanel	gridview
if so try to put the gridview in an updatepanel so that the event is sent to the server without actually reloading the whole page

474576
tostring	equals
implements the equals tostring and hashcode methods

474579
double	int
implement similar factory methods for converting from int double etc

474579
multiplication	addition
implements addition multiplication etc

474579
double	int
basically take a look at the api for other value classes like double int and do what they do

474580
compareto	equals
think about whether you want 1 2 and 2 4 to be considered the same or not - this has implications for the equals hashcode and compareto methods

474593
bazaar	git
some python core developers have recently begun putting together a document which illustrates various work flows that compare and contrast working with hg bazaar git and svn

474647
double-quotes	single-quotes
the main problem is that the double-quotes around the ldap query need to be doubled single-quotes

474689
base-class	inherited
assuming that this is correct you can either use inheritedance to inherited from a base-class frameworkobject or you can implement a common interface iframeworkobject

474689
base-class	inherited
i prefer the marker interface because class inherited is not something that is trivial from the perspective of the framework refactoring life cycle and it can tend to create kludged code due to base-class bloat as features are added that some but not all derived classes need

474713
mbunit	nunit
for testing however i would recommend going with a test framework like nunit or mbunit instead of writing your own in a console application

474717
crypt	md5
depending on your system you re either looking for crypt or md5

474717
crypt	hash
traditionally unix uses des-encrypted passwords thats the crypt function with a 2-character salt two random characters from the set a-za-z0-9. which is prepended to the hash to perturb the algorithm

474730
hash	md5
also i should note that the md5 version is not a simple md5 sum operation it also uses a salt value to make hash not-precalculatable

474733
append	input
the output file always contains an exact copy of the input file but then has the text mputernam2 append to the end

474739
data-members	constructor
your classes that use store should receive a store instance in the constructor or have a store property data-members that can be set and they can all receive the same instance

474748
fwrite	fread
you re actually mixing two types of io fread which is paired with fwrite and printf which is paired with fscanf

474760
compareto	equals
by making the class immutable as suggested you can also take advantage of the double to perform the equals and hashcode and compareto operations

474762
linux	unix
the password-hashing used on unix linux and other unix-like posix operating systems varies a lot

474763
subroutine	scoping
is there any way to get at the data scoping in this way for use in the patched subroutine

474768
compareto	equals
this might be one of the few cases though where you don t want compareto and equalss to be consistent since fractions reducable to each other are not necessarily equals

474782
design-time	designer
however during design-time the wpf designer can t see these resources complains they were not found and demands the errors must be fixed before reloading the designer

474833
put	get
a couple of days ago i took the code an put it on my eee pc with linux just to see if i could get it to build

474835
arrays	loops
i dynamically declare an arrays of pointers to pointers these are what get pushed because i assume priority_queue stores by reference so if i just put a pointer declared in the loops into the queue that pointer goes out of scope

474855
standard-library	boost
ace tends to be more classic oo while boost tends to draw from the design of the c++ standard-library

474894
latex	tex
should i use docbook or is it better to stick with tex latex

474896
constructor	object
is an object constructor called when new arrays is being created

474896
constructor	object
we would like to use this fact to instrumentation object constructor with some extra bytecode which checks length of arrays being constructed

474903
localization	translation
in the latter case there s nothing to translation and therefore no need to worry about localization

474956
value	field
numbers and dates are hard to have a value that means i don t have a value for this field. if you make the mistake of storing numbers or dates in varchar field then putting an empty string instead of a null could result in queries that don

474976
latex	tex
well tex latex in the texlive cd dvd bundle in the xetex incarnation is certainly able to deal with arabic see these examples

474976
apache-fop	docbook
i m not sure whether all the docbook utilities like the editors and things like apache-fop are up to this

474984
checkbox	button
everything works fine but when the user clicks the save button on the form which is within the updatepanel suddenly the onclick event of the checkbox stops firing

475012
contains	any
actually is refered to with a server path contains content in the url just do view source for any so page and you ll see this

475012
put	get
an alternative is to put an images directory in the root but then you get images at the same level as controllers and views which is pretty horrible

475024
document	editing
this document will get read into a domain model i then want to allow editing

475026
crypt	hash
also instead of using crypt you may prefer hash because this allows you to keep the string setting for the hash algorithm elsewhere

475028
attributes	properties
an easy way to change functionality for a particular user is to encapsulate each user s available actions read functions or methods and their attributes or properties within a class to represent the specific user

475037
deployment-descriptor	web.xml
but the web-inf web.xml deployment-descriptor in the foo.war file does not include a so tomcat wait until the first request

475041
python	ruby
currently if you feed it much more python code than ruby code it s likely to say that this code

475041
python	ruby
is python code although it really is ruby

475041
python	ruby
so if it has seen 1000x def in python and 100x def in ruby then it may still say python even though puts and end is ruby-specific

475066
value	field
as a good design you should always limit the size of the field to a realistic value

475068
value	field
murphy s law states that if you allow 1000 characters someone will eventually store 1000 characters in the column or at least a value large enough to cause errors in one or more application no one checked to see whether every application s employee name field could display 1000 characters

475074
mime	rfc
this a versioning of b64 encoding that i have seen in some viruses and other things that take advantage of some mail readers desire to parsing mime at all costs versus ones that go strictly by the book or rather rfc

475076
nlb	iis
my companys uses microsoft nlb to load balance traffic between our iis servers

475090
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby on ruby-on-rails django or asp.net mvc

475108
radix-sort	in-place
it looks like you ve solved the problem but for the record it appears that one version of a workable in-place radix-sort is the american flag sort

475132
solaris	unix
a nix operating system unix solaris linux macos cygwin and it s classic set of command line utilities

475149
contains	any
i ve got a pretty simple site around 8 pages with only one way page contains any significant codebehind and i d like to try learning asp.net-mvc using it as the test

475149
asp.net-mvc	webforms
what s it gonna take to get my webforms app into the asp.net-mvc model

475150
associations	model
i m trying to define a 1 1 associations between two entities one maps to a table and the other to a view - using definedquery in an entity-framework model

475154
seam	jsf
to do this work through the seam manual and refactor your code for each seam feature that simplifies the jsf approach

475154
seam	jsf
make your jsf action listener classes into seam components add one annotation

475154
persistence	hibernate
inject a seam managed persistence context instead of your existing hibernate session

475155
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this is one of the things that differentiates asp.net-mvc from webforms

475158
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you ll find that asp.net-mvc is much different than webforms

475178
children	nodes
my problem is that i want to order the grouping of categories in the order listed above parents of 33 first children of 33 second and parents of the root nodes last

475199
32-bit	64bit
first ctime is now in the atl namespace as you ve found but also ctime in vs2005 uses __time64_t internally which is 64bit not 32-bit and that isn t changed by defining _use_32bit_time_t

475218
children	nodes
i have a data model with its own complex set of nodes children properties etc

475223
interpreter	lexer
now obviously the interpreter also has the same lexer and parsing as the compiler

475223
pointers	stack
kind of like having an instruction pointers pointing to the current node in the tree and the execution is one big tree traversal plus the memory-management for the call stack and if so how does it do it

475223
virtual-machine	vmware
to be clear about my level of ignorance to me a virtual-machine is vmware i have no idea how the concept of vm applies to programming languages executing programs

475224
subclassing	inherited
if the operation will need to be overridden by a subclassing for some reason then of course it must be an instances methods in which case you ll need to think about all the factors that go into designing a class for inherited

475241
perl	php
yet people call javac a compiler so the informal definition of a compiler is something that must be done to source code as a separate step whereas interpreters have no build step eg php perl

475246
cryptography	security
if you re worried about them learning your security cryptography algorithm the same applies

475263
default-value	return-value
the default-value for getid is ultimately the return-value of the getname unless was used previously

475266
updating	updates
updating the view form the model requires sending a message if you don t want the model to know about your gui messaging the best you can do is register a callback a void pointers to a function from the tree controllers - and call this to do an updates

475273
expression	evaluation
if you don t convert to bool php will have to convert to bool anyways when evaluation the expression in the if-statement

475286
execute	prepare
summary the difference really comes down to prepare the code for later execution or execute the code right now

475292
order	add
in order to have an answer not biased towards smaller numbers or any other bias you would ideally generate all possible sets of numbers that add up to n

475301
any	set
ignoring the pros and cons of automatically generating tests that s a discussion for another day does anyone have any recommendations for a tool that would analyse the source and generate a set of tests to exercise that code

475302
32-bit	64bit
i would run my python scripting on my 32-bit laptop and have it communicate with a 6000 64bit server running postgresql

475311
header-only	boost
boost has a lot of header-only template-based shenanigans that are beautiful to work with if you can appreciate it

475336
elementtree	lxml
one possibility would be to use objectify or elementtree from the lxml module

475336
elementtree	xml.etree
an older version elementtree is also available in the python xml.etree module as well

475336
json	xml
either of these will get your xml converted to python objects which you can then use simplejson to serialize the object to json

475355
windows-xp	windows
platform .net 1.0 vb.net windows forms mdi application running on windows-xp

475388
globalization	localization
it is especially useful if you care about localization globalization in your application

475402
cargo	maven
i m using the maven cargo plugin to startup a jetty web container for running some integration tests in a separate project module

475402
cargo	maven
the web app works fine when run in an installed tomcat container or standalone jetty run through maven on the command line so i think the problem must be down to something to do with how cargo embeds jetty and then how jetty compiles the app

475411
contains	elements
no you do not need to specify the culture unless your string contains culture specific elements such as decimal separators currency etc. which have to be rendered depending on the culture

475426
background-image	transparency
about the only way i can think that might work to alter an image via css is to have src a transparency image and alter background-image

475429
multiplication	addition
this class include all of the basic things you expect to be able to do with numbers addition multiplication etc. as well as some complex classes like adrian has mentioned regular expression finite automata context-free grammars pushdown automata

475444
union-all	union
your three queries have mainly non-overlapping criteria so i suspect it s best to leave them as essentially separate queries but combine them using union or union-all

475446
constructor	object
in the constructor of each of the form object perhaps throwing a custom exception which can be caught and appropriately handled

475446
constructor	object
from the constructor of an extension of zend_form from which all your custom form object are extended probably the best method as it helps reduce code duplication

475452
asp.net-mvc	webforms
as you will surely discover the differences between webforms and asp.net-mvc are quite big

475459
push	pull
pull instead of push you ll use a threadpool thread when there s something happening instead of always having one active

475460
linux	osx
postgis and postgresql are easy to install on windows osx linux

475461
python	perl
some perl python read the entire description internally convert it to a simpler form and then act on that

475483
postdata	request
get and post are just request methods carrying all sorts of information including in the case of a post request a section known as postdata

475483
postdata	request
so while getpost gets the data from the postdata section of a post request getquery retrieves data from the query string of either a get or post request as well as other http request methods

475537
contains	lookup
when the wcf service returns a business object one of the properties contains the entire row out of the lookup table instead of just the foreign key so in the user-interface i can display things like the description from the lookup table without making another call to the service

475541
testdriven.net	xunit.net
hkey_local_machine software mutantdesign testdriven.net testrunners xunit.net 4

475541
testdriven.net	xunit.net
anyway i exported the the the xunit.net registry key from hkey_local_machine software wow6432node mutantdesign testdriven.net testrunners xunit.net and edited it removing the wow6432node and then imported it

475601
dlopen	dlsym
after you find a symbols you can use dlopen and dlsym to load it

475606
triggers	insert
however prior to instead of triggers i recall writing on insert triggers that would merrily update the just inserted rows

475620
subtract	add
second rather than comparing the string literals add subtract and such try to use constants final variables or enum s

475622
if-statement	loops
it doesn t save you much typing - though you could use for loops and the like to populate the mappings if there s some sort of logic to it - but it s a hell of a lot more readable than 6 pages of if-statement i d probably region off or partial class loading the mappings

475626
.doc	xls
with .document-management i mean the ability to store a set of files minimally .doc xls and pdf as a .document

475663
directory	folder
much of the bin directory is required but you can stripes out plugins and folder for things you don t need such as visual-studio support resharper extensions autocad integration etc

475663
teamcity	msbuild
the easiest way to get this right is to perform a base-bones custom install of just the few gallio components you really need such as msbuild and teamcity bits

475673
png	gif
use a gif or png - both support transparent pixels

475675
display	height
it should fit into the height of your display

475676
configuration	environment
the basic install gives you a simple environment with almost endless amounts of configuration for meta-data document grouping and various security options

475691
malloc	free
and yeah your biggest risk is that an initialized buffer is free d without using delete and a subsequent malloc happens to reuse that memory block

475695
g++	gcc
with gcc g++ the situation is a lot better since most of the standard has been implemented there already the standard committee doesn t like adopting features that haven t been implemented and tested in a real compiler and a gcc fork is often used for that

475712
.doc	xls
this indexes files on your network .doc xls pdf etc to make the text in them searchable like google

475720
xsd	xml
i have positive experience with tiny xmlbuddy plugin for editing xml documents in eclipse plain and xsd dtd based

475725
selected	checkbox
so suppose in my checkbox i selected objectnames obja and objb

475733
put	get
it could be that is faster to get the post in a blog by the id than by the slug so put the id for the sql query and the slug for the search engines seo

475762
getter	setter
unnecessary overhead comments that point out the obvious deeply nested-classes superfluous getter and setter for private nested-class variabless and unusually long function variables names can all create syntactic noise within related functions that will ultimately increase their length

475762
display	height
your massive developer-grade display isn t big enough to display it actually displays of today are big enough that a function that is anywhere close to its height is probably way too long

475768
disposable	dispose
generally speaking you should always dispose of disposable resources

475776
put	get
the code is here and if you try to run it you will see that it will some times not be able to get as many workitems as it did put in the list.

475776
interlocked	lockless
edit i have got a lockless list working it was faster than using the lock obj statment but i have a lock object that uses interlocked that was still outpreforming the lockless list im going to try to make a lockless arraylist and se if i get the same results there when im done ill upload the result here

475787
linux	unix
is anyone aware of an alternative yacc-compatible system preferably open source that provides the same support notation can differ - functionality can t running on unix or linux machines preferably available in source format

475801
any	set
so is there any way to set the default real type to be double precision namely 8 bytes wide in g77

475803
value	field
the parameter has the default-value set to from query and the dataset and value field are set accordingly

475804
.when	ready
if not i m either going to have to go the xhtml route and start sticking html elements in my svg ouch or just come back again in ten years .when svg 1.2 is ready

475811
textbox	button
in contrast i believe in winforms every control button textbox has its own hwnd

475818
ubuntu	debian
the debian ubuntu version relocates some jars around and eclipse expects the pure version and jar locations

475825
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
the comparision seems to be case-insensitive what if i want to find case-sensitive max

475835
overlap	padding
then you just need some css to positioning the background-image and probably to add enough padding for the background-image to not overlap any text

475843
apache-mina	mina
mina uses separate interfaces

475849
solid-principles	principles
search for solid-principless and see interface segregation principles

475860
click	mouse
how can i simulate the mouse click in a directx application

475860
click	mouse
i wrote the text wrongly what i want is to make the directx app believe that the mouse has just click but without effectively using the mouse and without using sendinput or mouse_event which need that the windows must be focused

475879
key-value	key
i need a collection that stores entries as key-value pairs so i can look up values by a key but i need one that allows multiple values to share the same key using hibernate

475897
pointers	stack
the new object will be left on the heap and its pointers cleared from stack thus creating a memory leak

475907
arguments	default
if you use protogen to create your classes then it can do it for you you can enable this at the command-line via arguments it isn t enabled by default as binaryformatter doesn t work on all frameworks cf etc

475907
.net	wcf
it goes out of its way to plug into and exploit core .net tools binaryformatter xmlserializer wcf datacontractserializer - allowing it to work directly as a remoting engine

475908
google-chrome	firefox
however only webkit safari google-chrome ... and gecko firefox ... have implemented it so far and you ll have to add their respective vendor prefixes -moz-column-width ..

475911
debugging	trace
this is the trace that i get in debugging windows

475912
arguments	default
explicitly specifying currentculture the default if the iformatprovider arguments is omitted is essentially documentation that demonstrates that you have considered the above and that the string being generated should use the current user s culture

475928
overwrite	copying
when copying files there is already a progress dialog overwrite handling etc

475940
implements	abstract
you want to support the open close principle and have your class implements an interface that describes the dependency in a behavioral abstract sense and then have your classes depend on that innterface

475945
constructor	object
for this pattern to work class must implement some kind of init method which allows to correctly initialize object without calling the constructor

475953
jython	pypy
i can t say anything about ironruby but most python implementations like ironpython jython and pypy try to be as true to the cpython implementation as possible

475953
jython	pypy
the main thing that will encourage developers to write code that s different from what they would write in cpython is the lack of c extension modules like numpy this is a problem in jython and pypy as well

475953
ironpython	cpython
this should eventually mean that you can develop code under cpython using whatever modules you like and it will run unmodified on ironpython

475953
ironpython	cpython
it should be easy enough to write ironpython applications that work on cpython as well but i would probably aim to go the other way around cpython programs that work on ironpython as well

475953
ironpython	cpython
the advantage of ironpython et al existing is that they provide alternative implementations of the language which are sometimes useful for spotting bugs in cpython

476019
select	union
union select n2 from lottery

inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
but i would like to keep the auto updates so every time i edit or add delete an object it auto updatess i suppose i need to implements something like the interfaces inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged

476021
getter	setter
when creating getter and setter should you also use those same accessor properties as your way of accessing that arrays in this case

476021
arrays	loops
the problem i am having using the accessors from within the class is that i get infinite loops as the calling class looks for some info in data.arrays the getter finds the arrays null so goes to get it from the file and that function ends up calling the getter again from within data arrays is once again null and we re stuck in an infinite loop

476026
getter	setter
can you post the getter and setter for one of these properties

476029
getter	setter
if you should modify either the getter or setter to take specific actions in the future you ll break your object if you fail to use that path

476040
constructor	object
depending on the size construction of the object i d add a copy constructor to the object or serialise deserialise using one of the solutions mentioned above

476041
contains	set
if you do the symbol table entry for will be set to the pointer contains in the symbol table entry for

476066
javascript	dom
in addition to the excellent answers above let me offer you a link to the following article by patrick thomson which explains monads by relating the concept to the javascript library jquery and its way of using method chaining to manipulate the dom

476071
getter	setter
do not use property getter and setter for expensive operations like reading a file or accessing the network

476092
windows-xp	windows
microsoft has a kb article showing how to do this in c++ how to ejecting removable media in windows nt windows 2000 windows-xp

476110
trojan	virus
it s unlikely to be a generic virus or trojan as such would either have to specifically delete the files on startup before sql-server started assuming your database starts automatically or shut down the database then specifically delete the files

476112
value	field
to update a field as soon as that evil erp process is changing the value of another

476128
contains	any
the only thing i can come up with is helper class contains all possible objects and return that from the wcfservice any better ideas

476130
any	set
i ve found that the parent of a user-controls is always null in the constructor but in any event handler the parent is set correctly

476133
python	c++
the wxwidgets doc has sample code in c++ but the python equivalent should be something like this untested

476160
web-config	app-config
in this case you have to define a base class contains the id that all your entities will derive from and use either the serviceknowntypeattribute or list them in your app-config web-config file

476163
msbuild	nant
i am aware there are other nant and msbuild related questions on stack overflow but i could not find a direct comparison between the two and so here is the question

476163
msbuild	nant
when should one choose nant over msbuild

476163
msbuild	nant
is nant more suitable for home open source projects and msbuild for work projects

476173
typedef	struct
the solution must work with typedef and struct no limiting to only basic c types

476181
value	field
in the form fill the value attributes of the field with the data sent back from the server

476188
authentication	login
usually when using windowss authentication the software eg internet-explorer tries to use windowss authentication and if it doesn t succeed because the domain is untrusted or because the credentials are not ok for example it just popups a login windows so that you can input your domain login and password

476188
authentication	login
with sql-server management studio 2008 if i select windows authentication the login password boxes are autopopulated with my current credentials and if i try to login it says

476188
authentication	login
the login is from an untrusted domain and cannot be used with windows authentication

476189
parallels	vmware
lots of people are talking about parallels and vmware fusion but i didn t see any mention of the other methods i ve used to good effect

476189
virtual-machine	virtualbox
virtual-machine using virtualbox - all the major features of a vm except virtualbox is free

476189
virtualbox	vmware
i ve used vms with vmware fusion parallels and virtualbox and i have to say i find performance to be pretty much even across all three

476189
virtualbox	parallels
virtualbox also has seamless mode essentially similar to parallels s coherence mode but less integrated into the desktop

476190
msbuild	nant
nant can call msbuild very easily with nantcontrib

476190
msbuild	nant
so i hand-craft a nant scripting to do things like copying built files cleaning up etc - and call msbuild to do the actual turn my c# source code into assemblies part

476193
credentials	account
trusted authentication will use the credentials that you are logged into the machine with to try and connect thereâ s not a way round this if you want to use trusted authentication for management studio you need to be logged on to your machine with an account that is allowed access to sql if not then you will have to use sql authentication

476207
msbuild	nant
i have switched from nant to msbuild recently because of its ability to build vs solutions

476208
codeigniter	cakephp
most frameworks though do all of this for you and in a much better way than the code above i personally suggest cakephp or codeigniter

476219
sql-server	oracle
on the other hand true persistence stores such as mdb sql-server oracle or whatever are entirely alien to the dataset that s why you need provider specific adapters to transfer data to and from the dataset

476220
rvalue-reference	move-semantics
i believe they are modifying some containers classes to take advantage of rvalue-reference move-semantics

476224
msbuild	nant
i discovered that life would be easier if i just did this with msbuild - i ended up calling a msbuild task from within a nant scripting so i suppose it s not too out of the ordinary to mix and match the two

476237
value	field
if you re using a templates or framework system i ve incorporated the smarty engine into several projects of mine you can usually tweak the templatess so they automatically fill fields with values if they detect that the value corresponding to their field is set

476245
contains	any
for instance you might have one code for password was too short and another for password didn t contains any numbers etc

476263
msbuild	nant
just for the record i ve used nmake make ant rake nant and msbuild on non-trivial builds in the past in that order

476272
ostream	std
matrix.cpp 459 error std ostream

476272
ostream	std
math matrix operator std ostream

476275
associations	model
in fact if your model is so complicated that you need to create a dozen objects with all sorts of associations i d consider that a code smell and maybe the model isn t as concise as it could be

476288
pure-virtual	subclassing
doing so with interfaces pure-virtual classes is often easier than for base subclassing

476291
pixels	line
the rightmost 1-3 pixels of the image is just a vertical white line

476324
templating	mako
i really like the mako templating system that s used in pylons and a couple other python frameworks and my only complaint is how much ws leaks through even a simple inheritance scheme

476331
player	movie
that s the way all the media player software display movie

476338
debugging	trace
a nice debugging tool that i used is tcp trace from pocket soap

476359
dialog	pop-up
the dialog pop-up as usual but on the mouse over hint of a recently created file the entire thing crashes with a out of bounds error

476368
driver	kernel
i need to handle direct i o to a parallel port in a better way that we are doing it at the moment - presently we use a kernel driver that opens up useable addresses using the i o protection map

476402
order	add
what attributes do i need to add to day class in order to deserialize the xml with xmlserializer

476403
decrement	increment
such as increment decrement dereference etc

476409
json	xml
the programming model has leaky abstractions different methods for json xml doesn t support multiple media types only xml and json relies too much on uri parameters for method selection etc

476433
subclassing	base-class
as a valid base-class without a need to repeat the definitions of those attributes in such subclassing

476436
conditional	operators
the best approximation i can figure out for javascript is using the conditional operators

476448
scalability	azure
at the end i figured it is actually expensive to implement something with zero points of failure and if you do decide to go there then take a look at azure the future of storage is on the cloud azure services will be fully scalability and distributed but we are not there yet

476449
vmware	esx
also i d suggest looking-into vmware s esxi - it s a stripped-down free edition of their full esx product

476449
parallels	vmware
it s a bare-metal hypervisor installation so it s not going to see the level of performance hits that a hosted solution like parallels virtual pc or vmware s own server tool sees

476460
contains	any
undefined when a variables has not been defined before in the code and as expected it does not contains any value

476461
getter	setter
should you declare the getter setter of the class inside the .h file and then define them in .cpp or do both in .h file

476461
getter	setter
i personally like the latter wherein all of them are in .h and only methods which have logic associated with it other than setter getter in .cpp

476462
environment	building
this link mentions windows-ce building environment tool wince.bat that sets up the windows-ce building environment

476462
environment	building
and this link describes how to use the windows cd building environment tool

476469
base-class	inherited
subclasses which used the api of the specific hardware to implement the abstract api inherited from the abstract base-class

476487
vmware	esx
whether you were to go with vmware esxi the free edition of esx or the full-blown esx is a business and maintainability decision

476499
convention	standards
the standards naming convention in the java world is to name packages classes and methods according to

476499
convention	standards
what is the c# .net standards naming convention for the above cases

476508
boost	stl
consider boost as an extension to the stl

476516
standard-library	boost
boost bind or the standard-library bind functions would let you bind the parameter param to the function so you don t need to supply it as an argument every time

476527
django-sphinx	sphinx
sphinx django-sphinx

476531
adventureworks	northwind
it no longer comes standard with a northwind database but you an download the adventureworks db

476533
postgresql	mysql
mysql or postgresql are both full fledged db s and good for education experimentation

476540
rhino-mocks	nunit
i m using nunit and rhino-mocks but it should be fairly obvious what i m trying to accomplish

476557
xsd	xml
rather than have wcf dictate my soap wsdl and xsd i want the xml to define the wcf layer but use wcf to generate this so as not to add any custom message processing to wcf

476567
sql-server	oracle
both oracle and ibm offer offer versions of their flagship databases for free in a similar manner to sql-server express

476567
postgresql	rdbms
postgresql is also well worth considering as it is also a real relational database having originally started as the much respected ingres rdbms in the 1980s

476589
double	int
this seems weird to me that int double etc are actually not just modifier keywords

476601
double	int
int double etc

476604
where-clause	sql
and writing sql is so much more that a few joins and a where-clause

476613
shared-objects	.so
if .so how do you deal with shared-objects such as an article

476633
superclass	metaclass
the fact that the target class is a metaclass or an abstract superclass or a concrete class doesn t matter

476634
click	mouse
if you want to move things on screen with your mouse or double click to add events you need to use expression-blend

476636
javascript	dom
javascript is not a necessity but coupled with the dom it provides a very useful medium for gradually improving the user experience of your site

476639
python	c++
broaden your horizons maybe learn some c++ or have a mess around with python or ruby

476653
put	get
you can fairly easily get down to o n log k time just put the lists in a heap

476653
quicksort	heapsort
this is one of the ways to do i o-efficient sorting you can generalize quicksort and heaps heapsort as well

476654
exception-handling	try-catch
of course you may need try-catch to handle exception-handling

476701
webforms	asp.net
on my c# asp.net webforms i have a search page that has roughly 20 elements that could be used as part of the search

476701
listbox	textbox
what i have done is extend the textbox and dropdown listbox to include a few variables

476713
data-structures	dictionary
you definitely want to look at nist s dictionary of algorithms and data-structures

476713
traveling-salesman	bin-packing
it s got the traveling-salesman problem the byzantine generals problem the dining philosophers problem the knapsack problem your bin-packing problem i think the cutting stock problem the eight queens problem the knight s tour problem the busy beaver problem the halting problem etc

476716
32-bit	64bit
i would like to know if there are any severe consequences if i install jdk 32-bit instead of the 64bit in vista 64

476717
put	get
therefore small functions that are as simple as get set i often use to put in a separate file as inline-defined functions and then include that file where i use the extension .inl into the .h header file

476718
selected	button
on first page load with nothing highlighted no ugly orange selectedion box around any item using down button to selected the first item the following events fired in order mouseover mouseenter mousemove domfocusin

476718
selected	button
with an item selected moving to the next item using the down button the following events fired in order mouseout mouseover mousemove domfocusout domfocusin

476718
selected	button
with an item selected clicking the enter button the following events fired in order mousemove mousedown domfocusout mouseup click domactivate

476744
any	set
any that have a value other than null or empty string have been set on the inline style attributes

476746
textbox	button
i m trying to develop a simple app it will resemble something like a powerpoint presentation that will require some simple gui controls button textbox slider and listbox

476746
python	c++
it can be in python or .net xna preferable or if not c c++ will be ok i guess

476747
32-bit	64bit
it seems that the 64bit java only makes sense if you really need the 64bit capability for normal users the intended version is still the 32-bit one

476749
temporary	copy
so yes create a temporary table without id import your file into it then do insert..select to copy its data into your target table

476753
default	reset
since your problem was mostly caused by different default value in ie and firefox you may be interested in a reset css stylesheet which include value for things like padding effectively clearing the defaults for every browser so that they all rendering similarly

476764
compact-framework	.net
if you want to create arm based application on windows mobile based devices install .net compact-framework

476770
fileoutputstream	printwriter
it also assumes output is a printwriter or printstream one of which is system.out a fileoutputstream is easily wrapped by a printoutputstream or printwriter new outputstreamwriter

476771
value	field
don t separate entries by comma in a database field if you might use them as single value just one category

476771
concatenation	comma
there are cases when you don t want to go all the way normalizing but concatenation distinct-values with comma doesn t belong into this category

476775
textbox	button
most of the standard gui controls are there including button listboxes textbox and sliders

476789
cvs	git
for issue tracking i suggest you hosted redmine ruby-on-rails app that integrates with cvs svn git mercurial and a few others

476791
cvs	git
basically the things people are using now are svn cvs or maybe git

476791
version-control	cvs
svn for version-control -- it is more mature and now seems more in use than cvs

476792
cvs	git
i would recommend svn over cvs although distributed version tracking tools like git and mercurial seem to be very popular among open source projects

476809
contains	any
the output of netstat is being piped to findstr so i only have to see any lines contains 1433

476814
having	select
so by having unified categories you can just select based on foodid in your queries

476818
authentication	login
if the user submits the form but is not authentication the login prompt appears

476821
firefox	safari
it turns out that there are some browser-specific innertext in ie textcontent in firefox safari etc. attributes that when set are required to create a single text node

476821
children	nodes
so i think this is close to what i want it looks good-- text nodes can t have children and it appears like they can t be interpreted as html

476849
windows-xp	windows
microsoft s directx 11 compute shader should work on any brand of gpu but of course it will only run on windows vista or windows 7 not linux and not windows-xp

476853
margins	padding
it can t be set through css even though there is the margins and padding property

476853
margins	padding
this is something i ve thought to be incredibly annoying because i always want to control the margins and padding on tables through css

476862
click	mouse
- only in javascript when you click the element with your mouse the element disappears

476865
callback	methods
i then call a virtual methods on the object in the callback

476865
callback	methods
however there is a subtle race condition that if the callback has already been called but the timer object is destroyed before the call to timedout the app crashes because the callback calls the virtual methods on a non-existent object

476866
callback	methods
it is legitimate to make further changes to s from this callback but be careful not to get yourself into an infinite loop because any changes you make will cause this methods to be called again recursively

476900
ruby-on-rails	django
other frameworks like django and ruby-on-rails use a config file which is a script

476902
logout	login
only login logout create and delete

476928
contains	any
you can drop any row contains a missing using na.omit however that s not what you want

476932
constructor	object
the principal problem is that by the time the base class constructor has been entered the derived object is already invalid but the timer might fire and nothing stops it attempting the virtual function call which will now result in undefined behaviour

476941
debugging	trace
to make debugging easier you can type call void instrumentobjcmessagesends yes right in the debugger console to begin logging objc_msgsend s to tmp then continue execution and it will trace all the messages that are sent right up until the crash

476942
derived-class	base-class
i understand that one can raise an event in the class that the implementation declaration occurs but i wish to raise the event at the base-class level and have the derived-class s event be raised

476942
derived-class	base-class
current the code runs but the call foovaluechanged sender e throws a nullreferenceexception because it doesn t call the derived-class s event only that of the base-class

476951
strawberry-perl	activeperl
i have a perl scripting that i d like to run on windows using either strawberry-perl or activeperl

476965
derived-class	base-class
so now when events are added on the derived-class they will actually be added to the backendstorage of the base-class hence allowing the base-class to call the delegates registered in the derived-class

476968
python	java
i have a python app and java app

476968
python	java
the python app generates input for the java app and invokes it on the command line

476968
python	java
so it doesn t make sense to call the python app from the java app and i can t run the py app in a jython environment on the jvm

476970
arrays	loops
a smart enough compiler might notice that the values are simply incremented integer values and might gen up a loops to init the local arrays

476977
python	java
it s kind of like jni but replace c with python you can call python from java and vice versa

476984
fortran	ada
such languages include b event b ada fortran

477013
oracle	mysql
so i basically repeated the same exercise on oracle xe running on the same windows xp desktop machine as the mysql from the previous example and the results are almost identical

477013
order	join
join seem to be frowned upon but as i ve demonstrated aggregate queries can be an order of magnitude slower

477036
if-statement	while-loop
your if-statement should be a while-loop

477046
csv	xml
will larson just made a good post about handling very large csv and xml file in python

477049
hardware	monitor
it s a hardware domain term describing how large a monitor a user could afford to buy

477055
stderr	stdout
have been studying the filesystems related classes of adobe air 1.5 but so far i ve not seen anything that mentions how to interact with stdin stdout stderr

477064
cursor	row
i would like to execute a stored procedure over each row in a set without using a cursor with something like this

477071
32-bit	64bit
it is unlikely that using a 32-bit version instead of a 64bit will make any difference unless your library uses 32-bit shared libraries

477072
dump	temp
alternately dump the ids into a temp table or table variables and delete when finished

477088
codeigniter	kohana
i was looking into the same thing recently and i found a codeigniter fork called kohana that includes a nice authentication module

477088
codeigniter	kohana
if you are set on codeigniter maybe adapting kohana s auth module backwards to codeigniter would save you some time

477094
decrement	increment
it not only has read-write commands but also atomicity increment decrement for numeric value

477121
msbuild	nant
converting from msbuild to nant is trivial

477132
dialog	pop-up
otherwise you will need to find some methods for specifying the quarter year when the macros runs pop-up a dialog box and ask the user to input it

477132
formatting	printing
the printing # statement outputs to the file without any additional formatting

477139
tunnel	vpn
by secure line i mean ssl vpn tunnel public-key encryption - or a robust challenge-response scheme

477142
put	get
watch the intellisense or put the cursor on transferdata and press f1 to get the help for the transferdatabase methods for reference

477148
conditional	operators
or suppose that there were a few very complex conditional which could be composed with operators a and b c and not d etc. into even more cases

477157
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the elements are positioned as expected the first and second div s are adjacent to each other and are above the third and fourth div s which are also adjacent to each other

477171
environment	execution
microsoftâ active server pages asp is the server-side execution environment in microsoft internet information server iis 3.0 that enables you to run activexâ scripting and activex server components on the server

477188
google-chrome	firefox
this makes it look like your google-chrome sample both in firefox and ie 7 browsers i tested

477217
remote-debugging	debugging
winpdb is a platform independent graphical gpl python debugger with support for remote-debugging over a network multiple threads namespace modification embedded debugging encrypted communication and is up to 20 times faster than pdb

477223
append	input
i added this to a toolbar menu for easy calling and changed the save portion to automatically find there desktop and save the file append the value of the quarter year variables that they enter through a filtering input box

477223
having	select
i would like to try and get away from them having to select the active area but depending on the work involved it may not be worth my time investment

477229
any	set
in most instances having a good covering set of indexes and up to date statistics will solve most performance and blocking issues without any denormalisation

477276
worksheet	excel
i have developed a package in pl sql for generating excel file with formatting and multiple worksheet it might be useful for you

477282
perl	c++
i performed an i o performance comparison between ruby python perl c++ once

477322
getter	setter
this was relevant very recently for us as we recently went through the code and added a lot of runtime assert statements to validate input data for our classes and that required a lot of modification to getter and setter

477325
uitableview	uiview
i have a uiview with a uitableview for a subview

477325
uitableview	uiview
the uiview has an image applied to its background via setbackgroundcolor and i have applied a background to the uitableview in the same manner

477325
uitableview	uiview
both images are pngs and the the background for the uitableview has levels of transparency in it that don t appear to be working -- the png seems to be rendered without regard to the transparency data within it -- i should be seeing the background of the uiview through it

477344
contains	elements
all you re guaranteed is that the elements between first and new_last do not contains any of the removed elements

477349
vbscript	jscript
as well as vbscript classic asp pages can use jscript as the underlying script language

477353
preserve	copying
as for the wtf i m not sure why you would expect a remove operation to preserve the elements you want to remove by copying them that s extra work to the end of the containers

477387
command-line	cmd
when i type dumpbin on the cmd-line it says unrecognizable cmd

477399
perl	c++
by contrast in c++ or other languages where object lifetimes are deterministic perl the class implementor would define a destructor function that performs the cleanup whenever an object of that class goes out of scope

477408
detect	move
how do i detect and move to the next line using std ifstream

477455
handler	service
after some more testing i ve found that the extjs form does load the json from my web service but because the response text doesn t have success true in the root it is handled by the failed handler

477456
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
you could use sharpdevelop as ericschaefer says but it does not have a web application designer tool like visual-studio does so if that is a must for you then im afraid only visual-studio will be a solution for you

477459
value	field
the whole point of normalisation is to minimise duplication to try to ensure that any field value that must be updated need only be changed in one place

477463
jquery	.post
even if you dont read my full .post - if you re reading this and using jquery 1.3.1 then stop using it if you re relying on any handlers that you want to execute when the dom is complete but before the page s images have loaded

477525
cos	sin
functions are sum ave sin cos tan cot mul div pow log 10 ln mod

477533
python	java
choose a communication-protocoll in which python and java can use

477540
deep-copy	object
calling a member function like void matrix.transformme on b would see that the actual data is referenced by two object a and b and create a deep-copy before doing the transformation

477558
bison	yacc
in order to do that you need to describe the full grammar and write a frontend have a look at lex and yacc or flexx and bison

477569
order	add
the reason for this is because there s no actual guarantee that items in a collection which that variant of for iterates over even have an index or even have a defined order some collections may change the order when you add or remove elements

477570
observers	listener
in c# or .net generally you can use events and delegates which are special observers monitor listener implementations

477572
widget	button
if i click on my button to launch the image preview load an image off the sd card the application returns from the activity back to the listview activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget

477577
linked-list	nodes
the bits marked with a are new objects - there s a new linked-list nodes at the front of favorites containing a new string and the browser structure itself is new it must be since it has a new favorites pointer

477578
http	ssl
unless the connection is already secure that is tunneled through http using ssl tls your login form values will be sent in cleartext which allows anyone eavesdropping on the line between browser and webserver will be able to read logins as they pass through

477578
sniffing	packets
in essence the only practical way to protect against wiretapping packets sniffing during login is by using http or another certificate-based encryption scheme for example tls or a proven tested challenge-response scheme for example the diffie-hellman -based srp

my understanding is that you effectively have two user account -- one normal level one administration level -- with uac mediating the switching between the two

478563
linux	unix
now the question is does anyone know of an equivalent unix or linux command that doesn t involve complex find incantations or doesn t return false positives like someone perming all their images rwxrwxrwx

478566
select	union
i m not familiar with the mysql tsql dialect but you would have to first select the row with the highest a value perform a union all no distinct via sorting with the row with the highest b value perform a union all with the row with the highest c value and then a union all with the remaining rows ordered by c and excluding the 3 rows by id already selected

478602
ms-access	oracle

md5 is just like any other cryptography hash function which means that a given arrays of bytes will always produce the same hash

478745
abstract	extends
because c++ allows multiple-inheritance and because an interface is an abstract-class which has all of it s members also abstract virtual c++ does not need it - a class can simply extends multiple other classes any of which may be purely virtual abstract

json	xml
however i m trying to think of some places where xml would be more appropriate as a protocol format that doesn t include soap because soap could theoretically be done with json anyways

478855
json	xml
note i love me xml for many other purposes so its not about xml vs json in general i m concerned in particular with ajax s transmission protocol

478863
json	xml
i could be way off there though - json xml aren t my strongest areas

478867
json	xml
for me i think the biggest drawback of using xml in ajax is the fact that you will usually have to parse it and convert it in some way whereas you won t have to do the same with json because the format is native to javascript

478867
json	xml
when you add the larger transmission cost to the parsing and conversion i honestly can t think of a good reason to use xml over json for ajax though i certainly use xml for many other things

478872

478900
json	xml
favor xml over json when any of these

478900
json	xml
chances are the xml + xsl chain will work faster than json + javascript especially for big chunks of data

478900
json	xml
i d choose xml over json if i need to validate the chunk of incoming data because xml nativly supports this through xsd

478902

if the user exit a form within it whilst code is execution it causes an exception-handling because the code is trying to updates a component or use an object that has been freed with the form

479208
execution	exit
is there anyway i can tell if code is execution in the exit event or is there a standard way to deal with this situation

479217
data-structures	tree
browsing through wikipedia s list of data-structures will give some idea of how structures are used in general and what the jdk has or hasn t got that s significant such as having linked hash set but not exposing what kind of tree the tree map is and having a nice set of concurrent data-structures

479220

479297
compression	streaming
if you wrote a compression routine which did that then yes you could compress a streaming and restore it at the other end

479304
derived-class	base-class
the problem with templates methods is that it s nearly always somewhat re-entrant - the derived-class knows about not just the abstract methods of its base-class that it is implementing but also about the public methodss of the base-class even though most times it does not need to call them

479304
callback	methods
in the above code theoretically the author of the compare methods can re-entrantly callback into the superclass sort methods.

479307
tail	eof
no need to use tail 1 becaus eof the regex matching

479317

479432
contains	set
also make sure that the enctype attributes of your upload form is set correctly - it should be multipart form-data if the form contains file inputs

479448
internationalization	localization
edit for user-friendly strings you need to go through a .resource to get internationalization localization done and it would arguably be better to use a fixed key based on the enum key than a decorator attributes on the same

479449
hash	md5
does anyone know if there exist a dll in windows 2003 server which i can call to calculate a md5 sha1 hash for a string

client-server	security
the wcf client-server uses sct security context token to maintain a secure connection and it is working as intended in the general case

479641
abstract-class	subclassing
abstract-class don t prevent instanciability they can be subclassing and even suggest that they are designed to be subclassing

479641
constructor	private
you can use an enum if all your constants are related like planet names put the constant values in classes they are related to if you have access to them or use a non instanciable utility class define a private default constructor

479652
triggers	insert
based on meta-model data they generate triggers logging c# const declarations insert update statements data model information to check whether the app is running on the expected database schema

you can t get the int part of a decimal because the decimal is too friggen big to put in the int box

479746
background-color	transparency
it seems to me that your user-controls does not have a background-color defined - null means transparency which is why the parent control s background is visible at all

479760
administration	account

in your question you stated the difference well and i believe that needs to be your deciding factors

479826
data-access	ado.net
with an average page having say 50-200 lines of html and 50-500 lines of vbscript code as separate functions not mixed into the html spaghetti-style we found it took about an hour per page to migrate them including changing all of the ado data-access to a new ado.net data-access layer

479826
webforms	asp.net
if we were to redo the migration today we d use asp.net mvc rather than webforms as it maps better to the way that the original pages were written - although i couldn t comment on whether or not a migration to mvc would take more or less time

479826
versioning	migrate
our client was windows based so moving to asp.net development time aside carried no additional costs. however i can say that it s possible to migrate a substantial asp site to asp.net without a complete rewrite - and it s equally possible to migrate from earlier versioning of asp.net to more recent versioning with minimal work

duplicates	elements
related question in python what is the fastest algorithm for removing duplicates from a list so that all elements are unique while preserving order

480216
throttling	throttle
for the attackers at best it will be the same effort to break 100 account as it would 1 account but since you re not throttling on a site wide basis you can ramp up the throttle quite quickly

480229
duplicates	elements
community edit this is however the most elegant way to compress duplicates consecutive elementss into a single elements

480231
logging	trace
i m a fan of using the built-in trace object for logging

expression	evaluation
the evaluation of all expression 1 + 1 2 is performed by pushing operands onto the stack and then popping those operands off the stack whenever an instruction add divide etc needs to consume those operands

480362
double	int
under the covers it uses the same msil for all reference-type specializations so a list string uses the same implementation as a list object with different type-casts at the api boundaries but each value-type uses its own unique implementation list int generates completely different code from list double

480362
double	int
the clr allows user code to define new value types struct whereas the jvm provides a fixed collection of value types byte short int long float double char boolean and only allows users to define new reference-type classes

480426
updating	updates
tomalak thanks for the function and updating the updates statement couldn t resist the pun

480456
python	php
another option is to write the main application in python php and then rewrite the critical parts in c which seems more sane to me

copy the string str points to before calling reverse or get reverse to allocate a buffer and put the reversed string into that

480611
execute	declare
if the only reachable reference is in the thread.run methods because the runnable s run does not reference it s instances and no other reference to the instances exists including the implicit this passed to the run methods in the bytecode not as a declare arguments then it doesn t matter whether the object instances is collected - doing so by definition can cause no harm since it s not needed to execute the code if the implicit this has been optimized away

480619
webserver	upload
i am trying to automate some upload download tasks from an ftp webserver

correctly and efficiently maintaining the gc roots across both runtimes in such a system would be a topic worthy of a phd thesis in the abstract let alone implements it

480654
double	int
all the common numbers int long double etc do implement comparable

480660
long-integer	integer
wrapper classes like long-integer etc implement comparable an integer is comparable to an integer and a long is comparable to a long but you can t mix them

time-complexity	big-o
i wonder whether there is any automatic way of determining at least roughly the big-o time-complexity of a given function

480804
local-variables	class-variables
the value1 you define just above is ignored just as if you were declaring a local-variables in a c# function with the same name as a class-variables

480810
32-bit	64bit
to distinguish between a 32-bit and 64bit pe file you should check

arrays	loops
say you have a program that has a set of nested loops each based on the number of items in an arrays

480892
insertion-sort	quicksort
quicksort algorithms are o n log n of course but when the recursion gets small enough say down to 20 items or so many implementations of quicksort will change tactics to a separate algorithm as it s actually quicker to do a different type of sort say insertion-sort with worse o n but much smaller constant

480895

innodb	myisam
mysql supports this in newer versions if you use the innodb storage engine but not for myisam

481128
persistence	hibernate
for example suppose you have a persistence system like hibernate that provides a raw list of results from a finder methods

481157
export	report
however when i go to export the report to pdf i receive a parameterfieldcurrentvalueexception

481162
.when	ready
for developers that don t want to use the tool let them develop in management studio and then use the schema-compare tool in database edition to automatically extraction out the changes from their development database into the project files .when they are ready to check-in

481182
checkbox	button
none of these approaches worked - we wound up using the checkbox jquery plug-in that replaces the checkbox and radio button with shiftable images

481227
double	int
looking at your code i think you re actually trying to see if it can be represented exactly as an int in which case why can t you just cast to int then back to double and compare to the original

481227
32-bit	64bit
any integer stored in a double that s within the range representable by an int should be exact iirc because a 64bit double has 53 bits of mantissa and i m assuming a 32-bit int

481253
lgpl	gpl
since you re basing your work on the original lgpl work it seems to me that your work is a derivative of the original and so section 2 of the license applies your code needs to be lgpl or at your option gpl

481319
truncation	formatting
right now there is several formatting options that can be chosen rounding truncation the number with the specified precision added prefix e.g or postfix grouping thousands applying commas adding numeric abbreviations kmb

481352
digits	base
it s the reason why 1 3 cannot be represented with finite digits in base 10 base 2 5 .

481355
debian	linux
the machines have debian 4 linux sunos 9 sunos 10 or apple darwin

481355
itanium	powerpc
- processor type intel pentium pentium pro pentium ii sparc powerpc itanium athlon core 2 duo cytrix etc...

481355
python	perl
proc cpuinfo doesn t work neither and things get even more complicated because some machines dont have a c compiler installed i m sure they all have sh perhaps python or perl dunno

481365
puppet	facter
i would suggest you look at the facter component of the puppet system

481367
subtract	time
subtract the current time from the function time

481372
directory	folder
extract the .zip file using folder names to a local directory say c jqueryui_test

481374
scheme	lisp
scheme is the only lisp dialect i know of that requires tail-call optimization and they tend to use recursion a lot

481374
common-lisp	lisp
in other lisp dialects that don t require this like common-lisp i don t see recursion used any more than in any other language

481385
.when	ready
for example i have 50 different pages and on each page i want to set a different button click handler .when the dom is ready

481395
value	field
i have seen various methods used when retrieving the value of a primary key identity field after insert

481400
fwrite	fread
sqlite many programs use fopen fread and fwrite to create and manage files of data in home-grown formats

481402
gethashcode	equals
you can see i overrode the equals and gethashcode for this object

481402
gethashcode	equals
i thought overrideing the equals and gethashcode should fix this

481431
canvas	pixel
now my theory was that you may be able to extract pixel data from a canvas element

481431
frame	width
you would then know that each frame was 110 pixels wide and you ve already got the full width stored in a php variables so deciphering how much image you re working with would be a breeze

481432
linux	unix
i believe a sigterm on linux unix does the same although linux will sigkill an app shortly afterwords if this is during shutdown

481451
version-control	git
it s a simple wiki system that can be backed by a real version-control system i use it with a git repository

481465
methodology	legacy
the biggest challenge with this may be getting your legacy table structures to fit into nhibernate s single table per class methodology

481478
opensolaris	solaris
the source code available for opensolaris is very useful for finding out about the internals of solaris together with dtrace and mdb

481478
opensolaris	solaris
however as far as i know there is no way of finding out exactly how the opensolaris source code relates to the binaries released as formal update releases of solaris

481478
opensolaris	solaris
and i know that there isn t a 1 1 relation between opensolaris and solaris

481492
button	popup
for example let s say that on some of the pages you want to a have button that popup some extra information on the page

481496
exception-handling	try-catch
if you don t expect the finally block to throw an exception-handling and you don t know how to handle the exception-handling anyway you would just dump stack trace let the exception-handling bubble up the call stack remove the try-catch from the finally block

481496
exception-handling	try-catch
if you want to reduce typing you could implement a global outer try-catch block which will catch all exception-handling thrown in finally blocks

481530
rollback	commit
note however that your repository should not be responsible to manage open close the connection and the transaction start commit rollback though

481556
integer	digits
1 if the number is not an integer check to see if the rightmost digits is 5

481556
decimal-point	digits
if there are any non-zero digitss to the right of the decimal-point the last digits is always 5

481570
treeset	treemap
however you can write your own comparator and use it to create a treemap number object treeset number or collections.sort list number comparator or arrays.sort number comparator

481571
account	api
one idea is that they use it to limit or measure api usage but it seems to me that a setting in the users profile could easily do the same thing -- especially since you generally have to get an account w username and password to get the api in the first place

481573
hash	md5
you can upload an md5 hash of the file and then upload the file and if the file uploaded doesn t match the md5 then it s not finished or if it takes to long perhaps it didn t upload properly

481573
hash	md5
md5 is often used to check the integrity of a file by creating a hash that represents the file

481573
hash	md5
if the file varies at all it will almost always as in basically never for our purposes generate a different md5 hash

481573
hash	md5
the only reason a file would not match it s previously uploaded md5 hash is if it wasn t finished or the md5 file was corrupted on upload

481588
postgresql	mysql
i m using both postgresql and mysql so subqueries are probably bad given that mysql doesn t optimize subqueries pre version 6 anyway

481590
arrays	map
not sure what your theobject class is doing w the char arrays but if you use the map outside of the scope of this function eg

481609
arrays	map
say you have a function that does something to each element of an arrays lets call it map

481609
arrays	map
what the map function will do is create a new arrays containing the values

481612
persistence	hibernate
apparently you have to hack your way around by defining your own custom sql dialect for hibernate which grails uses for persistence

481624
account	api
they ask for api key because you could have more than one api under same account - in case you have more than one site which are use same api

481625
sqldatasource	gridview
i have an asp.net 3.5 application that has a gridview and a sqldatasource on the default.aspx

481625
databound	gridview
the gridview is databound to the sqldatasource

481625
button	popup
click the back button and you are returned to the default.aspx page and the gridview is not reloaded with new data it popup immediately

481637
put	get
so the developers get a token to put into their apps but the end users have their own user name and password

481640
contains	set
you can create a category class which contains a set or list of products and you can create a product class which has no notion of the category to which it belongs

481682
onsubmit	onclick
not sure if you have an answer yet or not but in the onclick function of the selected call onsubmit instead of submit

481693
strncpy	strcpy
you are on the right tracking you need to use strcpy strncpy to make copies of strings

481693
strdup	strlen
use strlen or use strdup

481722
pointers	stack
that creates a char arrays aka string on stack that is the size of a pointers probably 4 bytes

481728
xsd	xml
i ve thought of creating an xsd and then creating an empty xml document but wasn t sure how to do that programatically so that a business user can get the xml for the template

481780
selected	button
i m wondering how to make a button or input field in interface builder react in such a way that on click it opens a file dialog and lets you selected one or more files and puts them into a specified arrays table.

481780
selected	button
once the button is pushed and files are chosen this seems a like quite trivial thing i guess it will already contain some sort of arrays like an arrays with paths to the selected files so i ve got that covered

481782
vb.net	vb6
that s the main obstacle with vb6 developers when they change to vb.net

481795
select	union
select itemnumber from tbl1 union select itemnumber from tbl2

481807
getter	setter
i was working on this javaish application filled with getter setter that did nothing but get or set and interfaces and everything ever invented to make code unreadable

481809
wait	hang
if your command console is in quickedit mode and you accidentally click anywhere in the console windows the console will hang while it wait for you to press a key

481813
value	field
for both field null value are perfectly acceptable so compareto must not break in these cases

481819
default-value	default
you can define default-value for annotation - here s example string str default text

481828
aggregate	grouping
then you might have a smaller subdomain for each grouping of objects at the aggregate root level

481831
display	height
note that setting the height property or the maxheight property to a value that leads to items appearing off the list in the initial display of the dropdown will lead to an absence of a vertical scrollbar and therefore an absence of access to items in your list

481836
value	field
note your comparator above if both names are null won t even compare the value field

481852
contains	set
my solution to it was to do the same thing as in jeff s solution - remove the combo box construct a new one fill that one with the changed item set and add that back to the contains panels

481852
silverlight	wpf
silverlight has nothing analagous to wpf s elementname binding ability

481852
silverlight	wpf
and finally this post has some good info about what silverlight is missing as compared to what wpf has

481864
constructor	object
although c# doesn t have any direct equivalent for the general case c# 3 gain object initializer syntax for constructor calls

481879
postgresql	mysql
for instance i use mostly oracle and i see that others mysql sql server postgresql ... cannot do

481882
joomla	drupal
i m looking at things like wordpress joomla and drupal but i m wondering if anyone has personal experience in using and more specifically developing for these applications

481895
sql-server	mysql
both sql-server and mysql don t support the standard double pipe for string concatenation while every other db seems to

481895
sql-server	mysql
in the code for mysql and via for sql-server

481897
oracle	mysql
bristle software sql tips for oracle sql server and mysql

481904
authentication	login
one more idea no kittens though is to track ips that users access the system with and require them to perform additional authentication captcha pick a kitty pick a key from this table when they login from an address they haven t before

481935
silverlight	wpf
i was thinking that silverlight being a subset of wpf you would be able to copy large blocks of silverlight code into wpf later and vice versa

481935
silverlight	wpf
is this just an anomaly or are complex silverlight applications going to be pretty much unportable to wpf without significant changes

481936
oracle	mysql
conceptually oracle and mysql are examples of two very different ways of handling databases

481936
postgresql	mysql
oracle like db2 is an example of an dbms which almost includes an entire operating system it performs many features that a dbms like mssql mysql postgresql would let the operating system s filesystem and virtual memory systems handle

481937
shell	bash
i recommend both learning the bash shell and essential system administration

481940
wordpress	blogs
wordpress is pretty much tied to the posts+pages system posts are blogs pages is a hierarchy

481941
silverlight	wpf
the loaded event in silverlight does not match the definition of a what it is in wpf and consequently b the definition that they pasted into the silverlight documentation from wpf

481948
versioning	upgrade
i also need to use multiple versioning of django as i have legacy projects i haven t upgrade some old svn checkouts pre1.0 some 1.0 and some new svn checkouts

481959
digits	base
ps in general you can express a number r with finite digits in a base b iff r m b n where m n are integers an n 0

481963
reflection	runtime
you can do a runtime check using reflection to see if inheritors have added any fields however i wouldn t recommend it since it violates some of the elementary principles of encapsulation

481968
attributes	properties
afaik the only thing this this affects is the way the ide handles attributes to show not-show the named properties options

481971
silverlight	wpf
the way i understand it is that aside from both using xaml silverlight and wpf are essentially different

481984
mediator	facade
i understand that facade encapsulates access to a sub systemd and mediator encapsulates the integration between components

481984
mediator	facade
i understand that sub systemd components are not aware of the facade where as components are obviously aware of the mediator

481984
mediator	facade
i m currently using a facade for encapsulating the methods of retrieving configuration information app-config user setting stored in sql assembly info etc and a mediator for navigation between different windows forms

481988
reference-type	generics
not only can you do away with boxing but the generics implementations are somewhat faster than the non generics counterparts with reference-type due to a change in the underlying implementation

481988
enumerator	iteration
in addition iteration via foreach on an list rather than ilist is faster due to the arraylist s enumerator requiring a heap allocation

481999
cakephp	drupal
these modules allows you use drupal api to do almost anything a framework like codeigniter or cakephp does

482025
shell	bash
learning the bash shell unix shell programming is a fairly decent read

482025
shell	bash
so is linux shell scripting with bash developer s library

482026
sql-server	mysql
i am not as familiar with mysql as i am with sql-server but in t-sql you can t use aliases in group by clauses i originally thought order by clauses as well but that has since been shown to be incorrect

482026
filtering	grouping
in this case you want to filtering based on the results of a grouping by so i would use a having clause as follows

482031
switching	screens
switching to an alternate login screens

482048
maxima	sage
i heard today that maxima can do the country plot by contour_plot in sage

482086
radio-button	checkbox
the checkbox value is either true or false depending on if the checkbox is checked or not as expected while the radio-button always returns true

482088
document	element
in both techniques the code doesn t execute unless the css selector matches an element within the document

482100
sql-server	mysql
i used to prefer auto increment columns ala mysql sql-server and others until i got heavily into jpa

482111
sequences	unique
also sequences can throw one for a loop on rac where unless you specify that you want them to be strictly increasing you will get unique numbers out of them -- but not necessarily in strictly increasing order this happens because in order to avoid inter-node communication for every sequence.nextval call each node gets a separate small slice of the upcoming numbers

482113
copy-constructor	constructor
a copy-constructor is not possible as far as i know because memory is allocated before the constructor is called

482113
constructor	object
the copy constructor of the known type is used not of the type of the object

482134
arguments	undefined
when settimeout calls that function it passes no arguments meaning me will be undefined

482138
sql-server	firebird
i don t know much about firebird but if it support odbc you can install the odbc driver onto your sql-server and import away

482175
zend-framework	codeigniter
still i don t remember seeing anything remotely as well polished in cakephp codeigniter or even zend-framework

482180
hide	show
i would however say that it s really not that big a deal to show hide grouping of controls

482180
hide	show
if you re using panels to show hide then you aren t tabbing to the other panels anyway

482202
double-quotes	single-quotes
are there any performance benefits to using single-quotes instead of double-quotes in php

482204
double-quotes	single-quotes
earlier versioning of php may have had a difference - i personally prefer single-quotes to double-quotes so it was a convenient difference

482237
i2c	spi
i am starting to try to interface with some external components skyetek m1 mini or m1 rfid scanner than supports the following protocols ttl spi or i2c

482239
double-quotes	single-quotes
i seem to remember that the developer of the forum software vanilla replaced all the double-quotes in his code with single-quotes and noticed a reasonable amount of performance increase

482255
if-statement	loops
even when the logic is not strictly linear we have good programming constructs loops if-statement etc that allow us to cleanly represent non-linear operations using linear text

482268
hash	md5
you can specify md5 or sha1 as your hash algorithm or indeed other hash algorithms if supported by future framework versions

482309
directory	folder
i don t need the actual contents of folder being stored in the git directory

482314
environment	building
i m thinking i d building a console app that hosts a powershell environment but bundles the powershell assemblies locally

482325
perl	php
hashes arrays and lists all the same in php all different in perl

482346
mediator	facade
finally the facade is an structural pattern that is it describe the composition of the objects while the mediator is an behavioral that is it describe the way the objects interact

482347
entity-relationship-model	relational-model
on the database side the best model to compare with ooa is not the relational-model of data but the entity-relationship entity-relationship-model

482358
put	get
another acceptable answer would be the answer to this question how do i get google to put a jquery.min-vsdoc.js file at

482363
json	xml
one wants json and another wants xml or perhaps a fully or partially rendered view

482399
pascal	delphi
the .net was designed with c# in mind as its main language partially because anders who designed c# also turbo pascal and delphi in the past for borland was one of the main designers of the .net

482401
perl	awk
it appears as though the original implementer was trying to make it look like grep sed awk perl etc so that it is more familiar to programmers coming from those tools

482402
digits	zero
value does not consist of an optional sign followed by a sequences of digits zero through nine

482418
version-control	git
is to simply have git doing the source version-control and perform project management separately with sharepoint wss 3.0 or moss and or with microsoft office project

482425
json	xml
it s ok for the application controller - whose responsibility is to mitigate between the model and views and to invoke changes in the model - to know about a certain view json html plist xml yaml

482431
sql-server	mysql
i don t want sql-server mysql sybase or even its express editions because distributing it is a problem requires separate install etc...

482433
javascript	dom
i have some javascript code that creates dom objects on the fly in response to user actions

482433
javascript	dom
what i d like to do is every time a new instance of a dom object with class x is created i want the same piece of javascript code to execute

482439
jquery	.post
here is a blog .post by scoot gu on the jquery intellisense

482452
versioning	upgrade
vb.net is basically an upgrade versioning of vb that supports oop but it s not natural because of the structure the original vb has

482461
json	xml
right now i am trying to call my model and spit out its results into json xml format

482463
command-line	cmd
you can run the script from command-line so that you can see if there are any echos cmd or if there are any errors

482465
temporary	copy
on r d i found we can rename the specified path directory even though the total length is exceed 260 characters and then we can copy the file from the specified location to new temporary location for our scanning purpose

482470
directory	folder
entries to the iis metadata before it access the file folder under the virtual directory before we access the entry

482477
shell	bash
if you re on a bash shell you can type and it should probably give you some kind of utf-8

482482
perl	php
i had been using perl for a very long time before doing any php and i found the transition fairly easy

482482
perl	php
the syntax is very similar between php and perl

482482
any	set
obviously there are difference and you have to learn a new set of libraries cpan has modules for most uses so before you implement any new tools have a look at cpan

482483
silverlight	wpf
the solution consists of example silverlight and also wpf client projects and a console application project that self-hosts a duplex wcf service and instantiates an instance of a class derived from servicehost to expose the appropriate endpoints for the different types of clients

482486
perl	awk
arguably flags could be passed as a separate parameter java can do it this way but that s the way perl did it originally and sed awk vi before it so that s how it s done now

482488
ruby-on-rails	django
i m wondering what a controller - such as the following ruby-on-rails controller - would look like in django to perform an ajax update of the page after an asynchronous form submission assuming the following is correct

482488
ruby-on-rails	django
the replace_html calls really make things easy in ruby-on-rails - i m hoping there is an easy equivalent in django

482488
ruby-on-rails	django
also does django have the notion of partials - as ruby-on-rails does

482493
python	java
make sure they support unicode preferably utf8 also set the database encoding to utf8 and if your language has a special notation for unicode string use it for java i think all strings are unicode but for example python 2.5 and lower need to use u ....

482498
javascript	dom
the closest thing you can do in the view function is return plain text instead of html or return data in json format then you have to use javascript in the template file which displays html that sends the request and upon receiving the response decides what parts of the dom to manipulate or what other things to do

482504
javascript	dom
the page.replace_html in rails is really a manifestation of rjs - that is javascript that is generated by the server and the correct mime type is sent etc and then the client takes that chunk of javascript and inserts it somewhere in the dom probably replacing some other element as specified by dom id

482517
persistence	hazelcast
hazelcast btw requires serialization so it will be slow and will not do well at all with a map of maps data structure every put will result in a full deep clone copy across the network and it doesn t have any kind of persistence built in

482518
assign	add
it might be worth trying to assign the variables dynamically after the swf has loaded but before you add it to the stage

482547
textbox	button
also if i click the previous button would i be able to get the data that i had entered in the textbox or selected using radio button on the previous page

482551
tao-framework	opentk
if you prefer coding opengl directly instead of using an engine checkout opentk or the tao-framework

482588
perl	php
c + perl m php

482612
python	c++
is there a good orm object relational manager solution that can use the same database from c++ c# python

482624
32-bit	64bit
my problem is that during link the compiler fails to find __alldiv which seems to handle 64bit integer divides in 32-bit applications

482640
freebsd	linux
it is present on freebsd but not on linux glibc although both are using gcc by default

482640
linux	osx
so assuming you have mastered to compile your application on osx and win32 and you want to compile it now on linux you ll have to go through all preprocessor conditionals to see if they work for linux

482640
openbsd	freebsd
maybe you also want to support freebsd openbsd etc

482654
any	set
for code up to a moderate range of complexity just have a long set of output statements using the standard c++ ostream classes which will allow you to write lots of code mixing literals with any variables

482666
instances	private
because it is protected private in the second example and the caller must use getloadbalancer which checks for an existing instances it enforces only one copy

482685
stderr	stdout
if you have already redirected stdout and want stderr redirected to the same file you must use the 2 special form rather than just specifying the same file twice

482692
unsigned	integer
if this is stored in a dword unsigned 4 byte integer then dates all the way up to 2106 can be stored as seconds since epoc 01 01 1970

482703
32-bit	64bit
dividing a 64bit quantity by a 32-bit quantity is easy as long as the resulting quotient fits into 32-bit

482708
hypertable	hbase
based on what i ve seen people are abandoning hbase and cassandra and adopting hypertable

482710
base-class	inherited
so you can use base-class to read the common parameters and overwrite the inherited modules to read specific settings

482719
emacs	vim
i m not sure if i answer your question as it is not entirely clear what you are asking why the macros s are not working or which tweaks are available for emulating vim in emacs

482723
value	field
the second time i access the field it has no value the only way is to use a temp variables to store the data the first time.

482734
environment	building
building your code with flex buildinger and use a friendly programing environment eclipse

482757
double	int
the above example is fine if the i is int float or double but crashes if i is a char

482763
checkbox	button
they may be ids for divs images checkbox button etc

482782
environment	building
i m doing some work with several shared .net assemblies and a generic web application that i would like to handle better in our cc.net nant building environment

482800
constructor	object
in the client code i am calculating the base address of that object in memory then initializing my object class using a constructor that takes the base address as a parameter

482814
switching	screens
turning off screens updating is the way to achieve this it also has performance improvements significant if you are doing looping while switching around worksheet workbooks

482816
dictionary	map
map dictionary collection stack

482823
xsd	xml
does anyone know what advantages memory speed there are by using a class generated by the xsd tool to explore a deserialized xml file as opposed to xpath

482827
easymock	jmock
there are several ways to do it and it depends on if you inject your dependencies using ioc in the java world we have spring ejb3 and other frameworks platforms which provide injection capabilities and or if you mock objects for java you have jmock and easymock to separate a class being tested from its dependencies

482834
duplicates	elements
it will alert all the ids of elements with duplicates

482836
any	set
you could set it up with a list of urls to constantly crawl your test server and log any errors

482837
constructor	object
i d say the advantage is that you get a strongly typed class which is more convenient to use and also the constructor for the class will throw an exception if the xml data in the file is invalid for creating the object so you get a minimal data validation for free

482842
selected	button
i want to fetch the datakey of the selected row of gridview on button click

emacs	vim
i don t know how to make vim macros work but since you asked for tweaks for making emacs as vim-like as possible here s a few additions to vimpulse i use everyday

482859
emacs	vim
and the default vim key bindings are so comfortable that using viper simply means that viper does some emacs customization for you

482859
emacs	vim
as for using vim instead of emacs i love vim but i love the interactiveness of the lisp system that is emacs

482862
arguments	undefined
arguments none if the file reference remains undefined after a call to new the file is to be considered not parseable by this module and one should issue some error message and go to another file

482883
account	api
what url can i visit to get myself a google api account

482883
account	api
there are places on the web that offer google services if you give them your google api account key in my case and index retrieval

482897
account	api
as far as i understand you apply for an api key and you can do that with any google account

482905
administration	account
if the account that is impersonated in the scheduling task in an administration then it works perfectly but if not then i get the error

482914
buffering	streaming
the problem with pushing data back into a streaming is that any readers that sit on top of the streaming may already have a local buffering of data

482916
webforms	asp.net
i already found some example that shows how you do it with asp.net webforms but i am using asp.net mvc so no fancy scriptmanager for me

482923
buffering	streaming
you need to build a wrapper class that either functions as a streaming but supports a buffering of the last x bytes so you can seek back at least for a limited distance or something that isn t a streaming at all where you can indeed push data back into the input streaming

482927
racket	scheme
for scheme drracket is awesome included in racket

482927
common-lisp	lisp
for common-lisp ready lisp is great

482927
common-lisp	lisp
ready lisp is a binding together of several popular common-lisp packages especially for mac os x including aquamacs sbcl and slime

482947
put	get
if you put a formula into the field part of a comparison you get a table scan

482948
linked-list	arrays
for example a true arrays in computer science terms has an o 1 lookup time while a linked-list has an o n lookup time

482948
linked-list	arrays
insertion and deletion are o 1 in a linked-list while they are o n in an arrays

482951
triggers	insert
they can be used to mimic an autoincrement field where required with a triggers while also letting you get the id beforehand - which is great when you re preparing datasets to load into multiple tables and you want the id before you insert

482965
contains	elements
i think they re very useful to communicate a user that some controls are related in some way for example radiobox or checkbox plus since contains elements are seen as it s children you can menage them more easily

482984
python	java
the bplusdotnet package is a library of cross compatible data structure implementations in c# java and python which are useful for applications which need to store and retrieve persistent information

482984
managed-code	unmanaged
not 100 managed-code but it s worth mentioning it as unmanaged library itself is already part of every windows-xp 2003 vista 7 box

482984
data-structures	tree
c5 provides functionality and data-structures not provided by the standard .net system.collections.generic namespace such as persistent tree data-structures heap based priority queues hash indexed arrays lists and linked lists and events on collection changes

482996
compiler-warnings	compiler-flags
can you show the actual compiler-warnings compiler-flags and the associated lines of your code

483003
updating	updates
you re updating the node in an in-memory representation of the xml document afaik there s no way to updates the node directly in the physical file

483013
superclass	subclass
in fact you can emulate const behaviour by declaring a superclass superinterface that implements only the methods that don t change state and then having a subclass subinterface that implements the mutating methods

483014
png	gif
what image file format jpeg gif png supports low bit-depths like 16bpp or 8bpp instead of the usual 32bpp or 24bpp

483041
constructor	object
the risk is that code reordering an optimisation step would see the object reference being updated before the constructor had completed running - hence the second thread could see a partially constructed version of the second object

483060
hide	show
i ve seen them used for making available class methods consistent across classes adding open close and show hide to all classes of a given type rather than only active and visible properties

483064
xsd	xml
i am not expecting it to be perfect but much like the code generators that can create xsd from sample xml it would be a good starting point to then refine by hand

483067
buffering	streaming
so long as you keep reading from your input streaming as fast as it receives data from the output streaming there won t be much data to buffering

483081
instrumentation	profiling
i found a solution to the above errors which allows me to use the sampling profiling method but there is another possibly unrelated problem when i try to use the instrumentation profiling method

483082
response	timeout
when the request timeout or a response is sent th eclient sends another request

483090
callback	methods
alternately you can use the call methods if you want to adjust the value of this within the callback

483102
sql-server	postgresql
that certainly works on sql-server though i don t have a postgresql database setup right now to try it on

483116
contains	elements
within bindinginfo modulerefcollection moduleref services service i have the orchestrations and these have ports port elements which contains valid values for sendportref receiveportref

483123
instance-variables	class-variables
you have it as a class-variables to make it an instance-variables you need to do

483124
postorder	inorder
you could initializer it with some random value and see if traversal it in several different ways such as preorder postorder inorder and level order produces the same result

483135
derived-class	base-class
make the methods from the base-class virtual and the one from the derived-class override

483137
instances	self
to get instances-variables declare them inside the init function and bind them to self the handler for the current instances

483170
instances	self
instances-variables defined within a class methods usually __init__ and qualified by the instances usually self

483170
instances	self
the variables named instances-variables is part of the instances self

483176
response	timeout
i have found a problem with use jquery timeout i have a page with scripting it s set a timeout and waiting response from server

483176
response	timeout
i think that scripting not interrupt the connection with server and wait for server response because in server side the connection is on for 10 sec but timeout is set 5 sec

483185
prototyping	methodology
both parties would often be better served by taking the t m approach combined with some form of rapid prototyping methodology with regular deliverables or demonstrations to the client no more than 4-6 weeks apart

483189
oracle	mysql
make sure to post it in the mailing list for the product you re using toad for oracle toad for sql server toad for mysql etc.

483232
constructor	object
the following assumes an object with a public constructor and a public method that returns some value but takes no parameters

483236
environment	execution
if you keep all of this in a database with the hostname you can compare execution times for the same run-time environment to previous test-runs

483274
click	mouse
the main problem is that most of the automated testing tools i have looked into rational robot automatedqa testcomplete network automation automate etc don t fully support the vba controls so their tests end up replaying mouse click and key presses so aren t really maintainable

483278
abstract-class	pure-virtual
it seems to me that the only effect of the pure-virtual methods here is to make b an abstract-class

483280
stderr	stdout
this will direct stdout and stderr to a file name output.txt

483285
abstract-class	subclassing
probably the designer wanted to insert an abstract-class in the hierarchy deriving from some concrete class and force overriding of the methods in subclassing

483294
constructor	private
as javascript is lexically scoped you could always simulate this on a per-object level by using the constructor function as a closure over your private members and defining your methods in the constructor but this won t work for methods defined in the constructor s prototype property

483294
instances	private
this will store the private properties in another object seperate from your foo instances

483299
syntax-error	syntax
this seems likely as any compilation-time syntax-error could be just a syntax extension

483313
updatepanel	gridview
ok this is an ajax page the gridview is inside an updatepanel which reacts to the oncommand event of the linkbutton

483320
any	set
when forward declaring the fact that you will use a limited set later on doesn t add any value subsequent code needs to know the possible values in order to benefit from it

483323
pure-virtual	subclassing
when you have a pure-virtual function concrete subclassing have to override it

483323
pure-virtual	subclassing
so by adding a pure-virtual function you ensure that all subclassing provide the same set of functions interface

483331
sql-server	oracle
when all is said and done we want to have a single text file in source control that can be used to generate a clean database that works with both sql-server access at least and preferably is capable of working with oracle db2 and other engines

483339
scheme	lisp
scheme lisp helped here as the syntax for a program is exactly the same as the syntax for lists in general namely s-expressions

483343
document	editing
editing document the library can

483343
linux	unix
linux unix mac osx and any other

483369
key-value	key
the key to this cache is built up of the key-value pairs which are used in the proxy call

483376
hide	show
it is especially useful when you want to generate controls programmatically hide show a grouping of controls or localize a grouping of controls

483376
right-to-left	hebrew
the direction property is useful for localizing a panels control s content to display text for languages that are written from right-to-left such as arabic or hebrew

483396
numeric	zero
the reason why we do this is because numeric value sometimes should not be default to zero as this is very very bad

483400
unpivot	pivot
i am using the pivot and unpivot operators but the result is not satisfactory

483401
contact	submit
i think the only foolproof methods you can have is creating a contact me page that is a form that submit to a scripting that sends to your email address

483409
callback	methods
the original printing api which involves a callback on a methods repeatably and you setting the arguments correctly hasmorepages to indicate whether there are more pages to print

483419
textbox	button
the problem is that user can perfectly click ok button and close the dialog without actually entering the data into textbox

483420
arrays	map
and i am interested in finding a way within one loop not multiple to derive a subset arrays of the highest 10 values where the previous position of the value is the key so simulating a map object

483436
command-line	cmd
i wish to call the svnlook cmd-line from my msbuild script using the exec cmd however all the documentation i have read seems to indicate that this can only be run on the machine holding the repository itself the server.

483441
stream	send
by ttl do you mean uart where a peripheral receives send out a serial stream automatically or bitbanging where you manually set reset toggle bits

483443
selected	button
when the button are selected the viewmanager decideds which view is set to visible

483445
jquery	.post
i have simple php application it works on all browsers except on ie8 beta 2 problem occurs when i try to update table field using ajax call jquery .post method

483452
triggers	insert
for your key tables can you add a triggers to the update insert delete to capture the id of records that change then move or delete just those records

483460
ubuntu	linux
on my ubuntu linux box i can easily mount usb connected drives or cdrom clicking on devices icons that i can found on the desktop

483460
command-line	cmd
there is a cmd-line cmd that behaves like the gnome gui mounting facilities does

483465
interpreter	runtime
the more usual approach is to use string constants for this purpose which can be parsing to a little interpreter at runtime

483474
contains	set
the problem with this viewpoint is that sets cannot contains more than one of each element no more than one jim per set also it cannot recognize several elements in a row counting as a pattern you can however modify a comparison function to look further to see just that

483482
dictionary	arrays
the simplest way to code would be to build a dictionary then loop through each item in each arrays

483482
dictionary	arrays
check if the item is in the dictionary if so add the list to the arrays

483485
boost-test	cppunit
we care about the performance of many of our components and have a very unittest-like framework to exercise and time them with hindsight we should have just used cppunit or boost-test like we do for unittests

483505
msbuild	nant
vs the nant task reference csc - compiles c# programs. update i ve noticed the msbuild documentation has been improved and is much better now probably on par with nant

483505
continuous-integration	nant
edit one of my coworkers brought this up--if you want to set up a build machine using cruisecontrol for continuous-integration cruisecontrol integrates with nant nicely out of the box

483526
derived-class	base-class
if they should be in a base-class is there a way to have the testinitialize and classinitialize methods be executed without requiring them to be called from the derived-class e.g base.initialise

483535
sql-server	ms-access
we ve got a weird problem with joining tables from sql-server 2005 and ms-access 2003

483560
virtual-machine	parallels
vmware fusion or parallels or give him a virtual-machine pc that he can remote desktop to from his mac

483580
keyboard	mouse
you will see all this little things because you have to wait you have to go back to the mouse of the keyboard etc

483583
arrays	loops
for large arrays this should even be rather fast since most times the inner loops should only do one iteration

483593
contains	set
problem statement given a large arrays x of length n and a small number m n here m 10 produce an arrays y of length m where each element of y contains the pair i x i such that the set of x i are the m largest elements of x

483609
binary	hex
i am taking a beginning c++ class and would like to convert letters between hex representations and binary

483616
callback	methods
this callback can fire repeatedly on multiple different threads it uses the system thread pool for this you code assumes that only one thread will ever execute this methods at a time since threads can be created but not not stopped

483629
selected	button
when transferring your regular expression from regexbuddy to php either generate a source code snippet on the use tab or click the copy button on the toolbar at the top and selected to copy as a php preg string

483633
linux	bsd
this only runs under unix-like systems linux bsd and probably macos so it may not help under windows

483639
binary	hex
you can easily write a mapping between the hex charachters an their binary nibbles

483657
reasoning	rule
style cop rules are recommendations not laws breaking them comes down to reasoning of what brings most benefits for the situation following the rule and being standard and familiar or or breaking the rule for the specific reason your situation dictates and have other benefits from doing so

483660
perl	c++
stored procedures can be written in sql java perl php c c++ c# or vb.net

483673
required	checked
the difference is that union required that the lists be checked against each other and have duplicates removed

483691
nsstring	nsdata
nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsdata nsaray nsdictionary objects can be put into a collection and stored to a plist directly

483696
defined	declare
if you are creating a custom class and these are member-functions usually called methods in objective-c then you would declare the methods in your class header and defined them in your class source file

483698
data-structures	linked-list
i dont think there is any other special data structure that would cater for these specific needs but you can still use the normal data-structures like a linked-list and then make route calculations per given factor-you are going to need some kind of input into your app of the variables that affect the result and then make calculations accordingly i.e depending on the input

483699
windows-vista	windows
no not officially if you believe this kb article the windows speech recognition language must be the same as the operating system language in windows-vista

483719
json	xml
xml and json are both options but unfortunately i haven t seen any code for converting to from xml or json that i can really recommend since i haven t tried any just yet

483721
parallels	vmware
i agree with the above about using parallels or vmware

483726
firefox	safari
see it as a new safari user or firefox who tries to put the url inside the search field..

483751
binary	octal
hex and octal are just shorter ways to write binary

483757
binary	octal
because hexadecimal and rarely octal literals are more compact and people using them usually can convert between hexadecimal and binary faster than deciphering a binary number

483757
python	java
python 2.6+ allows binary literals and so do ruby and java 7 where you can use the underscore to make byte boundaries obvious

483765
rollback	commit
if you can get it to independently rollback or commit a transaction you have the basis of the tm-rm interface

483781
debian	linux
i m writing a new daemon which will be hosted on debian linux

483796
compression	streaming
it s actually a very easy api to use - you simply create a compression streaming specifying your required input and output formats and then create source and destination buffers

483797
g++	gcc
i understand i think i understand correct me if this is wrong that i can t do an implicit-cast from a void pointer in c++ but c lets me and this is why the above code will compile using gcc but not using g++

483820
data-access	nhibernate
depending on how you want to approach the design you could use ibatis sqlmap and nhibernate transparently side-by-side by making use of your own abstract dao factory or the ibatis data-access api which does essentially that and is still compatible with nhibernate.

483823
mta	sta
apartments are set at the thread level and once your thread has established its apartment mta sta etc. it cannot change so it is very important to get the apartment correct

483825
firefox	opera
seems to work in firefox and ie7 but i guess you have to try it in opera and so on too

483828
expression	evaluation
i use it for evaluation of mostly mathematical expression at runtime but i imagine it could be modified expanded to evaluate pretty much anything in the .net framework.

483841
callback	methods
in situations where the connection to google is slow and the map can t be rendered in a reasonable time i d like a javascript callback methods to be called such that i can display a useful message to the user rather than have a loading... message constantly displayed

483850
contains	set
give the contains div the one with the absolute positioning a set width

483858
google-chrome	firefox
the document.activeelement property is supported on google-chrome 2+ firefox 3+ ie4+ opera 9.6+ and safari 4+

483858
contains	elements
note that this property will only contains elements that accept keystrokes such as form elements

483864
windows-xp	windows
i could easily write such a program but i would prefer to use a native windows command if possible or only what is available in a fresh install of windows-xp

483890
digits	base
my solution was recursive and works fine for small strings but run time is o x n where x is the number of possible digits the base and n is the length of the string

483896
webforms	asp.net
and since you re mentioned asp.net in the future you ll be facing two options asp.net webforms which is the classic platform and asp.net mvc a model-view-controller based platform closer of how ruby on rails is structured

483909
contains	set
i once used it to decide if a given millimeter-wave radar data set contains an obstacle such as brush a tank trap etc

483917
rewrite	rule
this sets a rewrite conditional to check for the directory tinymce is in and if found the rule

483929
vhdl	rtl
for rtl design vhdl for programmable logic

483951
digits	base
the time to generate n digits in base 10 is 10 n

483953
default-value	default
i created a sample report with a string first parameter with no default-value and a string 2nd parameter with a default of datetime.today.year

483969
display	width
if you donâ t declare a width for the span element or width 100 its property display block would already make sure that its width would be the full available width

483996
mbunit	nunit
i have started using a default setup for small projects loosely based on tree surgeon from thoughtworks with nant mbunit nunit ncover ncoverexplorer etc placed in a tools folder and checked in with the project

484006
contains	any
it doesn t require any server-side support except for a webserver to serve up an html page contains an object tag pointing to your silverlight app

484022
icmp	udp
i use udp packets to send business data and icmp pings to verify connectivity

484022
packets	ping
above means that for every data packets i am charged for payload + 28 bytes and for every ping 56 bytes

484023
python	perl
maybe check python or perl repositories

484037
versioning	upgrade
answering to you question we ve been using scrum for two years and our versioning format is the classic major.minor.upgrade.build we only use upgrade on bugfixes

484041
simpledateformat	date-format
then you can customize the date-format you use by creating a new simpledate-format with the format string you want

484066
binary	hex
it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers

484096
output	mode
the key points being to make sure that the input and output streams are in binary mode as you ve found the pdf needs to be interpreted as binary data throughout the chain

484114
binary	hex
the average coder can parsing hex just as well as binary when handling flags or bit masks

484114
binary	octal
although binary -- if available in c++ java c# would probably be used more than octal

484116
if-statement	for-loop
apart from fixing the for-loop i assume you re just missing an if-statement with a char.isupper call around the sb.append bit

484136
emacs	vim
you could run vim in client-server mode then you could have two windows connecting to one instance hence removing the need for emacs

484140
mta	sta
does a standard poco have thread affinity or care if its in a sta or mta thread

484178
scala	java
like say scala or better yet groovy which bills itself as a dynamic version of java

484190
json	xml
you can easily use it with php just https and parse the json or xml repsonse

484193
expression	evaluation
one way to control the evaluation order is with the case expression

484193
expression	evaluation
you cannot depend on expression evaluation order for things like

484212
reflection	runtime
maybe i could use reflection to do what i need at runtime

484231
directory	folder
if you can t recurse the directory structure since that would take as long as performing the task in the first place the best you can do is guess how many folder there are

484233
fileoutputstream	filechannel
if i were you i d hide the file filechannel and all fileoutputstream from all business code

484242
order	join
also i cannot join all the selected together they have to be done in order with a commit after each loop

484247
early-binding	late-binding
most scripting languages use late-binding and compiled languages use early-binding

484247
return-value	arguments
the target function may not accept the arguments passed to it and may have a return-value of the wrong type

484249
dictionary	hashmap
a dictionary or map refers to the behaviour of the datatype while a hashmap refers to a specific implementation hereof

484267
windows-xp	windows
this is windows itself changing the keyboard layout - it s not really anything to do with visual-studio but it happens when you re using visual-studio because the key combinations you use when tying in code are similar to the default key combinations windows-xp uses for switching keyboard layouts in the fly

484267
button	popup
on the dialog that popup on the settings tab hit the keyboard button at the bottom of it

484268
silverlight	wpf
is there a built-in microsoft grid for wpf or silverlight yet

484275
directory	folder
if i need to add generated files i add a release folder and keep the .framework and .app folders to my project directory

484314
deployment	install
there are many different aspects to this question but one important fact to be aware of is that .net 3.5 sp1 supports the new client profiling technology which enables a much smaller and streamlined deployment based on what the target pc already has install

484324
itemtemplate	databound
in the itemtemplate for said databound control you d declare your link button

484325
implements	abstract
i think you misunderstand why things are made abstract it s becuase they contains some useful functionality and don t dictate how you implements some parts of thier functionality

484363
directory	folder
you would need to create a stringbuilder passing in the maximum path of 260 into the constructor this would be true for vista xp. this is the stringbuilder that would have the new directory for the folder you re trying to set so append your text into the stringbuilder for your new location

484412
linux	unix
i have done a lot of perl on both unix linux and windows and unless you re doing a lot of specific unix stuff my experience is that scripts can easily be converted to run under a windows perl like activestate

484416
updating	updates
so you would not need to updates your defined names although there is complete support for creating and updating defined names if that is what you want to do

484430
value	field
one slightly crazy option is to add your column that is basically just a rename copy the current data over to it then re-design the original column so that it s a calculated field that returns the value of the new column

484441
scala	java
if newer languages scala fan jruby javafxscript etc. provide the notational features and novelty that the second group desires while maintaining interoperability with existing java which can move at a more sedate pace perhaps both groups can have their chosen flavor of cake

484454
groovy	java
it s syntax is very easy for java programmers to pick up and it s 100 java compatible including extending java classes in groovy and the like yet it s a scripting language--as powerful as any--with all the power and lack of compiling that implies

484474
post-increment	pre-increment
one ++i is pre-increment one i++ is post-increment

484492
post-increment	pre-increment
but it s worth sticking to the pre-increment operators as a guideline unless the post-increment operators is definitely what s required

484503
entity-framework	nhibernate
i am talking here about the alt .net and open source folks who are like if ms has come up with entity-framework we have nhibernate

484517
google-chrome	safari
i was not able to duplicate it in webkit-based browsers google-chrome and safari

484520
updatepanel	gridview
i have a gridview inside an updatepanel that is populated when a search is performed on the page

484520
updating	updates
the problem with the solution proposed in that thread is that there is no way to catch the updates and updating events to animate

484522
ruby-on-rails	django
also if you re not tied to the microsoft platform there are tons of others ruby on ruby-on-rails cakephp django spring java and more

484534
any	set
you can set the maximum number of threads to be active at any one time using threadpool.setmaxthreads

484538
contains	elements
a document named parts.xml that contains many part elements

484538
contains	elements
each part elements in turn contains partno and description subelementss

484538
contains	elements
a document named suppliers.xml that contains many supplier elements

484538
contains	elements
each supplier elements in turn contains suppno and suppname subelementss

484538
contains	elements
the catalog document contains many item elements each of which in turn contains partno suppno and price subelements

484538
xquery	xslt
do note that xquery does not have a standard document function it is an xslt function and instead has the doc function which is part of the xquery 1.0 and xpath 2.0 functions and operators

484544
python	java
maybe by examining schmidt s working version in java you can determine what is missing in python

484554
javascript	dom
event delegation in the context of javascript and the dom is where you attach a single event handler to an outer element in this case the body and then based on what element was originally clicked take a particular action

484557
methods	extend
with c# 3.0 i know you can extend methods using the this nomenclature

484817
selected	button
click the little arrow on the right side of the button and selected add as link

484840
illegalstateexception	runtimeexception

484849
binary	hex
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can

484869
perl	ruby
if you need system administration tasks you probabely end up with shell scripts or a scripting language like perl python or ruby

484878
scala	java
i m thinking primarily of groovy scala clojure and fan and less of ports of prior languages to the jvm like jruby jython and rhino which tend to have a more challenging time implementing clean java integration

484898
verilog	vhdl
the only languages i ve ever used that properly support binary numbers are hardware description languages verilog vhdl and the like

484925
bufferedreader	printwriter
from what i can tell it appears as if on closing the printwriter and bufferedreader the socket itself is being closed

484926
value	field
and how should i bind these value field to the specific columns

484934
background-image	background-color
you could add a background-image to your td and wrap the inner text with an inline element such as a span and style that with a background-color

484972
gridview	listview
you can use the listview in combination with a gridview and at least one celltemplate for the column that contains the icon

484981
compact-framework	.net
i ve done this with the microsoft .net compact-framework and had excellent results

484988
library-project	libs
if the libs-project is a class libs then it needs a context to execute in

484997
arrays	loops
while arrayss i think all and some other functions and calls use 0 as a starting point you would have to set i to -1 to make the loops work with the arrays when using ++i

484999
getter	setter
does anyone know of an eclipse plugins or methods to get eclipse to generate getter setter on one line like this

485006
base-class	inherited
the textbox i originally posted about was not inherited from a base-class form although it was added to a custom user-controls class

485006
base-class	inherited
i probably should have mentioned that earlier but i recently ran into the same problem on a totally unrelated set of controls that were inherited from a base-class form

485012
barcode	code128
if you going with cheap barcode readers use code128

485012
datamatrix	barcode
if you want to use cameras phones for barcode decoding use datamatrix

485012
datamatrix	barcode
you can put about 1kb of data into a datamatrix barcode

485035
webforms	asp.net
i m currently working on a reasonably complicated data input form based around asp.net webforms

485045
python	perl
you might find perl or python useful to get data from the serial port

485082
stax	sax
but if it s streaming you want and don t need pipelining of multiple filtering stages stax is simpler than sax

485082
xstream	jibx
so jaxb xstream jibx are good

485086

could you explain sta and mta

485086
mta	sta
could you explain sta and mta

485109
mta	sta
sta single-threaded apartment and mta multithreading apartment are to do with com

python	c++
i think the concept of python doctests is brilliant and as a c++ programmer at a real-time shop i m quite jealous

485188
getter	setter
globals over having getter and setter functions for everything does keep application size down though

485207
baud-rate	parity
you can use the stty or setserial commands to change the parameters of the serial-port baud-rate parity stop bits etc.

485211
getter	setter
this expression will transform the generated getter and setter to be one line

485224
python	lua
lua is a great dynamic language along the lines of ruby or python and allows you to quickly develop high quality code

485231
checkbox	textbox
for each page of settings i had been recursively traversing all the controls on the page and if i came to one that i wanted to work on checkbox textbox ... i added it to a ilist and then sent that ilist to the service layer where i then had to pull the control out of the list so i could work on it

485234
administration	account
i ve only used the django admin interface to let administration manage the mail account but a management user-interface for users is trivial to implements as well

485234
postfix	dovecot
a howto in german for dovecot postfix postgresql

postfix	dovecot
a howto for gluing together virtual user domain support for debian postfix 2 with smtp auth sasl2 with libpam-pgsql for postfix postgresql and dovecot

485234
postfix	dovecot
you might also want to checkout the virtual mail manager command-line tool for managing domains account and alias with a dovecot postfix postgresql setup

485242
ruby	php
my tool of choice for this is coldfusion from working with asp php java and a bit of ruby

485270
error-handling	try-catch
if you have error-handling elsewhere in your code i suggest removing the try-catch block

485271
pointers	stack
indeed a global is faster because accessing a local requires the variables offset to be added to the value of stack pointers

485290
debugging	trace
this is ok for me i always do it because i have assertions and debugging trace which are only executed in the debugging version

485291
environment	building
and to that last point not only emacs is the most extensible environment there is it is also the easiest environment to extend there is and it is the environment where you reap the most benefit from extending it--your extensions integrate into emacs like they are stock features and so your future extensions may building upon your previous ones positive-feedback-loop kind-of thing

485297
ironpython	ironruby
given that there are many .net clones of various languages - f# ironpython ironruby jscript.net for example - visual-studio is quite a good way in which you can combine various languages

485300
populate	row
typically to populate your data you d use a dictionary the key would be the keypath and object the data for each row or even better create a class to represent the data and create a new instance for each row

485300
contains	set
both contains samples you can download and examine exactly how the bindings is set up in interface builder

485305
ruby	php
memory management is magic in php ruby

485307
directory-structure	filesystems
i suggest you create a filesystems directory-structure that makes sense for what you re trying to accomplish and so that you can structure your data

485320
assign	add
aside from the fact that there are slightly more than 365 days each year you need to add 97 leap days each of the value that are multiplied to make up your constant are integer literals and therefore until you assign them to the uint64 it s all done in integer spaces

485323
document	element
i have an element in my document that has a background-color and image set through a regular css rule

485342
order	add
why do you have to add 2 additional set of quotation marks in order to escape a set of quotation marks inside a verbatim string

485343
getter	setter
to access your fields you should declare properties in ifacilitytreeitem interface with getter and setter

485372
python	c++
you should accept that coding in c++ is not as a quick job as it is in python so the unit testing is similarly somewhat more difficult

485372
python	c++
so briefly i think the analogue of the python doctest for c++ would have so many drawbacks compared to the existing tools that nobody began to implement it

485377
command-prompt	cmd
not having to go back to a cmd-prompt and enter a cmd to recompile may only save two seconds each run of your program but that adds up

485388
emacs	vim
but compared to vim and emacs i m sure the text editor inside visual-studio is really lousy

485395
controller	routes
create a votes controller and have it nested off the stories controller in your routes file

485406
getter	setter
java code formatting in eclipse does not differentiate between getter setter and any other methods in a class

485414
put	get
you need to put it in the routedata to get it to show up

485416
keyboard	mouse
the good thing about those two i have never used emacs before but i still use vi for the most mundane task is the fact they don t interrupt your train of thought you don t have to take your hands out of the keyboard to grab the mouse and hunt in the file menu for the correct option

485449
function-call	inline
i mainly think of #define being used to inline a short expression because it saves the overhead of a function-call

485463
cakephp	symfony
lastly i would strongly recommend that you take a look at the various php frameworks out there like zend framework symfony or cakephp to see how they all handle this problem

485472
integer	short
the gist of the matter is that inside that struct you are creating a short integer one that is 4 bits wide

485472
for-loop	loops
this is shown clearly by the for-loops which is actually an infinite loops

485493
design-patterns	anti-patterns
some of them trivial or even contraproductive look up anti-patterns generally if the need arise to follow a workflow predefined to a degree comparable to that as stated in most design-patterns implies one or both of the following

485525
floor	ceil
i can find ceil and floor in the math.h - but not round

485528
contains	set
then i made the http web request and i m attempting to set a cookie that contains the asp.net session id of that logged in user

485529
double	int
or to put it another way you can always assign and int value to a double and then compare the double back to the same int and be guaranteed it will be equal

485529
multiplying	subtract
you can also start out by assigning a whole number and have simple comparisons continue to work by sticking to adding subtract or multiplying by whole numbers assuming the result is less than 24 bits for a float abd 53 bits for a double

485529
double	int
so you can treat floats and double as int under certain controlled conditions

485535
integer	zero
edit and it s probably not called round since there are at least three rounding algorithms i know of round to zero round to closest integer and banker s rounding

485538
emacs	vim
as others have noted the editors in ides are sort of limited compared to either vim or emacs

485538
emacs	vim
at the same time both vim and emacs are available when there s no chance of having a full-blown ide working over ssh sessions for instance

485558
dom4j	jdom
you ought to be using jdom of dom4j to handle nodes if for no other reasons to handle whitespace correctly

485573
selected	checkbox
ok i have a set of checkbox for selected criteria

485575
textbox	button
if you mean between the second textbox and the button then i d have to agree with eimaj and say whitespace is the cause

485582
python	c++
i m not sure how the more powerful aspects of cxxtest would get implemented such as creating fixtures but something like this might provide the together-ness of python docstrings and doctests in the c++ world

485586
having	select
i d like to know how much time was remaining in the select call if it returns before the timeout having detected a packet

485598
hide	show
edit a little css javascript to show hide nested elements no checkbox

485600
margins	padding
you d then set the padding margins of the ul s to 0 and 0

485600
hide	show
if the box is checked show it else hide it

485609
data-access	ado.net
it might be easier to simply ignore the autogenerated tableadapter commands and use the ado.net data-access factory objects when it s time for your crud operations

485614
strcpy	memcpy
edit memcpy is very likely to be faster in any architecture strcpy can only possibly perform better for very short strings and should be avoided for security reasons even if they are not relevant in this case

485638
arrays	loops
i suspect luke s test is dominated by loops overhead which seems bigger in the arrays case

485640
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
it would be much better to create an nswindowcontroller or nsviewcontroller for each secondary non mainmenu.nib nib and bind the nsarraycontrollers in those nibs to file owner.myarray

485640
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
you can then instantiate the nswindowcontroller or nsviewcontroller passing it an arrays or arrays kvc-compliant object before loading the secondary nib

485641
value	field
unfortunately whenever anyone saves the record the field is updated with a blank value unless they entered a comment and the last actual comment is lost unless you drill into the item

485654
c-strings	c++
my particular question is between mfc s c-strings and std string since i m doing windows only software but this would extend to any of the string formats in c++

485663
web-services	webserver
the problem is supplying the certs to the webserver hosting the web-services

485686
version-control	git
i don t know any django module which would offer what you want at least wiki editable text with some lightweight markip language coupled with version-control system but you can take a look at interfacesfrontendsandtools page at git wiki section wikis blogs etc.

485686
version-control	git
pystl very simple small blog engine in python using git for version-control

485738
boost	stl
std string can be manipulated by boost string algorithms in addition to the ones in stl

485740
google-chrome	opera
ie google-chrome safari opera render the page fully

485772
dojo	gwt
a library like google web toolkit gwt or dojo might have significant impact on the way you architect because of their need to be compiled

485803
video-player	flv
i m trying to troubleshoot the scrubber for a custom video-player and i m coming across an issue with the scrubber being dragged past the progress-bar fill if the flv hasn t fully loaded

485803
video-player	flv
if you play the video you will see that while the flv is still downloading when you move the scrubber past the yellow progress-bar into the white part of the line the video-player will freeze

485811
command-line	cmd
cmd-line http clients like lynx wget and curl are very useful at least if your development style is oriented towards the cmd line and text tools

485827
margins	padding
this has been driving me crazy for a couple of days now but in reality it s a problem that i ve hit off and on for the last few years with html css how can i make an element that has a width and or height that is 100 of it s parent element and still has proper padding or margins

485834
factors	digits
the only difference is the decimal digits 1 vs 2 and a factors of 10 accordingly

485841
margins	padding
100 means 100 of the containers height - to which any margins borders and padding are added

485841
margins	padding
so it is effectively impossible to get a containers which fills it s parent and which has a margins border or padding

485862
command-line	cmd
i m writing a command-line interpreter and i m trying to setup formats for individual cmd

485872
specifications	w3c
according the the w3c specifications height refers to the height of the viewable area on a 1280x1024 pixels resolution monitor 100 height 1024 pixelss

485876
emacs	vim
the clarification that great programmers adapt their environment to themselves may have some merit but lots of tools can do that vim and slickedit so there s nothing particular about emacs in that regard

485876
emacs	vim
emacs and vim and slickedit et al is such a tool

485888
default	reset
after following these steps the setup is reset to default so you ll have to reconfigure all startup options fonts for the text editors etc

485896
double	int
for context imagine a whole library of math theorems you want to use with int double int-rational double-rational bigint or bigint-rational types depending on what you are doing and the speed precision accuracy and range requirements

485930
development-environment	platform
pick platform to deliver on and appropriate development-environment

485933
perl	ruby
recompiling vim with the add-on support for python ruby and perl nice but it does not help when i am running vim on someone else s machine without that support added in

485971
boost	stl
stl boost algorithm support

485971
boost	stl
no boost or stl algorithm support

485983
windows-mobile	windows-ce
googling for that key will send you to an msdn article that talks about registering your own image codecs on windows-ce and windows-mobile platforms

486004
python	java
so languages such as ruby or python also have interfaces although they don t need to declare them as in java

486037
keyboard	mouse
then move your mouse to the bottom of the screen and out of the way and use the up arrows on the keyboard to move it out

486044
profiling	debugging
to add to mark s answer you can setup a specific debugging profiling for firefox and then change the project s properties web select there start external program and browse to firefox.exe and set commandline arguments to -no-remote -p mydebuggingprofiling

486044
profiling	debugging
there you create a new profiling lets say debugging

486056
continuous-integration	teamcity
i use teamcity 4.0 for continuous-integration

486079
order	join
not sure this will help but you can try using containstable - which lets you change the join order

486087
python	c++
c or c++ would be the preferred language but if this is more easily done in any other language let me know asm c# python etc

486088
buffering	streaming
then use them to wrap your application socket s streaming before any application wrappering like a buffering

486088
stream	send
to answer the comment that this is too advanced a concept for the op the op s problem is that in closing the top level stream he is also closing the underlying socket but that s no good since he wants to create further top-level streams over the socket to send further messages

486094
haskell	erlang
haskell erlang and scala are not homoiconic clojure is

486094
haskell	lisp
it is a lisp unlike haskell or erlang therefore all code is data which allows you to make what look likes changes to the language itself at runtime through the macro system

486094
data-structures	map
clojure data-structures implement java interfaces such as collection list map runnable and callable where appropriate

486094
double	int
strings are just java strings numbers are java int and double

486113
execvp	execl
the runtime library also provides a family of functions execl execlp execle execv execvp more or less which are derived from unix heritage and offer more control over the process

486132
sql-server	oracle
arcgis generally leverages an external database engine so unless you are talking about an individual shapefile your data is being stored in access sql-server or oracle

486135
jquery	.post
it s an older .post on my blog about how you can do a nice breadcrumb with lists and some piece of jquery

486156
javafx	swing
however if you are just wanting to have a java gui but would rather wait for more polish on javafx - i would recommend grabbing miglayout go with swing on java 6u10 or later

486167
project-management	project
i like the web site style of project-management because it s not as rigid as a web application project but i like the end solution to be formally built pre-compiled continuous-integration etc

486184
jquery-cycle	slider
i m using the jquery-cycle plugins in an attempt to fade in out images for a slider show

486184
internet-explorer	firefox
i am able to get it working in firefox and safari however when i view in internet-explorer i see very unexpected behavior

486184
firefox	safari
the first image doesn t show in ie but does in firefox and safari

486191
credentials	security
i d look at the linkserver configuration in particular the linkserver settings for what set of credentials are used as the security context under which operations executed across the linkserver run

486194
windows-mobile	symbian
can anyone provide any insight on how to achieve this on windows-mobile symbian j2me or any other platform

486211
margins	padding
i know that the above css block is getting read as if i add things like padding or margins those do get applied

486242
sequences	unique
sequences are incredibly important for generating unique ids

486242
sequences	unique
sequences can also be useful for generating keys across multiple tables that need to be unique

486259
arrays	loops
with a vector or a fixed-length arrays whose length is 256 you wouldn t need to loops .

486265
google-chrome	firefox
also works on firefox google-chrome safari and opera

486290
hide	show
i have like 15 grids on my windows and i have a small menu on which i can click and choose which grid to show up or hide

486297
common-lisp	scheme
functional purity is better found in other places lisp derivatives like common-lisp and scheme are good places to start

486298
sftp	ssh
by the way it would be a huge bonus if i could get some sort of remote desktop access to this machine so i wasn t limited to using ssh and sftp

486314
contains	set
it s because you have a height set on the contains div

486337
quirks-mode	doctype
the lack of a doctype meant that ie 7 was running in quirks-mode and the inline css emitted by the jquery accordion was behaving funky

486352
user-interface	look-and-feel
it seems to me that whenever a gui graphical user-interface is involved the look-and-feel of the interface nearly always trumps the performance of the application

486354
contains	any
in the bottom of the info windows is a little gear-icon and under that popup is add build setting condition which once added produces a build-setting popup which contains any iphone os device.

486360
haskell	lisp
i was working with a lisp dialect but also learning some haskell as well

486360
haskell	lisp
my question is this are there different applications or uses where a language like haskell may make more sense than a more dynamic language like common lisp

486360
haskell	lisp
for example it seems that lisp could be used for more bottom programming like in building websites or guis where haskell could be used where compile time checks are more needed like in building tcp ip servers or code parsers

486363
user-interface	look-and-feel
i don t care how zippy the look-and-feel is if it takes second to echo a keypress the user-interface experience will suck

486372
hide	show
hey i have a field called status and it is either 1 to show or 0 to hide

486412
postback	ajax
everything happens on postback there s no ajax or web services on a good day the page loads are fairly quick

486412
selected	button
it must be responsive i don t want to have to click a button and then wait 10 seconds for a list to load and then selected an item from that list and then wait for another screen to load before i can selected an action to complete on that item which then takes 5 minutes to complete

486427
keyboard	mouse
even worse consider text-mode browsers with separate mouse and keyboard selection interfaces

486431
duplicates	elements
unfortunately thiswill not work for an arrays with duplicates elements

486432
ruby	php
the official version is ruby based but there are versions for other languages like php and python

486436

486448
compact-framework	.net
i was just wondering if anyone has found a mocking library that can be used with the .net compact-framework

486465
return-type	arguments
a function prototype names a function its return-type and the type of its arguments

486468
return-value	arguments
source code that needs to reference the function simply include the header file which gives enough information for the compiler to correlate the function call to the arguments and return-value of the function you are calling

486469
defined	declare
class member-functions are declare in the header that defined the interface for the class

486471
verilog	vhdl
i posted an answer to another stackoverflow question which requires some digital logic to be implemented in verilog or vhdl so that it can be programmed into an fpga

486471
verilog	vhdl
how would you implement the following logic diagram in verilog vhdl or any other hardware description language

486473
verilog	vhdl
it describes a logic system which will be coded in verilog or vhdl and eventually implemented in an fpga

486478
firefox	safari
return false as well as e.preventdefault in onmousedown works in firefox and safari but not ie

486480
verilog	vhdl
i have no experience with verilog or vhdl so i ll leave the actual code up to you and the rest of stackoverflow

haskell	ada
i could imagine that haskell could be a bit better suited as a replacement for ada in the avionics sector since it forces at least all type checks at compile time

486492
return-type	arguments
a declaration is a function s return-type name and arguments list without a body

486499
any	set
i d like to set up a simple css menu foundry at some point and it would be nice to get some input on the markup before going any further

486521
any	set
the code doesn t have any heuristics to choose between code pages that both match the same set of bytes so a windows-1252 file may be detected as gb2312 and vice-versa depending on file content and encoding preference ordering

486523
common-lisp	lisp
common-lisp s strengths which are numerous lie in its dynamic nature and its homoiconicity that is lisp programs are very easy to represent and manipulate as lisp data -- lisp is a programmable programming language

486534
activereports	.net
data dynamics reports and activereports and other third party .net tools can also report directly off of objects and have a developer-friendly licensing policy

486569
google-chrome	safari
if it s worth anything google-chrome doesn t set the cookies either if you use the appending method but if you have a hidden with the same source google-chrome works in addition to the rest of the browsers except again safari

486572
double	int
this function is usable on values of type double int float even odd ones like short thanks to the marvels of implicit conversion

486584
contains	any
this change helps reinforce the purpose of views in a asp.net-mvc application which are intended to be purely about rendering and to not contains any non-rendering related code and for most people eliminates unused files in the project

486594
selected	textbox
i m not sure how selectall works for ultratextbox but i presume it just selected all the text in the textbox

486599
superclass	subclass
however the object which exists on the stack can be passed to subroutines which accept a superclass instance as a parameter in which case the fact that it s a subclass is useful used

486612
display	height
perhaps with display none or set their height to zero

486617
gnome	kde
the comparison between vi and emacs sounds like the comparison of gnome and kde to me

486624
traceroute	ping
the above replicates the same behaviour as windows ping and traceroute and is very simple to implement

486629
authentication	login
simple way i am able to authentication login page

486640
attributes	properties
this defines a stored function that will take your profiling xml and go look for the properties with the id of business name and returns its name attributes back

with this you add a new computed field called businessname to your table and from now on you can selected and order by using this new field

486647
export	report
periodically export data from the transaction database to the report database

486648
mp3	3gp
for music i would be streaming mp3 files and for video i would be streaming flv and 3gp files but mostly 3gp

486661
emacs	vim
either vim or emacs will change how you work with text -- both are proven effective but are almost at odds with each other in terms of style

486662
google-chrome	firefox
this is the solution i have working in firefox 3 opera and google-chrome

486665
scala	java
i use a lot of scala maps occasionally i want to pass them in as a map to a legacy java api which wants a java.util.map and i don t care if it throws away any changes

486671
centering	fixed
fixed size and dead in the centering

486674
hash	md5
easy to do with md5 hash values now at least and when sha-1 is broken well you get the picture

486694
restart	exit
the callback implementation should exit immediately after the catch block so that the restart logic can destroy the current session session state is almost certainly corrupt and create a new session

486694
shutdown	restart
this will stop your restart method from interfering with natural shutdown

486697
short-circuiting	equivalent
like vb has operators andalso and orelse that perform short-circuiting logical conjunction where can equivalent operators be found in javascript as

486700
authentication	login
this class should have a method called login where all the authentication and authentication takes place

486718
dialog	pop-up
at this point it seems only causing an alert dialog to pop-up does the trick.

486732
output	mode
or have your function take another parameter that decides the output mode

486734
bitwise-operators	operators
our first thought was that logical operations are much more common than bitwise operations so we should make and and or be logical operators and add new bitwise-operators named bitand bitor bitxor and bitnot the last two being for completeness

486737
required	checked
for instances when checked two different and unconnected variables it would not be required

486756
unsafe	out
simply don t let your web-browser control directly access the internet but delegation all http requests to your special proxy-server that will filtering out all unsafe response from the web

486814
revision	svn
svn comes with a tool called svnsync which sort of behaves like an svn export but keeps track of the actual revision your export is at

486825
google-chrome	firefox
works all fine in firefox google-chrome etc but not ie 6 -

486846
authentication	login
publicly accessible without logging-in -- not behind login authentication

486853
perl	tcl
and of course any language which can work with postgresql can work with postgis -- the list includes perl php python tcl c c++ java c# and more

486857
variables	boolean
if there are none for example when the polygon is convex then you will not notice a runtime difference because the filling rule amounts to a boolean variables in the main loop of the mifillpolygon most of the code is the same for both fill rules

486891
scala	java
perhaps functional programming could be the next big thing and scala will be the next java

486894
traffic	packets
yes you can use a packets sniffer and see what s in your traffic

486901
compact-framework	.net
managed .net compact-framework and unmanaged native arm

486926
contains	any
in short yes - a type inherits the type arguments from any types that contains it this is the key to things like and many other scenarios etc - it is critical that they share the t from the outer class not just any t

open a access database .mdb using jet ado and vb6

486983
mousedown	mouseup
all button are rolled-over out and click mousedown mouseup

487006
linked-list	dictionary
it wouldn t be too hard to build one using a linked-list of elements and a dictionary from key to linked-list node

487006
linked-list	nodes
access would then consist of fetching the linked-list nodes moving it to the head and returning the value

487014
macros	vba
record a macros this will generate a vba template

487027
metaphone	soundex
postgresql has a module named fuzzystrmatch with the docs showing examples of using soundex levenshtein metaphone and double metaphone

487047
constructor	object
i d also discourage using the constructor property for type checking in javascript - it might work reliably for jquery but as constructor is just a property of the object pointed to by the constructor function s prototype property at instantiation time there are lots of ways to mess with such tests.

487047
instanceof	typeof
instead it uses a combinations of typeof duck-typing and tostring.call for type checking which should work where instanceof will fail

487067
short-circuiting	equivalent
is there an equivalent of which would not use short-circuiting evaluation

487084
jquery	.post
also i found this jquery plugin from another .post on stackoverflow and if you need more flexibility you could use that

487086
python	ruby
i ve just learned the basics of ruby after being very happy with python for several years i m still using python for some things but i d like to know if there s an idiom or hack to solve this particular problem

487094
ado	jet
how to implement multi-user custom counters in jet 4.0 and ado 2.1

487094
ado	jet
the article suggests using jet s refreshcache methods and to set the jet oledb transaction commit mode to 1 millisecond one advantage for ado over dao for jet is that you can alter this setting without changing the value in the registry

487099
bash	zsh
declaring arrays has some syntactical differences between zsh bash or so.

487110
communication	messages
usually this is done in pygtk using mechanism of queue messages for communication between worker and gui which are read periodically using timeout function

487114
javadoc	doxygen
as far as i can remember doxygen does good stuff with java doc-style documentation but are there any other conventions and tools for this i should be aware of before going for javadoc style documentation

487141
selected	textbox
i m using a wpf textbox and i m calling the selected method to make a selectedion

487156
revision	svn
this is not true imo as a simple change in the timestamp of the dfm does not qualify as a local modification of the dfm file and svn will not commit a new revision

487157
communication	messages
i don t see a need for the classes to communication pass messages but would suggest some strategy-pattern be used

487176
contains	set
backupmediaset -- contains one row for each backup media set

487176
contains	set
backupset -- contains one row for each backup set

487179
subtract	time
the basic steps i think would first be to calculate the amount of time each one takes done by taking each entry and joining it to the next entry and subtract to find the time difference then a simple grouping by clause with a sum will easily get it into the form you ve described

487179
subtract	time
this is semi-pseudocode i made up all the table names and things and you won t be able to just subtract one time from another you ll probably be using the datediff function

487204
any	set
is there any way to do this without having to explicitly set the viewdata username portion

487237
.net	wcf
i m using .net 2 so the great wcf solution doesn t work for me

487261
web-applications	scalability
spawning seems to be the new fast scalability way to run python web-applications

487271
put	get
putting everything in an airing cupboard if we put everything in one big pile and just let general warmth do it it will take a long time for the middle shirts to get dry

487271
hashtable	set
as the data set grows larger however the hashtable will eventually beat the arrays

487278
multiplication	addition
but a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations one multiplication one addition will tell you something meaningful

487278
multiplication	multiplying
so to multiplying our two 6 digit numbers we must do 36 multiplication

487278
multiplication	multiplying
while multiplying 6 digit numbers if one of them is 4 digit and the other one is 6 digit then we only have 24 multiplication

487278
contains	lookup
now if you were instructing a computer to lookup the phone number for john smith in a telephone book that contains 1 000 000 names what would you do

487278
factors	primes
it is computationally hard to find two primes factors of a very large number

487279
space	input
big o is a measure of how much time space an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input

487279
space	input
if an algorithm is o n then the time space will increase at the same rate as its input

487279
space	input
if an algorithm is o n 2 then the time space increase at the rate of its input squared

487280
png	ico
you can also use non-ico files for browsers other than ie for which i d maybe use the following conditional statement to serve a png to firefox etc and an ico to ie

487286
profiling	trace
the best way to do this is to run a very lightweight profiling trace on your server and log just audit login events

487290
export	report
i did however find an issue after i had bought it with export multipage report from fastreport to pdf where the component leaks memory and corrupts the output

487292
space	input
the input size is usually the space in bits needed to represent the input

487302
contains	elements
also contains the type of each elements

487322
lookup	any
this means that lookup are much faster on the primary key because it doesn t have to do any dereferencing as it has to do with any other kind of index

487331
scons	cmake
i ve considered looking at things like scons and cmake too but i don t know how much better they are likely to be or if there s a better system out there that already exists.

487338
oracle	mysql
as long as you do not allow null for a value they should be handled the same but the value null is handled differently on databases afaik ms-sql do not allow more than one 1 null value mysql and oracle allow this if a column is unique

487352
irrlicht	ogre
so it s been a few months since i wrote this question since then i ve toyed with raw c++ d3d the ogre and irrlicht graphics engines and lately microsoft xna

487358
javascript	dom
why not just put the variables inside the update panel or have the javascript get the values through the dom

487363
directory	folder
however there doesn t seem to be an exploded myapp directory under the deploy folder how come

487378
median	min
min mean + -sd median max

487418
perl	awk
bottom line write some g awk perl scripts and use tools like those mentioned above and you should be good to go with little effort

487429
python	c++
you can use the following to easily more or less expose your c++ code to python

487431
python	lua
script languages like lua and python would be the most used script languages for binding together c++ libraries

487438
put	get
at a previous job i maintain some perl scripting to summarize this type of data and put it in a postgresql database....then used www.databeacon.com for analysis...but after you get the information in a database can generate any charts you want...

487449
contains	elements
the use elements can contains description and animation elementss but it doesn t behave like an xbl containser

487454
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort versus quicksort

487454
time-complexity	quicksort
quicksort has an average time-complexity of o n log n

487454
time-complexity	mergesort
because of the worst case time-complexity of quick sort is î n 2 all elements fall on the same side of every pivot and mergesort s worst case is o n log n mergesort is the default choice for library implementers

487454
time-complexity	mergesort
in this case i think that the predictability of the mergesort s worst case time-complexity trumps quicksorts much lower memory requirements

487454
time-complexity	mergesort
given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time-complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort

487491
google-chrome	firefox
the difference between google-chrome and firefox might be different tostring implementations

487491
constructor	object
i just cannot understand why the two object constructor are undefined in ie

487503
.when	ready
by saying .when the client should come back you can implements a backoff policy - even if you don t know .when it will be ready you could have a backoff for 1 2 4 8 16 30 30 30 30... minutes policy

487505
boolean	int
on top of that you can get typed functions now it seems you only store boolean what if you need to store an int a string etc

487512
literals	hardcode
i really should use constants and no hardcode literals

487525
attributes	properties
just specify the properties in your control s code give it all the usual attributes to allow it to be displayed in the properties windows and the properties windows will automatically display the enum values in a dropdown

487549
export	csv
edit the text file is created by running a ms-access macros from a scheduled tasks which export the data as a csv file

487555
dlopen	dlsym
on posix-compliant operating systemd like linux you can use dlopen and dlsym

487567
tokenize	parsing
flex can be used to tokenize an input and bison can be used to parsing the tokens and transform them into an syntax tree

487568
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to pykde4 now released as part of kde itself unless you want to target kde 3 in which case you need a corresponding old versioning of qt and pyqt 3.x

487572
updating	updates
my guess is that you would use activerecord callback on updates or deletes and instead of updating deleting records you would create a new one and have some sort of identifier to keep the same record associated maybe a field to distinguish which record is current and a versioning field

487581
.when	ready
.when you close the connection the connection pool does not release the connection it keeps it on-hand ready for reuse

487615
document	element
and for a not-so-well-formed xml document and you only know the name of the element you are looking for is this the best statement you can use to find the element

487637
bufferedwriter	filewriter
you should use a bufferedoutputstream instead of a filewriter bufferedwriter

487660
tunnel	vpn
with a reasonably secure vpn link or ssh tunnel type arrangement the web shopfront could get stock levels place order or execute searches against the inventory system

487677
json	xml
xml - json - spring asp.net-mvc - jsp page which is displayed as a table with editable fields

487677
value	field
how do make is so that when i edit a field value it correct updates the json object

487695
profiling	debugging
you d need to use the debugging profiling api to do this - which i wouldn t recommend for a normal application

487697
scala	java
scala provides wrappers for java collections so that they can be used as scala collections but not the other way around

487700
virtual-machine	virtualization
running a database test on a low performance virtual-machine is not really indicative of production performance the heavy io involved will require a fast disk arrays which the virtualization will throttle

487730
selected	checkbox
provide a checkbox select within the row and then a means of performing an operation of a grouping of selected items

487732
hide	show
you can use javascript to hide show the panels on the begin and end functions of the requesthandler

z-index	overlay
you can set z-index of your_content to value less than overlay z-index

487752
checkbox	button
if i really need to execute one operation on several elements for example to delete 10 elements i would expect to have the checkbox with a global button option

487802
organization	naming
imho-as long as you have good project namespace and or directory organization along with a reasonable naming convention you should be able to handle any number of classes easilly

487809
python	perl
if you are doing whatever you can to avoid the annoyance of gui testing then vb script python perl or pick your favorite scripting language

487826
display	height
each property name date of birth height etc would have the display name format and description used for help or tooltip

487826
attributes	properties
the properties attributes would be defined in a configuration file somewhere

487833
recursive-descent	lalr
how do hand-written recursive-descent parsing which are inevitably ll k compare to generated lalr parsing in terms of performance

487849
value	field
as far as i could see categories are represented as field of the type choice with multiple value the user can chose form

487851
any	set
there is another property maximum number of generic report columns that defaults to 60 and must be set to a value big enough to accommodate any future columns added to the table

487857
web-services	api
the application has to interact with a series of web-services which are not really all that greatly designed and don t offer much abstraction in and of themselves - basically there is a web service method for each create update retrieve delete operation for each datatype and there isn t much of an api beyond that

487858
lan	wan
returning more data than is needed will throttle the database and your lan wan bandwidth

487875
margins	padding
finally there is a huge benefit in a lightweight pure markdown markup it does not depend on a particular site layout screen width padding margins justification column widths etc.

487895
any	set
i cannot see anything different in the build it is still set to mixed platforms but at the _copywebapplication target the copy ignores these folders any ideas

487901
cargo	maven
i use the maven cargo plugin to automatically deploy the war to tomcat6x before running integration tests

web-config	app-config
it is far easier to check out a file web-config app-config or some custom file and make changes that are instantly picked up when the code is run

487910
remote-server	tunnel
once you have that you can access your remote-server via vnc but the great thing is that you can tunnel vnc over ssh like so

487912

487926
mkdir	pwd
svn mkdir -m file pwd repo branches

487929
expression	evaluation
are you looking for support for expression evaluation or are you looking for a way to output bean properties

487952
instances	destroy
since instances of this class may be created and destroy over the course of the application runtime should i implement idisposable and set the property s reference to null or will the destruction of this class be sufficient to remove all references to the collection tis property refers to

487959
cakephp	kohana
tip #4 read getting started with tutorials for the major frameworks zend cakephp codeigniter kohana symfony

487969
messenger	bots
i would like to create a small windows messenger client that i can trigger from a script essentially a notification bots

487975
xsd	xml
admittedly this is easier to throw together in xml because it s free-form text and there s no real validation unless you write an xsd schema but in those cases you re doing the same kind of work as defining types and relations in code classes

487998
worksheet	excel
i have quite a few cells that link to other worksheet books etc with standard excel formulae

488012
contains	set
if there is some other class that is still in use that contains a reference to the observablecollection then the observablecollection will not be destroyed regardless of whether or not you set it to null

488024
e-commerce	product
i justified this because the business-objects where serialization data transfer objects and will be used in diffrent domains as they where general e-commerce entities such as product customer merchant etc

directory	folder
i extracted it and placed it in this folder opt phpmyadmin-3.1.2-english and i created a symbolic link in the variables www html directory so that i can access it like this

488091
constructor	private
you can make all the constructor private and create factory methods static-methods on the class like createfromconnectionstring

488094
coalesce	isnull
coalesce is ansi sql but you could use isnull too

488099
constructor	private
this method can call a private parameter less constructor and you can take it from there

488102
attributes	properties
is there a way i can set several attributes on for example a properties

488104
revision	updates
deleting the file and re-adding the identical file will not actually updates anything in the repository except the pointers to that revision

488162
silverlight	wpf
itâ s primarily wpf but you can use the techniques on silverlight too

488169
httpwebrequest	webclient
it s easy enough to test i recommend you set up three different urls that will test the different mechanisms and then have a client httpwebrequest httpwebresponse or webclient instance download the content from all of them

488178
pixels	line
once you ve got the latitude-longitude to pixels transfer done rendering line and polygons is fairly simple except for normal graphics issues such as edges of line or polygons overlapping inappropriately anti-aliasing etc

variables	boolean
edit a clarification i j and x are just picked off the top of my head but they are boolean variables 1 true 0 false and each corresponds to a checkbox so

488243
user-controls	ascx
to accomplish this you need to build a web user-controls ascx file that contains the script-tag to load the jquery library

build-process	release
the library versions may be changed by the automated build-process replacing the dlls in the debugging and release directories

488296
subclassing	inherited
subclassing inherited protocols java interfaces object properties bean properties methods you have to explicitly indicate the parameter entry labels unlike in c++ java where you guess the parameter order

488296
nsstring	nsurl
familiarize yourself with using these foundation classes nsstring nsarray nsdictionary nsset nsurl nsautoreleasepool

488297
sql-server	oracle
unfortunately the methods for restricting the range of rows returned by a query vary from one dbms to another oracle uses rownum see ocdecio s answer but rownum won t work in sql-server

you cannot use operators on generics types except for foo null which is special cased unless you add where t class to indicate it is a reference-type then foo bar is legal

488309
firefox	opera
what many folks probably donâ t know is that this rule is already supported in opera 9.5 shipping versions of safari for the mac windows and iphone os and is promised for firefox 3.1. and well as ie6 and later

488309
firefox	opera
sadly while support for font-face was hinted at for opera 9.5 and firefox 3.1 see my comments at #4 below this is in fact not the case sadly

488309
firefox	opera
update 2 opera 10 and firefox 3.1 now support linking to truetype and opentype but not eot in currently shipping alphas or betas

firefox	opera
update 2 opera 10 and firefox 3.1 now support linking to truetype and opentype but not eot in currently shipping alphas or betas

488368
versioning	upgrade
the impact here is that when new versioning are relased and an upgrade is requested how much pain may there be on what breaks since it was customized so much

488387
value	field

the easiest way would be to restart the process with a new display environment variables but i don t want to take down the process at all

488400
contains	set
when using code snippets in visual-studio that contains multiple lines the following lines will preserve the whitespace that was set in the .snippet file instead of positioning the code relative to the original cursor placement

488424
common-lisp	lisp
it is a different dialect of lisp than the common-lisp i was using but seems to have a lot of community support and integrates with my windows installation of emacs either through slime or through the inferior-lisp interpreter

488427
instance-variables	local-variables
the local-variables are stored on a stack but instance-variables are stored on the heap so there are some chances that a previous value on the stack will be read instead of a default-value as happens in the heap

488459
powerpc	arm
search for microchip atmel msp430 arm powerpc etc

488462
keyboard	mouse
this means i can t use my mouse to click to the tab i want but have to resort to keyboard commands to move between tabs

then use imagemagick s python bindings pythonmagick or pythonmagickwand to convert the eps to a windows enhanced metafile emf

488565
.when	ready
i am trying to think of a way so that the second service will only run its batch process .when new messages are ready to be processed and if the second service errors the first service will keep going and vice versa

488565
contains	any
i am currently thinking of using a message queue where the first service writes a message only if the queue is empty and the second service will see if the queue contains any messages if not go into an asynchronous wait until a message arrives and then remove the message and run

488599
selected	textbox
does your textbox have focus when you call the selected method

488608
memcached	apc
another option to memcached - depending on the scale on information you are caching is caching in apc

488620
configuration	upgrade
how do i use wix to prevent overwriting a configuration file during a major upgrade

488626
put	get
the way you put it the parameters get applied to infile.wav not to outfile.wav

488640
parentheses	braces
think of every grouping the parentheses as a curly braces

488641
memcached	apc
i would suggest using apc to memcached the information in memory

488654
subtyping	generics
your objects would either extend or call the generics person object to access primary data then call it s unique type object to get access the unique data for that subtyping

488662
selected	cell
the cellstyle property is the one which will remove the light blue highlight around the currently selected cell

488662

vmware requires you to submit your contact information to download vmware server

488668
virtualbox	vmware
click here to download pre-built virtualbox images akin to vmware virtual appliances

488698
contains	any
if the text after the file name contains any non-alphanumeric characters other than and the pattern will need to be revised

488704
google-chrome	firefox
being a web developer i install 4 other browsers along ie opera firefox google-chrome and safari

488708
value	field
the first table has an identity value a 32 character varchar field indexed on this field

488713
configuration	environment
if you really do think you need to set environment variables for the system you will need to look at changing them in the location they get initially loaded from like the registry on windows or your shell configuration file on linux

488727
constructor	object
question why the constructor of class a is invoked when i create and object of class b

488727
constructor	object
however i didn t know and didn t imagine that when i create an object of type b the constructor of a is also invoked

488732
ruby-on-rails	django
the reason i am asking this is due to my observation that frameworks like ruby-on-rails and django are two of the leading mvc frameworks out there which really have stirred up the community

488732
ruby-on-rails	django
i know there are mvc frameworks in java world long before ruby-on-rails or django came out but there wasnt so much excitement

488732
python	ruby
are languages like ruby python a better choice if you want to build an application using mvc pattern

488732
python	ruby
if you are a .net developer and pretty well versed with python ruby do you see any advantages of building asp.net mvc apps using ironpython ironruby

488733
default-value	default
instead it is set do a default-value which we store as a default configuration in the programs files and copied over by the app itself

488744
base-class	subclass
remember inheritance is an is a relationship between the base-class and the subclass thus every time you have an instance of a subclass by definition you will also have an instance of the base-class as part of the instance not as two separate instances

488744
base-class	subclass
additionally think about what would happen if you subclass depended on some internal state of the base-class

488749
constructor	object
the superclass constructor are called because otherwise the object would be left in an uninitialized state possibly unbeknownst to the developer of the subclass

488760
constructor	object
this is done because the constructor is used to initialize the object

488769
constructor	object
the constructor role is to get the class into a state that conforms to those invariants or throws thus forbidding usage of an invliad object

488775
python	java
it be honest it is not really the best example to compare java against ror and python

488775
python	php
there really hasn t been a great deal of static languages that offer a really good implementation of mvc for the web so that is probably why you see most of the development in ror python and php

488786
key-value	key
map stores its key-value pairs in a data structure sorted by key

488793
selected	checkbox
donâ t use checkbox which can be confused with a record attribute rather than a selected state

488793
selection	highlight
use highlight either of the whole row or of a row icon to indicate selection

488799
base-class	inherited
this also resulted in unexpected dependencies--an abstract methods taking a collection of class x to produce object y defined in a base-class dictated that everybody had to do it this way even when it made no sense for half of the inherited tree

488813
silverlight	wpf
does anyone know of a good silverlight or even wpf book or guide to read about xaml

488823
command-prompt	command-line
use it from the command-line but make sure your paths are set or use the visual-studio command-prompt that vs installs for you in your vs start menu

488837
textbox	button
the project will only need a few components to start off the main process so it will be very light weight just 1 button and a textbox pretty much...

488853
selected	button
click on the add button and go to the path where you extracted the image selected it and click ok

488879
credentials	security
wcf itself can be setup to use transport or message security using the current running credentials

488879
.net	wcf
if the wcf service and anything it needs to talk with using the current credential is on the same box as the asp .net front end you will probably be ok

488879
authentication	impersonation
basically windows auth will get an impersonation identity on the webserver which is fine locally but it does not have permission authentication off of the webserver

488880
textbox	button
mfc is dated and has its fair share of annoyances but it will certainly do the job for you if you re just talking about a button and a textbox

488889
sql-server	mysql
i don t know mysql but in sql-server iwould put the check in an if statment and fail the transaction if the if condition is met

488893
hash	md5
javier shows calling md5 in php code and sending that the resulting hash string to the database

488905
buildpath	libs
re 3 eclipse specifically web tools platform feature can create buildpath from libs in your tomcat installation + libs stored in web-inf lib

488911
ethernet	packets
you mention ethernet so one obvious use i could imagine is for order packets

488914
javascript	dom
if you are looking to keep the html as clean and semantic as possible i would do the styling using javascript probably with a library like jquery to adjust the dom so that the css can be more effective

488919
updating	updates
i would like to updates the state of certain widget upon a certain event happening for example updating the data model s state

488923
treeview	grid
when the treeview is contained on the layoutroot grid by itself and it s height is set to auto if the contents extend beyond the vertical or horizontal limits of the treeview scrollbars appear automatically as expected

488923
display	height
the following also display scrollbar as expected notice no stackpanel but the treeview s height is set to auto

488923
display	height
finally this code fails in that the treeview will not display scrollbar and data scrolls off the bottom and or right hand side of the control notice the treeview is in a stackpanel and the treeview s height is set to auto

488941
scikits	scipy
it seems that mov_average_expw function from scikits.timeseries.lib.moving_funcs submodule from scikits add-on toolkits that complement scipy better suits the wording of your question

488942
double	int
in c# when you want to divide the result of a methods such as below what is the best way to force it to return a double value rather than the default int

488946
superclass	subclass
it seems that you might want to inspect the arguments list of the superclass __init__ methods and compare it against what you have in the subclass

488946
subclassing	superclass
it might not be safe to assume that just because class a has n arguments to __init__ subclassing will contains at least n arguments and pass the first n through to the superclass

488946
superclass	subclass
if the subclass is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclass __init__ methods

488954
command-line	cmd
chkntfs is a utility for managing the chkdsk operations but if you run the cmd with no cmd-line switches it simply reports the results

488966
order	add
when you use the winding mode the algorithm will detect a closed path even if you didn t add the lines in order

488978
easymock	mockito
powermock extends both easymock and mockito with the ability to mock static-methods final and even private methods

488978
easymock	mockito
the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugins needs some more work

488993
internet-explorer	firefox
use firebug in firefox or a http debugging proxy like fiddler for internet-explorer to see exactly what the response of the server contains

488996
subclassing	superclass
your decorator won t check parameters marked with any and the accepts on the superclass constructor will check all the arguments passed up to it by subclassing

489000
put	get
seriously just start reading kernel source and get a feel for how everything is put together

489001
wan	vpn
i m trying to make file i o over a network drive likely over a wan or vpn as reliable as possible for a native c++ windows app.

489014

489034
silverlight	wpf
this is a good link having video interview with people who have worked with wpf and silverlight xaml a lot

489036
tcp-ip	udp
the socket api is the de-facto standard for tcp-ip and udp ip communications that is networking code as we know it

489048
contains	elements
was converted by the compiler into a safearray where the zero-th elements contains a bstr string which is a length prefixed unicode string

489048
contains	elements
my problem becomes one of trying to construct a safearrays converting a string into a bstr placing the bstr into the zero-th elements of the safearrays and passing a variables that contains a safearrays to one that only accepts an object arrays object

489068
javadoc	doxygen
that way ides have the chance to pick it up and show it during autocomplete eclipse does this for javadoc for example perhaps also for doxygen

489068
javadoc	doxygen
javadoc has this additional quirk that it uses the first sequences up to the first full stop as a brief description don t know if doxygen does this though but if so it should be taken into consideration when writing the documentation

489070
actionscript	mxml
although you can create custom components in mxml and in actionscript i would recommend implementing them in actionscript

489074
svg	vml
using javascript with some vector graphics available around svg and vml google-maps actually use this technology to do some graphic like routing etc

489088
firefox	opera
tested and works in firefox 3 and opera 9

489089
scala	java
even though scalacheck is written in scala and requires the scala compiler it s easy to test java code with it

489120
directory	folder
if the directory for the documents is okay to add to i would add an index directory in each folder as documents are parsing and store a file such as originalfilenamesansextemsion _index.txt inside

489120
directory	folder
if that is not possible create an index folder on each drive and mirror the directory structure as needed

489140
any	set
in theory all but one of the entries for any given individual in the grouping table should have that bit flag set to false because every individual must have exactly 1 primary grouping

489154
ods	xls
hi i m looking to parsing spreadsheet xls ods in groovy

489154
groovy	java
i have been using the roo library for ruby and was looking to try the same tasks in groovy as java is already installed on a development server i use and i would like to keep the number of technologies on the server to a simple core few

489154
ods	xls
the ability to process xls files is not of major importance but would save me having to save multiple xls files to ods as this is for parsing data from clients

489155
contains	elements
note that in both cases it is invalid if you try accessing any elements - because there are zero elements actually contains

489172
webserver	security
if you need more security you can go into the webserver installation

489172
manual	rcs
cvs was based off individual files in rcs format and was much more amenable to manual repairs than the subversion repository

489185
any	set
you can also decide to set foo to you default value use the trygetvalue and return foo in any case

489209
hash	md5
keep url in a text field keep the md5 hash of the url in another column and create a unique index on the hash column

489236
treeview	grid
notice that the treeview is contained in row 2 of a grid not a stackpanel and that the height of the treeview is set to auto. there are some additional controls in this code snippet because that was the reason for the extra container in the first place

489273
linked-list	queue
here s the java api page on the queue interface - you can see on that page that there are many implementors of queue if you don t know what to choose a simple linked-list will do

489278
extends	super
the reason is that super only operates on new-style classes which in the 2.x series means extends from object

489291
buffering	streaming
this is important not just for closing resources such as the underlying streaming or text writer but also to make sure any buffering have been flushed and to make sure any remaining unclosed elements are closed

489303
perl	ruby
i ve done a little work with perl which rt is written in but not much and i ve never tried to have ruby talk to perl before

489323
any	set
then start at combinednode leftstart rightstart and find the spanning set and if there are any non-valid combinednodes the set isn t orthogonal.

489327
ods	xls
both xls and ods will produce the same csv - you ll have to handle just one input type

489335
python	java
once you get to a decent level in emacs you can effectively edit any language javascript java ruby python html c c++ etc

489373
pecl	pear
there s both a pecl and pear bbcode parsing library

489391
procedure	records
i would probably wrap it in a stored procedure and return roles that i care about as a set of records all the roles the user has that i care about

489396
hosts-file	hosts
make up a domain name and add it to your hosts as 127.0.0.1

489406
export	report
i am amazed and dumbfounded to find out that a report generated in microsoft access will not include the charts i generated when export to excel word or any other technology

489415
contains	any
and to not contains any non-rendering

489433
hosts-file	hosts
also i did try just making the domain in the hosts simply dev but that did not work

489438
union-all	union
one performance tip that i see off the bat is using union-all instead of union unless you intentionally want distinct records

489441
postgresql	mysql
i would like to port the functionality from oracle to postgresql or mysql

489451
scp	ssh
i came across a scp and ssh tasks for phing yesterday

489454
groovy	java
just remember that anything that s available for java can be used by groovy due to groovy s unparalleled integration with java

489466
digits	zero
i have a requirement to pad all single digits numbers with a starting zero

489475
binary-compatibility	compatibility
it s configured to use binary-compatibility and we break compatibility occassionally and we d like our new automated build-process to be able to break compatibility automatically

489476
postback	ajax
i know this is true for an ajax callback i think it is true for a winforms control postback

489518
stream	send
for this i recommend creating a string with utf-8 as encoding value convert to utf-8 byte stream using widechartomultibyte using the cp_utf8 codepage and send out resulting utf8 byte stream

489527
onchange	onsubmit
it appears in both ie 6 and firefox 3 that when you type some text into the input-field and click submit that the onchange event fires for the input-field but the onsubmit event does not fire for the form until you click the submit button a second time at which time the onchange does not fire of course

489527
onchange	onsubmit
in other words the onchange seems to prevent the onsubmit from firing

489537
perl	awk
regarding changing from compatibility to no compatibility i ve done things like this by editing the project file with unix-style tools sed awk and or perl

489582
json	xml
you should pass the arrays as json or xml instead of just the tostring value of it unless that offcourse is returns either json or xml

489586
deployment	install
i ve also been thinking about this lately however and have started to think about how using proper deployment may improve the process - having to document a detailed install process can be a real pain

489588
having	union
and because of union end up having just one row

489597
button	popup
when i click on the ok button both vali and check valid arrays popup

489597
firefox	safari
works on both firefox and safari on mac

489621
put	get
this file doesn t get put into source control for the codebase because it belongs to the webserver s configuration

489623
constructor	object
what is your threshold to use factory instead of a constructor to create an object

489630
web-deployment	web
i have use the web setup project to create an msi that installed the output of a web-deployment project for an internal app

489630
deployment	install
for my current app my server admin doesn t like the black box feel of msi install and prefers getting a pile of files and a 50 step deployment manual

489651
linux	unix
this is a linux unix program that saves restores entire partitions like norton ghost

489651
filesystems	fat
it can backup and restore many filesystems including microsoft s fat and ntfs

489674
button	popup
to test the reverse i added a third button which popup a dialog with a datagridview that gets bound to the same datatable

489721
coverage.py	pydev
i needed exactly something like this some time ago when pydev still used an older versioning of coverage.py than the one accessible from the scripting creator s page

489721
coverage.py	pydev
then i manually ran a new versioning of coverage.py from a separate scripting and told it to save its .coverage file in the place where pydev saves its

489721
code-coverage	coverage.py
i cannot remember if there is a command-line argument to coverage.py or if i simply copied the .coverage file with a scripting but after that if you simply open the code-coverage results view and click refresh coverage information

489733
system.reflection	.net
.net offers you all you need to load an assembly and query all interfaces types methods and properties in the system.reflection namespace

489733
perl	awk
this way you don t have to worry about parsing the source code yourself using sed awk perl which is not trivial since you need to resolve namespaces and inheritance

489739
user-controls	ascx
i have some javascript functions within the ascx of a user-controls

489752
prerequisites	uninstaller
yep...we have an app that needs a lot of prerequisites set up....web service windows service user account security folder creation gac bits etc....i rolled it all up into a nice msi with custom actions that can install and uninstaller cleanly

489755
scriptmanager	updatepanel
note that if you re using a scriptmanager updatepanel use scriptmanager

489765

in your case where you have content you don t want to show for the non-js users you can just hide it by default

489767
specifications	w3c
have you tried wrapping the form around your div instead according to the w3c specifications form tags are not allowed to be inside divs.

489783
jflex	cup
i m currently reading compiller construction and jflex and java cup is quite painful to work with so i m wondering if i could should use parsing combinators instead

489796
temporary	copy
1 on startup make a temporary copy of the sqlite file

489802
version-control	git
another option i ve recently switched to is using git for this purpose which also works over ssh and gives us version-control

489832
32-bit	64bit
the size of the reference itself will depend on your processor architecture - 4 bytes on 32-bit 8 bytes on 64bit

489838
haskell	scala
i haven t dealt with the scala or haskell parser combinator libraries but it looks like the grammar should be fine

489864
persistence	hibernate
the subflow is actually allocated a different persistence context than its parent and it can use that persistence context to commit but if the technology in use is hibernate the objects have to be attached to its session before the commit end state is issued

489872
realloc	malloc
eventually i created a simple set of wrappers around free malloc calloc realloc that simply printed memory addresses and sizes to a file

489876
32-bit	64bit
this will consume the native pointer size on the current architecture which is considered 32bit if the os is 32bit or the process is executing under wow64 so 32-bit or 64bit accordingly

489877
filtering	grouping
stackoverflow questions filtering by a specific grouping of tags

489889
graphviz	doxygen
if you also install graphviz then doxygen can generate nice call graphs and other diagrams too

489935
primitive	int
primitive like int are passed by value so the variables you are assigning a value to in a is not the same as the int variables that was passed in

489936
queue	fifo
the file you are writing to and the old file you are reading from taken together constitute a queue or fifo fifo but that s not a very deep concept

489936
puts	gets
on subsequent passes in updates mode debutton gets the id from the fifo modifies it if necessary and puts it back in the fifo

489938
counting	repeat
so instead of repeat the same parameter counting exception-raising mumbo-jumbo again and again

489942
triggers	insert
set up an insert update triggers if possible in mysql to populate a separate column with calculated fields like concat u.firstname u.lastname and use that for queries

489948
python	php
one gotcha i can see is that i ll be maintaining two models one written in python and one in php

489968
value	field
as for the new firld creation your field s clean methods should return a cleaned value not just print it

489974
default	reset
the following code - which uses yahoo s reset stylesheet to kill off all default browser padding - leaves a gap of about 4 pixels between the two images below but only when i use the strict doctype

489974
google-chrome	firefox
it is only a problem in google-chrome and firefox

489988
version-control	git
distributed version-control systems like git allow a lot more flexibility in organizing your multiple repositories

489988
push	pull
you can push changes pull changes and clone repositories

489996
contains	any
due to the serialization the return types of web methods do not contains any methods only the public properties of these types are available on the client

490066
.when	ready
that is there is really little to no overhead in having a core in the waiting ready to be used .when you need it

490082
breadth-first-search	dijkstra
so basically the difference is dijkstra s has to backtrack and look at edges it has explored before to make sure it is following the shortest route while the breadth-first-search always knows it is following the shortest route

490092
export	csv
alternatively you could use the csvde command-line utility in windows-server to export your directory information to a csv file and then import it into a sql database see for more info on export ad data with csvde

490107
selected	checkbox
if you want that person to be the owner of files and subfolders in this folder selected the replace owner on subcontainers and objects checkbox

490140
contains	elements
basically you use the second form when you truly have a list that can contains any object and you want to be able to add elements to the list

490171
windows-vista	windows
sapi 5.3 looks like it was included as part of windows-vista so i don t think you can use it in any other version of windows

490175
getter	setter
essentially it would be a bunch of getter and setter and any one of the major libraries could sit inbetween

490178
contains	elements
i d put it this way while list and can contains any type of objects containss elements of an unknown type but once that type is captured it can only contains elements of that type

490191
select	union
select points null as total from data union select null sum points from data grouping by points

490202
any	set
if you set up a test environment with your clients and server connected to the same switch you should be able to perform a load test to work out if your code fails without any other network hardware involved.

490235
ip-address	hostname
getaddrinfo does not translate a hostname into an ip-address and consequently does not connect to the server

490255
enterprise	platform
we had to create a third-party provisioning interface for an enterprise platform with a very complicated database

490275
arrays	map
the map at the end uses the digit to decide if it should return the arrays element or the substitution

sql-server	mysql
we are using mysql connector j and will eventually be adding sql-server support jtds

490294
expression-blend	wpf
i m having some issues trying to change the look style of a combo box in expression-blend wpf

490311
internationalization	translation
internationalization is really not that difficult except for finding a firm to do good translation of your text

490324
g++	gcc
how do i tell if gcc more specifically g++ is optimizing tail recursion in a particular function

uitableview	uiview
note that most of the various uikit objects including uitableview are subclasses of uiview

490345
oracle	mysql
i found out at least with mysql or oracle that whenever i try to do something with the jdbc client that is not standard sql i have to introduce compile-time dependency on the vendor s classes

490345
oracle	mysql
i am not sure about mysql but oracle uses their specific non-standard classes for connection pooling

490352
webforms	asp.net
i would really like use the jquery validation plugin in my asp.net webforms application not mvc

i have a mysitecontrollersbase class inherited from controllers - which is subclassing by productcontrollers

490404
shell	bash
if you are not bound to python you should consider using shell scripts sh bash etc

490411
subroutine	scoping
if there is a subroutine methods which is in the same scoping as the lexical variables then it can return the value of the lexical and that can allow indirect access to the variables from outside its scoping

490420
iteration	elements
you ll find all of these type of methods in the sun jdk to behave this way as it makes various operations including iteration of elements consistent with arrayss where the indices are from zero inclusive to the length of the arrays exclusive

490424
contains	elements
i wanted to write a function that would take an object and convert it to an arrays that contains that object as a single elements

490444
implements	extends
if you like though you can create a pretty bare-bones uicomponent from scratch simply by extends uicomponent which ll give you all the baseline stuff or i suppose if you re really going for minimalism and you re up for a challenge you can just implements iuicomponent and define each interface methods manually

490457
knapsack-problem	np-complete
but if the knapsack-problem is a reasonable analog then there are solutions but they are np-complete to implements

490471
constructor	object
since that particular constructor is only supposed to be called when loading a particular object after selecting it from the results of a search procedure not finding it is either a bug or a race condition which would mean another user deleted the object by key

490481
tuples	set
in the relational database model a relation is what defines a row or tuples meaning it is the set of attributes about the key

490484
order	add
you need to insert in reverse order and this is where auto increment keys can be an even bigger pita - if you can add date of birth or something into the actors and directors table then a unique constraint can make it easier

490489

constructor	object
the constructor will only do the minimum setup of the object so it s valid by the time it s been created

490735
any	set
is there any way to set it and make it stick

490781
hide	next
the alternative for seeing new items is to always have a previous link and it backs up the smaller of a full page or the top of the list - and that s how a user sees new items but i prefer to hide disable the previous next when there s no items previous and or next

490801
iteration	set

what this means is 4.3.x and greater have some backwards-compatibility issues with things compiled in the 3.x branch which used the deprecated and now removed features

490816
g++	gcc
that way gcc g++ will also look here in addition to the default headers directories

490829
pdf-viewer	acrobat
using the above methods also means that microsoft office and adobe acrobat or another ie enabled pdf-viewer need to be installed on all the machines that will be running the application which implies expensive licensing fees

490840
contains	any
basically for java program i never done any android development the basic eclipse configuration files for a project are a .classpath defining the dependencies of your project and a .project file that contains all specificities to your project configuration

490847
javascript	dom
in a browser you manipulate the html dom in javascript

490851
pointers	stack
the above code works fine and on returning the line is not executed but i can t understand the logic behind shouldn t it be i.e 8bytes for buffer and 8 for the saved base pointers on stack

490852
any	set
this would mean there would be no need to set any zindex however it would depend on your requirements

490859
pixels	line
are there other straightforward methods that offer primitive graphics operations like drawing line circles pixels

490864
ubuntu	linux
i am developing some python programs that i m running on a remote ubuntu linux server hosted on slicehost

click	mouse
edit some more information i ve added a handler to the treeview to handle mouse click events but the sender is always a treeview instance even if i click directly on a treeviewitem

491113
any	set
the basic premise of an auto mocking container is that you set expectations on the dependencies you need to care about and it creates mocks for any other dependencies for you

491121
contains	any
3 a reciprocal grants- for any file you distribute that contains code from the software in source code or binary format you must provide recipients the source code to that file along with a copy of this license which license will govern that file

491121

you may license other files that are entirely your own work and do not contains code from the software under any terms you choose

491124
python	c++
examples are the use of raii in c++ or with-open-file in common lisp and equivalent in newer lisp-influenced languages - the same in dylan c# python and in ruby you can pass a block to a file object

491130
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
is dynamic-sql more vulnerable to sql-injection hacking

491140
compact-framework	.net
consider also the .net compact-framework itâ s not uncommon for windows mobile devices to have 32mb or 64mb of volatile memory to play with which - when you think about it - is still â œlotsâ

491140
compact-framework	.net
i wondering what the footprint of the .net compact-framework is and how would it perform on a nokia phone with 4mb of volatile memory

491149
selected	checkbox
now i want to make it like in windows if you click on the text the checkbox should be selected or deselected

491158
value	field
say for example that you have a string dictionary of field to update as the key and the new value as the item

491158
value	field
this way you can use parameters for the value which is safe and you are safe against sql injection in the field names

491188
python	java
if you want some stranger to make some recommendations i would go python ocaml sql c and java c#

491191
silverlight	wpf
even more so if you are looking at wpf in parallel to silverlight

491209
hide	show
you can hide and show controls and subreports but stuff like interactive grouping etc isn t there

491217
distance	polygons
the polygons solution suggested is wrong -- the area of interest is the union of that polygons with the circle of radius d around each point on l -- and actually less efficient than simply finding the distance from each point to every line segment.

491224
default-value	default
from what i understand the default-value will be null if i have a list of objects as below but i would like to return my own version of a default object with proper values

491227
any	set
and any mutable attributes inside an object that should fall within a certain range should be checked prior to being set

491229
itemtemplate	gridview
you can modify the columns and the itemtemplate of columns in a gridview s headerrow

491240
triggers	insert
index the sort order column and ideally add a triggers to the char column so that insert or updates to the char value triggers an update to the integer value

491257
highlight	selected
there must be a solution because it s possible to selected a region and it will be highlight but i can t figure out how to do it programmatically

491259
pascal	delphi
pascal and also delphi uses a subrange type but it is limited to ordinal types integer char and even boolean

491263
select	union
depending on the number of rows returned you may be best using union all on the selects with a select distinct query around it

491323
swing	awt
is it safe to construct swing awt widgets not on the event dispatch thread

491327
continuous-integration	build-process
of course if you are really serious you will run a continuous-integration setup like cruise control - this will automate your build-process and run in the background checking out your latest building and running the suite

491350
temporary	copy
1 keep a temporary copy of the current file-rename old file write new file delete old file or write new file with temporary name delete old file-rename new file but perhaps your are writing out the file too often for this kind of thing

491380
ping	lan
i want to have some work done on the network front ping numerous computers on a lan and retrieving data about the response time

491380
python	perl
which would be the most useful and productive to work with perl or python

literals	hardcode
it uses hardcode literals true and false

491399
centering	fixed
i m trying to centering a fixed size control within a form

491405
icollection	ienumerable
if you do this then there s nothing stopping your callers casting the ienumerable back to icollection and then modifying it

491406
python	perl
i know perl better than python so my choice would fall on perl

491406
python	perl
python may have a better object-oriented support but for scripting that happens to be what you need the power of perl is quite obvious

491445
debugging	trace
wireshark trace + connector debugging log once you re sure there s an issue

491459
reflection	runtime
reflection is used for runtime type evaluation

491487

491488
triggers	insert
this could be done in an after insert triggers on main_table for example

491504
connection-pooling	pool
sql-server uses connection-pooling by default each connection opened with the exact same connection string is returned to the pool when closed

491508
credentials	ntlm
if a host outside what ie deems to be local asks for ntlm credentials an authentication box will appear and you have to authenticate manually

491508
hosts-file	hosts
what way the name was resolved cname record a record hosts other makes no difference because the methods of name resolution is opaque to the calling application

491515
web-config	app-config
to do so you can use the web-config app-config file of your app or write in the code

491527
google-chrome	firefox
edit on further examination firefox does not seem to be doing this but google-chrome definitely does

491527
google-chrome	firefox
i guess its just a bug with a new browser - for every event an i o read also occurs in google-chrome but not in firefox

491527
google-chrome	firefox
when i load the following page in a browser i ve tested in google-chrome and firefox 3 under vista and move the mouse around the memory always increases and does not ever seems to recede

491535
listbox	textbox
i m implementing a filtering feature for a listbox where i have a textbox and i want to filtering the content of the listbox according to what i type

491543
sql-server	oracle
however your model wouldn t be very performant - if you look at how sql-server and oracle deal with table changes they don t change the values like this

491548
32-bit	64bit
i am c# developer and i am almost certain that in this language an int is always 32-bit regardless of the platform 32 vs 64bit a long is always 64bits a float is 32 and a double 64 and so on

491552
updating	updates
you should just stop updating the collection when the list is frozen if you must keep adding to the collection even when the list is frozen if the same collection is used somewhere else that shouldn t be frozen then consider having two collections one always updates and the other one bound to the listview

491553
filtering	sorting
this should leave the paused view free for sorting filtering etc

491560
affinity	cpu
the information placed in cpu is only guaranteed to be current at the time of the call unless the cpu affinity has been fixed using sched_setaffinity 2 the kernel might change the cpu at any time

491564
dto	dao
dto s aren t typically used to bring a one-to-many over with them as two or more separate database dao calls

491564
dto	dao
there s nothing stopping you from linking dao s together to give you one single dto

491564
dto	dao
it s easier then have a dto connect to a dao

491569
affinity	cpu
from apic ids to a cpu number or affinity mask or something

491571
versioning	upgrade
in one of the database tables called tbsynchronize i store the versioning number of the latest executed scripting so i can upgrade any database easily by using the web interface or a client developed on purpose for eclipse

491572
repository	entity
you could and probably should extract this code into a seperate repository for the account just make sure they share the same entity context

491574
32-bit	64bit
so certainly a compiler could produce 32-bit ints on a 32-bit machine and 64bit ints on a 64bit machine

491577
32-bit	64bit
32-bit or even 64bit architecture by instantiating the integer arithmetics of

491587
order	add
in order to allow users to provide usernames that exist in other applications we need to add a prefix in its username and it should be as transparent and painless as possible

491602
moss	wss
i would recommend reading real world sharepoint 2007 indispensable experiences from 16 moss and wss mvps before making a decision

491606
downcasting	constructor
then the derived constructor can pass an appropriate type and the rest of the derived class can downcasting confidently

491606
protected	public
if b wants to do something to a then use a s public or protected interface

491638
restrictions	userid
now you have a problem someone could compromise your location restrictions by simply re-typing the url with a different userid

491642
credentials	account
they may be useful in such things as user activations where you pass in plaintext account credentials from the browser directly though this is easily resolved with a lookup token

491671
virtual-machine	vmware
setup iis in a vmware fusion virtual-machine

491676
selected	button
specify in the advanced tab of the task information panel that all tasks should selected all your tasks and click the task info button to update these properties for all tasks

491676
push	pull
like a lot of work but i think the result is relatively decent -- a super-high-level view of a project that allows for a high degree of day to day flexibility but still affords one a way to reasonably make plans around interdisciplinary activities once this is done we need to buy those four servers make sure our legal stuff is taken care of and pull the triggers on that marketing push one week later etc

491695
if-statement	nested-loops
nested-loops can kill performance and nested if-statement can ofter be reduced down to less levels

491702
rich-internet-application	ria
i m starting to step into unfamiliar territory with regards to performance improvement and our ria rich-internet-application built with gwt

491703
coding-style	indentation

direct3d	gdi
mixing gdi rendering and direct3d rendering into the same windows is a bad idea

491751
directory	folder
in an earlier question i ve found out that sadly solution folder are not real folder inside a directory

491785
if-statement	arrays
if you have some sort of brute force iteration over a 4d arrays then you ve got four levels of nesting automatically and if there s is an if-statement then you have five levels without having a particularly convoluted section of code

491789
value	field
as far as i know all sql databases allow you to set a seed value for the auto-increment field

491792
redland	jena
i know that there are some libraries frameworks like jena redland protã gã but they don t state on which platforms they are known to work

491794
postgresql	oracle
you can do it with databases that use sequences like oracle and postgresql

491818
hide	show
one option you could check would be to add all components to the same panels with just one grouplayout then and hide show them based on user s selection

491818
hide	show
if grouplayout behaves well then it would just be a matter of calling pack each time after user changes his selection to show hide extended fields

491820
jquery	.post
i am trying to use an ajax .post call through the jquery .ajax function to send data to a php file

491821

protected	public
they take it directly off the pda they also need the password as the public key should be protected by the user password

491823
boost	stl
i also avoid using pods and instead use stl boost as much as possible to avoid mem leaks and other nasty things

491836
rounding	currency
i m using 2 for the scale since you said this was for currency but you may choose to use another rounding scale

491847
order	add

491964
python	perl
for setting up environment fill in the db making reports from logs it s a scripting language perl python shell

491977
32-bit	64bit
that did make me think of 32-bit and 64bit difference though

491977
64bit	x86
since sql-server is a 64bit process and my assembly would be hosted in process - i loaded the assemblies from the framework64 folder and system.identitymodel and system.identitymodel.selectors from program files as opposed to program files x86

491992
configuration	environment
not sure if your setup is more complicated but we have a similar problem and we added a custom actions class that updates the configuration files based on the environment which the user selected during installation then you add this custom actions project to your setup project

google-maps	openlayers
i ve recently started using openlayers for internal projects and while google-maps has all the advantages listed above you can do just about everything google-maps can do with openlayers

492166
scriptmanager	updatepanel
you could use a scriptmanager with a form runat server in your control instead updatepanel

492174
decrement	increment
if you re worried about the performance hit you should store a count in the tag table and increment decrement it when you tag or untag an item

492188

492190
abstract	extends
you d make use of the abstract eventdispatcher through encapsulation allowing any other class to easily implement eventsource while not requiring it to extends any particular class

492198
xsd	xml
i know that you cannot fully describe the xml that the tclientdataset with an xsd schema as the row elements have attributes that have names that vary with the contents

492198
xsd	xml
so is there anyone having a partial xsd that describes the metadata portion of the xml that can be saved with delphi tclientdatasets

492198
xsd	xml
i should have written that i did that myself as well but that generating that xsd in a proper way one that covers all possibilities will need input xml that cover all possibilities like roundtrip rowstate etc

492220
versioning	upgrade
does this mean i have to upgrade to the full versioning or is there a way to enable compression in standard edition

492224
reflection	runtime

that solves my problem without touching the hosts

492261
textbox	button
i have a form with several components like textbox and combobox and i need to know when click in the out button if there was any changes in the form

492262
printf	scanf
i know something similar exists in the ansi-c library printf vs scanf

492273

the easiest way to do this would be to simply use a variables on the form named something like ischanged. set it false when the form is initially displayed and set it true if they make any changes

492299
updating	updates
all of the updatespanel will always updates even if the child updatespanel are set to conditional because the parent is actually the one that is updating

492302
buffering	streaming
there s no use in utilizing this class when reading-writing to-from a memorystream but it might be quite useful when doing network or disk io if streaming for these subsystems do not do buffering on their own

492303
buffering	streaming
the normal file i o streaming are already buffering by using a streamreader streamwriter

492303
buffering	streaming
since read write operations on streaming normally use the read write methods that take a byte arrays you will naturally provide some buffering yourself

you can use mouse and keyboard events using win32 programming in visual-studio

492418
webforms	asp.net
we decided to choose php instead of asp.net in part because we didn t want to get stucked in a unflexible paradigm webforms everything-automatic-but-not-so-flexible but i believe a php framework could put us in the same situation

492420
postgresql	mysql
if you use the top solution or limit if you use mysql postgresql sqlite then you can t get the minimum for multiple groups based on name you can only get the minimum for one name

so far my proposed solution is to use a while loops to read bytes into a temp byte arrays until there is a newline character

492479
required	checked
you have to checked required ssl then you can selected the option required client certificates.

492485
radio-button	textbox
also the code to store check the state would have to change for different control types textbox would be the text property but a radio-button would be an index etc

492507
forms-authentication	security
i have a classic asp application currently secured using asp.net forms-authentication running on iis 6 the problem is our purposes require this application implement a single-signon security model using entrust truepass which uses client certificates i believe

i have a git repo that i have deleted four files from using rm not git-rm and my git-status looks like this

492563
oracle	mysql
this is identical to this question but for oracle rather than sql server or mysql

the name comes from w indows o n w indows 64 wow64 which is the name of the translation layer allowing 32-bit applications to use the native 64bit system resources

492630
select	union
you are better of using union query to join the tables first and then select

492630
select	union
also you may consider creating a view for one of the tables so it pulls only the columns you need while renaming them then union and then select from the union

492642
user-controls	treeview
i have a user-controls that contains a treeview

492642
user-controls	treeview
i ve tried creating a public property on the user-controls to the treeview but that only allows me to set a selecteditemchanged triggers

python	perl
well i work in both perl and python and my day job is supporting a network monitoring software

492772
python	perl
if you insist on doing this yourself this can be done in either perl or python - use the one you know best

492772
python	perl
if you re planning on parsing a lot of text it will be easier to do this quick and dirty in perl than it will be in python

492772
python	perl
both can do it but python requires an oop approach and it just isn t as easy as perl s inline regex syntax

492772
python	perl
use libraries - many many people have done this task before you so look around for a suitable lib like net ping in perl or the icmplib in python or this ping.py code

492772
python	perl
this is particularly easy to do in python using either approach so this is one place python will be easier to work with imo than using perl

492777

in my limited experimentation both google-chrome and firefox do the scrolling automatically

492811
margins	padding
it might not be exact if you use any crazy padding or margins but it should be close enough

32-bit	64bit
on 64bit windows 32-bit programs run

493024
windows	wow64

493045
authentication	login
i would like to give them all the same user authentication system so that users will not have to remember separate login credentials for each app

493054

from the api documentation and from your descriptions of the behavior of your application it sounds like an exception-handling is thrown and that there is defined some form of validation callback methods that does something non-fatal like logging a warning and then returns control to the validator one level above the offending element

493059
dockpanel	dock
then set the attached dock property to each button you are adding to bottom before adding to the dockpanel

493653
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to a regular standard enterprise etc sql-server versioning then typically you get a per cpu license for a webserver

493658

493905
ruby-on-rails	django
php django ruby-on-rails flex

493925
ruby-on-rails	django
i dont t think that mixing php django and ruby-on-rails makes sense for a demo.

493950
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
i almost never hear the word cakephp without hearing the word ruby-on-rails shortly afterwards

493951
for-loop	loops
don t think about the situation follow a list of inviolate rules no matter what the situation no matter what you think is the better way if the rules say use a for-loops in case x then you have to use a loops even if you know if there will only be 1 loops from 1 to 1

i think combining php and ruby-on-rails or php and django would make sense but perhaps not combining ruby-on-rails and django

493966
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby-on-rails and django are too similar

493966
ruby-on-rails	django
i suggest combining wordpress or drupal with django or ruby-on-rails

493966
ruby-on-rails	django
perhaps one way you could get both django and ruby-on-rails into the mix would be to use ruby-on-rails for the base of your site and use django as a way to use a python library for something that s done better in python

493966
python	ruby
one example i know of python being used in a ruby app is github which uses pygments a library written in python for source code highlighting

493971

what can be done easily elegantly in a dynamically typed interpreted language that s awkward or impossible in a static language even with templates polymorphism static type inference and maybe runtime reflection

493976
lgpl	gpl
restrict open source licenses eg gpl lgpl

493992
logout	login
in this case inform the user that another login has taken over and call request.getsession .invalidate to logout the user

493995
.net	wcf
i have a friend who is sending wcf objects with both these attributes pre .net 3.5 sp1 and it is working fine

493998
administration	account
i m always working with a self-imposed limited account for security reasons and it always pisses me off that most auto-updatesrs simply assume that i m running as admin and then after downloading just fail and offer no other way of performing the updates other than actually closing the program and running it again in an administration context

494000
command-prompt	cmd
after that the first instance can terminate and allow the command-prompt to resume processing cmd

494009
reflection	runtime
so it s not that you can t do these things in a statically typed language if you have runtime reflection it s just more complicated

494024
lookup	any
the iidentity interface can be implemented on any number of classes which know how to lookup users from a data-store sql-server active-directory etc

494043
digits	zero
to show a value with leading zero up to 8 digits for example set the format to 00000000 then 123 will be display as 00000123

494047
dialog	pop-up
howabout a pop-up windows dialog with a filterable list instead

494049
order	add
you do indeed need to be an admin in order to add or remove performance counters

494054
any	set
the csv file does not quote field values at all but the python 2.4 version of the csv library does not seem to give me any way to turn off quoting it just allows me to set the quote character or whatever

494054
value	field
i can sort of work around this by setting dialect.quotechar to some rare character but this is brittle as there is no ascii character i can absolutely guarantee will not show up in field value except the delimiter but if i set things go predictably haywire

494054
any	set
in python 2.5 and later if i set dialect.quoting to csv.quote_none the csv reader respects that and does not interpret any character as a quote character

494055
having	select
generics which make static types less stupid by letting it select the right type when objects are passed around saving the programmer from having to cast it themselves

494071
hide	show
sharepoint s field editor for lookup fields purposefully hide any columns types that aren t supported by lookup fields but you can create a field editor for your custom field type that show them

494088
selected	checkbox
selected the show formulas in cells instead of their calculated results checkbox and then click ok

494118
python	perl
i find dynamic languages like perl and to a lesser extent python allow me to write quick and dirty scripts for things i need to do

494120
solaris	unix
the script would need to run on solaris and use as few as possible external libraries as possible definitely pure classic perl getting anything additional installed on these unix boxes is a pain and would have to be done by remote team

494138
firefox	opera
also since you can t take up 100 of the parent block i used 90 and it produced working results under firefox not sure about ie or opera

494154
firefox	opera
the contenteditable property works in safari firefox 3 and opera 9

494225
driver	kernel
some people claims that driver has to be in the kernel which is not true

494235
javascript	dom
and yeah i can just split up the stylesheets into different media types but i d first like to figure out whether or not i can just reliably pull the media type out of the dom with javascript completely independently of css

494235
javascript	dom
oh and i ve tried that trick of hide an element for the print view then check to see if it s visible with javascript but that s always resulted in when i load up print preview javascript detemining that the supposed-to-be-hidden elements are visible and performing whatever dom manipulation i tell it to despite the fact that those elements aren t visible

494249
dialog	pop-up
now i know i could use this example for how to show a please wait dialog and on completion just show another pop-up with the returned data

494254
versioning	upgrade
there s a free versioning of an obfuscator shipped with visual-studio which can be upgrade to industrial strength

494254
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
obfuscation rendering code incomprehensible without altering it s behaviour and hence presents a real barrier to reverse-engineering

494260
object-reference	instances
edit the error i m getting is the object-reference is not set to an instances to an object

494261
any	set
any problem that smells like it could be memory related is a prime candidate for a heap-corruption bug if you re coding in c++ and that could cause result set problems

494289
put	get
if you want it to be completely automatic you d have to put all the correct values into an arrays and get the computer to compare them

494352
margins	padding
don t use margins and padding on the same parts of an element

494379
export	csv
still for a quick fix you could export to quoted csv and then import using vbscript

494400
javascript	dom
i m under the impression that as long as you set yourself up for notifications your code will be called for all changes to the dom whether done on page load or dynamically by javascript following the page load

494422
order	join
well since it does allow left outer join you re right you can just rearrange the join order

494430
logout	login
further it must exclude the period between logout and the next event presumably a login

494430
order	join
the self-join between the table on the name column and then the asymmetric join on the time column using ensures that events are in time order

494502
contains	set
i need to be able to specify a set with k elements and have every set with k+1 elements or more that contains the specified subset returned to me

494502
perl	c++
if it matters i am writing this program in c++ though i also know java c some assembly some fortran and some perl

494502
contains	set
3. each number within a processed set actually contains at least two numbers 14 bits for the data itself detected energy and 7 bits for metadata detector number

494502
contains	set
in a preliminary glance through some of the chunks of the data i find that i have sets that contains as many as 22 numbers but the median is 5 numbers per set and the average is 6 numbers per set

494503
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
cakephp is like a cheap bastardized ripoff of ruby-on-rails

494503
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
cakephp has an ajax helper that does something similar to the ajax-related helper methods in ruby-on-rails so yes in some way it s also true

494503
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
but cakephp is really an exercise in futility its authors wrote it so they wouldn t have to learn ruby even though learning ruby and ruby-on-rails together is probably easier than figuring out the monstrous mess that is cakephp

494503
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
since y all asked my biggest complaint about cakephp is how it manages to totally butcher the conveniences of object-oriented programming sure it implements the active record pattern just as much as ruby-on-rails does but it makes you pass around data structures

494503
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
people say ruby is slow but my own ruby-on-rails apps run faster than their cakephp equivalents last i checked

494508
highlight	selected
far more useful is to selected the option created and still living then highlight regions of the graph where memory increases but it never goes down if you expect it would

494530
perl	c++
i am embedding perl in a c++ application that uses smartheap

494530
pointers	stack
the pointers is â œwildâ uninitialized is allocated on stack local variables or is otherwise invalid

494530
decrement	increment
the pointers was increment or decrement since the time of allocation

494530
16-bit	x86
for 16-bit x86 the pointer was cast to a near pointer after allocation in which case the segment portion of the pointer has been lost

494538
web-services	api
expose your .net api as asmx web-services and you should be good to go

494553
contains	set
usually you won t have to set the java_home unless your appliaction is looking for resources from jdk lib tools.jar which contains compiler

494555
contains	set
if there are 16 entries per set then on average each of these 2 16 files will contains the ids of 2 20 sets

494596
rollback	commit
if there is then it registers itself with the transaction to take part in the commit rollback sequences which transaction controls and might propogate to varying transaction coordinators such as kernel distributed etc.

494598
constructor	object
i d suggest making only the constructor private and return a shared_ptr to the object instead

494602
quadtree	octree
break up all the primitives into a quadtree octree 2d 3d

494602
quadtree	octree
a general visitor pattern is used to walk the quadtree octree

494602
duplicates	contains
because the tree leaves can contains duplicates references to geometry the walker marks nodes as being visited and ignores them thereafter

494602
frame-rate	fps
i have found that in these types of applications you want your frame-rate as high as possible 20 fps at a minimum

494603
contains	set
i need the ones which contains this set of words. you just have very conveniently integers instead of words and smallish documents

494604
msbuild	nant
i installed cc.net months ago it took me a whole night to configure it and create the xml configuration and i have no regrets about it it smoothly integrates with svn nunit nant or msbuild

494611
overlap	padding
the arrays also starts at the same address and subject to no padding in the structures the elements overlap the two structures

494633
any	set
interestingly i don t know what originally set this and don t see any other exposed place to do so

494653
debugging	trace
i want to use the trace macros to get output in the debugging windows in visual-studio 2005 in a non- mfc c++ project but which additional header or library is needed

494665
debugging	trace
trace is only enabled in debugging builds

494669
double-quotes	single-quotes
you can get around this by using single-quotes and alternating with double-quotes

494678
triggers	insert
can i use a triggers in mysql to create a new database when a value is insert into another database

494718
databound	gridview
i know i can do this manually by building an html table myself but i was hoping that there was a way to use a databound control gridview

494745
lgpl	gpl
you can make a derivative work of any project based on one of the popular licenses gpl lgpl apache mit bsd

494760
typedef	struct
the line typedef float vertex const vert means that vert is a pointer to a float member of the vertex struct

494762
directory	folder
for unix based os i-node look-up algorithms are highly efficient and number of files and folder in a directory does not matter

494766
32-bit	64bit
a reference is a pointer in disguise so it s 4 bytes on 32-bit machines and 8 bytes on 64bit machines

494785
any	set
the first parameter to apply indicates the value of this within the callback and can be set to any value

494812
hash	md5
we structured them with md5 hash usernames 3 levels deep ie

494818
malloc	free
closest thing we ve done with malloc free for debugging is to

494818
linux	aix
aix 5l is supposed to be much more like linux hence the l so it may be able to do exactly what you require

494833
required	checked
the sole exception-handling to this is a checked for null on required arguments

494853
persistence	hibernate
speaking as someone who spent quite a bit of time working with jpa java persistence api basically the standardized orm api for java j2ee ejb which include hibernate eclipselink toplink openjpa and others i ll share some of my observations

494879
textbox	button
add an extra save button outside the gridview and iterate the gridrows find the textbox in each row and use it to update the database

494884
repository	entity
i have inherited from the class entity generated in the data context but am having trouble with the casting in my repository

494884
base-class	inherited
how can i get the base-class linq result to cast up to the inherited employee class while still maintaining its db state so i can submit changes

494900
selected	checkbox
doing this will show the dialog regardless of what the user had selected for the remember checkbox

494911
function-overloading	function-call
first is that function-overloading almost never works when calling a function from debugger so i had to pass type as a second parameter and the function-call occasionally crashes though it works perfectly when called from within code

494921
malloc	free
allocation from the loh is done via a free list much like malloc is handled in the c runtime whereas allocations from the generational heap is essentially done by just moving a pointers in generation 0

494922
google-chrome	firefox
the following checkboxes are properly vertically centered in ie safari firefox and google-chrome even if the text size is very small or large

494925
spaces	output
the first file with a spaces in its name will bork the scripting if you use the default newline terminator output of find

494928
build-server	msbuild
i m setting up my first build-server for .net 3.5 projects and found this interesting line in the msbuild log after a successful build of a simple test application

494949
silverlight	wpf
i am working in a legacy non web system that cannot directly use wpf silverlight controls

494954
groovy	java
i would say java too so they can support ruby with jruby compatible with python with jython groovy and so on

494980
quicktime	vlc
both quicktime and vlc do it that way i don t know for the other client

494990
user-interface	look-and-feel
that would give you a direct way of seeing how the user-interface code looks like in an application that has a look-and-feel and user-interface complexity level suser-interfaceting your tastes in a language you already know

495048
defined	declare
now imagine a scenario where a templates function is declare in a.h defined in a.cpp and used in b.cpp

495078
assign	add
the idea behind account entity was that as of now the site only needs to handle employees but in the future they may want to add vehicles etc to the system the system is used to assign costs to an entity so for this purpose an employee is handled the same as a vehicle

495090
png	gif
as an extra tip opacity and png s or gif s with transparent backgrounds don t tend to play nicely in ie6 and i would strongly recommend you use a javascript library such as prototype or jquery if you are working with javascript

495096
uiimage	nsdata
i m using uiimagepngrepresentation to convert uiimage object to nsdata and then posting the image

495100
magento	moodle
a solution which looks promising to me is jfusion which is an open-source bridge to combine several different systems in terms of structure and user authentication - this is built around joomla but supports moodle and several forum software products along with magento ecommerce

495108
exception-handling	try-catch
you should have code for exception-handling anyway wether in advices or try-catch blocks

495133
factors	matrix
you can store a matrix of conversion factors where

495136
getter	setter
it should be noted that it s not good practice to use public instance-variables you should always create getter setter to have proper encapsulation

495145
binaries	install
again the most common practice is to install compiled binaries of the compiler and use them to compile anything else including the compiler itself and the kernel

495159
png	gif
they will already be png gif or jpeg images

495160
solaris	linux
apart from the highly recommended stevens books providing a detailed description of one implementation check out the source in linux or solaris or one of the bsd s

495161
hash	md5
i have sets of hash first 64 bits of md5 so they re distributed very randomly and i want to be able to see if a new hash is in a set and to add it to a set

495164
filenotfoundexception	nullpointerexception
i am guessing filenotfoundexception nullpointerexception ioexception

495170
credentials	security
think i successfully made a managed wrapperclass to the credentials api functions mentioned here with a little help from there at least the win32-errorcodes returned from that functions are zero or other but expected 1168 from creddelete if calling it twice and the appropriate values are stored at the correct place in the registry hklm comm security credman 1..

495171
dialog	pop-up
where freakout did something like clear out the text field or pop-up a warning dialog

495172
perl	ruby
ruby python perl or pseudo-code is fine for me

495174
export	report
i would therefore like to display a message at the top of report when more than 256 columns are shown in the matrix advising users of this limitation and suggesting the workaround of export to csv and viewing in excel 2007 if they have it

495177
contains	sorted
separate-chain the hash themselves by doing something like using the first 10 bits of your hash to index into one of 1024 individual files each of which contains a sorted list of all the hash starting with those 10 bits

495182
.net	wcf
another point to use the current version is that dublin microsoft new app server will be built on wcf wf .net 4.0 but will gladly host 3.5 wf s

495189
triggers	insert
is there any way i can force this insert to fail short of creating a triggers for inserts

495216
google-chrome	opera
tried the following code in ie7 mozilla 2 google-chrome 1 opera 9.5 safari 3.2 and it works

495236
configuration	installation
i have read visual-studio uses its own directory configuration and the gac another and .net installation another

495244
32-bit	64bit
i would use this as a sanity check at the end of a build-process on an sdk to make sure that the 64bit version hasn t somehow got some 32-bit dll files in it and vice versa

495264
environment	building
we are constantly breaking each others building environment because eclipses .classpath file is checked into version-control and we include different swt libraries for our machines

495272
stdin	pipe
you can then send commands such as load pause etc over a fifo pipe or to stdin of the subprocess

495282
solaris	linux
i m not a vim expert as i only use it to edit system configuration on aging linux solaris servers but are you really sure you want to do this

495285
asterisk	ivr
i ve worked with ivr in the past but mainly with large systems and have never used asterisk

495290
asterisk	ivr
freepbx makes it really easy to set up an ivr - got a decent web-based front end and supports some cool asterisk tools out of the box

495300
contains	elements
when using the parameters option this value is the elements and contains a string

495300
command-line	cmd
basically there is no difference other then the control you retain when running the wsdl.exe cmd from the cmd-line

495315
credentials	account
the account that the windows service runs under does have the rights to call the web service but i can t figure out how to get those credentials and send them off to the web service

495318
google-chrome	firefox
and i find that although this works in firefox google-chrome and anything

495321
dialog	pop-up
in vs2005 opening a file causes a dialog to pop-up contacting server to get a list of items to update .

495325
python	perl
these are perl or python or whatever language scripts that implement your ivr logic

495354
joomla	drupal
no idea what the site is going to be but have you thought of using a pre-build cms like drupal joomla etc etc

495362
wing-ide	komodo
between komodo and wing-ide i would go for wing

495376
sql-server	oracle
target db is for the current client is oracle but the app can be configured to run on sql-server as well

495391
having	select
most generic solution would be to execute queries with select clause having the expected coulmns and from clause having table names within try catch block

495405
sql-server	oracle
lastly you don t say what is slightly different but sometimes these are unavoidable oracle uses sequences sql-server uses identities

495418
m2eclipse	maven
i m using the m2eclipse plugin to handle maven modules in eclipse

495425
contains	elements
plugins management contains plugins elements in much the same way except that rather than configuring plugins information for this particular project build it is intended to configure project builds that inherit from this one

495499
private-members	object
if that doesn t work try defining your callbacks confirm_action cancel_action as private-members of your object

495511
defined	declare
actually the c++ standard defined the export keyword that would make it possible to simply declare templates in a header file and implements them elsewhere

495528
vbscript	jscript
when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection

495540
put	get
i will put variabless into another variables and then it will get re-initialized to default values

495573
arrays	loops
collect should be used to filter arrays results not to loops over them

495574
credentials	security
if you manually log in using the dialog does it store anything at the expected credentials registry key hklm comm security credman 1..

495574
credentials	ntlm
if you do manual ntlm authentication with explorer for example does the browser pop up the credentials dialog

495591
base-class	inherited
if you inherited from the collection base-class to extend instead of using list of t - what advantages do you get

495595
python	php
i ve looked at the python time module and can t find anything that gives the integer of how many seconds since 1970 as php does with time

495597
textbox	button
i need to get a value from a textbox inside a footertemplate in the onclick event of a button

495613
versioning	upgrade
versioning is it reasonable to force all customers to upgrade at the same time

495629
triggers	insert
however i do not want to disable all triggers and not even for a batch of commands but just for one single insert

495629
triggers	insert
when i try to insert it the triggers overwrite the existing product code not the identity numeric id

495629
triggers	insert
so is there a way to disable triggers even just one for just one insert

495645
hosts-file	hosts
that should avoid any confusions and you d not have to edit the hosts every time

495647
dictionary	arrays
i now want to store an associative arrays of drive letters to map key is the drive letter value is the network path and have tried using dictionary hybriddictionary and hashtable for this but i always get the following error when calling configfile.load or configfile.save

495662
similarity	distance
i probably need similarity defined as a levenstein-like distance

495676
textbox	button
the webpage is really tiny - it has only a login form and an action form with a dozen textbox and a button

495676
textbox	button
i won t be using any of their controls anyway - just textbox and button

495679
attributes	properties
a workaround would be to use the xmlignore attributes to hide those properties from the serialization and expose them via a list of serialization key-value pairs

495706
triggers	insert
the best way would be to alter the triggers itself so it makes the decision if it needs to run whether that be with an insert type flag on the table or some other means if you are already storing a type of some sort

495738
similarity	distance
also minimal edit distance by itself may not be very useful if what you are after is similarity in speech rather than in written form if so consider a stemming soundex pass first or some other sense of similarity

495741
scala	java
how do i iterate over a java collection in scala without using the verbose while hasnext getnext style of loop

495765
sql-server	oracle
unlike oracle sql-server indexes null values so it s possible to use a null to mark an ultimate ancestor

495774
object-reference	instances
the problem i m seeing is that when i try to navigate to form index i get object-reference not set to an instances of an object. on the code behind of home index.aspx.vb

495787
configuration	environment
you may have a library set in your .bash_profile or similar shell configuration or perhaps by other means setting proper ruby ruby-on-rails environment locomotive or other all-in-one environment

495793
windows-mobile	windows-ce
they are not completely undocumented - the documentation for windows-ce and windows-mobile mention them 2 and they are included in the header files

495817
qmail	exim
other good choices are exim and qmail

495830
triggers	insert
if you insert using bulk insert you can disable triggers just for the insert

495832
display	width
some experimentation reveals that the declared size of a form apparently affects the size of objects in the scale length and width units per screen inch of the form when display as a maximized mdi child

495854
order	add
in order to add contracts to properties i would add constraints to the set property but in this specific case i think it would be better writing a class that could actually encapsulate the requirements allowing the construction of good objects only

495854
strong-typing	types
i think that dbc works better with strong-typing at least because it let you add more requirements to types and to functions

495862
xts	zoo
xts and zoo handle irregular time-series data on top of that

495877
spring	grails
maybe take a simple story feature keep the existing services it uses and get them wired in via spring in grails

495881
double	int
that data type can still basically act the same whether it s a double or an int

495886
getter	setter
having complex logic in getter setter is not a good practice

495887
enumerator	any
enumerators are disposable and when the enumerator is disposed -- foreach disposes it for you at the end of the loop -- garbage-collection will feel free to clean up any objects that are in your iterator

495888
any	set
though it s perfectly fine to iterate over an in-memory collection of objects i wouldn t recomment doing any kind of heavy lifting in either get or set parts

495894
naming-conventions	conventions
i m a little unclear about some conventions which the question action naming-conventions only partially covers

495902
triggers	insert
identity will return the wrong value if there are triggers onthe table that also do insert to other tables with identity fields

495903
processor	cpu
one ec2 compute unit provides the equivalent cpu capacity of a 1.0-1.2 ghz 2007 opteron or 2007 xeon processor

495908
background-color	font-size
do you try to keep positional css layout separate from color flavor css color background-color background-images font-size and family

495913
getter	setter
if this was on a domain entity then i wouldn t be in favor having complex logic in a getter and especially not a setter

495914
getter	setter
i think that there is some level of logic that is expected in getter and setter otherwise you just have a kind of convoluted way to declare your members public

495924
literals	hardcode
you probably want to do something other than just return a hardcode string literals but i m sure you get the idea -

495925
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
the enterprise library client system.data.oracleclient is a viable alternative to the odp.net provider from oracle

495931
linux	unix
but for unix and linux so make sure you always use the right one

495937
hash	md5
when an md5 hash algorithm is specified the probability of hashbytes returning the same result for two different inputs is much lower than that of checksum

495942
compact-framework	.net
it is supported in .net compact-framework 3.5 and 2.0

495953
configuration-files	web-config
i am not necessarily concerned about the web-config as much as i am concerned about some of the other configuration-files that are present in the application

495965
binary	octal
however if you convert to binary octal or hexadecimal negative numbers are displayed in twos complement so convert.tostring -7 16 becomes ffffffba

495968
any	set
my question is this if i set up a subversion server do i gain any functionality that i don t already have

495974
scala	java
this will allow you to use a scala for -loop with any java iterator

495975
naming-conventions	getter
i like your naming-conventions and i agree entirely with using content such as your example in property getter if you re delivering an api to be used with binding

fontfamily	font-size
firstly if you re catching yourself setting color font-size fontfamily style rules over and over you re wasting your time

495977
contains	any
so to answer your question yes i usually have a global.css file that defines all of my fonts and colors for h1-h5 a p and any other tags that will contains text

495985
ubuntu	linux
our web app is written in django we are running on linux ubuntu under apache + fast cgi with postgresql database

profiling	trace
i think you re going to be farther ahead using standard optimization techniques first -- check your execution plan profiling trace etc

496026
required	checked
i opened the receiver and found it was using a shift register to checked the codes and no delay was required between attempts

496041
silverlight	wpf
i ve done a couple of wpf and silverlight projects and i have terrible graphic design skills

496047
uclibc	libc
set which versioning of gcc binutils libc gnu or uclibc threading and linux kernel to build and crosstool-ng does the rest downloads the tar balls configure the tools and builds them

496069
interface-builder	iboutlet
the simple way create an iboutlet in your class usually the file s owner and in interface-builder connect this iboutlet to the nsarraycontroller

496071
json	xml
then as the results are returned in json you ll want to take a look at json.net which will allow you to convert the json to more c# friendly xml

496076
pointers	stack
the only problem with isbadreadptr that i ve read about is that the bad pointers might be pointing to and so you might accidentally touch a stack s guard page

496093
.when	ready
.when you know a client is doing something wrong have the facts ready as to why and present them quickly and in plain english

496098
document-ready	.when
.when the page loads in the document-ready function we are making a fake webservice call to eliminate the initial delay

496113
mobile-devices	blackberry
i am looking for some advice on memory usage on mobile-devices blackberry in particular

496124
docking	toolbar
i haven t found a good simple solution to stopping the toolbar from being dragged yet while docking next to each other you can remove the cbrs_gripper style however that doesn t stop the toolbar from being dragged

496124
docking	toolbar
however dockpaneleftof does not seem to work in this case so you lose docking toolbar next to each other

496124
docking	toolbar
so it seems like one or the other right now if you want to stop docking or dock toolbar next to each other

496144
oracle	mysql
the idea of a subroutine to reduce duplication or otherwise is largely foreign to other database platforms in my experience oracle ms sql sybase mysql sqlite in the main

496149
toolchain	buildroot
a href rel noreferrer buildroot a is a tool i ve had reasonably good luck with for building a custom uclibc-based toolchain from scratch

496166
python	c++
we have an o rm that has c++ and c# actually com bindings in fost.3 and we re putting together the python bindings which are new in version 4 together with linux and mac support

496167
reference-type	generics
there may be other cases involving generics where is is useful because you may not know whether t is a reference-type or not so you can t use as but they re relatively obscure

496178
margins	padding
margins and padding are sometimes needed for the layout and sometimes used just for formatting

496192
operators	keyword
one of the more subtle difference between the two is that the as keyword can not be used for casting when a cast operators is involved

496192
operators	keyword
this will not compile although i think it did in previous versioning on the last line since the as keyword do not take cast operators into account

496200
any	set
set the performance levels if any and then monitor them

496213
environment	building
tracking the cmakelists.txt files and then generate a valid building environment

496221
contains	set
it is important that each of the index files contains the same number for the same set

496255
webserver	security
the whole purpose of course is to a not store any username password anywhere on the webserver web.config and b provide an abstracted security model that can be managed in active directory

496258
http	ssl
ssl through http is sort of a cooperative venture with the destination server

496258
http	ssl
if you re encrypting the stream with ssl it should be safe to use http basic auth

496273
background-process	restart
a queue into which you can put timed events a database-table would do nicely and a background-process either running continuously or restart frequently that pulls events scheduled to occur since the last execution or those that are imminent i suppose and actions them

496276
filtering	sorting
the date filtering in the nvarchar field is not easy possible as the data in the index is sorted lexicographically which doesn t match the sorting you would expect for the date

496276
value	field
so you should use a date field and convert the string value to date

496298
zend-studio	komodo
i use linux and windows but it doesn t really matter because on both i use the same editors activestate komodo and zend-studio both of which are also available for mac

496300
contains	set
you can set and then use onfilterrecord event and check if detail dataset contains requested value this can be done in loop or with locate procedure of dataset

496302
margins	padding
.element margins padding layout stuff

496312
arguments	undefined
some standard quotes to especially show how pointers arguments are not converted to auto-magically and how the whole thing is undefined behavior

496312
arguments	default
the default argument promotions are performed on trailing arguments

496312
arguments	undefined
if there is no actual next arguments or if type is not compatible with the type of the actual next arguments as promoted according to the default arguments promotions the behavior is undefined except for the following cases

496312
unsigned-integer	int
one type is a signed int type the other type is the corresponding unsigned-int

496312
arguments	default
well here is what that default arguments promotion is

496312
arguments	default
these are called the default arguments

496318
hosts-file	hosts
you could updates your hosts to alias your machinename to devserver

496346
malloc	free
and i know it s early in your development but you ll want to make sure you free the memory that you malloc

496354
rewrite	rule
will i have to add a rewrite rule for every page where i use get

496358
expression-blend	silverlight
if you are just starting with silverlight then i highly recomend also installing expression-blend 2 with sp1

496362
select	union
if you want rows from table a and rows from table b just use two select statements separated by a union command

496364
firefox	opera
this code doesn t work as intended in ie6 7 it might work in ie8 i tested it and works correctly in firefox 3 safari 3.1.2 opera 9.50 and camino 1.6.6

496369
xsd	xml
in java i can validate an xml document against an xsd schema using javax.xml.validation.validator or against a dtd by simply parsing the document using org.xml.sax.xmlreader

496376
pkcs#12	pfx
pfx files are actually pkcs#12 files part of a specifications by the rsa grouping

496381
arguments	default
the problem is that there won t be any conversions applied to variables arguments aside from the default argument promotion ie you have to do the cast explicitly yourself

496381
arguments	default
this means only the default arguments promotion will be done which as litb pointed out does not include a conversion to

496407
base-class	inherited
so if you are using these to compare base-class and derivedclass which inherited from base-class then

496427
hosts-file	hosts
i think that s easier to me but the hosts solution should work just as well

496430
value	field
in a c# 2.0 i have a list of field and a list of value stored as strings a table name and an odbc connection

496459
constructor	object
when a derived object is being constructed before the body of the derived class constructor is called the base class constructor must complete

496459
constructor	object
before the derived class constructor is called the dynamic type of the object under construction is a base class instance and not a derived class instance

496474
object-files	extern
if each file in your program is first compiled to an object file then the object-files are linked together you need extern

496482
buffering	streaming
stringbuilder does not need functionality that streaming provides like buffering etc to build a resource

496486
stringbuilder	stringwriter
use the stringwriter class if you want a stream that wraps a stringbuilder

496489
defined	declare
functions actually defined in other source files should only be declare in headers

496498
filtering	sorting
if you want to bind without dipping into code-behind whenever your query logic changes you re probably better off using a collectionviewsource since it has sorting and filtering capabilities assuming that s what you re after from using linq

496500
decrement	increment
also this does not actually lock the resource that being done by increment or decrement the semaphore value

496506
child-process	spawn
instead i figure you can spawn a child-process to do the dirty work grab the output from the child-process let the child-process die as soon as possible after that and then expect the o s to do the garbage-collection

496582
python	c++
i m a c++ programmer just starting to learn python

496586
constructor	object
the second form is useful if the object s constructor applies the first incref

496586
ref	out
otherwise your object would have a ref count of 2 and when the smart pointers went out of scope it still wouldn t free the object

496594
default	reset
reset.css - a reset css file can be used to â œresetâ all the default browser styling which can help make it easier to achieve cross-browser compatibility

496598
licensing	lgpl
other than because of the lgpl licensing

496606
abstract	extends
if are supposed to implement models by extends abstract models listeners by extends adapters but that s it

496626
command-line	cmd
you can setup explicit command-line cmd within freecap but you have to setup each individually which kind of defeats the purpose

496641
defined	declare
local scoped variables otoh should be defined closest to when they are used except in c--which i believe still required variables to be declare at the beginning of a methods

496655
constructor	object
you know that once an object s constructor has run all of it s fields have been initialized

496664
getter	setter
a very simple tutorial that show object creation use simple getter and setter would be fine and deletion would be fantastic

496677
textbox	button
i created a new windows placed a couple of button and textbox and whenever i change the size of the windows all the controls get resized

496692
stringbuilder	stringwriter
the stringwriter implements textwriter against an underlying stringbuilder

496692
stringbuilder	stringwriter
then in your test instead of instantiating a streamwriter you instantiate a stringwriter and you could then check what was written by looking at the underlying stringbuilder

496701
instance-variables	class-variables
it sounds like you re talking about instance-variables and not class-variables

496701
instance-variables	class-variables
note that in the following code a is a class-variables and b is an instance-variables

496713
revision	svn
i had another project like this but as there were no revision i did svn delete and then svn import and that worked well

496713
svnadmin	dump
i suspect that i need to go down the svnadmin dump load path so i have done

496717
google-chrome	firefox
for example firefox safari chromium or google-chrome and my other next-gen browsers do not lose focus when using a scrollbar

496723
directory	folder
all svn export does is move the chosen directory s to a new location without the .svn folder so it acts as if it s not a working copy and from there you can add it to your working copy

496724
for-loop	arrays
if you re really using arrays the best way is probably just to use the conventional for-loop with indices

496728
dictionary	arrays
instead of creating two seperate arrayss you could make a two-dimensional arrays or a dictionary which would be better

496776
shell	tcsh
to simplify invocation for csh tcsh or similar shell

496789
digits	base
i have a 100 digits string which represents a number in base 10 that i want to convert to either a string representing the number in base 2 or a bool arrays which represents the number s digitss in binary

496794
put	get
put it on once and get happy

496802
required	checked
for example software which confirms to sil -2 safety integrity level and above may required continual checked on ram in order to detect any possible data corruption

496805
installation	uninstall
so i looked around and decided to uninstall the rest of the minimal installation of sql-server 2005 express on my computer by following microsoft s advice in kb 909967 how to uninstall an instance of sql-server 2005 manually. that bit was very successful

496813
thickbox	jquery
thickbox for jquery for example

496814
progress-bar	progress
in my python program to upload a file to the internet im using a gtk progress-bar to show the upload progress

496822
average	max
i know know how to determine the average and max row size but i don t know how that relates to actual rows page

496825
hotmail	gmail
i want to use this templates as an email newsletter templates but i ve heard people say hotmail yahoo and gmail offer limited support for css

496839
defined	declare
the only reason to use extern at all in a source file is to declare functions and variables which are defined in other source files and for which no header file is provided

496846
fogbugz	trac
fogbugz trac and request tracker were either strongly recommended or suggested more than once

496846
fogbugz	svn
for managing files i am using a mixture between fogbugz dropbox svn and unison

496847
32-bit	64bit
can 32-bit and 64bit java be simultaneously installed on vista x64

496864
versioning	upgrade
pick the versioning of a family of processor with the smallest amount of flash on the grounds that you can always upgrade later unless costs make this unavoidable

496866
button	popup
when user clicks on add link button i was thinking have a popup windows with the little form and a save button

496906
documentation-generation	epydoc
a documentation-generation system such as epydoc can be used as a reference for what instance class-variables an object has and if you re worried about accidentally creating new variables via typos you can use pychecker to check your code for this

496916
zipfile	archive
when i run the above zip task it tells me that there are 0 files to archive in essence it makes an empty zipfile

496918
extends	sealed
additionally string is sealed so you can t extends it by inheriting

496968
primitive-types	reference-type
instanceof can only be used with reference-type not primitive-types

496993
coldfusion	.post
on a semi related note i found a very neat .post about encoding and reading 2d matrix barcodes in coldfusion

496995
progress-bar	progress
more than likely the issue is that in your progress callback which is where i presume you re updating the progress-bar you re not making a call to manually update the display run through the gui s event loop

497016
defined	declare
in c extern is implied for function-prototypes as a prototype declare a function which is defined somewhere else

497020
subtract	add
i have looked at and understand a javascript to manipulate and display a single date add or subtract but am unable to get that date in a cell as well as figure out how to display the other multiple dates mentioned above in a html table

497025
contains	set
so basically is there anyway to append to a set while iterating over it or is there an easier way to make a list act like a set rather than manually checking contains

497031
value	field
to the question at hand - i think this might be a bug in our templates that refuses to stick a value into the pk field

497034
floor	ceil
see also ceil floor and trunc

497040
floor	ceil
you can try ceil and floor to round up and down

497040
floor	ceil
ceil and floor only work on double s though

497048
tostring	indexof
so indexof 4 will find nothing because 4 is an int and even tostring would convert it to of 4 and not 4 and nothing will get removed

497063
put	get
the main reason i see to make at least the get synchronized is that if it is very expensive to miss in the cache and you don t want multiple threads each going out to get a value to put back in the cache

497093
contains	any
one other problem with using varchar or any other string datatype is that the data likely contains invalid dates as they are not automatically validated on entry

497103
restart	daemon
another plus for mod_wsgi set a maximum-requests parameter in your wsgidaemonprocess directive and mod_wsgi will restart the daemon process every so often

497117
rollback	commit
updlock will prevent anyone reading the data until you commit or rollback

497121
selected	textbox
i d selected last name from the drop down list and enter smith into a textbox control

497144
google-chrome	firefox
edit it looks like ie did not have everything wrong after all this is part of html5 draft and seems to be supported by the latest version of google-chrome safari and firefox at least

497146
freebsd	linux
is this possible under freebsd and linux

497148
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
if your application code comes from a case-insensitive collation database it may not run on a case-sensitive collation database if a object is misreferenced you would get a message when you attempted to run the statement or create the stored procedure or in a stored-proc architecture you would catch all these pretty quickly unless you had a significant amount of dynamic sql

497151
duplicates	contains
i think something like this will do what i want i m not concerned that the first set contains duplicates only that the subobjects may point to the same objects

497155
constructor	object
of course the constructor for foo has to allocate the separate object and the destructor has to destroy it

497156
cryptography	security
what are the most common security problems specific to cryptography that i need to understand

497159
contains	set
why not create an additional set that contains the entire set of objects

497166
base-class	inherited
how can i get the base-class linq result to cast up to the inherited employee class

497172
global-variables	call
you could have a global-variables in the dll and an extra entry point to set it which you call after calling setwindowshookex

497175
.when	ready
.when the user presses save the object is received on the server side ready to be saved

497205
required	checked
you can also set up your source code control to required that some or all tests pass before checked in

497206
cryptography	security
what are the most common security problems specific to cryptography that i need to understand

497217
deployment	install
is it better in a long run if i install ubuntu on my laptop or are the problems with deployment so miniscule i can go with whatever the hell i like on dev

497219
host	root
you would only need one button directory at the root of the host

497221
ubuntu	debian
the problems with deployment especially between debian and ubuntu are so miniscule you can go on without worrying about it

497230
radio-button	selected
selected radio-button control in the

497230
selected	button
however in your case assuming you re having trouble setting the selected item it might be because you haven t specified the grouping attribute on the radio button

497263
sql-server	postgresql
sorry this is not possible with ms sql-server possible though with postgresql

497269
macros	vba
i tried adding a macros to the document_open method in the vba for the template project but it errors out

497273
javascript	dom
option 2 generate the markup in javascript and then inject it into the dom

497275
contains	elements
this will also work if you are expecting your enumerable to contains exactly one elements - however it will throw an exception-handling if it is either empty or larger than one elements

497322
python	c++
i use it to document a large mixed c++ and python game application framework and it s working well

497327
postback	ajax
i ve had this problem when i was missing the microsoftajax.js include because the ajax postback failed due to missing javascript classes and thus it invoked the normal form post

497332
deployment	install
it needs a runtime install separately so deployment is different from the languages that make runnable binaries

497332
scala	java
scala runs on the jvm and can be used as a functional language with advanced features or as simply a souped-up java or both

497333
ocaml	sml
ml family sml ocaml f#

497337
average	min
as for what value to selected when the points overlap you can do min max median average etc

497344
jquery	dojo
i m not a dojo user but the common idiom from jquery and prototype is the delay property which also seems to be present in dojo

497346
.net	csla
csla insulates developers from the gotcha s of the .net framework and the ever changing architectural topology at microsoft

497349
hash	md5
stuff you cannot avoid except by being as up-to-date as possible new attack against a hash function or an encryption function see recent md5 talk new attack technique see recent attacks against protocols that send encrypted voice over the network

497353
directory	folder
what i m trying to do is create a powershell scripting which gets a list of folders in a directory which is filtering by a regular expression screening out folder names with nnnnnnx31 or nnnnnnddd where n alpha chars for the first 6 characters and the last 3 is either numbers of the static string x31

497371
selected	button
i m not sure how you re selected the menu but i ll work on the principle that there s an initial menu button set with null as it s parameter and each subsequent click holds the next parameter in sequence dynamically which seems to match your comments

497377
command-line	cmd
this cmd works as expected when invoked from a cmd-line or batch file

497393
expression-blend	designer
for the designer side expression-blend is what you will want

497407
hashtable	set
why not implement your own simple hashtable or hash set

497420
logging	trace
i ve been going through it removing all calls to trace and replacing it with calls into the logging framework using the built in mx.logging stuff

497453
windows-mobile	windows-ce
when building the windows-mobile cab for our product the windows-ce cab wizard cabwiz.exe sometimes returns the error

497456
curly-braces	parentheses
it s supposed to be parentheses not curly-braces

497460
.net	wcf
wcf has built-in support for publish-subscribe scenarios and already contains all the functionality of .net remoting and web services from what i understand

497479
shell	bash
the same mechanism works for bash or korn shell

497479
any	set
you could also add after the option to relay any other arguments which might then make the shell usable as a general set environment and execute command tool

497495
push	pull
wouldn t this just be a standard linked-list except you only define functions to pull off the head element and push stuff onto the tail element

497495
doubly-linked-list	linked-list
you could even do this in a singly linked-list with a tail pointer rather than a fully doubly-linked-list

497497
return-type	arguments
if you only want the type be arguments return-type of a methods you can do it by templatizing this methods eg

497522
expression	evaluation
is there some way of evaluation an expression in the sql selected list and getting a returnable result

497569
attributes	properties
in general every element available in the app.config file has an associated class in .net code and every attributes or child element has an associated properties in the specified class

497571
google-chrome	firefox
i ve got this working in firefox and google-chrome

497584
textbox	button
i can change the textbox value via javascript but when i click on update button to update the database

497589
inherited	subclass
when a subclass inherited from iterator it does this

497621
value	field
however there are some limitations on which field can be sorted on - they need to be indexed but not tokenize and the value convertible to string s float s or integer s

497623
textbox	button
if both yes and no linkbuttons are inside of an updatepanel why not just have yes button trigger an async postback change textbox value then call show method on modalpopup from code behind

497626
unix	bsd
bsd ftp doesn t give you a return code for error conditions necessitating all that parsing but there are a whole series of other unix programs that can be used to transfer files by ftp if you or your administrator will install them

497630
derived-class	base-class
i have a base-class with a virtual function and i want to override that function in a derived-class

497630
derived-class	base-class
is there some way to make the compiler check if the function i declared in the derived-class actually overrides a function in the base-class

497630
derived-class	base-class
it can also easily happen if the interface of the base-class changes and somewhere some derived-class wasn t updated to reflect the change

497651
contains	set
this way if txtboxvalue.textdoes not contains a valid number then sublength will be set to 0

497671
revision	svn
if you already checked in after doing the svn rm then you can look at the log svn log find the last revision where the file existed and grab it from that version

497679
contains	any
the yaml cannot contains any sql syntax

497695
actionscript	mxml
one s just by referencing the class name directly -- so for example if you d created a new component class mycomponent in actionscript or indirectly by making an mxml component extending another uicomponent called mycomponent in both cases the component would pick up the styles declared in your external stylesheet provided that stylesheet s been imported into your application via style source

497698
rome	feed
a quick article to get you started is rome in a day parsing and publishing feed in java

497707
windows-vista	windows
using an e-mail alias in combination with windows-vista or windows server 2008

497730
versioning	upgrade
i thought in upgrade the windows versioning to one with asp.net iis but i thought in another possibility

497730
development-environment	virtual-machine
i thought in create a virtual-machine with windows ultimate installing too asp.net iis and visual-studio 2008 in this hd case then i can access my development-environment in any computer that i will work on my desktop machine and my notebook

497730
development-environment	virtual-machine
are you using virtual-machine as your primary development-environment

497734
vmware	esx
yes i use vmware workstation 6.5 and esx 3.0 for my servers

497758
keydown	keyup
if all you re doing is a keyup maybe the windows processes the keydown message instead

497758
keydown	keyup
you really need to send a keydown followed by a keyup

497758
keydown	keyup
or better yet send the keydown when the oem key goes down and a keyup when the oem key goes up

497772
superclass	subclass
another question even though i have changed the type of b to the type of the superclass are the overriden methods in the subclass going to be called and not those of the superclass

497794
quicksort	mergesort
i was working on implementing a quicksort yesterday and then i ran it expecting a faster runtime than the mergesort which i had also implemented

497794
quicksort	mergesort
i ran the two and while the quicksort was faster for smaller data sets 100 elements and i did verify that it works the mergesort became the quicker algorithm fairly quickly

497794
quicksort	mergesort
i had been taught that quicksort is almost always quicker than mergesort and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this

497806
any	set
base64 is used to encode any 8bit value decimal 0 to 255 into a string using a set of safe characters

497808
python	c++
my team wrote an embedded software made out of c++ and python

497808
python	c++
in order to use python and c++ together we had to keep a strict control on typing

497819
quicksort	mergesort
previously discussed on so why is quicksort better than mergesort

497828
zimbra	horde
you could try ripping out the calendar part of one of the open-source ajaxy groupware projects such as zimbra bongo horde or zarafa

497833
superclass	subclass
another question even though i have changed the type of b to the type of the superclass are the overriden methods in the subclass going to be called and not those of the superclass

497849
quicksort	mergesort
i could imagine that by directly accessing the memory using c for example one can improve the performance of quicksort more than it is possible with mergesort

497849
mergesort	in-place
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort

497851
implements	abstract
again the abstract factory-pattern is also one that i use all the time and the up front development has saved me hours of re-factoring later on when we need to implements a new set of requirements

497862
line-endings	newline
this will still read in the newline at the end but it will normalize all the line-endings in your text see the javadocs for defaulteditorkit for an explanation of how line-endings are handled

497866
python	c++
however one very important kind of development i ve used vm s for in the past is python-based programs whether pure python with wxwindows or embedded python called from c++

497866
deployment	install
using a vm allowed me to control the python environment and work against different install that were guaranteed to match the deployment environment

497880
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu as my linux development environment on top of vista 64

497918
put	get
put them together and you get

497925
worksheet	excel
if you use something other than ms sql-server 2005 you can still create a query within excel to any odbc data source and write a sql query to fetch data into a worksheet

497933
quicksort	in-place
on arrays quicksort can be done in-place meaning that you re reading from and writing to the same area of memory

497936
boost	stl
for example using classes and class methods and function overloading which are usually easy for even c diehards to cope with but not the stl stream operators and boost which are harder to learn and can have bad memory characteristics

497951
contains	set
we can t assume that p always should be set to block other rulesets may have changed that value. we can t remove the display property from a ruleset in an style sheet and we can t remove the entire connection between the element and the ruleset because it may contains other properties and so on even if it would be possible it would be imho non-obvious to find which ruleset to do this with

497951
attributes	properties
element.style â the current calculated style for the element it s just an list of the properties in the style attributes see mdc for a longer better explanation

497966
button	popup
a parent page has a link when clicked a pop-up will popup with a gridview and a save button

497966
button	popup
perhaps i should mention that save button will save the data from the gridview in the database and i would like the popup to be closed and the parent page refreshed

497967
quicksort	mergesort
i actually just wrote a linked-list comparative sort demo program in c and arrived at a similar conclusion that mergesort will beat quicksort for most uses altho i have been told that quicksort is generally not used for linked lists anyway

497967
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort and quicksort have the same big-o best case n log n and despite what people may try to claim big-o is really about iteration count and not comparison count

497967
contains	sorted
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contains a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great

497967
contains	elements
when two split lists come back to be merged if one list already contains all smaller values all of the values on the left will be compared one at a time to the first elements of the right and then since the returned lists have an internal order no further comparisons need be done and the right is simply iterated onto the end

497979
catransition	uiview
i try with catransition uiview animation but nothing

497996
any	set
ohh and a true determined hacker will crack any application on any platform so pick a platform for its functionality and that is geard to your problem and your skill set

498001
bufferedimage	graphics2d
callouts text images etc can be added to the screenshot via the graphics2d object you receive when you call the creategraphics methods of the screenshot s bufferedimage

498005
defined	declare
as for variables shared across compilation units you should declare them in a header file with the extern keyword then defined them in a single source file without the extern keyword

498009
tar	cat
the kind of commands i d really like to be able to use are wc tar cpio ps kill cat at .

498029
32-bit	x86
x86 32-bit allows you to access eax ebx ecx edx for general purpose integer registers and f00-f07 for floating point

498046
hide	show
if you hide all your errors you won t be show those which signify that the logic of the program is wrong - namely errors you want to see

498052
mips	x86
beyond that if you want to run them on an arm processor or mips or powerpc then you have to run a full machine instruction set emulator that interprets the binary machine code from x86 into whatever machine you re running it on

498052
python	lua
so now you can have a c c# c++ java javascript basic python lua or any other language compiler that converts written code so it ll run on this virtual machine

498056
freeswitch	pbx
i m not looking for asterisk freeswitch or any other pbx software

498076
fpdf	fpdi
you can use fpdi to read pdf and translation them in fpdf

498090
enterprise	platform
the speed question is almost a non arguments as many enterprise applications that serve millions of people are written in platform languages like java - eg gmail gmaps

498102
primitive	int
in platforms like java int s are primitive while int is an object which holds a int field

498117
callback	methods
now the loader defines a methods for your other code to register for callback like

498130
environment	building
either start the visual-studio building environment and run your scripting from there or modify the paths in python with os.putenv

498135
directory-structure	filesystems
for example cd-rom iso 9660 is limited to 8 directory levels something to keep in mind if you would want to copy your directory-structure to a cd-rom or another filesystems

498140
google-chrome	opera
virtualbox is nice and fast for occasional ubuntu and an xp holding ie6 ff2 google-chrome opera safari for testing and installs of apps i don t trust

498190
ubuntu	linux
i particularly like vmware on my laptop and i really like to use it for ubuntu linux

498192
environment	building
you do not need to building a swf for each environment

498222
constructor	object
if you re using either pdo or mysqli and you should be for your database functions you have to specify the db name in the constructor call so you can just do this check right before you create that object

498234
environment	execution
without account for the possiblity of vulnerabilities present in the compiler interpreter or execution environment are there any kind of security vulnerabilities that exist in the functional-programming paradigm

498234
functional-programming	imperative-programming
are there any specific types of vulnerabilities that exist in functional-programming but not in imperative-programming

498238
export	csv
csv export is simple easy to implement and fast

498249
configuration	logging
what i m looking for a is something that contains logging caching string manipulation configuration reading extjs

498260
linux	bsd
while you can setup ruby-on-rails on windows most people tend to use some flavor of linux or bsd

498260
postgresql	mysql
if you make your site public and are getting more than a handful of users mysql or postgresql is the next step

498261
httpserver	webserver
have an iframe on your webserver that makes a request to a page on your exchange httpserver with your wanted cookie variables set as get or post variables

498271
ubuntu	linux
you can buy a virtual machine with 256mb for 20 month but you build the machine from scratch after loading a base linux distribution like ubuntu

498271
ubuntu	debian
i would suggest debian or ubuntu

498271
gentoo	linux
if you want to learn a bit more about some linux fundamentals like building a kernel and tweaking .conf files could be useful at some point try a distribution like gentoo

498278
jquery	.post
i am very familiar with using .post or get to send data but all of a sudden realized i have no idea how to retrieve it in a way that it can be used by a jquery callback function

498298
forwarding	port
if your machine is behind a router you need to go into the nat settings in the router and have it forwarding port 80 to your machine

498329
arguments	default
use of default type arguments which is one feature i miss in java but there are backwards compatibility reasons for this

498339
arrays	loops
finally i loops through the string arrays and peform the regex.match method

498342
checkboxlist	listview
this way you can simply take a repeater or listview control and databind it to the list of categories then put a checkboxlist inside that

498355
command-line	cmd
you can also use the mysqladmin command-line tool to issue these cmd

498358
perl	ruby
several people have commented and responded that ruby python perl and the like come standard with os x

498367
deployment	install
and don t forget that once you want to deploy into gac your install will need administrator privileges you can pretty much forget click-once deployment etc.

498396
command-line	cmd
which command-line cmd style do you prefer

498409
click	mouse
key presses and mouse click are buffered and are applied once the system unfreezes

498409
adplus	dump
is there any way to do something like adplus -crash on a system process to create a dump on an exception-handling if one does happen but is swallowed

498416
keyboard	mouse
remove the mouse and keyboard and use remote desktop to control the computer or try replacing your graphics card with another

498417
32-bit	x86
32-bit x86 has only 4 general purpose registers

498419
32-bit	x86
when a program is compiled to x86 usually it s target is to to run into all existing 32-bit cpus pentium 1 2 3 4 core etc

498439
defined	declare
under some set of warning flags not now remembered i was getting warnings when the variables was defined before being declare

498442
show	next
if you get more than about 3 of them you can probably just ignore everything after the 3rd or so because the initial error just cause the compile to into the weeds and if they are real errors they ll show up again in the next compile anyway

498447
python	c++
it seems to me that the main issue here is that you re thinking in terms of c++ when you re working in python

498447
python	c++
having a 1000 line class is not a very wise thing anyway in python i know it happens alot in c++ though

498447
instances	self
learn to exploit the dynamism that python gives you for instances you can combine lists and dictionary in very creative ways and save your self hundreds of useless lines of code

498452
platform	anycpu
remember .net managed-code is compiled to il and the platform switching default to anycpu so you should get better performance on 64bit os with your existing binary

498460
.when	ready
i ll move a nondev versioning to c .when its ready what am i doing wrong and is there another tutorial i can look at i only found the one linked via google

498478
basic	abap
i m not sure about online resources but there are a couple of quite good books to learn abap programming you d be looking for abap basic and or abap objects the latter one sounds better and more advanced but is typically just a more modern version of the language

498483
temporary	copy
not a pointer ++i is definitely faster as it doesn t involves a copy to a temporary which may or may not be optimized out

498486
lighttpd	apache
you might also want to consider putting a more balanced reverse proxy in front of your mongrels something haproxy instead of nginx apache or lighttpd

498486
lighttpd	apache
the other reverse proxies nginx apache lighttpd only do round-robin which means that they can load up your mongrel queue inadvertently

498492
curly-braces	braces
note the curly-braces changed to regular braces

498496
environment	restart
there are numerous scheme for monitoring killing and restart mongrel instances in a production environment - for example choosing at random ruby-on-rails monitor

498559
python	java
such threads have existed for java ruby and python for quite some time now

498566
webserver	host
i have encountered a mis-configured webserver in the past that had one virtual host properly setup to server php files via the php interpreter

498580
input-field	selected
i just downloaded 2.2.1 and i ve seen that my input view does not adjust itself when an input-field nstextfield is selected

498584
order	add
in order to conform to the api of your methods when it declares to throw someexception but you re calling code that might throw an ioexception that you don t want to add to you methods s throws clause

498588
blender	maya
usually you sculpt your 3d character in a 3d modeler blender maya 3d studio max etc you export this character to a file .obj .md2 etc and you have written the code to your 3d game in order to handle the import of the character in your engine

498598
required	checked
then use this component to checked and create required settings each time the main application executable is run

498607
convention	standards
there s a convention followed in the django world that you could use - there is a standards settings.py file that imports a local_settings module at the end if there is one available

498615
maya	3ds
your question is more related to the last item you should pick an engine that can import assets you produce in say 3ds maya into the engine in a way you don t have to worry with file formats because that will make you more productive since you are only focusing into the game

498620
installation	environment
there may actually be requirements for a scriptable installation procedure in corporate environment

498620
required	checked
even portable apps required certain configuration settings isn t it better to have the main app checked that settings are valid exist on each startup and only prompt the user when needed

498629
any	set
what i want is to say that for any product you can t have two tasks with the same taskorder however i can t just set taskorder to unique because diffrent products will and should have duplicates values for taskorder

498636
required	checked
i have checked that my jdk supports the required charsets they are standard so this is no suprise using

498649
silverlight	wpf
i am currently looking into learning wpf and silverlight

498652
expression-blend	designer
well designers tend to use expression-blend which is a powerful xaml designer

expression-blend	designer
if you want to use a designer then get expression-blend

498658
jquery	dojo
prototype.js jquery and dojo

498696
benchmarking	profiling
then benchmarking profiling and tuning can be applied to the measured bottlenecks instead of guessing

498703
boolean	int
the difference is string.contains returns a boolean while string.indexof returns an int with -1 representing that the substring was not found

498710
contains	any
so contains is likely a wee bit slower than calling indexof directly but i doubt that it will have any significance for the actual performance

498718
spaces	output
if the output was truncated due to this limit then the return-value is the number of characters not including the trailing 0 which would have been written to the final string if enough spaces had been available

498720
implements	extends
or it may be that a holds an instances of some other class that extends implements is a and isn t a b and you ll get a classcastexception

498720
defined	declare
remember you can only call methods that are declare in the class that the variables is defined as

498737
versioning	upgrade
we upgrade to a later versioning and it was much better

498757
defined	declare
how can i declare and defined in this class a static factory methods returning a staticvector 3 object sth like

498766
export	csv
it can certainly do export to xls or csv or pdf... and i believe it should be relatively simple to feed it an sql result set

498783
priority-queue	queue
suppose i need to have a class which wraps a priority-queue of other objects meaning the queue is a member of the class and additionally gives it some extra functions

498798
python	java
actually the security in java and python is the same

498798
python	java
none of this is unique to a java framework or a python framework like django

498821
defined	declare
how can i declare and defined in this class

498833
javascript	dom
perhaps i m just unaware of the competitors but it seems when it comes to client-side scripting in the browser and dom javascript is it

498840
unsigned	integer
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned

498847
python	ruby
flash has actionscript while silverlight has many and all that work under the dlr including python and ruby

498856
google-chrome	firefox
if a competitor came along it would need to really bring something new to the table in order to convince everyone to a adopt it b live with locking out all the users of older browsers like ie7 firefox 3.0 google-chrome 1.0 etc

498873
python	ruby
besides as schwern points out if you re sure your shell script is going to be run on mac os x why don t you want to use python or ruby that both come in standard in usr bin

498884
mootools	extjs
what we re currently getting is a range of library sets jquery prototype extjs mootools etc

498895
primitive	int
if the argument is a primitive type an int then the called methods gets a copy of the primitive value

498932
deployment	install
r consists of approx 600 files in approx 50 different folders and can be install on a machine through xcopy deployment

498943
selected	button
my jsp contains a form netui form with a dropdown box netui selected and a submit button netui button

498959
javascript	dom
javascript seems to have found a nice balance between flexibility and security it can trivially interact and alter the pages html css do safe networking has a decent standard library which has things like json xmlhttprequest sih networking dom manipulation and so on

498968
inherited	subclass
i ve come across the feature in visual-studio to auto-generate a subclass of a custom control using add new inherited user-controls

498991
inherited	subclass
you just create your own class that inherited the control that you would like to subclass

498991
contains	elements
in terms of user-controlss i often see that a parent user-controls contains some user-interface logic and basic user-interface elements while the subclassed controls are refinements of the parent for specific use

499042
32-bit	64bit
one thing to be careful of is that the small and high-cpu medium instances are 32-bit where all others large extra large and high-cpu extra large are 64bit

499042
32-bit	64bit
you cannot run a 32-bit amazon machine image on a 64bit instance and vice versa

499045
constructor	object
you shouldn t do memset on c++ object because it doesn t call the proper constructor or destructor

499072
sql-server	mysql
for a small single user database a file system would likely be quicker - as the size and complexity grows a database server like mysql or sql-server is hard to beat

499075
json	xml
if you want to store data in files look into xml or serialized php which i suspect is what you are after rather than json

499079
autoit	basic
but the mechanics of driving the gui and testing the results could be handled using autoit s built in basic like language or by using it in conjunction with a language like ruby and testunit rubys built-in unit testing framework

499088
rewrite	rule
add this rule above your existing rewrite rules to stop redirecting if the request has already been redirected once ref

499105
contains	set
for fileappender we set to avoid an ever-increasing delay when rolling over to a new file and the folder contains lots of files

499109
host	dns
on the other hand there s no dns resolution for www.pythonchallenge.com pc def 0.html simply because that s an url not a host

499110
output	mode
i haven t done any nio programming but according to the javadocs sc.write will not write the entire bytebuffer if the socketchannel is in non-blocking mode as yours is and the socket s output buffer is full

499137
contains	any
it does not contains any whitespace character

499137
textarea	textbox
what would be the css selector to force this text to be wrapped in an html textarea or in a xul textbox

499141
firefox	safari
microsoft could probably have pulled it off some years ago when ie has an extremely large market share before the rise of firefox and safari but they chose instead for strategic reasons to let the browser stagnate

499146
compile-time-constant	constants
it s a compile-time-constants so-called constants expression and is of type integer or enumerator

499146
default-arguments	arguments
but a templates without any explicit arguments is possible - it has default-argumentss

499150
rollingfileappender	logfile
for file-based logging we re using the rollingfileappender and having it generate a new logfile for each day to avoid ending up with huge logfile

499155
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop loops over its arguments your args variable is an arrays but bash only sees the first element when you do args

499158
google-chrome	firefox
as of 2016 tested and working on google-chrome firefox ie11 even ie8 see that last here

499172
fortran	ada
there are a multitude of programming languages that aren t used terribly often anymore but we re used extensively in their heyday - cobol fortran and ada come to mind

499172
prolog	lisp
other languages such as prolog or lisp are not used terribly often in business but contain key concepts that all programmers should learn and are valuable in their own right

499177
firefox	safari
note safari seems to wrap the long string in a anyway unlike firefox

499192
constructor	object
for the common task like specifying parameter to constructor of component at object creation you can always go to code grouping at properties windows

499194
temporary	copy
then i will copy rollup ids into the temporary table where they match

499200
contains	elements
i have two functions to add and remove table rows that contains a form input elements

499202
margins	padding
after i have all my controls into my grid reasonably placed i switch to xaml view and either remove the margins completely which causes a control like a button to fill the entire spaces or make the margins something like 5 which puts some nice padding around the control

499202
silverlight	wpf
this is my opinion and most everybody in my shop who does wpf silverlight development

499206
perl	c++
the elisp examples i see are for comments that start with a single delimiter and end at the end of the line like c++ s or perl s #

499218
png	gif
it could be that the gif jpg decoders rewind the stream but bmp png don t hence the error.

499221
average	min
the average user will stay on the page for 10 min translating to about 100kb at offset and about 400kb more through requests

499249
derived-class	base-class
ie put the common functionality in the base-class and derive the templates class from it then specialize the derived-class with only the functions which are different

499250
derived-class	base-class
an alternative approach is to split your stuff up common stuff into a base-class and specialized stuff into the derived-class like nick recommends

499253
python	java
not java but the ipython project has a notification center written in python here that you could use as a template for a java version

499280
versioning	upgrade
it s probably cheaper for you to upgrade your vista home basic to a versioning that runs iis although my suggestion would be to run win 7 beta since it s free and then upgrade to the final versioning of win7 when it s ready

499296
nsscrollview	nstextview
i m writing a program that has an nstextview embedded in an nsscrollview which user can zoom

499297
loading	gif
i was thinking of loading a panels with the animation gif in the center add some opacity

499299
callback	methods
a common way to use this with c++ is to pass an object pointer in the context parameter then the callback can cast it back into an object pointer and call the member methods to do the real work

499299
callback	methods
strictly speaking the callback must be extern c but using static member methods for callbacks is common and i think in practice there s never a problem

499328
decimal-point	digits
s is the scale or the number of digits to the right of the decimal-point

499388
basichttpbinding	netmsmqbinding
one way to transfer messages from an msmq to a web service call is to use a netmsmqbinding service endpoint and a basichttpbinding client endpoint that support the same contract

499397
administration	credentials
you ll need to be connect to the share as an administration or have the credentials saved

499401
recording	playing
instead of recording the output i was thinking of recording the timing of when the button were pressed so when the user presses a play button the button are pressed in the same timing the user has pressed them so it acts like the iphone has recorded the sounds but it s just playing them in sequences

499403
csv	zip
i found a csv database of cities zip gps and when i imported it it added a infront of the columns

499405
put	get
when i put an alert just above it works fine but when i remove the alert and let it run at full speed i get the error

499413
checkbox	button
jquery.val checks or selects all the radio button checkbox and select options that match the set of values

499423
sql-server	mysql
i m not a mysql expert but this should work based on my similar experience in sql-server

499426
buffering	streaming
streaming get their data on-demand if they need them either from files terminals or else optionally buffering their stuff well not exactly right

499436
object-reference	instances
upon attempting to insertonsubmit ip i get a nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

499458
subclassing	superclass
this lets me write cleaner code one layer up since i can catch the superclass and only deal with the individual subclassing when it really matters

499463
contains	elements
it defines the basic structure of a tclientdataset xml document datapacket containing metadata and rowdata where metadata contains fields and params and rowdata contains row elements

499463
contains	elements
note that row elements are very loosely typed as they will contains attributes names that are dynamically defined

499463
contains	elements
then the file cds_metadata_fields_include.xsd which contains the underlying meta data used by the fields and params elements

499471
version-control	git
it makes emacs integrate with everything file search with find locate text search with grep version-control with svn git hg ... you name it

499481
python	ruby
i don t mind if i have to use python or ruby

499502
spring	jsf
so read the documentation that comes with your framework spring asp.net-mvc struts jsf e.t.c

499549
glib	gtk
you can also look later at the glib library standard component of gtk gnome but

499585
conditional	operators
whichever way i do it it seems something goes wrong when using the conditional operators on enum values in linq to sql

499586
key-value	key
when you use a poor source of randomness to generate an encryption key you significantly reduce the entropy or uncertainty of the key-value

499590
png	gif
unfortunately it did this for non-gif images too so when our iphone application was expecting a png image and got a gif it would crash

499591
http	ssl
are all urls encrypted when using tls ssl http encryption

499591
http	ssl
i would like to know because i want all url data to be hidden when using tls ssl http

499593
perl	c++
cross-platform support python java c# c++ ruby perl

499594
http	ssl
yes the ssl connection is between the tcp layer and the http layer

499594
http	ssl
the client and server first establish a secure encrypted tcp connection via the ssl tls protocol and then the client will send the http request get post delete... over that encrypted tcp connection

499597
photoshop	layer
is there a library in c# that will allow me to read the layer in a photoshop file psd and extract them as transparency images png

499597
photoshop	layer
photoshop has a batch command that will extract all layer in individual files but there is no choice of transparency pngs

499602
put	get
but if you are using get instead of post then the user will still be able to cut and paste the url out of the location bar and you will probably not want to put confidential information in there that can be seen by anyone looking at the screen

499615
stderr	stdout
stdout stderr

499615
