i created a php file which deals with file deleting and uploading but i this file is one directory lower than the folder for files
to avoid misunderstandings my question is not whether web2py or django is better
edit again one completely different approach would be to use pypy s sandboxing mechanism which should be much more secure than cpython plus a sandboxing module
the above links to libc++ which is the preferred c++ standard library for mac os x with clang and a lot more complete than libstdc++ even when considering the newest gcc
however if you want to use the sha256 hash alogorithm which is better than the md5 then here s a code sample

rsa has much simpler math and can directly encrypt decrypt data you should never compare rsa and ecdsa
perhaps a highly optimized and tuned implementation with sse avx multithreading is better for me
install newer emacs by homebrew or macports
the problem is that the server-side selectedindexchanged event triggers earlier than the client-side change event so the data never reaches the server-side
on linux these syscalls are often mmap 2 perhaps with sbrk 2 and since linux systems are mostly free software you could actually study and improve the implementation of malloc musl libc implementation of malloc the more common gnu libc malloc implementation is perhaps more complex to understand

poor performance from mysql has more to do with it not being smart and automatically creating an optimized plan like sql server postgresql or oracle would
no problem mnt i mentioned possible compatibility between the method tried in 4.25 my solution and 4.00 your versioning but keep in mind the gap in time between these versioning is probably more than two years of upgrade and also a jump between backend databases versioning oracle 10g to oracle 11g r1.
the two vector graphic libraries you can focus are raphael and d3.js but d3.js is much more powerful with data binding
also robocopy is better than xcopy
the only place where raphael defeats d3.js is fallback raphael supports older versions of ie where as d3.js is based on current web standards ie 9
the swift runtime is smaller than the objective-c runtime

accessing and dynamically reloading non-class resources inside jar war files is way easier
example with nunit i have better experiences with nunit than with mstest
far easier than getting mysql or postgresql installed on a system.

i ve found that firefox is greatly faster with imacros than google-chrome
declarative code is easier to make bug-free than imperative code
memory optimizations - phusion passenger uses less memory than thin and unicorn
pypy s jit can make python code execute much faster than cpython
is the assumption that codeigniter modules work in kohana or at least can be massaged to without too much effort or is it just that kohana s got fewer modules

nvidia is more permissive for example nvidia lets you cast wrongly ie float4 to float only making it a warning ati won t error
while mysql is more famous for serious enterprise-quality database where preserving your data is critical i recommend postgresql
a filesystems such as xfs is more suitable for this
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor
wondering mainly if svn uses less disk space or more than the same in cvs
xcb is lower level than xlib and allows you to minimise the number of round-trips to the x server leading to lower latency
i find cobertura and emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checking just that cobertura has a better maven plugin and emma has a better eclipse plugin in my opinion
the most interesting thing i noted is that certain test combos in firefox are much quicker than even google-chrome
also it looks like when i transcode webm to mp4 2.7 is 30 faster than webm

these formats allow various data compression codecs note that snappy is now much more popular than lzo and can also provide other benefits such as fast serializable deserialization column pruning and bundled metadata
sctp mapped over udp ipv4 allows more private hosts per public address but udp mappings in ipv4 nat gateways are notoriously tricky to establish and keep maintained due to the fact that udp is a connectionless transport without any explicit state for a nat to track
raphael is very much similar to d3.js but is more on thd lines of a graphics library and the added advantage of compatibility with internet explorer 6 through 8 using vml instead of svg.
here ajax form breaks after adding html5 attributes in google-chrome safari is a better description and workaround
as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead
just one tip if only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps consider using some lighter option than apache for an example nginx or lighttpd you ll find sample configurations for all of them in play s documentation
if it is useful to you you are more than welcome to it note i m more familiar with vb6 vba than vb.net so this udf is more in the vba style but still works in vb.net
i know maven is more powerful than ant
so it seems like the opposite - mri 2.3 gets 2-5x slower than jruby 9.1

you are right because myisam is really faster than innodb
instead of firefox or ie i use google-chrome and i superficially feel google-chrome is responding better
as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysql s bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysql for any even slightly complicated query
whether you use a plugin or write your own code css only is a no go for google-chrome safari and as you said firefox is better at dealing with it
a similar tool is now present in firefox you had to use firebug before but google-chrome is more used partly because of its more powerful js engine v8
apparently opera ie and firefox works better with
hardware design with vhdl or verilog is more like programming nowadays
but if firebug donâ t enabled after launch firefox â time equal 2ms that faster than opera and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears

given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used
entity sql which is not available in code first and dbcontext api - you must access it through objectcontext api is more powerful because it is not dependent on limited functionality offered by linq

application expects grails versioning 1.1.1 but grails_home is versioning 1.2.0 - use the correct grails versioning or run grails upgrade if this grails versioning is newer than the versioning your application expects
it also caused a bigger problem with serializable and deserialization
because webclient is higher class of httpwebrequest and its slower
but firefox keeps being less responsive than google-chrome or ie

most noticeably if you look or google-chrome firefox and then internet explorer 9 you ll notice that the terms and conditions are slightly higher than in google-chrome or firefox and thus slightly touching the main content area
2 that code appears to be less secure than the bsd solaris versions since it doesn t take into account the saved setid bits

there exist battery-backed packages of ram modules which can act as an ultra-fast hdd substitute but if they attach via sata scsi or other typical disk interface the still are slower than system ram
i was also going to recommend nginx + fastcgi as i prefer nginx to lighttpd it s better mantained or at least that s been my perception the last few years
for other databases like mysql and postgresql there is simpler solution
but if you want a full-fledged java ee 6 server then glassfish 3 or jboss 6 is a better alternative

we updated freetype in osx 10.6.5 and fontconfig which links against freetype wants this newer version
lxml is much faster than beautifulsoup and probably the fastest parser available for python
innodb table is a bit slower than myisam tables but i don t think it is a major problem as you told you are using drupal system is that a kind of mult-sites like a word-press system
and looks like your php versioning is less then 5.5 so upgrade your php versioning 5.5 and it will work
i have to say that this combination is much better than aptana radrails 2 or aptana 3 for developing ruby on rails apps
therefore serving and caching images from nginx or apache still seems the better choice
for example i ve noticed nvidia s glsl compiler is a little more picky than ati s and rejects some shader code that otherwise works fine
apache activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine
the first one can be solved by using svn +ssh which is the more comparable format as cvs uses its own protocol as well

thanks to opencv i managed to rewrite everything with wxpython which i know better than pygtk
64bit code is not actually faster it is usually a bit slower than x86 code
the eclipse builder uses simpler logic than maven so sometimes the things m2e does are just not enough
according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

google-chrome is just more forgiving for some mistakes then firefox
postgresql is older than mysql so it might have influenced them
if your application is self-sufficient i would recommend going for tomcat as jboss is much more resource intensive as well as weblogic moreover weblogic costs some money

activerecord is much simpler then a datamapper but also much more limited
subjective phpunit provides much nicer code coverage reports than simpletest
xfce runs much smaller than gnome and is full featured
none of the .net libraries are there and there are some syntax differences as vb.net is more strict than vb6 is
i have tried firefox and it better than google-chrome crash issue is not always happen but not solved this issue

also take a look at silex as this has lower overhead than symfony and works with symfony forms
it s not even a webkit issue unless google-chrome s got a newer version than safari
i found programming google-chrome extensions easier than firefox but i couldn t come across something similar to xpcom in google-chrome

nginx also happens to be better than apache at writing logfiles interestingly
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts
firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall
tcp is subject to higher latencies than udp as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations

if you want to upgrade dependencies major versioning it s more trickier
use clutter which is much more suited to animation and integrates with gtk
i use rspec and capybara together but the language syntax of capybara makes more sense is semantic as rspec when testing for request expectations
in codeigniter and zend-framework which is the better option
if you want to bind data to gridview datalist datalist controls then better option you should use datatable dataset or you can use list ex list
actually it is much better than soapui because with jmeter you can easily read the data from csv and parameterize it
while you can munge together a solution with ant maven is a better solution for managing dependencies than ant
afaik malloc is not slower than memcpy
also this loops is better created as a for-loop
the google-chrome renders the letters using pointy ends but the firefox uses more solid and bold effect
consequently ironpython is potentially faster than cpython is especially for multithreading scenarios
i believe gridview allows much finer grained control of display than does listview
i recommend you to use nginx as an reverse proxy since the configuration is easier and the performance is much better than apache
junit is older and have more extensions dbunit cactus etc
it is slower than nginx because apache with the event mpm is very roughly equivalent to an event-driven http proxy nginx varnish haproxy in front of apache with the worker mpm
i would like to find better solution than serializable and deserialization
currently with the 10px top padding the cells in google-chrome look taller than in firefox

while in google-chrome usually another page refresh fix it firefox is more stubborn
if you are interested in more verbose javascript utilities for arrays objects and more check out lodash or underscore.js
gitosis which is obsolete for a few years now gitolite is much richer works with bare repos repos without a working tree
edited to add myisam is faster than innodb because it is simpler
myisam is the perfect choice since the database is almost only used for reading and myisam is significantly faster that innodb
use socket for tcp and datagram for udp its a lot faster than tcp but less connection oriented
hence as compared to tcp udp is more attractive for delay-sensitive applications like audio video

this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome
btw google-chrome is less close to w3c specs than firefox de 42+ i d opt to start using firefox for your initial testing and then test it in ch to detect quirks
do you find rails with postgresql is slower than mysql knowing that it produce more query on the background
perhaps write a config file for them bower.json for bower and package.json for npm that makes things cleaner and you can ensure installation by running npm install

in some benchmarks i see that myisam is faster than innodb but seems i have a little improvement
i have used a lot more than 10 linux distributions and i now stick to opensuse
firefox is more tolerant when it comes to image headers then ie and google-chrome
apache is more flexable then nginx but it comes with a high price in performance
if we remove the font-size it appears properly in google-chrome but shows up smaller in firefox
binary tree sort in particular is likely to be slower than mergesort or quicksort because of the tree-balancing overhead as well as cache access patterns.
google-chrome is just faster than firefox which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations
especially in opera there is much more green in the painting than in google-chrome
one might want to define kerberos access to more than one ldap server
google-chrome is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however firefox is worse than google-chrome in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than google-chrome but the innerhtml test runs much faster than google-chrome
therefore accessing myisam consumes less resources than innodb
innodb is usually much better than myisam at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because innodb uses row level locking for updates whereas myisam uses table level locking
since ubuntu 10.10 is newer than debian squeeze if you can do it on squeeze you can certainly do it on ubuntu
with swift the code is much more readable than with objective-c
c++ std map behaves more like a python defaultdict than dictionary
i would however argue that ubuntu or centos is a better option when it comes to server installations
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out
of late firefox has had much better performance than google-chrome
in google-chrome there is more files download 47 than in firefox ie 42
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid
the animations are slower than google-chrome and opera
i ve tried firefox and google-chrome and seems that firefox is faster and comsumes less resources is there anything else that is like text based
it seems to be slower in google-chrome and firefox but is significantly faster in opera
webkit is stricter than gecko
i already create the xml for some beans inside the larger bean with xstream and append them as elements to the jdom
postgresql is way better than mysql in nearly every respect
also i believe the ironruby team is smaller than the ironpython team
its slower than in google-chrome and firefox but now finally
if you have a newer processor with sse or avx extensions then ensure that the compiler is compiling to use these features usually this is done automatically when you set optimizations
i ve learned partly by trawling this site that the google-chrome security is fussier and the app loads correctly without errors in firefox and ie but i can t find any resources that are loaded from a non https source
all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo
i successfully compiled graphicsmagick with q8 but after all it seems about 30 slower than imagemagick 0.3 secs
basically imagemagick was only slightly slower than libjpeg
having nginx in front of apache is a better set up in my opinion
google-chrome dev tools are by far better than firefox ie whatever imho
objective-c print is more readable compared to swift
maven is higher level than make makefile the classic c c++ build tool or ant build.xml
while leaflet aims to be more lightweight than openlayers openlayers is by far the more mature proj
does that mean perhaps rails team favor postgresql slightly more than mysql
this i suspect serializable takes more time to process serializable and deserialization
i ve ran into out of memory errors on firefox with canvas heights greater than 8000 google-chrome seems to handle much higher at least to 32000
tftp is used because it uses udp which is simpler and had a smaller footprint than a full tcp-based ftp server
note the show hide effect is much softer because of the commented fadein fadeout declarations that were triggering console errors probably because jsfiddle uses jquery slim now
16 cores apache would scale better than nginx while nginx would process more client requests
chunk features includes branching looping and macros and has a simpler syntax than velocity and freemarker
if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications
innodb performance has been improved to the point where it is hard to come up with a benchmark that says myisam is faster
i have worked on codeigniter but yii is far more ahead of that
i think it mostly depends on the interprter engine in browser which responsible for interpreting th scripts which server sends to your browser and another thing about firefox as you have mentioned the extension in firefox is also responsible for it and another thing which i think matters a lot the developement of the browser as you can see google-chrome has same ui on all windows linux mac since it is mostly written in java so it requires jvm to run hence it is slow as compared to firefox which is written separately for each os using the respective oss apis hence it is fast since it directly interacts with os than interacting with jvm which in turn interacts with os like in case of chrome.still google-chrome is faster in incognito mode because of its intelligence to keep frequently data cached if you ll see the temporary files created by google-chrome they are huge in size as compared to that of firefox
the google-chrome console gives more information than the firefox console
kmz loads much quicker than gpx and can be integrated with the google maps api as a kml layer
even then google-chrome s fonts look thinner than in firefox or ie
scenarios when quicksort is worse than mergesort
it seems to be common wisdom that if you are deploying django on an apache server then you should still put an nginx server in front of the application to serve static files at which nginx is more performant
eclipse compiler for java jdt ecj is much smarter tool than actual javac
my rails app is coded in jquery but for file uploading i ve yet to find anything better than fancyupload better imho than uploadify or swfupload
it works in firefox because firefox is more lax about this security restriction and google-chrome happens to be more strict on mixed-content errors
always use tls which is ssl which is https more or less
ssd disk are good but they are still much slower than ram
setinterval is better than settimeout for this task
nb weka contains its own implementation - smo but it also provides wrapper for libsvm and libsvm runs faster than smo note that it requires installed libsvm see docs
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam

twip for parameterized testing the junit stuff isn t the greatest in fact testng does this better as well -
you might have better luck with a repeater a datalist or a datagrid
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3
it displays ok in google-chrome and safari but in firefox it has more space between the text and the bottom border than between the text and the top border

gson 1.6 now includes a low-level streaming api and a new parser which is actually faster than jackson
note that in any case for increased security and fast static file css js delivery you might want to add a reverse proxy layer nginx usually provides better performance but apache works as well before the nodejs python server
virtualbox no vmware because virtualbox is more user friendly
the answer is simple so that you don t upgrade to a versioning newer than the versioning in wheezy by accident
quicksort usually is better than mergesort for two reasons
in firefox the input button has more padding than in google-chrome
and web2py is more lightweight than django rails whatever on pretty much all counts
pd note that firefox s developer tools are better and more complete than google-chrome developer tools but in essence are for the same purpose
if you have recently upgrade to a versioning of apache greater than versioning 2.2 the authz_core error error might be coming from your httpd.conf or httpd-vhosts.conf file in the tags

but better ogg than wav
another alternative for javascript ajax is writing a google-chrome add-on easier than firefox or embeding a web browser within your application
but my directory structure is more organized its more like app lib mypackage folder
i believe that ubuntu is better than centos when it comes to mono as it is much easier to setup and seems to be better supported
this alleviated some of our performance issues but even on subsequent refreshes we noticed ie6 taking substantially longer than ie7+ firefox google-chrome etc
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares
in the first example sqldf is 3x slower than data.table and in the second its 200x faster than plyr and 100 times faster than data.table
microsoft s free application for stress-testing wcat is underpowered and buggy but the full blown test edition goes up against products like loadrunner but is easier to use better-integrated with vs asp.net and for much less money per virtual user
here the working header request with firefox bigger than google-chrome request
so you can do a django redirect_to urlconf entry but you d be better off with an apache or nginx or insert-your-webserver-here redirect so the initial request never has to hit django at all
font-face bold in firefox is bolder than in google-chrome
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads
since the upgrade or mac clients can no longer connect through safari and firefox is no longer accepting the about config setting of network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris
dus anyone knows if there is something wrong with my json or if google-chrome is harder to get than safari
udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp
myisam has historically been viewed as faster than innodb but for recent versions of innodb that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases
you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have
beautifulsoup is more forgiving in terms of well-formed xml structure see i had to edit the xml a bit to make things work for elementtree and it s actually much easier to work with
ie handles updates better than google-chrome and firefox

also setinterval is often better replaced by settimeout
datamapper is much smarter then activerecord
ie is much slower than google-chrome firefox for all js work not only complex ones
he says he uses debian and is less familiar with centos and so i am posting here
i ve replaced settimeout with setinterval which is more appropriate for repeated tasks
the logs only seem to work with a google-chrome browser which is a laugh as usually firefox is better at running google apps than google-chrome

gitolite is far more advanced than gitosis and is quite easy to install directly from your workstation based on ssh communication with your git repository server
keep in mind that implementing udp traversal is easier than tcp
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails
use png or gif it s faster types of images
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster
as you can see ie 8 is about 5 times slower than firefox 3.6 and almost 20 times slower than google-chrome 9 at least when using sunspider tests

i ve used python on windows and on ubuntu and linux is much cleaner
it is also usable from emacs and vim but this time the emacs interface seems more polished
triggers in postgresql have a syntax a bit more complex than mysql because they execute procedures as the action
myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth

2 integration would be easier with jboss eap support from eap 5 or wildfly however if you don t need any java ee technologies i would go with more lightweight server like tomcat or jetty
but changing the chmod maybe even working with umask is better than dealing with root-access and using chown
also for printing arrays i recomend to use the enhanced for-loop it is easier
btw this is not essential for this solution for windows 7 and 10 xcopy is superseded by robocopy which is much more performant and powerful
even if you re on linux it s much easier to get a precompiled version sudo apt install r-cran-rgl on ubuntu if you have the appropriate cran repositories set up
also i can t see your table engine but myisam is better for full text searching rather than innodb
mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference
for me apache is easier to use but i prefer nginx as it is much faster
anyway i just prefer not to use it because gecko is slower then webkit
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s just more robust
it is much more efficient than gridview listview for complex layouts
i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in google-chrome than other browsers saf firefox everything is more saturated in google-chrome even a background-color rgb
also datamapper is much more ruby syntax friendy and features like lazy loading when doing chainable conditions like activerecord in rails 3 are there from the beginning
tcp streaming for audio can be less helpful than udp rtp as you d have to turn off nagling
on centos dnf install zint ubuntu takes more work
using webclient is potentially slightly on the order of a few milliseconds slower than using httpwebrequest directly
also the hash algorithm itself is much slower than sha1 md5 sha1 md5 are made for speed - not a useful property when storing passwords
since myisam is better on selecting while innodb is better on writing
but one below query which was editable in ms access versioning before back-end upgrade is no more allowing edits

tcp as you know udp is faster than tcp even if udp may miss some
yes it is an old wives tale that myisam is faster than innodb
haskell has higher level bindings to llvm than ocaml the haskell ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and haskell has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components
i generally use mongodb because it returns queries in json format integrates well with angular.js and its bson format is much faster than json
running with debug option -x seems to imply that command substitution is similar to subshell since bash outputs a deeper nesting for it
google-chrome renders passwords smaller than firefox
use firefox network in development tools and check your requests sometimes it just sends options request in cross origin i insist on firefox because it s network tool is much more detailed than google-chrome and safari
google-chrome shows it better than firefox firebug
however bash has useful interactive features dash does not zsh is still better imho
bower packages are simpler than npm equivalents and don t have subfolders with module dependencies
also nice to know is the fact that the latest version of google-chrome and also opera don t know since when but longer than google-chrome supports userscripts out of the box no need to install any add-ons
why postgresql is more capable than others mysql etc. on django
if you overwrite the env versioning the rake db migrate will go downgrade rather than upgrade if versioning is smaller than last known versioning in db schema so please check and avoid similar environment variable

reference from here link for ntp commands as i am more familiar with ubuntu debian based commands
while celementtree is fast the world standard lxml library which also implements the elementtree is faster still
quicksort also has a better cache access behavior than heapsort
well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml
testng is more flexible than junit and have multiple advantages like support for parallel testing for example

i read that settimeout is less cpu resources intensive than setinterval
i know i can do a client-side redirect with html but i understand that the server-side redirect is nicer
this will be made less onerous by ruby-on-rails 3 which is intended to be orm agnostic after the merge with merb

2 - i have read about myisam vs innodb the conclusion for me was that myisam is faster when it comes to read-only whereas innodb is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently
make textview lower than imageview
and of course the results - if they are reproducible - might suggest that google-chrome is faster than firefox or that firefox just prioritises timeouts over dom events
is swt faster than swing
as an added benefit nginx can also serve static files much faster than apache and nginx also uses much less ram and can handle much more connections
i ve had to replace lyebox with colorbox which is much faster and seemingly has less problems conflicting with other scripts lightbox fancybox and others wouldn t work for me
converting to maven requires more work -- afaik there is no official tool or wizard that allows you to generate a full pom.xml configuration from an existing eclipse project
i d recommend datamapper for orm not only it s way faster than activerecord but it s also very modularly built and plugins are actual gems that you can easily install
in my test keyup gives a smoother transition as compared to keydown
it looks like while google-chrome and safari are trying to do the right thing with 0px firefox is sticking closer to the standard
instead of toggle be more explicit with slidedown and slideup
not sure if it ll work any better than junit but there is testng
is postgresql a better option than mysql for partitioning tables by date
for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated google-chrome release is more popular than the current and previous versions of opera the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10
i considered changing them to innodb to make the database 100 the same but then read the myisam is faster
it s easy much easier than installing freebsd or god forbid opensolaris pretty straightforward and the perl and python will be 64 bits out of the box and part of default installation
i don t know why arch linux is slower than ubuntu on your machine
in fact svn does stores binaries a lot more efficient than cvs for more info see the svn-faq
in firefox the render of new tiles and the panning is laggy this is not the case when using maps.google.com so it s not an issue of google-chrome being better than firefox
other posts which reference this error message seem to think it s a problem with not having an upgrade versioning of virtualenv but its versioning is higher than the troublesome versioning
better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay
probably webm will load faster than standard mp4 but i am not so familiar with webm format
oh and just incase you were thinking innodb is slower than myisam - the myisam implementation i tested was twice as slow in all counts
spidermonkey firefox is slower 50 of google-chrome max speed but the speed is consistent
udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp
basically - httplib is lower level while urllib is high-level
i worked on it to make it more consistent between google-chrome and firefox
since you don t do updates i think myisam would be better than innodb in this scenario
java has build-in support for work with pkcs#12 keystore work with this containers doesn t much differ than standart jks keystore
i use objective-c more than swift
good options are llvm libc++ static library fewer features more compatible with clang and gnu stl static library more features i had an issue that required me to turn the clang optimizer to -oz to prevent a segfault
instead you can support more than the jks and try the default keystore type and if it fails try the #pkcs12
also changing your imagemagick install from a 16bit one to a 8bit may improve speed as i belive that is one reason graphicsmagick is faster
after inspecting the test in ie 8 9 and seeing its results look like those of firefox i think there s an explanation for the google-chrome results i m pretty sure google-chrome webkit has a better optimization in the first version of the test especially the parseint part which gives a better result for parseint there
quicksort is not better than mergesort
as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries
in kohana for example also codeigniter but kohana is more flexible you can build internal requests with
i managed to use andlinux + wine to get this working but honestly i think the vmware virtual pc virtualbox route is simpler
i personally use codeigniter which probably falls in to the heavy framework category but is at least much lighter than cakephp and lighter than zend too i think
and also does anyone know why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome in 3d rendering
i built a site and the problem is google-chrome display font-size 1px bigger than firefox

plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb
myisam delivers better read performance compared to innodb at the cost of being less acid compliant

that said modifier keys are important in vim even if less than in emacs
png achieves better compression than gif because it applies a pre-filtering step before the lossless compression deflate roughly equivalent to lzw. see wikipedia s explanation of png filtering
charles has a much better ui than fiddler
however my experience is that configuring it in apache is significantly more complex than configuring it in nginx and even with worker it still is not quite as efficient with nginx
myisam is more prone to locking problems than innodb i believe
lxml also has more features and offers beautifulsoup too
also using a separate httpwebrequest or webclient gives you more control over proxies handling redirection authentication etc

i faced with the same problem in firefox google-chrome limit is greater as i see
consider umbraco its architecture is definitely better than dotnetnuke s
my question is similar the same page in my pc renders fine firefox google-chrome but the same one on a server rendered smaller by firefox google-chrome ok

tldr in firefox filter is slightly faster in google-chrome that s the opposite
fltk is really a full-blown gui toolkit though rather small as gui toolkits go that has a built-in glut emulation that at least the last time i played with it seemed considerably better implemented than glut itself
but if the use of mongodb is a must then i suggest that you reconsider using django in the first place because mongodb has a better integration with flask through mongoengine
however ico files if stored properly are not significantly larger than png files because since windows vista ico files can store png
if you are using anaconda conda is a better alternative to virtualenv as it manages conda packages which are not limited to just python packages
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns
turns out using onunload is behaving as documented in firefox but google-chrome is just smarter with it or something still investigating but i ll mark this question as answered
you should see impala as sql on hdfs while hive is more sql on hadoop
in other words serving static files from django will have worse performance than using apache or nginx

due to that swt looks more native than awt swing
if you re doing non-unit testing testng might be a better option than junit

to my knowledge and research so far - javascript s native for-loop is quicker than arrays map for iterating through the arrays
if for some reason you want to use an implementation that does not give you a full parse tree then i would suggest parsing the resulting html using lxml a python wrapper of the c lib or html5lib pure python both of which can return an elementtree object and are much faster especially lxml and more forgiving of invalid html especially html5lib which acts more like real browsers in the real world
xquery is more amenable to static analysis than xslt because it lacks the very dynamic template despatch mechanism
for instance quicksort can outperform mergesort although mergesort is provably better than quicksort in the worst case
and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation
overall kohana is more flexible than codeigniter and a great base to build a web application and api on

this is a huge performance boost look like myisam is much more quicker for fulltext in mysql than innodb
3 a first of all if you haven t done yet change the storage engine to innodb which has row level locking and in newer versions of mysql has more optimization than myisam has
you can refer the bootstrap official document you can find that the default navbar background described as background-image the priority of background-image and background-color distinct the background-image is more powerful than background-color

snprintf but in c++ std ostringstream is far better
but in my location jboss is more popular than glassfish so i have a idea

the switchover to nginx really had little to do with the rewrite rule and more to do with getting away from apache 2.2 default upstream version for centos however with nginx rewrite rules are more straight forward than apache s imo
incidentally the scrolling on the windows version of safari is fine albeit a little slower than ie opera and firefox

that happens because pixels size in google-chrome is bigger than in firefox
this sample rate might be lower as only google-chrome and firefox are supported
ie is less performant than safari google-chrome and firefox when it comes to js - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with js turned on

however when i run my program on windows 8 dev preview it always pop-up dialog that asks user to enable .net 3.51
first vb.net can be used to perform this xslt transformation which is really simple as you said just applying the xslt stylesheet at server-side if it is considered better than at client-side or even just sending the processing instruction for that to the browser
does this mean that the old adagio about jruby being faster than mri ruby is gone

may be postgresql takes less time than mysql
i think ie uses bigger font than firefox or google-chrome by default
actually your code doesn t work on firefox because he is less forgiving than google-chrome about errors

i really like postgresql s indexes which are far better than mysql s
performance is browser and device dependent for example firefox handles objects better than arrays while google-chrome prefers arrays
i haven t tried coded or retrospectiva but i ve used both redmine and trac and in my opinion redmine is better because
no guarantee but it s rather likely. in your case it s even more likely as linux freebsd and os x are all posix-compatible
this python3 cgi https server used to work a few weeks or months ago but now no longer works under linux ubuntu
beautifulsoup is a python package that parses broken html while lxml does so faster but with high quality html xml
you need to control many logging configurations i think the logging agent on ubuntu debian is better choice
im new to swift but i like it more than objective-c as it looks a bit like java does to me from syntax wise compared to objective-c
the comment of hanky that linked to myisam versus innodb tells you more about the differences

also google-chrome has a great tool that allows you to edit css on the fly which i find more useful and quicker than using firefox s extensions
i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin
there is the mono project that aims to allow .net code to run on mac and linux but between the two delphi being pascal is somewhat more portable
it s can be done in both server-side and client-side but in server-side there s more benefits like database searching before parsing page html and testing routines
i am using postgresql btw which can do more than mysql incase that changes things

and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven
vim is more powerful and textmate is worth the price tag
use myisam usually much faster than innodb if your data base isnt transaction oriented
sometimes a linux distribution contains far more than an operating system but is informally referred to by a single name such as ubuntu and so the line between what the operating system is the linux kernel and standard libraries perhaps and the applications that merely ship with that operating system the gnome and kde environments on linux is pretty gray
on your screenshot div width in opera is bigger than in firefox and google-chrome
in addition jemalloc tries to optimise for cache locality since the act of fetching data from ram is much slower than using data already in the cpu caches no different in concept to the difference between fast fetching from ram versus slow fetching from disk
for example using renatoargh s test google-chrome is faster with option 2 firefox with option 1
i know udp is faster than tcp for various reason
this also affects how it is stored which leads to myisam being slower than innodb on insert due to myisam requiring a full index re-write on every insertion
datamapper idea is definitely better than activerecord
can the geocode gem support more than one geocoding step
in that sense reliable udp cannot be faster than tcp

i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options
there is a firebug version available for google-chrome firebug lite but the firefox version is much better and i d highly recommend you at least try it out
a last suggestion is to convert your db from myisam to innodb but i think this requires some investigation because it not always the case that innodb is faster
also it does appear that firefox consistently handles this better than ie or google-chrome
recompiling ubuntu kernels is harder -- it will require working with debian build tools
and regarding your first question it is definitely possible to encrypt decrypt messages directly using rsa there are only technical and performance reasons aes is much faster than rsa why rsa is used only to encrypt a session key and aes is used to encrypt decrypt the messages themselves
also i think the webclient class is more idiomatic these days than hand rolling httpwebrequest
xquery works better than xslt for this because it s more amenable to static analysis as it lacks the polymorphism of xslt s template rules

imho wordpress is better do work and customize than joomla
gecko is often considered to consume less memory than webkit but this depends a lot on how the browser is implemented
with django it is easy to use postgresql instead of mysql so i tried it with the same query and same data in db postgresql is much faster that mysql x10 more faster while using inner join analyse shows it uses indexes unlike mysql
you could always use https that will work both on http and https websites but loading a https resource is slower than loading a http resource because of the encryption and ssl handshakes

i read a lot about gradle and it seems to be a better solution than maven or ant
i have used both prototype scriptaculous as well as jquery in many projects and based on what i am seeing it appears jquery has the more plug-in available so am leaning towards using jquery
nginx is faster than apache handles slow clients better and is generally easier to use
in my personal experience it is impossible to modify the browser behavior in google-chrome if the addon api does not allow for it - in firefox this is much easier to change as much of the interface logic is written in javascript and there are api s for just about anything

ios google-chrome is more ios safari than google-chrome itself
note that centos software versions are older than debian s but versions of opensuse software are newer than debian s versions
but in general you will find that lxml is faster more effective and has an api which adheres closely to a python standard the elementtree which comes with the python standard library
i have been trying to do this in firefox webextensions but if it s easier with google-chrome i will try it that way instead.
it is widely used to have a separated tag with the postfix -alpine in it to indicate that alpine linux is used which is a much smaller base-image than the debian image
this is due to the simple fact that firefox has been in the extension business longer than google-chrome or ie
google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd
it also gets broken even more in ios google-chrome which is an older version of safari
one of the main advantages people discuss when choosing nginx over apache is higher performance in serving large numbers of static file so when using laravel are those static files loaded as dynamic php files

it seems that ie and firefox are less strict than safari
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end
apache s design is thread per client while nginx uses the reactor pattern meaning - nginx can handle much more traffic than apache as a web server about 50 times the number of requests
worse than opera and firefox on the desktop as well
it s model it s much more twisted than svn cvs git
jruby is faster than 1.9 mri matz ruby interpreter the standard in certain areas

lwjgl is much more aimed towards gaming with opengl where as jogl is more worried about complete and perfect bindings to opengl opencl
i also would prefer to avoid service workers in the implementation so that this works in more than just google-chrome and firefox
have you considered creating an object structure for these files and serializing them java object serializable and deserialization is much faster than parsing an xml this is again considering that these 500 or so xml files don t get modified between reads
since you ve switched to lighttpd the webserver itself is going to use fewer resources than apache would but apache is rarely the bottleneck unless you ve run out of ram or seriously misconfigured it

different browsers do this in different ways f.ex ie has less slots than google-chrome firefox
using any kind of non-trivial maven pom.xml makes is more visible though
i actually found the setup of nginx much easier than lighttpd not to mention that you can install a macport of nginx port install nginx +ssl that does not contain the ssl-breaking bug that lighttpd suffers from here
speed does matter here myisam is still slightly faster than innodb especially for reads
your average debian or ubuntu user is more likely to be familiar with apt-get than with cpan

since you re using lxml why not use it in a more direct manner lxml is believed to be faster than beautifulsoup
as i understand websockets are on top of tcp and have higher latency than sctp that underlies webrtc when for example sending binary data between server and browser that also could be 2 peers in webrtc
mongodb s server-side document representation is a json-like binary format called bson which has richer types than javascript json and preserves field order

there is almost always some driver issue between them but in general nvidia is better for opengl has bugs in directx implementation and ati amd versions only is better for directx has bugs in opengl implementation
for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache
firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions
you may also use handbrake which is a simpler encoder than ffmpeg
udp is much faster then tcp but tcp has flow control and guaranteed delivery

regex is a nfa and is as such in most cases slower than a dfa or hand-written parser
both use debian packages and ubuntu is based on debian but is more user friendly
my usual rule-of-thumb is that xquery is better than xslt for simple tasks whereas xslt is better for complex tasks
it will produce the desired layout with a gridview but indeed the asp listview is a better choice
i have found that using jquery javascript inside an updatepanel is more hassel than it is worth as you always need to output the jquery javascript using the scriptmanager or the scriptmanager.registerclientscriptblock
transparency is also an issue however google-chrome seems to handle all three better than firefox
now on windows if the ntfs filesystems has less than 5gb disk space it displays
several things i found in the cocos2d forums lead me to believe it s an issue with the zlib implementation on ios but i ve tried using both stb_image and lodepng to avoid zlib and those libraries actually performed even worse than libpng
so your app code is actually run via uwsgi and cherokee is more like a proxy server
how can nginx performs better than apache

also for animations google-chrome chromium behaves much better that is why i use it for development but do my general browsing in firefox
however it may be that maven-jaxb2-plugin uses a newer version of xjc than you re using with enum
i suppose this is one of the reasons for the misconception that udp is slower than tcp
google-chrome doesn t implement the sizing correctly and firefox does although in your case the default behaviour of google-chrome is closer to what you want
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql
performing this asynchronous testing is actually possible in qunit but is handled better in another javascript testing framework jasmine js
myisam is more susceptible to data corruption than innodb and usually innodb performs better because it caches both data and indexes

i don t want this to be a mysql postgresql is better than postgresql mysql debate
how sctp is better then tcp
nawk alas aix don t have sort and unix sort is far more superior then any hand-made sort in awk

if you want open source postgresql is much smarter than mysql as well
i have read some comparisons of junit and testng and it looks like testng has more configuration options
if i were able to upgrade the server s versioning of mysql to 5.5 would innodb be a safer bet than postgresql
or maybe that is one of the reasons why visual studio gives slower codes than gcc g++ compiler
if you re focussing on pure client code then i find webstorm to be an excellent javascript html ide - even better than aptana

furthermore 3des is much slower than aes
use nio it is much easier than using inputstream outputstream
i am curious to know if detecting the visitor browser with client-side script is more reliable than server-side script

as i understand it web2py supports gae better out of the box than django
so why is google-chrome less efficient than firefox and ie
using a database system such as sqlite or mysql that follows the acid principles is much more easy as the database system guarantees consistency atomicity of the transactions isolation and durability
some newer with backbone only and older with marionette since marionette uses backbone both uses underscore.js
large objects google gson performs faster than jackson and simple json
and now i have learned that innodb uses more memory at-least while reading than myisam engine so i am trying to change the default engine of mysql to use myisam
socket tcp udp uploading is slower than native windows copy when there are more than 1 clients
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries
i don t want to use myisam because innodb is more advanced
in google-chrome typeof is slower than the other two but in firefox it is the fastest
better use apc on apache server it will be much faster than memcached because you don t need to make a tcp ip call to connect to memcached

it seems like udp will more efficient than tcp
for instance zeromq can leverage udp multicast to run faster than any tcp protocol but the application programmer doesn t need to learn a new api
the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content
while not really a console skulpt.org runs python code client-side with no plugins or anything which makes it a lot faster than a server-side prompt

very small object google gson performs faster than jackson and simple json
when i posted this on facebook someone said that since firefox is open source project developers optimized math.min but google-chrome didn t since google-chrome is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why google-chrome s and firefox s math.min a b performs in similar speed and google-chrome s math.min a b and firefox s performs in same speed because if firefox is faster than google-chrome then google-chrome s math.min a b should be much slower than firefox s
also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool
you might have even noticed the fgetc version is simpler than the fread version
judging from the benchmarks posted on the pypy speed center it appears as if pypy is faster than cpython for all but two of the tests presented

it s said to be better than udp or tcp for communicating by processes in the same os windows xp here
google-chrome is more flexible in this sense than firefox which is why it works there
sergio suggested nginx + unicorn or nginx + puma but nginx + passenger which replaces unicorn puma is much easier to setup performs great uses less memory works better and has more features

postgresql with the optional hstore module might be better than mysql at this.
vba being a whole lot less than vb6
the setinterval and settimeout ways you have shown are identical except that setinterval is more clear

innodb provides more complex keys structure than myisam foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in innodb
i guess google-chrome is smarter about me being careless than firefox is
if you are trying to support all users on all browsers then you will certainly need to do testing on those browsers although actively developing on those browsers may not be necessary whereas if you only need to support webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari or webkit-based browsers and firefox that is less testing that you need to do

requests is one of the cleanest api s i ve ever seen way better than httplib + urllib + urllib2
the other advice i have is that a for-each loops is faster than a for-loop

on kde aptana ran perfectly quicker than on gnome at the best of times
for-loop is easier to read than a while loops
once the set of projects has been validated maven now does some more parsing of those pom.xml files to construct the list of build extensions if any and the list of plugins
xml files have none - so sql databases are a lot more efficient with sorting and filtering
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that
by highlighting the shape of the two elements you can see that in firefox left the button is 2px taller than in google-chrome right
on contrary jscript is more c-like do not require explicit enabling of script running accepts relative paths case sensitive and loosely typed both are imho advantages for scripting language compared to vbscript
the only browser where the while loops was slower than the for-loop was in opera
probably firefox just ignores it but google-chrome is more strict change code to
caching and buffering are quite important since disk are just so much slower than ram and ram is much slower than the cpu
wpf .net represents more functionality than straight swing or swt but the eclipse netbeans spring rcp projects provide a much more comprehensive foundation for complex and modular gui applications
swing has newer and better api s than awt
i am using google webfonts and have come accross an issue with jagged and choppy font rendering in firefox and google-chrome ie11 renders them better

enumerate is more pythonic but xrange is fine here too
gson is faster with smaller documents and jackson is faster with large documents
anything django does web2py does better
i use google-chrome as my main browser but sometimes firefox has much more verbose errors warnings that can make debugging a complex issue easier

i believe ubuntu is smaller debian wheezy smaller still or even alpine for tiny start point
telnet is more general than ftp and is generally used for command and control
i think richfaces has a more mature ajax integration and their ajax components and events are more easy to use for me than trinidad ones
bad news is that the asmlib version of memmove is slower than the glibc version it is now running at the 300ms mark on par with the glibc version of memcpy
prestashop is much easier than zen cart oscommerce and magento
the nested loops version is the slower of the two due to the extra the interpreter overhead of the for-loop
but in mysql it is ok and in postgresql it is wrong and ask for the other fields besides site_id either in a group by clause or in a aggregation function i know that postgresql is stricter on sql than mysql so i must select the site_id in the query object of msg_published but in pure sqlalchemy i can do like this
a lot of answers comments are mentioning that the background-color rgba is faster and more efficient but that background-image is more compatibility friendly
right now google-chrome is faster than firefox sunspider tests so your statement it loads faster in firefox is not really correct
i will add that i ve often heard that nginx is faster than apache for serving static files to the point that it s sometimes worth using nginx for static files and reverse proxying to apache for dynamic content
what s up with google-chrome that the debugger behaves less conveniently than firefox
when i open my site with mozilla firefox and google-chrome the font in mozilla seems thicker than google-chrome
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa
are client-side binding grids better than the server-side ones
generally speaking i find postgresql lends itself to 24 7 operations better than mysql

and my php versioning is lower than 5.3.0 i upgrade that fixed my problem
alternatively you can use lxml module which is lot faster than beautifulsoup
it seems that in firefox ie the line-through style is a bit lower than google-chrome i am not sure if this is because of the implementation of different browsers or something
i try to align my imageview and my textview but the imageview is higher than my textview
installing from source is somewhat more time-consuming than using macports and fink but enables you to have a working environment that is optimized for your system
i don t know anything about except that it s more powerful than gedit but doesn t have the same feel as vim emacs
we have found that using servlets and those 3 different kinds of handlers instead one single type of modules the generic term for other servers like apache or nginx makes user-developments easier safer and faster
i m doing a comparison of erlang haskell elixir and es6 and i m less farmiliar with erlang and elixir but i want to represent all of these languages fairly so is this good erlang code
ant is much more powerful than maven in many respects but maven excels in dependency management and ease of deployment
i ve used tcpdf in the past and found it a lot better than fpdf
newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly
using sha256 with a salt will be much more secure than md5
although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job
it s known that sqlite is slower than mysql postgresql excepting very small tiny dbs
mysql has some advantages like easy replication but postgresql is generally nicer to work with
and additionally the algorithm that google-chrome uses is better than the one in firefox at least for handling the resizing of text
pc google-chrome and safari are fine ie shows the links like in the picture firefox shows more revealed urls
that way of adding dependencies is better managed by maven with m2e
the issue that i encountered was that google-chrome was giving me height about 300px more than the firefox ie
i think glassfish is a better j2ee app server to start with than jboss
you can probs achieve this better by using strftime and setlocale
sqlite is very fast in many trivial cases it performs faster than mysql postgresql or firebird and supports a good subset of sql-92 syntax but there is extra overhead to populate the data-set sqlite db and building any indices etc
the standard html.parser option handles broken html less well than other options while the html5lib option is closest to how a modern browser would handle broken html albeit at a slower rate than lxml would handle html parsing
looks like for the slice use-case on google-chrome using a literal is about 4 slower on my machine on firefox it s more lke 9 with no difference at all on ie10
ie8 has also some issues but to a lesser extent than google-chrome and opera
mongodb is way faster than mysql and postgresql but there s a tiny chance like 1 in a million that it won t save correctly
primefaces has more components but lack combobox available in richfaces
postgresql or mysql is better for production environment
in fact oracle is so sure that innodb is better that they removed myisam from 8.0
myisam also tends to store data in less space than innodb
found that the issue stemmed from using the firefox webdriver which apparently has much higher security than its google-chrome counterpart
i don t know whether this port of cql3 to ruby support activerecord it acts more like a simple datamapper but it worths having a look
i ve used vim for 10+ years but never really into vim scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where vim was weaker than emacs
mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson documents
in its basic form the three lines are way thinner than within safari or google-chrome
vba add-in are a bit troublesome to deploy but vsto is even more so
mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson document.
arabic default font in google-chrome is larger than it is in firefox
as you can see in the image google-chrome is running a lot longer than opera
btw a case-sensitive search done with removing i is much faster than a case-insensitive search
if your server versioning is older it is highly recommended to upgrade postgres anyway to use jsonb efficiently
svn is better than cvs
gson is not particularly fast but the jackson library can almost compete with most binary serializers jackson is 2-4x faster than gson in most situations and 10-20x faster on utf-8 because it has special code for utf-8
but modifying the arrays is more work than a simple for-loop again
database performance of the innodb is not necessary faster than the myisam engine
udp is faster and requires less bandwidth than tcp
mri is faster than jruby
i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysql which i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested
is embedded jar better than embedded war file
tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe default
i donâ t like using git itself though itâ s far better than svn or cvs but github is such an awesome site that iâ ve considered switching just to use it
also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout
also don t forget to upgrade the gradle plugin to 1.5.0 or newer as older versioning are not supported
if there are many modifications of the data it s said that innodb works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like myisam
one more example with gem fog and heroku configuration for carrierwave with amazon s3 hosted on heroku
its what s used for keyboard input in wpf way more than the keydown and keyup events
xslt is significantly more appropriate to use than xquery for such kind of tasks
con you can encounter issues related to library versions and dependencies macports has more software than homebrew
nowadays with xquery there is no reason to use xslt anymore xquery is much nicer
in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout
maven is better for managing dependencies but ant is ok with them too if you use ant+ivy and build artefacts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and also makes proper git tags from the svn tags
the pattern-based version installed by default on red hat-based linux distros fedora centos etc is simpler
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari
glassfish seems to be slower than resin
why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right
on my computer firefox performs much better than google-chrome on these tests using jsperf

in most cases usage of addclass removeclass brings much more flexibility
i am getting better with google-chrome and firefox debugging tools but i still have not found a way to easily examine the local entity cache managed by breeze
in ie8 and google-chrome it runs even faster than firefox in general and this slow down never happens

and modern broswers like firefox or google-chrome requires more bytes to start browser display
myisam for reads may well be faster than innodb
browser google-chrome firefox firefox requires more resizing to get the same effect
using malloc free directly is safer
junit is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java testng has more features but maybe is more complex
more modern processors handle hyperthreading better than older processors
datamapper is newer than activerecord
the silverstripe cms is a great php framework better than laravel the most popular at the moment but its documenation lacking
headers copied from google-chrome only since safari is harder to copy paste from
on a side note i d recommend using tcpdf instead - it s a fork of fpdf that has better supports for utf8 among some other improvements
in my experience firefox is sometimes more lenient than google-chrome but i would definitely test in both
using settimeout is considered better than setinterval because of the screwy ways that js s event loop works
one more thing as in maven we can update or if we save the pom.xml file maven downloads all those dependency automatically
think about project management bug reports and it all adds up to something more than just cruisecontrol svn and nant
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.
nfs with the right setup version and tuning is just a tad slower than smb cifs
firefox and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than google-chrome in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in google-chrome it doesn t need to be a domain as such
that means firefox is more than 7x faster than google-chrome here
the simultaneous use of more than one cpu or processors core to programmatically execute a program or multiple computational threads
i think architecture with sockets was chosen for better portability between different lisp btw slime also supports clojure and mit scheme and os-es slime works on windows too
g++ compiler is more strict then gcc compiler
testng has more capabilities and can be helpful with integration tests junit is more focused on unit tests
svn is much better then cvs and git or mercurial are even better again
myisam is faster when the query is simple but it s much slower in a high concurrent environment as its table level lock comparing to innodb s row level lock
on linux it would be easier for you to link to shared library and use symlinks to correct version - imo it s much easier than using dlopen + dlsym
rebuild a new png format in-memory data which is much more smaller than current bmp data and send the new png format data by socket to remote server
the browser does not matter though safari gets way more consistently working results than google-chrome
b use indexes - postgresql has bigger repertoar of indexes then mysql so use it - there are gist gin indexes
which protocol tcp udp is more common to use in a p2p design
google-chrome has a bigger time difference yet firefox is the one with the gap in the animation
memcached is in-memory too and a bit slower than apc
the famous line is nginx is not apache in other words nginx has better ways to handle urls than rewriting
sqlite is a more simpler database than postgresql or mysql and if you are testing very small applications you can easily use it instead of postgresql
i didn t work with these applications yet but afaik typo3 and ezpublish both php are considered much more professional than joomla
mysql is easier than postgresql but it doesn t really matter either way
in practice however quicksort is usually faster then heapsort
for this the best option is gitolite better than gitosis
how could i make the imageview have more priority than textview
since using ram is faster than using disk zram allows linux to make more use of ram when swapping paging is required especially on older computers with less ram installed
setinterval would be the better way than settimeout
i know that rails jruby handles concurrency better than mri but i don t know how to do it
web.py has a templating language of it s own it looks easier than django s
i prefer web2py because there are more conveniences built into the environment than offered by django but web2py is much newer than django and hindsight always makes it easier make new implementations better
i have encounter a problem with google-chrome that is similar to an older issue with firefox at this url scrolling blocks javascript execution in firefox
you can enable the root account and set a passwd but jumping to it with sudo is the better method
firefox is clearly less secured it deliberately allows something that google-chrome locks down
for security md5 is not the best method hash is much better
i got a draggable object done with jquery ui and when i drag it it s way slower than i move my mouse
the next text is an overlay between firefox und google-chrome - firefox is broader
nginx is still faster and i might choose it but apache isn t asleep
google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers
checkbox onchange should be more meaningful than onclick
note that while serializable is now optimized deserialization is doubly slower because i deserialize to object to then reserialize to string
here is a recent benchmark of jython 2.5.2 running on jvm 7 where jython is slower than pypy but faster than cpython
i hear postgresql is more robust and doesn t crash like mysql does in these situations
nvl versus coalesce oracle is much pickier about reserved words
snappy is also significantly faster than lzo for decompression
i also tried to do spacing from imageview to textview but then if the textview is smaller than the imageview the spacing will be wrong again
in general it seems as though the concensus is to primarily use innodb but there are still some areas in which myisam is much faster than innodb
xna is more popular and has more tutorials then libgdx
a 64bit capable x86 cpu is no worse at running 32-bit code
jackson is faster but the api is 37x more complex than the gson api
does an eclipse installation perform slower after the upgrade
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam
the advantage that you have is that unlike upgrading an operating system upgrading from ie7 to google-chrome 8 or firefox 3.6 is a more reachable goal for the average user of your app especially if you provide a link and upgrade instructions
also consider doing a web search for responsive bookmarklet tools for results that can help a-bit more than google-chrome s inspector or firefox s firebug
with regard to using send versus sendto i have found that sendto is used more commonly with udp and send with tcp sockets
freemarker is more powerful than velocity
this is a weak point that iirc postgresql can handle better but with mysql you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks
and since you asked for a work-around if you have access to visual studio you could whip up a little com-visible class library that exposes a .net-flavored regex much more similar to java s than vbscript s api that you could reference and use in your vba code
in my opinion glassfish is more user friendly than jboss so i decided use glassfish for my project
web.py is more low-level comparing with django
perhaps someone more familiar with bash zsh osx can make more sense of this
myisam is faster but does not support the use of transactions like innodb does
and people do install on their ubuntu system some external libraries so you need to search a lot more than what ubuntu contains and i won t be surprised if ubuntu or debian are large enough to already have conflicting libraries
nginx uses an event based non blocking single thread and the memory usage is relatively much lower than apache
the inclusion of jscript code into a batch file is simpler than vbscript and the translation of a small code segment from vbs to jscript is not problematic
instead using css you have a lot more control with background-image background-size and background-position
sure there is a learning curve with maven but reading a pom.xml is far easier than reading a build.xml
i want to encrypt decrypt a long file with rsa i know aes is better but this is just for a comparison in openssl libcrypto
cassini is not actually iis it is more of an emulation
attributes are used in a more meaningful manner than mstest or nunit
i ve read that nginx is faster for static pages but there are questions about its performance with php compared to apache s performance with php
as you know myisam table sizes are about three or more times smaller than same innodb tables
also you can use phantomjs is webkit browser without user interface so it is really faster than firefox or google-chrome
installing a real database server is fairly easy so i d recommend sql server express as others have or even mysql or postgresql whatever is easier to set up
even lighttpd or nginx with natively pre-compiled c++ is slower than g-wan s c scripts
tail -f that is capital -f as opposed to lowercase -f is a non-standard flag available on linux cygwin macos x freebsd and netbsd that works better for watching log files which may be rotated occasionally
but if your shared file system is a raid 5 or 6 array exported to the nodes via nfs over gige ethernet that will be slower than ram to ram transfer via gige using rpc or mpi because you have to write and read the disk over gige anyway
liferay is responsible for storing passwords with encryption or better as salt hash in the database
imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker
with gcc and clang your sse code is better whereas icc is a looser
install firebug firefox version is better then a google-chrome one
this is trickier to work around and you should file a google-chrome bug describing the situation and where it s slower than firefox but you could potentially reduce the amount of buffer uploads by looking into instancing or using uniform arrays instead of updating vertexes for positions textures
this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work
google-chrome is a bit more strict than firefox here
postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan
on the server off jsfiddle the submit button sits inline with the checkbox and tick text and the checkbox sits higher than the tick text rather than inline
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql
perforce is soooo much faster than svn because all the check-outs are stored on the server so it doesn t have to check every file on an update
png gif works much better
if you really want to go more secure than ntlm your may want to configure kerberos
nginx is better at handling requests since it does not spawn a new process for every request unlike apache
the upgrade sequence is much simpler i have a hard link in the app that points to the latest versioning of the apk the donwload starts and automatically laucnhes the install
freemarker is more advanced but a little complex as compared to apache velocity
though flot may be simpler d3.js is definitely more powerful
the xdm model used by xslt xpath xquery is much stricter it allows a free-standing zero-length text node but as soon as you try and add such a node to a tree it disappears
now started porting game from cocos2d-x to sprite-kit as cocos2d-x not offers box2d physics and new version of cocos2d-x 3.0 has less features
however due to it lack of android portability i have to replace all of my glfw code with sdl since sdl is more portable
it seems openmpi has better support for assigning ranks than mpich but setting up slurm and mpich wasn t trivial due to the cluster setup so i m hesitant to start over with openmpi
i use google-chrome for development as i find it runs faster than firefox and ie so it is a bore to guess where the icons are
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects
google-chrome has no issues in this code.the default zoom level of firefox is higher than it was in the earlier version
google-chrome is reporting the missing key with a higher severity than firefox is so i want to eliminate that as a possible cause
tcp is reliable but slower than udp while udp is not safe and i have to implement my own fault-handling codes
so i suggest you build a p2 repository can be done in ant but seems simpler in maven tycho and split the projects to several repositories
firefox text is 1px lower than in google-chrome and ie
note that just as you wrote this version is significantly slower than the inline one under cpython which of course does no jit inlining
but doing that kind of things with apache is rather painfull and is easier with nginx
you can get even fancier with fadeout and fadein too
in other words a future cffi release should give an alternative way to do embedding simpler than both cpython s and pypy s custom solutions respectively using the cpython c api and following
google-chrome is worse than safari
in vim it s much more difficult to run a subprocess than it is in emacs so in vim you need to have a separate running idris repl
in swift as objective-c there is far less emphasis on subclassing than other languages
in google-chrome it seems more or less ok but in firefox when i first tried it it should give me not logged in my console
according to the above posts and my own experience lxml is definitely faster than beautifulsoup
apache mod_php is much more stable and cleaner while nginx will often deliver http bad gateway error coded in 502

5 a war file can be runnable executable though this is more common with jar files
ps llvm clang is easier to port.
it s generally accepted that lxml is faster than beautifulsoup ref
bionic the android version of libc is more slightly more limited not by much
i can think of two relatively straightforward things you can do without ditching php though i have to mention that php doesn t have much to recommend it and you would likely be better off with python django python flask or ruby rails
in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way
by looking at various blogs i understand glassfish versioning 4.1 has older jackson library 2.4 which does not have this method and need to upgrade jakcson versioning 2.8
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates
maven can t be compared with ant as in maven vs ant maven is more than a build script than ant is
but in low traffic sites mysql postgresql is better
and it s rarely faster than innodb since innodb uses row locks and mvcc as opposed to myisam s full-table locks
using firefox even it s slower than google-chrome it s still more respectful of privacy
firefox is even slower that google-chrome
i switched from apache to nginx to save memory especially to serve static file i seem to be using about 75 less memory with nginx
i recommend not to use jpg as mask because of its lossy format i recommend bmp or png bmp is better

it seems a little bit more straight forward than kerberos but provides good ntlm sso capabilities
i am wondering what happens when i release a upgrade that has a higher target sdk versioning then the previous versioning of my app
use a swing gui not an awt gui since swing is much more powerful and flexible than awt
disk io will be slower than ram
perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too
the downside is that you cannot use it for browsers older than ie11 firefox 31 esr safari 7.1 ios 7 konqueror all versions and opera all versions

couchbase btw also uses binary replication mechanism which will be more efficient than couchdb as long as the couchdb protocol is not utilized for bidirectional data exchange and conflict resolution
google-chrome is stricter than firefox when it comes to loading data from your local filesystem
i ve tried using pypy because i ve heard its faster than the cpython interpreter but still no good
jackson xml module faster than xstream
openssl is more similar to peter gutmann s cryptlib and gnu s gnutls
update under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - opera reneders slightly larger fonts than firefox but nothing that looks odd
i feel like emacs is so much better than textmate
in my general programming experience compiled c c++ programs generally run faster than most other compiled-language like java or even compiled python and almost always run faster than interpreted-language like uncompiled python or javascript
ps i think that writing script is easier than hacking valgrind plugin callgrind with adding several counters for every instruction type
since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on
and it sounds strange but jruby scales very well and it s faster than mri with java 7
note that onclick is better supported with checkbox and radio button than is onchange
apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle
if that will solved later than wordpress menu is better than joomla
this also might be fixed solved in the git add mechanism in more up to date versioning i vaguely remember them adding their own .gitignore files to empty directories so i d really recommend trying to upgrade to the highest git versioning you can for that and other benefites your distro may provide by default an older versioning as ubuntu and debian do
i saw that pypy is generally faster than cpython
the ssl handshake overhead associated with https is more than 50 of the bandwidth currently
at least if the php versioning is newer and not including the deprecated functions like the extension in the error message i recommend to upgrade to a newer typo3 versioning and find a way to replace the extension ph_nextgenmenu with a newer one or edit it manually to use the typo3 sql api or the newer php functions directly
i am not an expert in deployment but in my experience nginx is much faster and more friendly to django compared to apache
mozila firefox and opera works smoother
i m testing some simple benchmarking calculations on win7 and linux ubuntu 16 to compare the timings and being wonder win appears to be much faster than linux
alternate build tools ant lots of configuration gradle conventions again less verbose than maven
in addition there are third-party libraries for xml manipulation which you may find more convenient such as dom4j suggested by duffymo or jdom
faster than on x86 32bits but slower than x64 64bit
i think this method of manipulating the dom from the client-side is easier than using regex from a server-side language
swing or javafx would be better than awt
elementtree is included in the standard library but lxml is faster
if your in the market for a templating engine twig a new templating engine used by symfony is much better than smarty imho

lxml is also much much faster than beautifulsoup
i m more familiar with ocaml than haskell so type constructor may not be the right term
that is one area i really think mongodb fits for but mysql postgresql is more recommended in general
firefox is probably easier than google-chrome these days
i ve reworked it slightly so that the deserialization code looks more like its serializable counterpart
the trope about myisam being faster than innodb is a holdover from code that was current in the mid-2000 s

also ram bandwidth is much higher than disk or ssd or network bandwidth and the ram latency is much lower too
in safari it renders significantly brighter than in firefox or google-chrome
you forgot to open the so no more css after this line is considered in firefox and ie google-chrome is more cool on the error
when attempting to access the admin side of wordpress if the db versioning is lower than your wordpress versioning expects it will redirect you to a database upgrade page
in the non open-source world choices are wider such as qnx neutrino and vxworks
in regard to vao and vbo performance i disagree that vbo is faster i suggest to see this link
native javascript sort performing slower than implemented mergesort and quicksort
ie7 is strict enough and used to give me javascript errors on them maybe google-chrome does it too firefox is more relaxed d
mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing
innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam
in firefox it runs extremely slow 3-4 seconds in google-chrome it runs much faster
i need to do the same condition but for less than google-chrome version 46 and for less than firefox version 44
the xcb library is alternative to xlib which is much better all around and supports a non-blocking interface but it doesn t play well with opengl
by default psycopg2 uses its own versioning of libssl and it seemed to keep a dependency on an old versioning of the library which no longer existed after my upgrade
be aware that the bourne shell in freebsd is more capable than on linux
if you use insert and update high performance uses innodb over myisam is better
i ve been using uwsgi in production on heroku for over a year and it seems to handle everything a lot better than gunicorn
all good jasmine angularjs tests running now and much faster than with google-chrome or firefox as the test browser
apc have less feature than memcached and is easly to use and optimize but this depends on your needs
also note that while maven is no slower than ant for multi-module projects of this sort importing your maven project into an ide will generally result in far faster builds than maven can perform itself
