postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
you should also take the time to learn sql oracle mysql postgresql and mssql have much in common regarding syntax but if i had to just pick learning one for myself id pick postgresql just because it s bsd licensed instead of gpl you should look up a compare and contrast on gpl bsd licenses too

debian	linux
pattern4	
if it doesn t build your own server - simply pick a decent linux distro i recommend debian it s super-reliable and easy enough to install but there s plenty others to choose from and install it either on a spare pc you may have lying around or inside a virtual machine on your own pc

for example bottom-up heapsort wegener 2002 outperforms quicksort for reasonable amounts of data and is also an in-place

150854
quicksort	timsort
pattern4	
i haven t repeated these benchmarks and would not be surprised if quicksort slightly beat timsort for some combination of random data or if there is something quirky in c# s builtin sort based on quicksort that is slowing it down

154623
scheme	racket
pattern4	
and make sure you ll learn a scheme with a proper define-macro implementation i d recommend racket or bigloo not just standard hygienic macros the latter would not surprise you at all if you re familiar with the c++ templates
