24643
getter	setter
in some projects they define all the fields first all static fields after or before all public private variables then the setter getter other methods

24645
getter	setter
i usually keep the private variable with the getter setter so the relevant code is all in the same place

24648
put	get
i put all the fields then constructors then get sets if any then methods

24729
rss	feed
it s almost as good as sitting down at home on the weekend with some rss feed or a newspaper

24805
imperative	declarative
i am not talking about procedural vs oop or imperative vs declarative

24833
min	max
so two engineers each provides a min max and expected estimate

24834
disk	ram
can be summarized as no cpu time ram nor disk space can be wasted was the main driving force in the architectural design

24875
put	get
how much refactoring you actually do will depend on the resource you put in vs the value you get out

24932
put	get
i also had to put out fires write code deal with people who can t seem to get along settle disputes on what library to use and manage a budget

24967
mouse	keyboard
processing keyboard and mouse events

25029
perforce	svn
since moving away from vss to perforce svn and git i ve never had an scm database become corrupted

25039
imperative	declarative
i can t find the right post anymore but eric lippert and possibly several other softies have opined on several occasions about how linq is declarative which for several classes of problems is far more intuitive than imperative syntax

25056
lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
it seems to me that it would be more practical to learn lisp or clojure or scheme or scala etc. but for what i ve heard recently haskell would be very hard to beat at teaching functional programming principles to someone

25060
erlang	scheme	haskell	scheme
erlang haskell scheme scala clojure and f#

25071
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
it took several skilled logicians working on it to figure out how to do subtraction for a while it was theorized that only addition and multiplication were possible

25128
srp	principles
srp single responsibility principles

25129
postorder	inorder
the traversal can be made in pre-order inorder or postorder depending on what is required

25206
pascal	delphi	forth	algol	apl	algol
same-same for autocoder pl i cobol java c c# c++ fortran basic visual basic assembler for any particular processor ruby forth python perl spl apl pascal delphi b bcpl algol pl sql etc etc etc

25262
min	max
hey everyone needs to know how min max works on tic-tac-toe via fancy recursion

25267
clang	llvm
is there any good reason except gcc is better to use the mingw win32api headers libs with llvm clang

25293
interpreted-language	compiled-language
ci tools have a more important role to play with compiled-language than interpreted-language but that isn t to say that the ci tool is wasted on interpreted-language

25463
wordpress	joomla
may niche and higher paying services like wordpress customization drupal customization joomla customization will all become a possibility to you if you know php

25467
erlang	lisp	erlang	ocaml	haskell	ocaml
erlang haskell lisp ocaml whatever

25637
wordpress	joomla
i have just left my college after doing graduation in computer engineering during my college life i tried to do some freelancing in local market.i succeeded in the last year and earned some small amounts based on joomla wordpress and visual basic based job.i had some small projects on php mysql also

25637
wordpress	joomla
my problem is when i started to work with python simultaneously i worked in odesk as a wordpress joomla drupal php developer

25667
ant	maven
sharing common code between modules is trivial with a build system like maven or ivy if you can t leave ant

25829
put	get
one of the things i do is i try to avoid being put in a position where i get to decide where anything goes in the first place

25832
switching	screens
switching down to multiples of 5 is only necessary when you run out of screens real estate

25854
vim	textmate
i last used coda at 1.5 before switching to vim textmate for everything

25865
postgresql	mysql
in software i write postgresql mysql sql server i have ensured that the bulk of my query operations can take place as a single statement of code

25936
width	height
i tend to use pixels for width declarations which generally are fixed but em s for height

25977
required	placeholder
if you have something specific like video that required scripts then fine but display a nice placeholder that says scripts are required to view this video

25983
post	put
the pre and post options seem to indicate that they are detached from the actual async function they surround like closing the car door before you put your foot on the accelerator or putting on the handbrake before exiting the car

26047
range	minimum
range minimu query given an array a 1 n of n ordered objects such as numbers a range minimum query or rmq from i to j asks for the position of a minimum element in the sub-array a i j

26060
getter	setter
getter and setter interfaces should be about behaviour

26149
public	protected
if your class is meant for sub-classing then you don t want public data members or protected data members for that matter

26149
public	protected
data members that are private can be changed at any time without breaking the sub-classes whereas changes to protected members potentially break sub-classes and changes to public data members quite likely break client code

26149
getter	setter
it may seem tedious to have a getter setter pair of methods to manipulate a data member but it s worth it if you want to keep the implementation flexible and not design yourself into a corner

26151
sdlc	methodology
i know this is possibly related to how would you introduce an agile methodology like scrum but here i am wondering about ways to circumvent work around the fact that the company imposes a certain way of managing the sdlc under the false pretense that it s the only way to have an audit trail

26299
erlang	lisp
according to me lisp lets say common lisp to be specific haskell and erlang are probably going to be interesting in the next little while

26299
erlang	lisp
lisp because some of the concepts it was pushing back in the 70s are finally getting explored in the mainstream haskell because it s a highly expressive language with focus on performance through its optimizing compiler and erlang because it was built for programming networks of machines rather than individual computers which seems like it ll get more and more useful as time goes on

26325
erlang	lisp
enter functional programming f# erlang haskell lisp dialects and data querying r languages

26365
csv	tsv
usually what i find myself doing is getting a tsv tab-separated values rather than a csv file pull the file into emacs and see which of a few uncommon characters it never uses is usually a good choice around here and then i convert all the tabs to

26366
disk	ram
on more than one occasion i ve had to compile a tiny statically-linked fast reboot program and use scp to put it on a ram disk on a server where the disk subsystem went away entirely

26383
gtk	clutter
it s also the primary language for open-source projects i work with like x windows gtk and clutter

26400
associativity	operator-precedence
it removes the need for any kind of operator-precedence and left right associativity

26702
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
and then they couldn t have missed google and firefox opera safari and google-chrome

26710
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
there s no guarantee that you won t decide you like windows ie and bing but the chance is much higher that you ll use mac or linux firefox or safari or opera or google-chrome or google

26716
google-chrome	safari
i ll check in ie and google-chrome to ensure i m not missing anything covering the three most common rendering systems google-chrome and safari share the same rendering library

26716
google-chrome	firefox
these days the story is getting better on both google-chrome and ie 8 and up--but still not as good as firefox

26734
ocp	principles	srp	ocp	srp	principles
by itself it does not make it easier to follow principles like srp or ocp or to decouple layers

26843
tunnel	vpn
you do have alternatives such as vpn s ssh tunnel too have a more secure channel for distributed remote access to your central database

26885
openmq	hornetq
i ve always been a big fan of asynchronous messaging and pub sub implementations but coming from a java background i m most familiar with using jms based messaging systems such as jboss mq hornetq activemq openmq etc

27138
puts	gets
what if a student gets a legitimate copy of the program puts it on his laptop computer and then goes to study with a friend who lives off-campus

27150
cvs	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn
if you use decentralized source control mercurial or git or bazaar or whatever you get advantages over svn cvs that makes it easy useful and powerful to use in case you re an indy

27150
pull	push
you don t have to setup a server and if you need one later it s easy and you just push and pull changes between repositories

27150
cvs	svn
with svn and cvs you can already use a branching system and ditch the branch if the feature is not as good as you wanted it to be

27150
bazaar	git
git mercurial and bazaar at least makes merges and branches really easy

27150
pull	push
i often just push pull changes between my own computers laptop desktop server and i m still alone on my devs

27193
post	get
in fact if you post it to sites like dice or monster they ll get it anyway

27313
datamapper	activerecord
some orms are based on activerecord others based on datamapper - that in itself is a relevant consideration but one that requires some investigation to understand the implications

27337
togaf	enterprise
things like togaf have been mentioned as helping achieve a world-class enterprise development environment

27337
togaf	enterprise
edit for clarification togaf is the open group architecture framework a detailed method and set of tools for developing an enterprise architecture

27433
lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
for the same reason i recommend experimenting with many languages programming styles including ruby python dynamic language haskell f# pure functional language lisp scheme functional language etc.

27525
pull	push
working with concurrent systems this is pretty much how my design worked anyway in any language -- a queue that multiple threads would pull data from perform a simple operation and repeat or push back onto the queue

27698
ready	each
each one of the consumers received a whole packet of data from the queue ready to calculate

27811
klocwork	coverity
static analysis tools like coverity klocwork grammatech have good analysis techniques that should produce more accurate results

27875
getter	setter
i would love to see support on c# s syntax for getter and setter

27875
getter	setter
when you have lots of getter and setter a simple syntax such as c# s is a great performance booster instead of doing it the java way and writing getter and setter methods

27892
implements	extends
according rfc s urischeme and it s default scheme implementation maybe make it possible to implements other urischemes extends the uribase

27934
uniq	grep
the unix file processing tools wc sort uniq awk cat grep find et cetera including-- as others have mentioned-- a good shell bash

27941
klocwork	coverity
the second best option is to invest for one or more high-end static analysis tools like earlier mentioned coverity or klocwork

28098
imperative	declarative
yes i understand that they are declarative not imperative languages

28155
imperative	declarative
you hit it on the head when you said declarative not imperative

28167
imperative	declarative
words like declarative imperative and turing complete are more precise terms with very specific meanings

28181
maven	pom.xml
also you should make sure that the github metadata for your project maven pom.xml files and so on also declare the licensing in the appropriate way

28250
imperative	declarative
the declarative vs imperative is a red-herring here

28259
lambda	first-class-functions
lambda goes with first-class-functions i guess

28259
serializable	deserialization
reflexion distributed computation requires serializable which should be left to the compiler and deserialization is more easily achieved with some form of reflexion

28264
int	boolean
in c code it could be a problem particularly because in c a boolean is just an int that is non-zero or zero --but in most strongly typed languages runtime type checking if the passwordcheck variable was declared as a boolean there is no way to assign something else to it

28310
strcpy	strcmp
implement strcpy strcmp and friends

28351
versioning	upgrade
i am thinking to upgrade my java versioning not from experience though we are using jdk1.5 to 1.6 getting certificate

28445
valgrind	callgrind
i use valgrind callgrind on linux in conjunction with pin and parallel studios on windows

28468
emacs	jedit	vim	jedit	vim	emacs	vim	notepad++	notepad++	jedit
i personally use intellij idea as my primary ide for development but sometimes switch to eclipse and netbeans a bit and sometimes i use jedit notepad++ emacs vim

28471
vim	emacs
choose vim or i guess emacs if you re that kind of person

28497
vim	emacs
i know emacs most than others vim a little less than emacs and knows where to click in visual studio

28500
vim	emacs
like the other posters have said choose one of the two great editors - vim or emacs

28768
awt	swing
for instance in java you have a timer that is used for background ui tasks and a timer that is used for background application not tied to awt swing tasks

28961
haskell	ocaml
haskell s type system is rich and complex and all the more interesting when compared to the type systems of c++ and ocaml

28975
erlang	ocaml	haskell	ocaml
also there s the emergence of multi-core and cloud computing which is something that many languages are attempting to capitalize on like concurrent languages like erlang and go or functional languages like haskell and ocaml

28976
haskell	scheme
if the type system is bothering you i would suggest you to try a more dynamic language like scheme or get around to using haskell s type inference system

28978
mouse	keyboard
alot of the so called mind control apps so far seem to be fairly rudimentary read scan apps that look to profile a certain activity or perhaps allow the user to manipulate or control an app in a way loosely analogous to using a mouse keyboard

28979
jobs	cron
i have mainly done frontend web dev and a little php cron jobs

28991
scheme	racket
i have been working in racket scheme this last term and there have been a number of times where i have passed an unparsed s-exp where i expected a parsed ast to some function in my interpreter and it only showed up in my medium sized test suite

29001
des	aes
there are a number of encryption algorythms des aes blowfish twofish and so on

29001
des	aes
if i use built-in java encryption api s des aes - does it mean that i will be free from possible commercial interests of des aes alike copyright holders

29072
ant	maven
can somebody please tell me in simple words what exactly is ant build file and maven build file

29073
maven	pom.xml
pom.xml files are used by maven which has a different philosophy and imposes more structure

29073
ant	maven
the maven approach is more declarative than ant

29089
vim	emacs
to execute on every line that does not match the regex to replace emacs with vim except on lines that contain the word sucks

29112
boost	stl
using the nice library features of the language like stl and boost

29112
boost	stl
infinite amounts of pain when they don t work and anybody who tells me that stl and especially boost are stable and portable is

29140
error-handling	exception-handling
exception-handling can allow easier error-handling

29162
put	get
she would get a big poster frame and put fancy but mono-chromatic patterned paper cloth behind it

29226
equals	tostring	equals	gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode	tostring	getter
in .net examples would be tostring equals gethashcode property getter and implicit conversions

29231
gtk	clutter
i also do a lot of work with gnome technologies like gtk and clutter all of which are written in c using the gobject system

29296
lisp	prolog
any ai professor will code in lisp or prolog or something like that

29344
clang	llvm
the first names that come to mind are clang and llvm

29345
clang	llvm
neither could the llvm authors redistribute them instead every llvm clang user would have to download them on their own

29374
haskell	ocaml
but really haskell ocaml d ml and such are all fine

29407
post	get
you can get the basics down using the other post but eventually you ll have to deal with cross-browser compatibility

29475
phong	shading
when i render in phong shading i no longer interpolate an intensity ambientlight or a color red green blue - i interpolate a normal vector nx ny nz and at each step i have to re-calculate the lighting equation based on the interpolated normal vector

29494
mvp	presenter
this leads me to think that the model-view- presenter mvp pattern would suit your development needs better

29507
ant	maven
i m curious if this will affect all those apache projects built around java tomcat ant maven derby jackrabbit just to name a few

29623
filtering	grouping
in that case you would not need an entire village the grouping end up with a handful of motivated people and would really filtering itself out in a week

29761
hash	salt
the password is salt and hash and then stored in the database

29784
phpunit	simpletest
testing has to be as easy as possible thats the reason why i ditched phpunit for simpletest

29803
pascal	delphi
simplicity - delphi s syntax is based on pascal which was explicitly designed to be easy to learn and it can deliver on that promise

29803
pascal	delphi
productivity - delphi is a descendant of turbo pascal and it still has the fastest compiler known to man which will boost your productivity enormously

29811
vim	emacs
simply consider visual studio and emacs vim

29811
vim	emacs
this mess up with the display in emacs vim

29841
ubuntu	debian
what has improved as well is that you can now have current packages for your distro meaning you don t need to wait until the next release of say debian ubuntu until you get the latest mono version without having to compile them yourselfs

29913
lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
search resumes for other functional languages such as scheme lisp or haskell

29999
ant	maven
they know it is a bad practice but they think that it works and it is not really a problem even when many people know about maven and other tools for building besides ant

30007
bazaar	git
if your firm is using a distributed scm git hg bazaar then those binary files must be copied and stored among all the developers

30033
put	get
when the data is similar however it makes perfect sense to put it in columns as in your second example only there is it not similar but you get the point

30036
int	boolean
nevertheless an implementation of this means that of the twelve available casts which cover eight different types the names of these casts can not be used as classnames int binary boolean anymore

30086
radio-button	checkbox
if the login name is the same as the email then you select an additional checkbox radio-button etc

30092
put	get
even though i have 6-7 years of experience with php then when i started working again a couple of months ago after a break for several months where i focused on my study i had to get back to it before i could really work again which put me right back to the annoyances of programming and therefore i didn t get much out of my break

30148
forth	brainfuck
if you re in doubt take apl or j or brainfuck or even plain and simple lisp or forth and try to understand any not entirely trivial program on it

30186
clang	llvm
cling as you might guess from the game is based on clang llvm

30267
free	malloc
that lets it be more efficient overall indeed the runtime cost of a modern gc is less than a normal malloc free system even without the extra overhead of smart pointers and do what work it still needs to do without getting in the way of the application threads

30326
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
i never had a classcastexception and very few nullpointerexception when interacting with java

30344
bazaar	svn
also the bazaar commands are very similiar to it s svn counterparts therefore somebody who has worked with subversion before can easily use bazaar without to much of a learning curve

30367
mouse	keyboard
become a fantastic typist use keyboard shortcuts instead of the mouse

30372
bash	zsh
similarly just reading through the man page for bash or zsh always gives new tricks to use

30463
put	get
after that i try to put these skills into my work but i rarely get the chance

30485
post	get
in conclusion i will spend some months lost till i decide like the majority of passionate developer to give up and take a merely boring architect post to get more cash

30735
getter	setter
the immediate example that comes to mind is auto-properties in c# not the only language that has something similar given that the majority of getter setter in any app are really just wrappers around a field just allow the developer to indicate their intent and let the compiler inject the rest

30748
rally	greenhopper
i ve used both rally and jira with greenhopper

30748
agile	greenhopper
greenhopper is an add-on that enables teams to begin working with agile

30855
agile	sprint
agile teams also demo their software after every sprint or iteration

30987
put	get
on the other hand unless you get put on the front page of digg you won t need to scale for a while

30994
agile	sprint
follow agile processes and make sure that code review is part of the sprint

31052
lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
and if you have time learn haskell scheme lisp etc

31523
disk	ram
sort the data by user_id and if that s not possible get a huge amount of ram or ssd disk

31604
minix	linux
one of the greatest foul plays in microsoft s history is paying someone to write a book claiming that linux source code was stolen from minix in an attempt to make companies afraid to use linux so that it can sell its own products in the basis that it was not legal to use stolen source code

31650
tortoisegit	svn
on the other side if you go for a distributed approach than go for git even on windows it s good enough since now you have tortoisegit the same interface that also exists for svn

31673
put	get
so that i can continue to use computers without dishonor i have decided to put together a sufficient body of free software so that i will be able to get along without any software that is not free

31745
hl7	x12
he may know plenty about combinatorics but i m willing to bet he knows very little about the lovely world of hl7 and x12 edi

32395
implements	extends
java has extends for subclassing and implements for interfaces which is quite nice

32427
feedback	review
lots of review and feedback and its only finished when it has to be published released

32442
lisp	scheme
what is unique to scheme lisp that will teach me something new

32509
min	max	minimum	max
i would see mean min max and standard deviation as a minimum to use the information in a statistically meaningful manner

32648
emacs	gedit	vim	emacs	vim	notepad++	vim	gedit	notepad++	gedit
you really need to think that an ide is just an editor + compiler + some sort of makefile + debugger sometimes + graphical ui builder sometimes so of course you can choose not to use an ide at all and you replace them with an editor of your choice vim emacs gedit notepad++ insert_others_here an compiler jdk for java gcc platform sdk or insert_cpp_toolchain_here for c++ python interpreter or whatever toolchain your language has some sort of makefile like autoh.

32648
ant	maven
tools cmake ant maven etc. some sort of debugger that usually is included with the compiler and if you want an graphical ui builder glade comes to mind and there you have it your own ide without an ide

32649
pop-up	dialog
in the system you are trying to model do you intend that the system be able to pop-up a dialog box for example whenever the cyber spirit moves it requiring the user to break state and deal with the system s demand

32656
kate	kde
my favorite happens to be kate which comes with kde

32713
mouse	keyboard
i progressively learned how to read out the keyboard state or the mouse how to use graphics code

32762
scheme	prolog
one of the best undergrad classes i ever had was writing simple 20 instruction interpreters for fortan scheme prolog etc in the languages themselves

32781
imperative	declarative
made a map from imperative concepts to sql concepts to translate imperative solutions into declarative ones

32783
imperative	declarative
the op s purpose was to learn how to shift the mindset from imperative to declarative

32805
membase	couchdb
there is some very good info on this in this article cassandra vs mongodb vs couchdb vs redis vs riak vs hbase vs membase vs neo4j comparison

32825
flask	django
think of all the cool shiny stuff that s been coming out recently python ruby rails django flask node.js etc

32827
imperative	declarative
your problem with declarative styles is that you re back where you were when you first started with imperative styles a clueless newb

32827
scheme	prolog	haskell	scheme
scheme haskell and the mls for mostly functional programming or alternatively prolog and mercury for mostly logic programming

32827
lisp	prolog
i d especially recommend learning one of the functional languages clojure as one of the lisp is probably a good choice here and one of the logic languages i like mercury best but prolog has a lot more useful material for learning for maximal thought process expansion

32839
wmic	winexe
winexe wmic - wmi agent

32984
int	chars
int copy4bytes chars psrc chars pdest

32984
int	chars
int copybytes chars psrc chars pdest int numbytestocopy

32984
for-loop	arrays
using the example above what is easier to read and understand if you are skimming through code copybytes or a for-loop iterating through an arrays moving data one index at a time

33043
children	parent
heap-like ordering means that both children of a parent have lower priorities than the parent

33087
np-hard	np-complete
it is used for modeling and solving combinatorial problems np-hard np-complete

33208
springsource	grails
springsource acquiring g2one and groovy and grails with it is a strong indicator to me that there s a need for other languages in this case a scripting language on the jvm

33338
nunit	mstest
the only real difference i noticed when i had to create a build script to run on a dedicated msbuild server form tfs setting nunit up and getting nunit test results was a real pain setting it up and getting the results for mstest was a breeze

33424
sudoku	crossword
ask him if he as ever worked on a crossword or better yet a sudoku puzzle

33498
nunit	nmock
i would like to add solid unit test coverage around the legacy code using the usual suspects nmock nunit statlight for the silverlight bits

33582
subtract	add
i mean being able to add and subtract dates hours and minutes and not having to deal with the number of milliseconds since january 1 1970

33634
google-chrome	firefox
we re looking for a web framework that makes the site look good on an ipad but also makes the site work well in a desktop browser such as google-chrome ie or firefox on windows or a mac

33634
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
the exception seems to be sproutcore which seems to be a full-fledged javascriptmvc application framework

33641
teamcity	nant
msbuild is preferable over nant for simple reason that all the project solution files in the vs2008 2010 are msbuild files technically but you can configure teamcity with msbuild or nant

33728
pascal	delphi
most of what the core of the code does is to work around the strictness of delphi pascal to create an environment in which extensibility attribute inheritance and unlimited undo is easy to do

33777
accessor	properties
i don t see properties accessor on the model classes

33783
ant	maven
but more often than not something like ant and maven are the common ground

33786
disk	ram
the language doesn t matter too much when you consider performance is limited by disk usage and ram not cpu

33839
ada	pascal
bounded and distinct integers types like in pascal and ada

33856
activemq	rabbitmq
thus you can connect your clients to any tcp ip service irc servers custom applications stomp daemons such as rabbitmq and activemq

33955
ready	each
i imagine that when i approach the workplace each day i will make a single tap on my phone to fire up the instance so it is ready when i get to work

34123
disk	ram
i have no hard evidence at hand but my gut tells me you should probably be more concerned about bits of cache ram disk being corrupt then the calculation being incorrect

34209
tablet	galaxy
i recently purchased a samsung galaxy tab as a reference implementation phone and first gen android tablet of android 2.x for app development

34224
trac	mantis	redmine	mantis	redmine	trac
a centralized server such as trac redmine jira mantis or whatever you want takes care of both of those problems

34227
clang	llvm
my questions are to people who actively contribute to large opensource projects like the linux kernel or gcc or clang llvm or anything else with say a developer head count of more than 10

34235
put	get
when you try to get these people to learn anything they ll put up a lot of resistance rather than see the new tool as something interesting and time saving

34260
put	get
getting good at programming is not about foundations it s about continually expanding your toolbox and the learning you get is so much more worth when you can put it into context of a problem that really needs solving rather than just pure theoretical research

34332
rss	feed
in order to keep up to date i listen to podcasts subscribe to rss feed peruse stackoverflow and attend developer events

34389
vim	emacs
be programming in an editor via an ssh session vi vim nano emacs

34414
division	addition
in addition to using tools to solve those conflicts there is usually some division into stacks or tiers to help avoid the conflicts in the first place

34417
put	get
unlike the iphone you can put apps you have written on the web and allow anyone to install them without having to pay to get them in the official market or get them approved or anything else

34782
wxpython	pyqt
there really is not any standard out there for python gui development at least not that i have seen but of my fellow python developers that i have worked with over the years they have suggested to me wxpython and pyqt more than any of the other toolkits

34783
lxml	beautifulsoup
it wouldn t be to difficult to do something similar with say lxml or beautifulsoup in python

34801
pull	push
in most dvcses network access only occurs when you do a push or pull operation

34816
put	get
i only get intimidated and put off from applying for something if i see things in the job description which are far beyond my skills and experience

34863
vb6	vba
but even if vba went the way of vb6 i think there would be a need for vba development for quite some time given the sheer quantity of legacy office applications out there

34970
codeigniter	kohana
and why i am asking is because from what i read about most php frameworks codeigniter kohana cake zend is that they re ether too complex or are designed mostly for small applications like blogs

34971
kohana	yii	codeigniter	kohana	codeigniter	yii
i ve tried yii kohana and codeigniter and found codeigniter to have the smallest learning curve and yet still supplies almost all of the functionality i needed for my application

35011
mybb	phpbb
a forum smf mybb phpbb can be quite an useful tool too

35035
kohana	yii	symfony	kohana
it s the least like a framework in comparison to zend kohana yii cake symfony and any other known php framework

35069
postgresql	mysql
also i heard postgresql is written cleanly as opposed to mysql but i haven t read it myself

35080
cvs	svn
dvcss are easier and more natural but they are different don t try to think that cvs svn base of all versioning

35080
cvs	svn
the best way you can convince yourself of using a dvcs is trying out a dvcs every experienced dvcs developer that has used svn cvs will tell you that is worth it and that they don t know how they survived all their time without it

35080
pull	push
what you are seeing is developers being able to focus on their own work while commiting without the fear of breaking others code they worry about breaking others code after pushing pulling dvcss first commit then push pull then update but since merging is smarter here they often never do.

35082
ant	maven
as a software developer until now i ve mostly worked on projects that were quite monolithic with hardly any dependencies on other projects without building automation no make ant maven etc. and kept on a simple version control system mostly subversion with just a few easily managed version branches

35208
put	get
will the higher degree right off the bat help me get a better-paying job just out of college or will the extra year only put me further into debt

35233
verilog	hdl	verilog	vhdl
that is the set of hdl languages notably vhdl and verilog to a lesser extent

35422
cvs	rcs
i you liked your histories classes try sccs rcs cvs subversion and then use some thing useful like git or mercurial

35538
lisp	prolog
lets not even talk about 6502 assembly apple basic lisp prolog pascal span fortran.

35611
getter	setter
some argue for example that writing tests for getter setter of pojos is a waste of time

35656
ienumerable	ienumerator
a good example in c# is ienumerable where other classes doesn t need to know the exact class it returns only that it is a ienumerator

35671
vb.net	vb6
dev 4 knows c# and vb6 vb.net should be pretty easy to pick up

35692
ssl	ocsp
now ssl validates the certificates and during validation it uses several pki protocols and standards crls ocsp requests etc

35761
getter	setter
but if you work with eg dna sequences in bioperl using the objects every time and working consistently with getter and setter can increase the calculation time a tenfold

35813
rpm	yum
note that there are rpm s available for redhat based linux systems providing for automatic upgrades with yum which is nice

35921
pull	push
either you will pull wrong revisions in which case you can simply ignore or remove them or you will push the correct versions again which automatically restores the remote repository

35944
post	get
at its simplest you create a set of get post requests that anyone can call and publish the information on the urls parameters and effects

35944
post	get
get requests for read-only tasks and post requests for anything that will change data on the server

36039
apache	nginx
you can run it under iis apache nginx etc

36039
postgresql	mysql
php itself is free and the majority of items it works with out of the box apache postgresql mysql are free

36048
vim	emacs
if the dinosaurs are epic enough to hack on emacs vim all day why can t the should be capable of creating an extension that automatically wraps lines or gives horizontal scrolling capabilities to their cli ides

36050
put	get
to get around this put a line in the destructor that removes the object being destroyed from its parent s list

36080
postgresql	mysql
postgresql mysql ms sql server firebird sqlite or some other database

36118
post	get
built-in handling of data from get post and cookies

36316
getter	setter
so properties are a way to declare and or implement getter setter

36316
getter	setter
do you think getter setter are against the spirit of oop

36351
ant	maven
depending on your environment you may want to look at make c c++ ant maven java gradle groovy - that s the ones i m familiar with

36380
wordpress	joomla
i have heard about many content management systems cmss such as drupal wordpress joomla etc

36384
wordpress	oscommerce
some are intended for blogs such as wordpress others for ecommerce such as oscommerce and some are generic

36435
jobs	cron
bring everything into production mode by launching database servers setting up cron jobs etc

36459
jar	war
in our configuration this does all the necessary building of the war file pulling in the jar dependencies as needed the deployment to the dev web server and creation of canned test data on the dev database

36473
nant	cruisecontrol
nant is for the build scripts that get executed in the cruisecontrol projects

36531
vim	emacs
he was programming in vim or emacs

36627
rtsp	rtmp
a part of the pie for rtsp after mms and rtmp but it s marginal

36898
rss	feed
a lot of them are rss feed

36953
subtract	add
ask about tdd test-driven development subtract 2 points if they don t use tdd add 1 if they do

36953
subtract	add
ask about iterations how long are they subtract 2 points if they don t do iterative development subtract 1 if the iteration is longer than a month or less than two weeks add 1 if its 2 weeks

36953
subtract	add
ask how estimation is done add 1 if they use story points add 2 if they do planning poker or something similar subtract one if they use absolute time estimates subtract 2 if developers aren t involved in the estimation process

36953
subtract	add
ask how features are built add 1 if a developer is responsible for the feature from top to bottom vertical slice subtract 1 if developers are responsible for a specific layer horizontal slice

36964
agile	sprint
when you started working with agile what things that you were doing during the early sprint did you change during later sprint or projects as you got to grips with the methodology

37046
factors	mean
clever coding and modulation schemes these days often mean that you can get a link bandwidth of say 1 m bits sec with an occupied frequency bandwidth of 100 khz - a factors of 1 10 better

37058
expression-blend	silverlight
silverlight developers are for the most part c# developers - but c# devs familiar with xaml and ui development - though you can put expression-blend in the hands of a suitable designer and have them to the ui

37080
put	get
i get the impression from the things i ve been reading and seeing is that it means more js will be pulled out into external library files and not put inline in the html page

37237
public	protected
by downloading them from a protected or even public location or by shipping the source with the app

37238
post	get
the ideal http implementation uses http header actions for manipulating the data post for updating records delete for deleting them get for viewing them options for learning about them and so on

37238
post	get
the ideal is not required as not all clients can easily send http delete messages but the principle can be simplified into a common set of post and get commands a common set of variables mapped to those actions

37238
post	get
sessions via cookies post get parameters or otherwise are initiated and used for subsequent access to apis

37288
bash	tcsh
bash or tcsh for how to administer a computer programmatically

37292
lisp	scheme
lisp preferably scheme in combination with abelson sussman s structure and interpretation of computer programs will teach you to think in terms other than those imposed by c c++

37444
lisp	prolog
there are a number of programming languages that will require that you think about a problem in a new way relative to what you are used to of course. the most common languages to learn having been taught a imperative language is a functional and a logical language for instance prolog and lisp

37444
haskell	ocaml
some languages are heavily influenced by category theory like ocaml and haskell and some are cross breed languages like curry functional and logical

37495
agile	metrics
this is something i could work out if my backlog was in good order and the stories were cut up by feature but we re just starting out with agile so i need some way of working out what the value is we deliver now then use a similar metrics in say six months to see if we ve increased our output

37557
rss	feed
subscribe to the rss feed at and take time to complete them as they come out

37646
feedback	review
product owners conversely agree to continuously review the incremental releases and provide prompt feedback

37668
versioning	upgrade
on the other hand for something like a large web portal system written as a web app which can easily be upgrade at any time by rolling out fixes as they come out it may make more sense to release an initially dodgy versioning and then patch issues and edge case funcionality as you get to it

37798
hide	show
the form that got me thinking about this had a good bit of logic built in to show and hide fields based on the user s responses and seems like it would have been less efficient to use mvc and jquery

37838
udp	tcp
otherwise internet runs tcp ip two protocols and udp

37845
put	get
are almost universal like get put and delete

37846
ftp	telnet
it was a bubbling pot of ftp telnet gopher ping finger and a few other bits and bobs

37850
stateless	stateful
the internet isn t necessarily stateless - in fact when you look at java ee - they have stateful ejbs and stateless ejbs

38131
vim	emacs
as for me i was using both emacs and vim for development currently stick with

38134
vim	emacs
for example at facebook the guy next to me was using vim and the guy next to him was using emacs

38134
vim	emacs
you are not a better developer because you are using emacs or vim but the kind of people who are dedicated enough to master these tools tend to be good developer 1

38135
vim	emacs
look at it this way emacs and vim excel at text surgery and automatization of repetitive keystrokes not to mention navigation of large chunks of text

38207
vb.net	vb6
so i have decided that now is the moment to roll up my sleeves and try and convince my employer that he should let me develop new code in vb.net using vb6 for maintenance only

38256
postgresql	mysql
create a pretty large program using lamp i still have nightmares about php but used postgresql instead of mysql and i am very happy about knowing this dbms now

38257
haskell	scheme
strangely people who learn haskell or scheme as their first and only language don t seem to share this worldview

38284
ready	each
also important is that mostly like in scrum each intermediate delivery should be nearly ready to be put into production

38380
jobs	cron
apart from php cron jobs i cant think of any way to detect if there has been a new tweet posted

38405
lisp	scheme
yet i d happily defer to a scheme or lisp expert if we encountered a project that necessitated either

38407
perl	tcl
say you are good at c++ but also know perl tcl and some ruby i d be willing to consider you for java

38423
getter	setter
when are getter and setter justified

38423
getter	setter
is it a good programming practice to not use getter and setter in trivial parts of code

38424
getter	setter
at the very least consistency should be an important factor across a code base so i d have thought that if getter setter are used they should be used globally

38425
getter	setter
a class with extensive getter setter pairs may be poorly designed in that it may be poorly encapsulating it s implementation detail

38425
getter	setter
but the getter setter themselves are not usually the problem in such a scenario the simple fact that the data is public often is so in such a scenario a big list of public variables might be just as bad

38429
getter	setter
it is good programming practice not to use getter and setter in classes that are intended to be more than bundles of data like a c struct

38430
getter	setter
you l quickly realise whether you really need those setter and getter

38430
getter	setter
oh and if your design later on says i need all of those getter and setter then that s what modern ides are for

38438
getter	setter
if you want to make sure that only your object is changing it s own internal state then getter setter are the way to go

38438
getter	setter
the getter setter guards the internal state making sure that external classes have no other way to get at it

38581
bibtex	latex
in such an environment think python sql academic special-purpose command line utils text files latex bibtex learning emacs made roughly the difference between a hand-trowel and a backhoe

38614
serializable	deserialization
separate serializable deserialization from classes

38614
serializable	deserialization
i ve found personally that it s preferable to separate serializable deserialization from the actual classes

38615
post	put
i think it s fine to put any community efforts on your cv i for one would at least then be able to look up some real answers blog post open source contributions etc that you ve made

38696
gauge	progress
but will enable you to gauge your own progress and to choose what to read and when

38825
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t work with firefox or google-chrome

38833
ant	maven
so how would ant or maven know what to pick up for the respective build

38833
jobs	cron
the ant build scripts are run as cron jobs at different times intervals for different environments

38857
put	get
you re going to be a bit of a big fish in a small sea but the book i m reading says on page 21 even the most odd and obscure applications get downloaded by at least 1 000 people within their first month on the market. that s encouraging enough for me to put my app in there as my market of choice

38869
postgresql	mysql
learn about databases - mysql mssql postgresql etc stored procs good db design basic admin

38897
logmein	hamachi
logmein has hamachi 2 which is very straight forward to setup and work with

38984
getter	setter
the notion of getter and setter is utterly stupid extremism so you shouldn t use them

38984
getter	setter
however these are not getter and setter in the sense of setting components of a product type because that s what you re trying to prevent since some values of the private data structure do not represent values of the abstract type

39017
ocaml	sml
the standard meta-language sml and ocaml are based directly on this model

39052
put	get	feedback	review
perhaps by your colleagues code review pair programming etc. or you put it online somewhere and get feedback from smart folks online

39107
subtract	add
not just add subtract after all.

39206
ubuntu	linux
or installing ubuntu or another linux operating system instead of your current operating system

39215
cvs	svn
git but svn or cvs is a start

39287
versioning	upgrade
i understand that any shipped source code must be preserved because of the need to provide support to the customers without requiring them to perform a major versioning upgrade

39336
put	get
sometimes you have to put on stuff you don t know very well to get past hr

39336
postgresql	mysql
how many job descriptions have you read that say things like knowledge of mysql sql server oracle sybase postgresql c++ java com win32 asp asp.net vb etc blah blah

39342
versioning	upgrade
each of these aren t going to be upgrade to the latest versioning for a variety of reasons so you are supporting all with bug fixes

39357
ironruby	ironpython
imo a language like python ironpython or jython if the host system is .net or java or ruby ironruby jruby is better for basing your dsl on than java or c#

39375
vb.net	vb6
just keep in mind that idiomatic vb6 does not translate well to c# or even vb.net so you ll want to tread carefully

39377
vb.net	vb6
in terms of maintainability keep in mind that hybrid vb6 vb.net should only be a temporary solution your plan should be to migrate fully to vb.net over time

39434
min	max
i add all tasks and features to bugtracker along with my min max probable estimates

39434
min	max
as i move through my tasks i can see from my history that on average my probable estimates are off by x for me it s 26 so i can take my total time and project all remaining tasks with my min max and adjusted probable time

39515
post	put
often i ll post questions on stackoverflow or another forum desiring feedback only to receive comments about how not to put the cart before the horse regarding performance

39595
google-chrome	firefox
good examples in various areas include firefox preferences about config userchrome.css al. google-chrome basic settings vs under the hood mac os x pref panes defaults 1 applescript automator or even vim s vimrc

39713
put	get
the reason it s good for that count to be low is if it takes n changes to implement a typical requirement and as a fallible programmer you only get n-1 or n-2 of them done correctly at first you ve put in 1 or 2 bugs

39757
swt	swing
many alternatives exist that have learned from swing what not to do like qt swt and i think even gtk

39759
floating-point	integer
integer and floating-point numbers

39803
postgresql	mysql
if i want to download mysql postgresql and connect to that from c# is that ok

39815
ant	maven
in java use maven or ant

39817
integer	unsigned
if you re multiplying a signed integer by an unsigned integer the compiler will often silently promote the signed one to a possible enormous unsigned one possibly resulting in an error systems hungarian makes this look wrong

39818
postgresql	mysql
if i want to download mysql postgresql and connect to that from c# is that ok

39854
int	double
i mean contrary to popular belief java does support operator overloading for example the + operator is overloaded for byte short int long float double and string and iirc in java 7 also for biginteger and bigdecimal and probably a couple i forgot it s just that you don t have any influence over it

39862
textmate	kate	textmate	geany	kate	kde	kate	geany
let s try a good text-editor pspad for ms-windows freeware textmate for mac os x geany for gnu desktop opensource or kate for kde opensource

40083
haskell	ocaml
look into haskell or ocaml for a start

40107
accessor	properties
in that case it makes no sense it only makes sense if the left-hand operand is a properties accessor

40107
accessor	properties
there s a properties accessor in there but i still don t think it makes sense if mywidget is null does that mean we don t call foo at all

40193
srp	principles
a good design will make it easy to figure out where to fix problems dry principles srp principles

40232
put	get
however if your actions are always get put and delete the change in naming might not matter that much

40246
cstring	bstr
bstr cstring lpctstr or char without searching for the declaration

40280
accessor	properties
if you wanted to do something like this right you could take the lamdba as an expression and modify the expression on the fly to add the null checks around each properties accessor

40352
ada	algol	fortran	ada
many languages picked up this technique -- ada algol fortran ml ...

40505
getter	setter
if it s a set of getter and setter that s better but still not great

40765
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
prebuild - generate project files for all vs version including major ide s and tools like sharpdevelop monodevelop nant and autotools

40770
vb.net	vb6
although vb6 code will be successfully migrated to vb.net it is very often necessary to refactor to obtain better performance

40773
vsto	add-in
for things like writing com add-in for microsoft office you would use visual-studio or vsto

40781
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
versions of basic such as vba vb6 or vb.net are very commonly the first programming language learned by people who now program for a living

40800
imperative	declarative
your code will be declarative rather than imperative

40808
verilog	vhdl
trying to think about matlab in terms of python or d is like trying to think about lisp or haskell in terms of c or about verilog and vhdl in terms of javascript---they solve different problems and approach problem solving in radically different ways

40808
integer	fractions
all scientific measurements contain some error and it s absurd to say from the perspective of the average matlab customer that a given quantity is an integer and not a real number with a tiny fractions component

40832
hide	show
in each mode the page looks different the changes are not big - it show hide 5 text fields in different combinations based on the mode

40832
jsf	seam
we use seam jsf facelets here is pseudo facelet code to make it easier to understand

40837
lisp	smalltalk
some languages ship with support for large numbers smalltalk haskell common lisp and some don t

40857
hide	show
in other words write client-side code which hide and show the relevant fields on the fly depending on which mode state it is in

40965
versioning	upgrade
web apps can be continuously upgrade without actually releasing anything and some people like grabbing the source for some of their apps from a publicly available versioning control system and doing their own compiles

41045
lisp	scheme
there are no shortage of vague scheme vs common lisp questions on both stackoverflow and on this site so i want to make this one more focused

41045
lisp	scheme
while coding in scheme what specific elements of your common lisp coding experience did you miss most

41045
lisp	scheme
or inversely while coding in common lisp what did you miss from coding in scheme

41045
lisp	scheme
i was trying to implement x in common lisp and if i had scheme s first-class continuations i totally would ve just done y but instead i had to do z which was more of a pain.

41045
lisp	scheme
i have a large existing c++ codebase and for me being able to embed c++ calls directly in my gambit scheme code was totally worth any shortcomings that scheme may have vs common lisp even including lack of swig support.

41413
inherited	subclassing
if you use this technique to tackle big projects you risk winding up with 5-10 layers of inherited where each subclassing is coupled to more and more flags

41420
ant	maven
if you are already using source control management scm such as subversion and a build tool like ant or maven that hudson supports then it is not that much work to set up an automated build for the projects

41434
google-chrome	firefox
i think it s telling that many of the large popular cross-platform apps invent their own cross-platform approach firefox google-chrome eclipse openoffice.org are examples that come to mind

41434
google-chrome	firefox
but i have done a lot of work on gtk+ and have some familiarity with codebases including firefox google-chrome and eclipse

41471
factors	mean
i think education i mean the style of it rather than quality is a much stronger factors

41670
feedback	review
apply all feedback from defects discovered during testing review and production to a process and developers who inserted defect in first place

41682
nfa	dfa
especially where the dfa and nfa part comes in

41689
disk	ram
the underlying darwin kernel virtual memory system to map both fragmented physical ram and disk space which is a different physical device from the ram into something that appears to the dynamic memory allocator like it s physically contiguous and linearly addressable ram

41738
x86	mips
if you have mips i believe its better for teaching but i suppose x86 is more convenient since it is more widespread x86_64 better since has more registers and niceties

41738
lisp	scheme
scheme or common lisp or clojure as dukeofgaming said lisp languages let you teach recursion well for this scheme is best since doesn t have explicit loops

41738
lisp	scheme
lisp and scheme are considered functional but to emphasize functional programming you have to force the students to think without state

41830
xslt	sgml
there s a few markup languages as well html xslt fo xslt css xml sgml that folks need exposure to if they will work with the web in any way

41836
lisp	scheme
one alternative would be python first and then common lisp instead of scheme more work but more reward

41864
client-side	server-side
sometimes a lot of client-side code can be moved server-side depending on what you re doing

41883
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it seems like most of common web browsers firefox google-chrome safari are developed using c++

41892
google-chrome	firefox
the best way to do that is to focus on something like firefox or google-chrome and then patch edit to get ie to work

41893
google-chrome	firefox
i love and use google-chrome firefox and ie9 for different things

41893
google-chrome	firefox
if the business uses both macs and pcs then you obviously need to use a browser that supports both operating systems like firefox or google-chrome

41899
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
the rest being mozilla google-chrome safari and opera

41902
google-chrome	safari
konqueror became safari and google-chrome

41902
haskell	ocaml
this is an obstacle for languages like ocaml f# haskell common lisp and d that are fast and high-level enough to write a browser in nicely but have few followers in the 10k-100k range maybe even if you liberally count all the hobbyists and academics

41902
lisp	smalltalk	haskell	ocaml
ocaml haskell common lisp smalltalk 1 and 2 in spades

41922
google-chrome	firefox
and stop complaining most web developers have to make their sites work on ie firefox google-chrome etc

41923
google-chrome	safari
for example both google-chrome and safari are based on webkit which has its origins in the kde project s khtml part

41979
bazaar	git
if you have a choice of version control you haven t committed to one yet i would go with one of the dvcs s distributed version control systems like git mercurial or bazaar

42090
put	get
if you can find some issues there the acceptance was not done strictly according to the predefined criteria you might be able to put some pressure on them and along with better defined quality assurance get better quality

42099
put	get
but i think some employers need a longer trial period because new employees go trough some training first so their skills might not be put to the test until they get a real task for the first time after they have completed the training

42128
vbscript	jscript
if you want to continue with windows development only then you should go with vbscript and or jscript

42273
lisp	prolog
i learned lisp and prolog

42278
integer	unsigned
so 2 16 - 1 is special because it is the largest number that a 16-bit unsigned integer can hold and the largest memory address that a 16-bit architecture can access

42292
bazaar	git
download git mercurial or bazaar and learn how to create a repository with them it s dead simple

42292
gauge	progress
ideally you would have a mentor to help you gauge your progress

filtering	grouping
if you get the grouping s expectations out up front to the candidate then if they think they aren t a good fit they may filtering themselves out of the position for you some what dependent upon the economy though

42331
jobs	cron
the way you calculate how much risk contingency to add is the percentage chance the risk might come to pass expressed as a decimal so 50 0.5 times the impact of that risk so in the example say you need to manually write cron jobs instead of using the scheduler and this will take 10 days this number is 10 days

42620
put	get
but i d like to put it out there and get some thoughts from others

42620
put	get
dr and to put it as succinctly as possible which of these would be better for a c++ java guy to learn to get some new perspectives on programming

42624
ubuntu	linux
there s a fair amount of ubuntu linux infrastructure written with python which tells me that python has application in systems programming

42632
phpstorm	rubymine	phpstorm	webstorm
i highly recommend webstorm from jetbrains or any of their intellij based products like phpstorm rubymine pycharm as they all support html

42632
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
it has project support as well as svn git perforce and cvs support

42636
google-chrome	firefox
for debugging i use ie s developer tools firefox s firebug and google-chrome s inspector

42649
scheme	racket
i know you said you narrowed it down to ruby and python but i suggest you start with racket a popular scheme

42653
bazaar	trac	bazaar	svn
if you use a version control system that is svn or bazaar try trac where you can define milestone keeping bug and features request and define your own workflow to manage a bug

42656
min	max
is there a min max value besides integer.minvalue maxvalue

42900
for-loop	loops
for example instead of using a for-loop that iterates a collection by index from 0 to count - 1 use a for-each style loops with all the logic of where to stop built into the enumerator

42908
versioning	upgrade
i received an email from red-gate this morning saying that already-paid customers will receive upgrade to the new paid versioning and a few additional years of support

42914
jms	jta
there are templates for jms jax-ws jpa jta and on and on

42914
jboss	glassfish
this has the effect of allowing system architects to avoid the use of bloated all-for-everyone application containers such as websphere jboss or glassfish and choose their lightweight counterparts instead - jetty tomcat and so on

42933
vb.net	vb6
even general-purpose languages that supported late binding resolution of types at runtime like vb6 tend to promote strong typing now vb.net because of the performance hit that used to arise when late binding was abused and because you often end up with ugly code when types are not explicit reference professional refactoring in visual basic - danijel arsenovski

42936
codeigniter	cakephp
as an employee he will be required to work on existing and new web applications that use zend framework cakephp and or codeigniter

42986
erlang	scheme	haskell	scheme
so the question is why do we need specific functional programming languages such as erlang haskell and scheme

43023
ocaml	sml
also you should have a look at languages from the ml family like sml ocaml and f# and scala which fuses oo and functional programming in a new way

43027
erlang	scheme	haskell	scheme
guaranteed tail-call optimization erlang haskell scala and scheme have this but not python ruby or clojure yet

43050
lisp	scheme
every concept available in lambda-calculus lisp and scheme is available in python so yes you can do functional programming in it

43078
erlang	scheme	haskell	scheme
so indeed we don t absolutely need erlang haskell scheme or any specific programming language but they all represent different approaches and different trade-offs making some tasks easier and some harder

43088
jsf	seam
and if i may recommend a framework seam tends to fill the holes of a lot of issues related to jsf and hibernate etc

43134
entity-relationship	diagram
i m currently taking a class for database design and we re using the entity-relationship diagram style designed by peter chen

43138
entity-relationship	diagram
in the cs dept i was taught by a very experienced db prof who used the diamonds for his entity-relationship diagram - but he didn t care if we used some other notation for our assignments we didn t do a lot of diagramming in that class not nearly as much as in the cis class at least

43138
entity-relationship	diagram
i d reckon if you say es queue ell you probably use crows foot entity-relationship diagram

43138
dia	visio
ms visio can turn your diagrams into databases and vice versa so that method of diagramming ought to capture the info you want although i ve found it to be fairly cumbersome to use and i much prefer to just use dia

43208
collabnet	svn
source control is via svn which is addressed by the enterprise via a custom solution leveraging collabnet

43242
ocp	principles
the open-closed principles ocp states that an object should be open for extension but closed for modification

43243
public	protected
it just pre-cludes you from changing the currently defined public interface to your object protected members are part of the public interface

43303
getter	setter
save methods property getter setter and simple constructors all fall into this category

43601
vb.net	vb6
i m now coding in vb.net vb6 and javascript and continue to learn tons about programming every single day

43607
put	get
i don t know if this will actually get read but i feel the need to sill put it out there

43966
ada	pascal
if i know pascal and ada - two languages with a fair bit in common and yes i know a great deal different

43966
ada	pascal
would you expect me to write pascal ada

43966
pascal	delphi
if i know pascal and delphi would i write pascal delphi

43966
pascal	delphi
delphi might be pascal based once upon a time but the oo extensions and huge libraries make the comparison one of chalk and cheese.

43993
int	double
while we re bashing matlab how about the fact that it has no int so when you need an int you have to use a double

44041
mouse	keyboard

lisp	scheme	lisp	prolog	scheme	prolog
lisp is a speech impediment prolog is a concise backstory python is a snake scheme is a disreputable plan.

44303
lisp	scheme	lisp	smalltalk
learn lisp scheme asm language of your choice c c++ smalltalk

44413
lisp	prolog
to be honest learning lisp prolog and ml went a long way to improving my skills as a programmer

44458
rss	feed
in the past this was 30 minutes before i started reading email now it is often reading books or rss feed on the bus on the way to work

44463
haskell	ocaml
i got bored after two months but lisp has prompted me to move onto ocaml haskell erlang.

44511
put	get
the paradox comes from that at some point i m looking at things from such a high level that nothing is really in focus and so the challenge them becomes trying to get back down enough to know how to put together the smaller parts while still understanding a big picture for where i m trying to improve something

44548
phong	shading

ironruby	ironpython
it s not the only .net-compatible language - other options include vb.net f# managed c++ ironruby and ironpython

44828
vbscript	jscript
one notable difference is that your only language options for asp are vbscript and jscript

44829
g++	gcc
the fsf and cygnus solutions are two companies that had a similar relationship early on fsf published gcc g++ for free cygnus provided extensive direct customer support

45034
versioning	upgrade
windows users do not upgrade just because there is a newer versioning

45106
getter	setter
dragging visual images around is just one of many development tools to make your life easier -- same as a debugger or something that auto-generates getter and setter functions -- and there s nothing inherently wrong with that

45169
boost	stl
stl and boost are utter crap - whatever

45169
boost	stl
stl and boost cause infinite amounts of pain - ridiculous

45169
printf	strtok
continued use of c api functions like printf gets also considered bad in c strtok etc.

45169
boost	stl
learn to leverage the stl and boost to gain further compile time detection of bugs and to make your life easier in other general ways the boost tokenizer for example is both type safe and a better interface

45200
lisp	racket
i suggest learning a simpler high-level language with objects first python ruby squeak common lisp racket if you must teach c++ at all

45200
haskell	ocaml
teaching the ocaml or haskell type system and then retrofitting those concepts might be faster anyway

45214
pascal	delphi
2 started on hobbyist level with delphi and pascal then studied programming in school before eventually getting a degree

45219
mouse	keyboard
as an aside before i hackintoshed the netbook i used it as an ubuntu dev box plugged into an external monitor keyboard and mouse

45277
allocator	stl
some of the performance hits i have seen usually are due to the magical memory allocator of stl yes you can change the allocator but who does that when he starts out with c++

45351
entity-relationship	diagram
you can use uml instead of entity-relationship diagram if you are familiar with uml

45354
versioning	upgrade
if you re looking for a language that is quick to learn yet powerful enough to do what you need i d offer you to take a look at runtime revolution or i think they call it livecode now it is multi-platform for pc mac linux ios as well as web apps but it is a bit pricey and i myself have not upgrade since like versioning 3.5ish

45374
haskell	scheme
functional programming languages like scheme clojure haskell and ml are something different entirely these languages are closer to math then to machine code

45561
perforce	svn
i m not trying to be too much of a pantsweasel here but the assumption in this question and all but one of the answers mostly applies to centralized vcs such as tfs svn perforce etc

45590
ant	maven
whether it s ant or maven isn t as important as the fact that the application is compiled and the jars are assembled the same way every time

45600
agile	sprint
arguing a given layout will foster better communication that will lead to better software but in working with the same team members in two separate office layouts do to a move did nothing to change the communication tendencies because they are a byproduct of behavior not office layout the agile scrum approach of addressing issues within the process after each sprint via the retrospective meeting will do more for your team then an office layout ever would

45628
put	get
this way you are still completing work on the current itterateion but have someone that is flexible and can help put out fires when needed but is handling the issues that wouldn t normally get attention

45636
lisp	scheme
i wanted to use lisp for the project and i spent about a month vacillating between using common lisp scheme or clojure

45636
lisp	racket
i was able to access the library using all three common lisp racket and clojure but i ended up choosing common lisp for the project

45636
lisp	scheme
the other factor was that i m more familiar with common lisp than with clojure or r6rs scheme

45677
mouse	keyboard
much of my coding is done on my laptop with a bigger screen external monitor and separate keyboard mouse

45691
git-rebase	undo
that is also a triple check so that even if the latest versions in the team stream are bad they are still not the ones that others git-rebase to or look at and your configuration manager can than merge the previous version to the next version to undo your delivery

45751
cpu	processors
if you re script is accessing a database and doing anything processors intensive cpu will probably be a concern way before bandwidth is

45755
disk	ram
if you re worried about disk access you might cache often used images in ram and dish them out from there

45755
disk	ram
of course ram can start swapping to the hard disk via paging and whatnot

45810
apache	nginx
apache might be a bit on the heavy side so you might for example check nginx for a lighter alternative

45828
vim	emacs
note about ides you will have better use of your screen with a high powered text editor like vim or emacs but some ides provide a decent balance

45924
min	max
each block would know how it likes to be displayed min max widths

45983

put an upgrade from previous versioning in the in-app-purchase versioning and if they activate via that route it calls home and you authenticate them against the database making sure that they re not the 500th upgrade for this user

46192
boost	stl
stl and boost are portable at the source code level

46192
boost	stl
-don t reinvent the wheel use stl and boost

46238
french	polish
however - if you decide to do this you should really check for embarrassing language in other languages - french german polish swahili..

46323
put	get
they will also look at your plan and say if we put 5 developers on task x it will get done in 1 5 the time

46369
addition	modulo	subtraction	add	subtraction	modulo	subtraction	addition
add one to an 8 bit 255 and it overflows back to zero so it acts naturally as a circular value in technical terms addition and subtraction is modulo 256

nunit	mstest
nunit or mstest

46391
moq	moles
moq rhino mock or microsoft moles

46451
hash	salt
code tests hash against entered password and salt and if verified resets the session id

46456
hash	salt
assuming you can choose a predictable salt assuming you are only concerned with rainbow tables you could always salt hash the password send that and the username to the database or if you implement you salt hash in the database and connect to your database securely you can send username and plaintext or reversibly encrypted password then do the verification logging and return the session id in one go

46618
french	turkish
after all my colleagues have been czech dutch bulgarian french american turkish swedish and croatian - with english being the common language after all the dutch guy was not happy when we needed him to translate comments every day

understand http and things like get post sessions cookies and what it means to be stateless

46760
client-side	server-side
implement both server-side and client-side monitoring and analytics one should be proactive rather than reactive

46910
google-chrome	firefox
here are links to firefox google-chrome and ie8 all of which will work properly with our site that s a whole lot harder to misunderstand

46912
versioning	upgrade
for each website we only upgrade to new versioning of our internal libraries as needed and before committing we make sure that the site compiles fine

47005
webmachine	nitrogen
of those the two that look most of interest to me are webmachine and nitrogen

47083
nagios	mrtg
or b tight budget do what you can with less nagios mrtg

47104
lwjgl	jogl
the biggest advantage of java was probably the ability to do true 3d with a signed applet and jogl lwjgl

47125
vim	emacs
and also obviously similar extensions already exist for emacs and vim so it cannot be completely pointless.

47230
pascal	delphi
creator of turbo pascal delphi c# and partly .net ..

47262
mockups	balsamiq
peldi guilizzoni the creator of balsamiq --an adobe air application for creating mockups

47331
junit	testng
the reason i ask is i m interested in qa as my career and am learning tools like junit testng and couple of frameworks

47554
haskell	scheme
isn t learning something like scheme or haskell good mental exercise if nothing else and useful at least to exposure to different ways of solving problems

47562
haskell	scheme
yes learning functional languages like scheme and haskell is good as an introduction to functional programming

47590
haskell	scheme
like scheme or haskell good mental

47608
erlang	lisp
then use a functional language like haskell lisp or erlang to evaluate the rules

47609
mvp	presenter
i have seen mvp using the view as the entry point that is in the views constructor method it creates the presenter which in turn creates the model wiring up events as needed

47609
int	double
displaying of business objects in the view a object myclass not primitive data int double

47621
perforce	svn
i ve used svn properties and perforce jobs attached to commits to show who reviewed what

47698
int	chars
java has built-in types chars and int that don t have to be allocated dynamically

47699
ring	counterclockwise
lots of great open source projects already such as incanter statistical computing or ring compojure web server framework or counterclockwise eclipse ide plugin

47747
post	get
for example when i have a page that contains a form that is submitted i would have an action that checks to see if it is dealing with a get or a post to decide what to do

47747
post	get
i think that being able to cleanly separate the handling of get and post requests is neat

47766
feedback	review
can you get people to review your code and give you feedback

47813
put	get
apologies if this question seems strange but i d rather ask and get some opinions on it to gain a better understanding of why it would be put to someone in an interview

47825
awt	swing	swt	swing
i d advise you to write a simple app in awt swing and swt and compare the development approaches an the final product between them all then review the various comments made from other developers and decide which one works best

47825
swt	swing
i ve worked with swing for many years and i used dislike swt but i d come to realise that swing is a lot more complicated than it needs to be when compared to other frameworks out there

47885
inherited	properties
new properties can be added to the prototype properties of object constructors simply functions invoked with a new keyword used to create objects with an initiation procedure and objects that have already been instantiated will still inherited the new properties

47886
client-side	server-side
javascript not to be confused with java is a high-level dynamic multi-paradigm weakly-typed language used for both client-side and server-side scripting

47912
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
silverlight 4 for window google-chrome firefox ie 6-9 mac firefox safari

47932
inherited	subclassing
nonstrict inherited allows operations to be redefined or even removed in subclassing

47945
mouse	keyboard
rather than one person tell the other what to code we just took the keyboard and mouse and coded the next section after explaining what we needed to do

48001
ubuntu	linux
contribute your time and efforts to improving open source projects such as ubuntu linux

48023
ant	maven
also if we use tools like maven ant the project involves java and some cots products build release can be simplified which should reduce manual errors intervention

48031
erlang	lisp
i ve also taken the time to teach myself lisp and erlang but that might not work with everyone

48188
imperative	declarative
to make it probably a bit more clear i mean that html is a declarative language whereas most of the dynamic stuff is done in imperative functional languages

48230
sse	avx
the guy here whom i most respect about computing stuff codes computational fluid mechanics thinks the ideal combination is lisp on the outside mainly because you avoid messy problems with memory management and fortran for the low level algorithms fortran is best for exploiting the vector capabilities of sse avx and we think this lead is unlikely to close

48279
free	malloc
manual memory management malloc free

48295
folder	directory
so those got stowed away in a special folder then called directory like c dos and the user was basically in control of the rest of the drive

48316
srp	principles
srp is a fairly straight-forward principles

48343
calloc	malloc
malloc and or calloc can return null...make sure your check return values

48395
free	malloc
i have learned that if they come from a java background then you must give pointer malloc free lessons

48463
free	malloc
you should understand why a buffer overflow against the stack is often but not always more easily exploitable than one against the heap and you should understand how the memory in the heap is laid out not in too much detail necessarily but the idea that a malloc ed region has control structures surrounding it can help understanding why your program crashes in another malloc or in free

48485
nunit	mstest
nunit is really nice but in vs2010 mstest is already fully integrated into the ide and there are full project templates for it

48564
subclass	abstract-class
by deriving from the main abstract-class you still can still adjust every stage but by deriving from a subclass you can reuse existing behavior which is already written

48573
organization	naming
features and restrictions of programming languages steer guidelines regarding code organization java packages mirrored through the directory hierarchy or that the source file must have the same name as the class within entity naming and so on

48573
organization	naming
for others and those mentioned above there are tons of style guides and other source code organization standards regulating barely anything only public function naming and tab width or pretty much everything

48589
mbunit	nunit
beyond nunit i think you could make a pretty decent argument for mbunit + gallio as mentioned by yann -- it is a very solid framework

48629
imperative	declarative
it provides a clean separation between imperative programming and declarative design

48636
agile	sprint
one thing i heard at the agile conference a few years ago was that your team is like a factory and it can product x amount of cars or in your case features per sprint

48654
rss	feed
the eu or us would be just as happy with a text-to-speech rss twitter feed reader with maybe and screen icons to indicate emotion and | to indicate a robot apocalypse.

48677
post	get
get yourself a really good rss reader that lets you reorganize filter post - i like rssowl

48677
rss	feed
it s similar in some ways to craigslist except the last i checked their rss feed weren t great and it s easier to use their search system

48720
multiplying	add
unless you multiplying every estimate by 10 and add a safety margin you re probably not going to finish the whole project before the first project schedule you make runs out

48807
int	double
and so i wrote things like string and stringbulder and i wrote the initial implementation although i did not own it forever all of the base types like int 16 32 and 64 and double and all of those

48886
decoder	encoder
but if i live in europe i d like to know if i can create software with mp3 encoder decoder and mpeg decoder encoder should i pay royalty

48939
imperative	declarative
the basic difference is that xaml is declarative while c# for example is imperative

49065
put	get
if you are using scrum put specific pieces of technical debt work on your backlog and treat them like features until you get a handle on them

49125
free	malloc
don t mix new with malloc and delete with free

49125
free	malloc
new and malloc are not interchangeable nor are delete and free

49192
lisp	scheme
i would take a look at siod scheme in one defun and some of the more stripped down versions of scheme and lisp

49193
ubuntu	linux
my experience is mainly limited to ubuntu supposedly one of the most popular and usable desktop linux variations
