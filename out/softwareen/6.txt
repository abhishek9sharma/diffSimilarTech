123123
hash	md5
another way to be a fair approximation is to calculate a hash such as md5 for the files and compare those

123131
itunes	iphoto
this means that if you know how to use textedit you automatically know how to use textmate and if you know how to use itunes you can find your way easily in iphoto and aperture

123133
kde	gnome
on linux it is the native toolkit for kde and looks ok on gnome

123144
free	malloc
the only features of c++ i m using is classes to encapsulate data and methods but that can be done as well with structs and functions i m using new and delete but could as well use malloc and free and i m using inheritance just for callbacks which could be achieved with pointers to functions

123152
implements	extends
a concrete exemple is given by gcc plugins i m working on melt a high-level domain specific language to extends gcc implements as a meta- plugin

123174
int	chars
we the programers decide whether a number in a box is an int fractions chars pointer to another box instruction for the machine pixel color for an image

123204
free	malloc
i m using new and delete but could as well use malloc and free and i m using inheritance just for callbacks which could be achieved with pointers to functions.

123209
put	get
you can then use these in your put and get methods to determine if there is space left or anything to take

123209
put	get
you can use the index pointers to implement a numitems function and you ll need them to workout the array indies to use for the get and put

123257
mantis	bugzilla
does anybody have experience with using a bug-tracking issue-tracking software like bugzilla mantis or jira not only for bugs or tasks but to initiate and maintain discussions that in the end lead to a decision

123274
getter	setter
that would give you the column names which you can then generate getter and setter based on each column name and type which you can also get from the information_schema

123281
put	get
then we would have to put plenty of comments such as create variables get input from user perform calculations print output etc

123388
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
inherited is limited to the case when you can say subclassing is a superclass

123392
getter	setter
i can point out that if you rely heavily on setter getter bean patterns generics anonymous inner classes you probably aren t coding generically like this

123392
getter	setter
setter getter force you to use code for new attributes generics force you to instantiate classes which requires code anonymous inner classes tend not to be easy to re-use elsewhere

123421
int	chars
c.function int main typeof chars typeof int

123457
vim	emacs
as much you may resist i would suggest learning vim or emacs

123457
vim	emacs
you can find extensions for vim and emacs that will do code completion for you

123474
pylons	cherrypy
with python one of the difficulties is choosing your framework zope cherrypy pylons etc all have very different design philosophies and a zope hacker cannot help you with your pylons problems

123515
getter	setter
if someone writes code so that an internal variable _fields is accessible without using getter setter methods is there a proper term used to describe that

123629
getter	setter
an internal variable _fields is accessible without using getter setter methods

123629
getter	setter
exposing an internal as in only of internal use variable over getter and setter to the outside world would be even worse

123629
getter	setter
if so we have a case where you would add getter setter methods

123629
getter	setter
whether you always want getter setter or only when needed is a coding standard issue

123629
getter	setter
violating encapsulation is absolutely possible with getter and setter

123629
getter	setter
it s even easier to slip into because most people s alarm bells don t ring when they see a bunch of getter and setter - code that s seemingly following best practices

123672
multiplying	subtract
suppose you have class called ledger a method called calculate that uses a calculator to do different types of calculations depending on the arguments passed to calculate for example multiplying x y or subtract x y

123741
jsf	tapestry
in a java company people use maven hibernate and frameworks such as jsf or tapestry

123747
ibatis	mybatis
mybatis aka ibatis in java

123757
junit	jmock
using junit and a mocking framework my favourite is jmock v2

123759
width	height
are all in specified widths and height thus i ve put the width of 640px on the tag

123759
width	font-size
should i forget all about pixels em and inches and go all the way with for both width font-size etc

123770
portrait	landscape
this tends to break pinch-zoom and landscape portrait orientation flips two important aspects of the mobile ux

123794
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
for this situation the server runs some microsoft solution probably asp.net asp.net-mvc or openrasta and the client javascript css etc. will consume this

123800
goto	break
...do not use else or else if after something that interrupts control flow Ã¢ like return break continue goto etc

123825
haskell	agda	agda	ats
advanced functional programming with languages like haskell agda coq ats etc. is quite hard to learn

123957
client-side	server-side
serialization can occur client-side logic or browser connection limits or server-side php serializes requests if you use sessions to prevent concurrency issues with session data

123981
clang	llvm
clang is an llvm native c c++ objective-c compiler which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools

124017
websphere	ibm
we would require some workflow application ibm websphere products

124049
jsf	wicket
it seems hip to hate jsf and i would like to look into something different like wicket

124049
tapestry	wicket	jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry
clearly jsf is a component based framework like tapestry but does wicket have an answer to rapid component-based web development like jsf+primefaces

124072
primefaces	richfaces
i m not aware of any components suite like richfaces or primefaces for wicket but long time wicket users say it is easy to create your own components

124085
free	malloc
the simple fact is that many if not most c++ users can hardly grasp that vector is better than malloc and free so the number who can not only appreciate but implement advanced template metaprogramming is not very high

124127
ant	maven
i have read about maven mainly and heard about ant

124131
ant	maven
the dependency management built into maven a feature that ant does not have can be used to effortlessly include all those 3rd party libraries and frameworks in your project

124131
ant	maven
learning maven is more about learning concepts whereas learning ant is more about learning individual commands

124132
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
other than the sortedset sortedlist sorteddictionary you shouldn t assume the data is in a particular order unless you handle that inside your own code.

124132
sortedlist	sorteddictionary	implements	extends
that s a linq-specific interface though and not implements by default by sortedset sortedlist sorteddictionary so it might not make sense to extends that particular interface...

124139
ant	maven
ant is more ancient than maven and does not handle as much

124139
ant	maven
ant with ivy will provide almost all the power of maven but will leave you much more control over your process

124139
ant	maven
it will allow you to execute arbitrary ant script while still have access to all the maven environment and conventions

124144
ant	maven
maven and ant have been very popular build project management tools but they are not going to be around forever

124144
ant	maven
gradle gives you the best of both ant maven worlds

124144
ant	maven
integration with both ant and maven

124144
ant	maven
it might still be a good idea for you to learn about ant and maven just because most places still use one of these two tools so you can use it as an experience builder

124186
getter	setter
an orm object relation mapper maps fields in the database table to the attributes of your model object providing getter and setter

124186
getter	setter
price is a field in the houses table which is automatically detected by activerecord which adds a getter and setter to the object

124191
goto	break
the ambiguity of this term is intended since a break in the middle of a loop is a bit unclean almost like a goto

124214
google-chrome	firefox
ui would be browser agnostic we do not have to worry about ensuring that our web pages work with ie 7 8 9++ google-chrome 8 9 18++ mozilla firefox currently a lot of development effort goes into this compatibility check and fixing

124242
backbone.js	javascriptmvc	sproutcore	javascriptmvc
i ve been looking into several of the javascriptmvc frameworks backbone.js spine sproutcore etc. and it seems to me that all of these are designed to act as single-page applications

124423
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
web layout is a set of css properties ex height width margin padding float display.. that are given to each container like element

124424
expression-blend	silverlight
and with wpf and silverlight they tried again to do web applications and gui applications the same way and used the same program expression-blend for both in the design proces

124425
post	get	post	put	put	get
you get a document or a list of documents in a folder you post changes to it you delete it if you don t need it and you put a new document in a folder

124439
boost	stl
i want the interface to be simple extensible and combining well with existing code like stl or boost

124461
versioning	upgrade
mysql was chosen over mssql as it seems to have fully sufficient functionality in free versioning and can be upgrade to enterprise versioning when it will make financial sense in terms of bandwidth overheads over licensing fees

124473
codeigniter	cakephp
if you are considering php and i really am not saying you should then you must consider symfony flow3 cakephp and codeigniter

124473
express	node.js
if you don t like static typing then you should add ruby rails sinatra node.js express and commonlisp weblocks

124482
put	get
however if a lot of people all have separate ideas that get put together into one application this is how it can become so complicated

124539
put	get
there is no easy way to get this you just have to put in the time

124548
mojolicious	catalyst
perl recently won a web app competition using catalyst although i prefer mojolicious and some of the new modern perl practices bring a lot of cleaner oo ideas to perl with things like moose

124551
observer-pattern	mvp
i went from looking at mvc to mvp to observer-pattern to the event pattern

124552
mockups	balsamiq
our team had used balsamiq mockups for this purpose and it works well

124581
put	get
so i created a class that extends jsonobject and override the put get methods in it and handled jsonexceptions inside this class

124583
put	get
i created a class that extends jsonobject and override the put get methods in it and handled jsonexceptions inside this class

124603
for-loop	arrays
however the for-loop shown does not support zero length arrays hence the special test nor will the subtraction of 1 work convincingly if the length of the arrays is equal to the number of integers

124603
int	chars
i say convincingly because it may be that 0 - 1 maxval this is true in c for unsigned int but are you sure it is true for unsigned chars without thinking carefully about integral promotions

124603
for-loop	loops
the actual implementation of the for-loop by my compiler does correctly handle 0 but this requires two tests to implement loops

124626
put	get
just like engineers can get out of doing the laundry by deliberately turning shirts pink when forced to try interviewers who feel put upon because they have to make up the billable hours when faced with unbillable work will do a bad job deliberately to avoid being reassigned that work

124671
for-loop	loops
at this step it s tempting to use a while loops but note that a c for-loop is not exactly equivalent to a while loops as breaks continues work differently wrt

124684
cvs	svn	cvs	rcs	bazaar	rcs	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn
some of code complete or pragmatic programmer are less relevant esp if you are programming in newer languages python ruby c++11 as its often focused on how to do something in c or gives recommended solutions using the best tools available at the time like cvs rcs for version control rather than a modern tool like git bazaar hg svn

124706
int	double	int	chars
many type names int chars double etc

124732
super	implements
it s not a very well known book but it goes from implements a super basic scripting language all the way to a custom designed compiled scripting language

124751
post	get
i m creating an application which will programmatically sent http get and post requests to a site and processing the data received

124779
ready	each
all agile methods i know emphasize that the software should be technically ready to ship at the end of each cycle iteration or even continuously

124821
white-box	assertions
fwiw i am referring to unit tests in the pure sense that they are white-box tests targeting a single class one assertions per test all dependencies mocked etc

124881
ironruby	ironpython
examples ironpython ironscheme ironruby etc

124884
agile	sprint
if agile is done right the sprint will be fully accepted by the end of the sprint meaning that it is ready for production release it doesn t necessarily mean that every sprint should be a release just that it should be production ready if the need arised for it

124885
ironruby	ironpython
there s an ironlanguages project that does ironpython ironruby etc. but it seems mostly to be concentrating on porting programming languages to the clr

124925
profiling	debugging
there are many language agnostic things every developer has to learn on his own implementing loosely coupled architectures debugging and profiling the code writing unit tests etc... that can be learnt in any language and perl is not the worst one to use

124934
pthreads	fork
i remember some basic stuff we did back in school with fork pthreads semaphores etc

124935
pthreads	fork
you still got pthreads on linux fork is still used in some cases

124996
entity-relationship	diagram
but from my industry experience i ve found that while we do use diagramsÃ¢ ranging from entity-relationship diagram class diagram state diagram to work flow diagramsÃ¢ all of it is for communication purposes

125017
entity-relationship	diagram
modeling in my opinion is vital for building databases entity-relationship diagram understanding process flows activity diagram and understanding user-system interactions use case diagram

125023
websphere	ibm
ibm s websphere commerce feature pack 2 features this type of configurable integration

125043
entity-relationship	diagram
the only potential exception to this i know of is entity-relationship diagram which don t encompass code per se only as their name implies pieces of data and their relationships

125043
getter	setter
but i have never heard of a successful attempt to use any kind of uml diagrams for real code generation update - more than class skeletons and trivial code like getter setter - except in special purpose tools areas like orm as testified by doc brown below update and i think this is no accident

125045
haskell	ocaml
this is true for example for functional languages you can find many haskell tutorials for ocaml or java users etc

125067
tortoisehg	hgsubversion
in tortoisehg windows mercurial client these are included so you just download the hgsubversion source include the path in the hgrc file and are ready to go

125077
agile	sprint
i feel it s sort of a sub agile process - the requirements of an agile process should be defined at the beginning of a sprint and reviewed towards its end

125082
agile	sprint
there are some agile models where requirements are meant to be fixed during a sprint and should only change for the next sprint a prominent example is scrum

125086
awt	swing
they probably don t care whether you write your project using awt or swing sometimes not even whether you use java or .net

125104
agile	sprint
in scrum at least which seems to be the agile process that s most popular with management types these days the scope of a sprint is fixed

125127
put	get
the context-switching required to go from release work to support work means that there is some overhead but since the work you bite off for a sprint should take into account how much work you historically get done in a sprint the typical amount of time you put into support and the context-switching overhead should automatically be accounted for

125163
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i m thinking of developing software for ubuntu and other related linux-based distros like linux mint

125172
getter	setter
an example is a value object who s every getter setter is required to be final to pass this check

125194
versioning	upgrade
when you roll-out a newer versioning of your application you just implement the necessary upgrade the the latest public versioning upgrade from previous minor versioning for example from 1.2 to 1.4 1.4 to 1.6 etc

125194
versioning	upgrade
you still first update the client db to the next major versioning using single scripts and then quickly upgrade from major versioning to major versioning using this cummulative update scripts

125198
kde	gnome
gnome kde

125217
unix	aix
runjva is the native command and qsh provides an aix emulator if you like a unix environment better

125342
vala	genie
well if your target audience is just linux and you are planning for desktop apps on gnome then i would recommend vala or genie

125432
organization	naming
there are far too many for me to just start naming randomly since many are focused in a particular industry or even within a particular organization

125432
agile	metrics
i m sure that you can find some case study somewhere where an agile project was 60 less efficient with regards to some performance metrics than a similar plan-driven project

125478
decltype	auto
furthermore while you should use auto whenever you re setting i to some intelligent value like vec.begin decltype works when you re setting to a constant like zero where auto would just resolve that to int because 0 is a simple integer literal

125537
getter	setter
how does one perform unit tests on an object that has setter or methods that modify the state of an object but that provide no outwardly public interface to read the state from such as property getter in c#

125537
accessor	properties
is the rule of thumb that the only properties getters get accessor should be ones that are also writable in the domain

125546
erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme	lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
popular ones include several lisp dialects common lisp clojure scheme the ml family ml f# haskell and erlang

125604
ubuntu	linux
i am thinking of making some applications for linux primarily ubuntu and i have an intention of selling some in the ubuntu software center and offering a few applications for free

125613
put	get
i have ran into this a few times where you get put on a project and you want to do unit testing of some type but the project isn t setup right to allow for this and you might not have buy-in from everyone

125622
emacs	kate	qt-creator	kdevelop	kate	kdevelop
i would make all changes in my ide qt-creator kate or kdevelop then i would open it up in emacs and select all and put in some command to auto-indent everything

125637
client-side	server-side
less runs on both the client-side ie 6+ webkit firefox and server-side with node.js

125652
equals	gethashcode
i would make sure that the equals and gethashcode methods of the objects you use as keys to the dictionary do not have any unexpected non-threading-friendly side-effects

125673
implements	extends
worse the android documentation implies that you ought to but gives no detailed explaination of why or what the pros cons are vs not extends and doing everything through implements your own glsurfaceview.renderer as i did

125687
vbscript	autoit
but almost every type of application and platform has its native scripting language or tools such as vbscript and powershell for windows bash scripts for linux selenium for web applications and autoit for gui applications etc.

125698
integer	fractions
in some locales there is a comma instead of a dot to separate the fractions part from the integer part in a number

125700
free	malloc
we ve gone through great lengths to make sure malloc free were not called unless they were absolutely necessary

125715
srp	principles
1 ideally i would like to see a strong and valid argument against goto s that still holds when you adhere to established programming principles for clean code like the srp

125720
imperative	declarative
the critical difference between the two approaches is that the one he considers to be the only correct way is imperative and yours is declarative

125723
goto	break
goto can be used instead of an if a switch for while break return and many many other features of the language that all serve different purposes

125773
pascal	delphi
choose the delphi framework and object pascal delphi or lazarus object pascal programming language

125795
codeigniter	yii
now my question is i heard of php frameworks like codeigniter zend frameworkd and yii

125803
codeblocks	anjuta
anjuta and codeblocks

125818
pop-up	dialog
if you need another windows in your application dialog warning pop-up windows etc you can create new stages

125839
free	malloc
you need to provide explicit irrefutable compilable proof that you are correct or reduce the problem to something trivially true something that must be safe like raii is by definition safer than something that can be safe malloc free

125872
hash	salt
when a user successfully logins with the remember me option checked i generate an auto-login token a sensibly unique random string most probably a salt hash

125887
free	malloc
on the high-level side d is garbage collected but the garbage collector is written in d and manual memory management can be done using c s malloc and free

125931
srp	principles
there are a ton of software design philosophies and patterns behind this but the single responsibility principles srp is probably a good default to always use

125938
gif	png
imagemagick to identify the image type and to convert gif files to png files

125941
libjpeg	libpng	imagemagick	libjpeg
for example imagemagick itself is already bundling several graphic libraries optionally even like libpng or libjpeg

125961
put	get
like all things though you get out of it what you put into it

126064
scheme	racket	haskell	scheme
as for languages i recommend mathematica racket a very friendly but still powerful scheme derivative python and haskell

126087
rss	feed
get the rss feed of those websites and make your

126088
jsf	seam
i am about to start with an application using jsf 2 seam 3 hibernate and hibernate search with the following characteristics

126098
haskell	ocaml
use it wisely only for things you cannot code in c or in some higher-level language like ocaml haskell common lisp scala

126098
x86	64bit
common ones are x86 a typical pc in 32 bits mode x86-64 a desktop pc in 64bit mode arm smartphones ... powerpc etc

126118
anjuta	kdevelop
my only attempt to use an ide on linux happened in 2005 but at that time no ide i tried kdevelop eclipse anjuta was any good so i went back to vim+ctags+gdb and still using it for linux coding

126127
rss	feed
usually this will be in the form of an rss feed or a web service

126186
put	get
you can try to get new grads who are desperate for a job willing to put up with less pay for the experience

126201
put	get
we then employed a junior developer and put both him and me being the primary developer on the courses to get us up to date with the technologies we needed to use

126234
hash	md5
could you not just generate a md5 hash for each binary tree object and compare them

126234
hash	md5
if the binary trees are the same the md5 hash should also be the same

126261
fortran	ada
compile-time fixed static typing is common eg c ada c++ fortran etc etc

126290
implements	extends
if you can foresee a possibility of needing to change from ef to some other approach you might want to extends your business objects taking advantage of the partial classes to implements interfaces defined in a separate business object layer

126304
pull	push
the workflow seems a bit simpler - we just have to remember that commit is local and push is like svn s commit and pull is like svn s update what the team refers to as get latest

126327
perforce	svn
if you replace svn with perforce in your op you ve pretty much got the situation i found myself in when i started my current job even down to the manual-change copying

126394
lisp	scheme
i have chosen a lisp-like syntax for melt so as in lisp or in scheme every operation is written with lots of insipid stupid parenthesis so the application of function f to arguments a and b is written f a b like it is in scheme or in lisp

126394
lisp	scheme
some young persons in particular jeremie salvucci and pierre vittet have been able to learn and code melt without prior exposure to melt to lisp dialects or scheme or even to compilation

126473
pop-up	dialog
then you provide implementations of the input service dependinh on whether you re on a console or want a dialog pop-up .

126535
int	chars
if the first chapter is full of chars int while loops that increment pointers and functions whose names start str don t buy that book

126545
public	protected
one thing worrying me in unit testing is that is often requires you to make public or at least internal fields that would have been private otherwise to un- readonly them make private methods protected virtual instead etc.

126569
superclass	subclassing
basically the down- and up-cast is the logical continuation of the subtype subclassing in oop and supertype superclass respectively the classical representation of the derived type to be located below the original type -- sub type

126573
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
personally i browse using firefox google-chrome opera mobile safari occasionally lynx and even a little ie sometimes

126577
public	protected
make public or at least internal fields that would have been private otherwise to un- readonly them make private methods protected virtual instead

126580
submit	submission
this proves the exact form that the user uses to submit the data therefore proving that you had not modified the form javascript since their submission therefore proving that you did not use javascript to steal their private key

126654
organization	naming
a lot of times careful variable naming meaningful use of white space and grouping and a meaningful logical organization of the code itself eliminates the need for the comment

126682
pull	push
people should not be told how many hours to commit and they certainly should push back if scrum master is attempting to pull something like this

126691
ada	pascal	scheme	prolog	haskell	scheme
i distinctly remember spending time in both high school and college learning languages like basic ada pascal prolog haskell scheme and turing

126694
pascal	delphi
as to the modern pascal equivalent if you re excluding delphi i would go with python

126697
implements	extends
for example why does java have multiple inheritance in terms of implements multiple interfaces rather than extends multiple abstract classes like c++

126700
post	get
it checks v s http post get requests ratio for each ip

126701
ada	pascal
of the academic languages you named i have seen half of them being used in the industry for commercial products ada pascal prolog haskell

126713
haskell	ocaml
be sure to learn how to bind code to several languages implementations ocaml c++ python haskell java lua ...

126714
haskell	ocaml
ocaml haskell scala clojure are perhaps academic languages but there are several companies using them extensively

126714
ocaml	scheme
so learning ocaml or scheme will change the way you think and code in c++ or java

126721
getter	setter
my coworkers tell me there should be as little logic as possible in getter and setter

126721
getter	setter
yet i am convinced that a lot of stuff can be hidden in getter and setter to shield users programmers from implementation details

126721
getter	setter
how much logic is appropriate in a setter getter

126721
getter	setter
what s the use of empty getter and setter except a violation of data hiding

126743
getter	setter
if you set a value with the setter and then read it with the getter the value should be the same

126747
srp	principles
i m nit picking here but your push method should probably split out the reading of data from a source into another method follow the single responsibility principles srp

126765
equals	gethashcode
implementing is a possibility for the equality test but my understanding is it is recommended to also override equals object obj and gethashcode when implementing iequatable so all equals methods have the same behavior

126765
equals	gethashcode
is this an edge case where overriding equals without overriding gethashcode should be done

126771
getter	setter
provide them by an object of a helper class which has the same 20 properties with getter and setter so this one won t be immutable

126771
equals	gethashcode
it may also be a good idea to implement equals and gethashcode by utilizing reflection looping over all public string properties of your class

126772
post	get
it s going to be an ajax call or an http get or post to a back-end component that does it

126777
equals	gethashcode
is this an edge case where overriding equals without overriding gethashcode should be done

126796
getter	setter
they tell me there should be as little logic as possible in getter and setter

126796
getter	setter
my personal preference is for as little as possible but when maintaining code you usually have to leave the original interface with the existing getter setter but put lots of logic in them to correct newer business logic as an example a customers getter in a post-911 environment has to meet know your customer and ofac regulations combined with a company policy prohibiting the appearance of customers from certain countries from appearing such as cuba or iran

126810
hide	show
i just need to add the class jbtn-borrar to a hyperlink and it show a dialog delete the record and hide the tr

i could simply fork n children directly from the parent

126921
lisp	scheme	lisp	smalltalk
if you are primarily going to be doing what i would consider computer science i would suggest learning something like python or smalltalk in order to try out real work and a functional programming language of your choice i would suggest some variant of lisp or scheme but choose what s easiest and coolest

126955
post	get
what if character is interpreted as a separator in an url assuming that for some reason the password is being sent through get instead of post

127076
activemq	rabbitmq
if that doesn t work you could implement your own version of paxos using for example one of the usual suspects in terms of messaging libraries the zero message queue library rabbitmq or activemq

127106
vb.net	vb6
even though the company standard is asp.net vb.net most of what the company does as a whole is to purchase third party software which is usually java based and very and i do mean very few people in the company even know vb6 let alone asp.net vb.net

127126
put	get
a practical example i give folks is to put them in a significantly complex project than what they have hoped to get one on it and let them fight their own battle

127189
queue	fifo
if you really really think priorities are important you use a priority queue instead of a fifo queue and you manually assign simple priorities

127201
implements	extends
to extends it you create a dll containing classes that implements interfaces like isearchscreengridcolumn and that becomes a module

127206
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
where i used to work we wanted to play with gpu s to add subtract multiplying 2 matrixes to work out genetic corrleation

127510
vb6	vba
we decided to gradually move our application towards .net because we can stick to visual basic .net even though it is a new language for most of the developers here we have deep knowledge of vba and several dozen small projects implemented in vb6

127514
decimal	ieee
the size of a float is platform-dependent although a maximum of 1.8e308 with a precision of roughly 14 decimal digits is a common value the 64 bit ieee format

127514
rational-numbers	base
additionally rational-numbers that are exactly representable as floating point numbers in base 10 like 0.1 or 0.7 do not have an exact representation as floating point numbers in base 2 which is used internally no matter the size of the mantissa

127523
decimal	ieee
the size of a float is platform-dependent although a maximum of 1.8e308 with a precision of roughly 14 decimal digits is a common value the 64 bit ieee format .

jobs	cron
as for executing the script every x minutes read up on cron jobs

127579
int	boolean
fyi i am currently coding mostly procedural functions that take 10 boolean and a few int and give me an int result based on this i feel like the only unit testing i could do would be to simply re-code the algorithm in the test

127583
int	boolean
i am currently coding mostly procedural functions that take 10 boolean and a few int and give me an int result based on this

127588
google-chrome	firefox
it s basically just a numbers game so users don t think firefox is somehow less good than google-chrome simply because google-chrome is version 16 and firefox is version 3.6

127592
int	boolean
i am currently coding mostly procedural functions that take 10 boolean and a few int and give me an int result based on this i feel like the only unit testing i could do would be to simply re-code the algorithm in the test

my first idea is to create an abstract class number with abstract methods add number n1 number n2 multiplying number n1 number n2 subtract number n1 number n2 divide number n1 number n2 and so on

127618
multiplying	transpose
multiplying a vector transpose and a vector returns a double.

127627
eiffel	smalltalk
if you re programming in a purely object-oriented language such as eiffel smalltalk or ruby then you re probably going to be forced to learn object-oriented programming from the get-go as it s effectively the cornerstone of the language also note that these languages often have support for other types of programming such as functional etc.

127674
lisp	scheme
scheme is a dialect of lisp and probably one of the languages most programmers think of when they discuss functional programming

127743
onresume	onpause
any activity lifecycle callbacks oncreate onpause onresume

127753
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
i m porting a gui application i had written to have a web interface which is all grand and nice any all but things like spine sproutcore javascriptmvc would have you define your models and views and implement specific controllers

127757
daemons	systemd
unlike other queueing systemd zeromq is not a daemons

127763
subtract	add
i learned a bit of basic by writing simple programs to add subtract and to print

127787
ada	pascal
another example of similar but different use of a character is that of semicolon as a statement delimiter c c++ java ada ... and as a statement separator pascal

127818
daemons	systemd
there is quartz for java quartz.net and of course the cron daemons on any unix based systemd

127822
cpu	processors
processors that followed this line of thought are called risc processors reduced instruction set cpu to contrast with the cisc complex instruction set cpu

127908
division	multiplication
does it support natively all c operations most notably multiplication and division and for what types

127940
hindi	french
it s actually about as useful as learning a little bit of french spanish english arabic hindi and chinese while never knowing any one of them well

127964
put	get
however if the information is based on session at all and you re using some sort of built-in authentication you can put an enablesession attribute on the webmethod decorator and that will allow you to get at httpcontext.current.user session etc

127975
min	max
i have a class that is meant to generate a random password of a length that s also random but limited to be between a defined min and max length

127975
min	max
if i fix the min and max length to the same value then i can easily check that the generated password is of the expected length

128024
debian	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian
debs for ubuntu debian rpm s for redhat centos

128183
put	get
if you do manage to get an rfp put out i would wager that the bids you get indicate that what you are trying to do is far more complicated than your managers realize

128261
put	get
or to put it another way if the sequence of definitions in your classes is really the biggest problem you have to solve then congratulations you have a great code-base and you should just get on and develop business functionality rather than worrying about these kinds of details which as you point out yourself your ide worries about for you

128335
accessor	properties
however that also generally only applies to simple types complex data types list i find harder to properly encapsulate in a properties and generally use other methods for interacting with them as opposed to a strict mutator and accessor

128398
restrict	shared	pull	push
all cloned repositories can shared code with each other through synching with pull and push commands that can be access restrict

128398
pull	push
all users can pull fetch content but have no access to push it

128447
memset	calloc
this implies among other things that memset or calloc which can set a region of memory to all-bits-zero will not necessarily set any pointers in that region to null pointers

128477
subtract	add
i have my own little teaching instruction set i made from scratch that has some of the details of say how an add and subtract work from basic gates and things like that

128477
hex	binary
may start way to elementary but walks you slowly from nothing to do with computers and electronics into binary hex and into the basic gates etc

128477
verilog	vhdl
hardware designers use programming languages vhdl verilog as well and go through the same process the programming is only slightly different to software the primary difference is that different lines modules of hardware programs execute simultaneously where software executes linearly

128505
squeak	visualworks
having worked with smalltalk myself for two years i can tell you i haven t seen any python ide available that will give you the level of expressiveness you are looking for in smalltalk ides such as visualworks or squeak

128532
filesystems	fat
in a fat filesystems the metadata of a large file is organized as a linked list of fat entries

for macos this means using a system like homebrew or macports to install software so you can run the same command on each box

128585
cpu	affinity
when i set affinity to the process to one cpu in this case 1 4 cpu s 2 cores with 2 threads each the gui uses 100 of that dedicated cpu for about 2 min

128590
rspec	capybara
my current company has no testers -- everything is an automated test junit rspec selenium or capybara

128615
cpu	processors
depending upon what you are doing maxing out the cpu is not the best way go and thus the numbers you are getting back now might actually mean that things are running faster than they were before even though the processors is not maxed out

128616
feedback	review
as for tracking the feedback of the review yes it should be tracked

128674
apache	nginx
which are two methods to simulate sockets over http they are way more efficient than polling and technically could scale to the 10k if you use a light weight server such as nginx which is alot better at handling concurent connections than apache

128674
apache	nginx
as for the server with more than 100 connections you could get a amazon ec2 micro server instance for something like 19 month that lets you run nginx and could scale a lot better than apache

128677
getter	setter
you could also have some setter getter on timesheetday timeslot

128689
rbac	acl
does there exist a good overview of the access control domain including terminology discussion of the tradeoffs of different schemes rbac acl

128692

128701
sorting	filtering
there are quite a few sorting and filtering options as well including faceting

128756
versioning	upgrade
it is easy to upgrade just push a new versioning to the server

128776
inherited	properties
if i were then going to attach additional methods or properties to the class i would use prototypal inherited example with jquery s .extend method but it s easy enough to roll your own extend

128827
versioning	upgrade
according to this article from the bbc and this post on microsoft s exploring ie blog microsoft has planned to automatically upgrade windows xp windows vista and windows 7 s ie to the latest versioning

128837
codeigniter	fuelphp
i tried fuelphp which has an built-in active record style orm and php activerecord to use with codeigniter

128856
getter	setter
to make the question clear do web designers have to get a grasp on a very basic level of how a java class works fields setter getter args constructors...

128899
datamapper	activerecord
orm s generally follow the activerecord pattern because datamapper is a bit tricky

128910
cvs	svn
still a lot of people using svn and even cvs though

128970
post	get
however when the controller that handles the functionality of retrieving the post to generate the display view it likely depending on how the data has been stored will need to also access the user model to get names and other such information depending on what the view needs

128970
codeigniter	fuelphp	codeigniter	cakephp	cakephp	fuelphp
however i would suggest that you download a few of the available frameworks such as codeigniter cakephp fuelphp zend or others as found here

128983
agile	sprint
as you were learning the basics of a language and working through books that i hope have example projects to do some questions like how might i approach a problem like x when working in a agile environment or how many of these tasks could i do in 2-week sprint

129034
stateless	stateful
the right answer is a system which supports both inductive functional and coinductive procedural programming so the right tools can handle both stateless and stateful programming

129152
redmine	trac
i can get close with trac or redmine with their repository browsers but unfortunately they do not have any repository management capabilities

129321
feedback	review
to do this of course is sin since it removes all possibility of review or feedback from previous iterations into the next

129325
children	parent
the data structure of every treenode is a list of children list of parent

129325
children	parent
the type of children and parent are treenodes

129423
put	get
given virtually no resources probably the best you can do is get a file cabinet and ask everyone to make a copy of what they already have and put the copy in the file cabinet

129514
hash	salt
the upside is that there wouldn t be any in-memory cache or hash table anymore and that session would be cluster-independent if the salt is the same for all clusters

129533
free	malloc
remember when people think of non-gc they think malloc and free

129533
free	malloc
this is obviously a rather unfair comparison- the garbage collectors that were in use when malloc and free were designed were much too slow to run any meaningful program if i remember correctly

129547
put	get
i simply answered that i don t know since i haven t been put in a very high pressure situation yet and they were happy with my answer i did get the job and their interview process was not without rigour

129594
super	abstract
instead of generalizing by keeping most common parameters specific to an abstract virtual function the code does super generalization by passing parameters as arbitrary list of name-value-pairs

129594
serializable	deserialization
not only that it adds overhead of adding serializable deserialization process -but more importantly the semantics are lost

129594
put	get
now the callee function can put in arbitrary parameters and the whole thing begins to get misused way beyond context

129622
queue	fifo
a queue fifo

129691
mockito	easymock
to achieve that you may use for example a mocking framework such as easymock or mockito to cut the dependency to the database

129691
junit	testng
you can write your integration tests with the same basic framework as your integration tests junit or testng to name the most popular

129752
udp	tcp
it greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as tcp and udp socket server

129757
public	protected
working in c# quite a bit and abiding by stylecop s default rules i personally find it nice to have consistency in my code to have all fields constructors properties and methods grouped together and within each group it s sorted by scope public protected protected internal private

129758
google-chrome	firefox
even minifying is pointless as modern browsers like firefox and google-chrome will neatly format it for them

129761
put	get
even at an early stage if a product isn t ready to test just put together a presentation on the product and submit to testers and get feedback on what they are thinking and how they feel

129789

csla for .net serializes a copy of the object that you wish to save undo-history on and stores it in a stack of undo s.

129803
fizzbuzz	sieve
make it something really simple like fizzbuzz or the sieve of eratosthenes

129859
wxpython	pyqt
on the desktop side of things it doesn t seem like very many companies use the popular gui libraries like pyqt or wxpython

perl	tcl
i ve built a very long career almost entirely with dynamic languages like python perl ruby and tcl and have loved every minute of it

129885
x86	mips
c c++ java assembly language x86 arm mips python perl.

129886
verilog	vhdl	hex	binary
it is quite likely that the hardware engineer probably programming in verilog or vhdl writes the first few test programs by hand in machine code probably in hex or binary

129900
lisp	scheme
the lisp scheme family have let letrec and

129907
ats	mercury
you should probably take a look at ats and mercury

129910
children	parent
the entire repository is a tree of changesets each one depending on a parent where a parent changeset can have any number of children and the tree root represent an empty directory

129910
pull	push
you can have six clones of the same repository and merge or rather push or pull

129912
perforce	svn
i have some experience with perforce svn and tfs

129919
perforce	cvs
tfs has evolved from vss and i believe perforce used cvs as a starting point

130001
equals	gethashcode
all you need to do is to have a generic class triple a b c override equals and gethashcode so that it will have value semantics two instances are to be considered equals if they have equals elements and declare the concurrenthashmap is from triple to integer

130002
ant	maven
ant maven and scons all provide ways of doing this in code

130002
ant	maven
read up on ant maven and scons for approaches that work nicely

130027
maya	blender
see maya blender various games

130071
range	minimum
you ll see it can support optional dependencies and a minimum maximum version range

130099
public	protected
internal public protected private

130099
pop-up	dialog
to add to this i create an expansion macro that will pop-up a dialog asking for name params and retval -- then it creates the stub according to the section you are in

130107
put	get
i was attracted to python by its layout - the block structure is what you see is what you get - and don t understand why there are people who are put off by this

130113
redmine	chiliproject
chiliproject is a fork of redmine that uses updated versions of ruby rails

130113
redmine	chiliproject
there are also redmine chiliproject plugins that provide facilities like code review syntax highlighting and other niceties that github etc

130113
redmine	chiliproject
there are other options jira etc. but they imho don t provide the felxibility or wealth of functionality that the chiliproject fork of redmine + the multitude of available plugins provide

130122
vim	sublimetext
vim and sublimetext support syntax highlighting and allow you to run command line or build scripts through the editor

130126
submit	submission
basically my fear is that if someone is editing the same image and set of actions at the same time and they both submit changes or if it was edited by someone else then there s a whole series of structures that potentially will fail on submission

130132
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are supported

130167
int	chars
yes absolutely on an 8 bit machine returning unsigned chars instead of unsigned int or shorts is one way to improve performance and size

130167
unsigned	short	int	chars
you could of course just use unsigned without int or short or chars and let the compiler pick the optimal size

130188
fossil	git
bug tracking and wiki - in addition to doing distributed version control like git and mercurial fossil also supports distributed bug tracking distributed wiki and a distributed blog mechanism all in a single integrated package

130195
codeigniter	yii
when i was using php i found that codeigniter and yii were both fairly strong

130197
symfony	silex
i d suggest learning from a micro framework like silex to begin with - this is placed somewhere between the middle of straight php and full blown frameworks like symfony and you ll be introduced to the mvc paradigm as well as great other constructs such as the use of orms and lambda functions

130208
np-hard	np-complete
is there a general method to evaluate the optimality of an optimization algorithm for example an algorithm solving an otherwise np-hard or np-complete problem

130243
nullpointerexception	classnotfoundexception
exception subclasses consist of objects that extend exception ie nullpointerexception classnotfoundexception outofrangeexception

130245
public	protected
a derived class will have the public protected members of the base class

130268
unix	bsd
the best known would be the classic bsd unix syslogd which declares its willingness to accept incoming pushed packets and processes them

130274
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie and google-chrome all implement xslt processors

130293
int	double
an int is an number so anywhere you can use a number you can use an int or any of the other subclasses of number long float double short bigdecimal atomicinteger etc

130350
unix	bsd
this is basically how unix became dominant when produced by at t unix s license and the market was in such a state that it was basically like open source for the time which is why for instance bsd unix evolved out of said code base because they did not want to be in the os business

130430
fossil	git
apart from git mercurial etc suggested above also have a look at fossil - it has the advantages that the run time binaries are small 1meg or so for windows and linux portable and zero installation needed

130474
implements	extends
some extension points are provided so that third parties can extends specific behaviors by implements a subset of the published interfaces and registering them with the os

130474
decoder	encoder
implement its own proprietary interface on both the encoder and decoder in order to detect and bypassing operations that cancel out each other

130497
partialfunction	first-class-functions
if for example your language has first-class-functions partialfunction application polymorphic data types type variables and generic types you have pretty much covered the same bases as you would have with classic oop inheritance but using a different paradigm

130522
phpword	phpexcel
it only works with microsoft s openxml format and it s of a similar lineage as phpexcel and phpword

130536
client-side	server-side
you can build and deploy hosted apps exactly as you would build and deploy any web app using any server-side or client-side technologies you like

130579
google-chrome	firefox
on the same token using browser app doesn t really work well as browsers themselves can now host apps as extensions such as the google-chrome version of angry birds or the firebug firefox extension for example

130607
pull	push
changes to the master should be minimized because that s what the other devs are going to pull before they merge rebase push their new changes

130607
pull	push
it s linked to a remote server so you can push pull changes except it can point to a completely different repository

130626
mxmlc	compc
it installs the flexsdk as part of its installation routine and uses the compilers mxmlc and compc contained therein

130669
serializable	deserialization
think of http date manipulation xml parsing templating json serializable and deserialization oauth math libraries and so on

130764
email	dkim
with dkim you sign every email

130814
feedback	review
a constructive feedback from my experience is that during the initial years of your development it would be very important although not mandatory that an experienced developer review your code to lay the foundation

130836
listview	gridview
adapter classes if i am using listview gridview that need baseadapter etc

130855
junit	testng
make a testing classes junit or better testng for filling ui and data entities with test data and launching them

130925
getter	setter
getter and setter unless they actually have some logic in them

130926
getter	setter
to me trivial getter setter and one-liners like yours above usually aren t worth it

130926
getter	setter
and when you are struggling to get overall code coverage up from 0 or just managed to bump it over 25 unit testing getter and setter is the least of your worries

130957
button	checkbox
then check or uncheck run code whether to execute your program and private whether not to list your code in the recent codes page checkbox click the submit button and watch your snippet being executed.

130985
verilog	vhdl
i have written a lot of software in many different languages and i ve also written hardware for use with fpgas using verilog and vhdl

131003
versioning	upgrade
this way if someone is using say versioning 1.5.3 they could tell at a glance that they could upgrade to 1.5.4 to get the patches that 1.6.0 would add functionality and that they shouldn t upgrade to 2.0.0 at least without handling the change

131086
cvs	svn
we ve just moved to svn from cvs

131105
disk	ram
if build or deployment times are excessive then consider optomizing away some of these problems with physical or software ram disk faster internet connections parallellizing builds etc

131107
multiplying	add
so if i add or multiplying i can have a variable checker function that see that the sixth digit from the right of array 0 is the same place as the first digit from the right of array 1

131108
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
after that you need to implement all the functions to add subtract multiplying divide exponentiate and so on

131110
gif	png
so if you want that tracking - start an image hosting attack the resource under research with picture postings links and or 1x1 hidden transparent gif png images hotlinked with unique uri and voila you have that visitor map

131120
verilog	vhdl
furthermore if you are developing with verilog vhdl then you are sticking with binary logic

131170
width	margin
make whatever god awful hack you have to and if possible paramatize the change if it is something commonly tweaked like margin width or title so it will be a little more straight forward to update the next time

131221
cos	sin
take c and rename printf to p sin to s cos to c

131227
organization	naming
to clarify i was wondering if there was an organization that would dictate proper naming convention for variables and functions for example

131237
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
what would be the most cross browser friendly ie9 google-chrome firefox safari opera way to code an animated interactive double-helix

131354
implements	extends
a implements b c is not same as a extends b c

131360
implements	extends
so we use an interface instead of an abstract class in order to give descendants the freedom to extends whatever base class they wish and implements our interface rather than forcing them to extends a specific base class

131375
googletest	gmock
i ended up using googletest due to gmock since i wanted a mocking framework as well

131396
hide	show
you make a div and give it a class name and when an event triggers then you would use the javascript to show that div and have a link on the div that would trigger javascript to hide the div

131455
serializable	deserialization
each call required serializable and deserialization of a relatively small amount of data

131505

awt	swing
if your programming language doesn t have first class support on delegates and events see in java how it solves with event handling in awt and swing then you ll be implementing it using this pattern instead

131553
hide	show
the biggest and by far the most honest reason why they don t like it is because it s very hard to hide in a bad work ethic more blatantly it show up lazy people

131588
ironruby	ironpython
microsoft s visual studio is an ide that is used by many programmers and it supports ironruby ironpython and f#

131635
post	put
the reason we went with this approach is because of the potential server load with long-polling or frequent post backs every 2 seconds and the burdon it would put on our server we have a few databases and webservers so maintaining a changelog is out of the question at the time we hadnt looked into node.js socket.io which brings me to my question

131655
int	chars
the compiler will use jvm primitives for int chars etc

131691
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
for data bound controls repeater listview gridview etc. what s the preferred way of binding data

131736
post	get
functions for data access and rendering that data the page getting setting to and from session and get post data etc

131738
ready	each
once the web pages are ready run the same set of acceptance tests on each and compare bug density

131805
maple	maxima
i ve recently started using wxmaxima a nice graphical front-end to the excellent open source maxima computer algebra system aka a cas like the commercial maple or mathematica systems

131941
put	get
by breaking the project down into a series of mini projects you get more control as you can put something in front of the client early you re not locked into a long development schedule that becomes out of date when the client changes their mind as they will

131944
put	get
if you could tell people i can not do it in this release but will be happy to put it on schedule for the next one it s much better than saying them you re too late your change can t go in goodbye and would make them your friend - they d be happy for you to release in time so you could be free sooner to get to the next release which will have their change - and not your enemy

131971
srp	principles
in object-oriented programming the single responsibility principles srp states that every object should have a single responsibility and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class

132002
post	get
probability they are accessed via post or get and will show up in

132011
cos	sin
change to radians 0 to 2 pi if your language cos sin takes angles in radians like c c+ does

132018
udp	tcp
and since it seems they are using some custom protocol over udp a custom protocol over say tcp could achieve the same effect too

132052
getter	setter
it can involve a lot of redundant setter or constructions and getter

132117
children	parent
each node can have exactly one parent but any number of children

132138
srp	principles
helper classes do not violate srp if coded in accordance with that principles

132205
min	max
but for selecting the min or max values

132221
screens	tablet
before the tablet support in android 3.0 you didn t have to think about the large screens

132290
dwoo	smarty
finally you should look into a templating framework like smarty dwoo or twigg

132290
dwoo	smarty
dwoo inherits from smarty and adds a thing or two to support oop better on php 5

132302
boost	stl
this is the same category of people who refuse to use the boost library or any of stl and continue to use malloc for just about everything

132306
codeigniter	kohana
kohana started out as a fork of codeigniter and that was reason enough for me not to use it initially

132306
nginx	lighttpd
nginx and lighttpd are apparently better choices performance wise but i haven t used them a lot and i can t really say

132313
cdr	cons
why are they still called cons nodes and worse still use car and cdr as accessors

132322
hash	salt
data that is hash salt is theoretically secure even from the people who have full access to view it

132401
getter	setter
i too was confused about objects that are used like structs with getter setter

132421
directx	gdi
first gdi objects were bypassed with wpf by using directx

132443
min	max
there are a few things i am confused about and i think the best way to clear up my confusions would be for someone could guide me through one question how many numbers are there in a floating point number system given the base precision max exponent and min exponent

132516
versioning	upgrade
seems like you ve been able to identify which versioning meet your standards and which ones don t so i wouldn t upgrade until you are confident with the latest and greatest

132542
bots	chatterbot
a chatter robot chatterbot chatbot or chat bots is a computer program designed to simulate an intelligent conversation with one or more human users via auditory or textual methods

132549
width	height
this way everything can be pre calibrated and your app could by only counting the pixels in height and width tell you the 2d measurements of the object under inspection

132594
inherited	properties
plus classes means when an object is instantiated you already know its inherited chain and all the properties it has - in js i can modify a prototype 15 steps up the chain and those changes will appear on existing objects

132644
lisp	smalltalk
can be done in smalltalk and in lisp

132699
getter	setter
in .net at least reflection is used very effectively here to automatically call getter and setter depending on the string that was passed to the subscriber

132703
typedef	struct
it s pretty hard to parse c or c++ in the face of typedef and macros and so forth so unless you can scrounge up a struct parser or maybe a system to read struct defs and write code to translate you ll end up doing it by hand

132724
udp	tcp
udp based file transfer solutions are becoming very popular because of the opportunity to develop all of the transport functionality from scratch thereby avoiding a lot of the problems inherent in tcp

132799
agile	sprint
if you adhere to bdd tdd allow your requirements to change with the wind and can adjust your feature priorities accordingly if you build your entire system and run all of the tests often and if you deliver working code at the end of each sprint you are already agile

132829
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
also inherited is not to be abused as changes to the superclass trickle down to subclassing

132847
ant	maven
think of an ant task or a maven task that does the real work after ant or maven has handled all of the parsing and decision-making

132847
ant	maven
for guidance on how these tidy classes should work read ant or maven to see how they define the various worker tasks

132877
post	get
in php the main ways this situation occurs is if one is having php automatically create global variables from the get post variables register_globals or one is doing too much in the global scope rather than inside functions and methods

132887
mouse	keyboard
while refactoring i would let him have control of mouse and keyboard as it was more fun for him tis way see also my last bullet point and i was free to write down what i was learning

132926
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse events are handled with huge if else blocks none of it is commented the only comments are the sections of code that have been commented out and all of the drawing and animation code is just in one huge chunk

132945
phpstorm	rubymine	phpstorm	webstorm
i was going to get webstorm as i do have a lot of pure html5 js based frameworks apps that i am working on however i then read that webstorm phpstorm rubymine etc are all based on their idea framework and made out like each framework contained the functionality of webstorm anyway other than a few features which were not there out of the box but could be added through plugins

133024
getter	setter
whereas such a simple property as in your example has completely no use over just a simple public member variable properties usually do or should do additional things inside their getter and setter

133033
accessor	properties
in case 2 3 always go to the properties accessor not the field variable

133039
accessor	properties
the main situation i can think of when you should use the backing field and not the properties accessor is when the accessor has additional logic validation or updating other state information in the class which you don t want to run

133039
accessor	properties
when initializing a new copy of that object given data from the db the properties accessor which each recalculate the third value may complain if the other needed value is not set

133047
min	max
i created a set of sandbox tests that contain candidate algorithms for the constraining process the process by which a byte array that could be any long becomes a long between a min and max

133047
for-loop	arrays
i then run that code through a for-loop that gives the algorithm several known byte arrays values from 1 to 10 000 000 just to start and has the algorithm constrain each to a value between 1009 and 7919 i m using prime numbers to ensure an algorithm wouldn t pass by some serendipitous gcf between the input and output ranges

133047
division	modulo
the only one that passed this test was to constrain by modulo division which also turned out to be the fastest of the three

133093
sorting	grouping
in addition this generates a class name that allows easy grouping and sorting in the test runner

133134
mvp	presenter
how to separate view and presenter in android while the reactions on the user actions presenter part of mvp are set into the same activities that shows gui elements view part of mvp

133148
children	parent
a child has a reference to its parent however a parent cannot see its children explicitly

133148
children	parent
i thought that i should compare the highest order parent to do2 in this case and that works until there are do children under do3

133148
children	parent
perhaps the comparator needs to be initialized with the unordered list first so that it can build a tree structure where i can see a list of children from any given parent explicitly

133210
prng	random
validate or take as a given that the source prng is sufficiently random using standard statistical measures

133223
versioning	upgrade
old versioning of this portlet named kittens-portlet for example would be considered as different and probably missing portlets in a upgrade portal

133277
client-side	server-side
now while considering this i thought that overcoming webapps limitations basic widgets sessions text http-based forms distinct client-side server-side languages in most cases with a limited communication mechanism etc. were a big timewaster and that maybe traditional gui development was a better option

133278
mouse	keyboard
everything else is triggered by events from the mouse keyboard or timer passed directly to the current state without knowledge of which state the game is currently in

133279
getter	setter
getter setter behavior is also in keeping with providing encapsulation for all of your internal variables

133279
getter	setter
languages such as delphi and now c# with it s automatic properties tend to blur the lines and make properties seem as if they act like mere variables yet the reality is that for each property there is a getter and setter method underneath the hood for each property

133354
bots	chatterbot
if you ask a chatterbot to remember the number 490 talk for a while and then ask the bots what the number was most bots will have no clue what you are talking about

133385
integer	unsigned
0u - unsigned integer

133409
entity-relationship	diagram
other kinds of design documents such as class diagram interaction diagram state charts entity-relationship diagram etc

133471
moq	moles
should you consider a more heavyweight mocking framework that allows mocking of concrete collaborators moles versus moq in the c# world

133483
inherited	properties
i use a lot of inherited test doubles to expose inner properties and behaviors for my tests

133485
versioning	upgrade
a branch for each company makes sense in the short term but i could see how this could cause issues with upgrade when a new versioning is developed

133497
srp	ocp
while i agree with other s comments when they said there s no hard rule about right loc number i bet if we look back at the projects we ve looked at in the past and identify every function above let s say 150 lines of code i m guessing we would come to a consensus that 9 out of 10 of those functions break srp and very likely ocp as well have too many local variables too much control flow and are generally hard to read and maintain

133497
srp	ocp
what i generally settled on is to tell the team that while there s no absolute limit any function more 50 lines of code should at a minimum raise a red flag during code review so that we take a second look at it and re-evaluate it for complexity and srp ocp violations

133515
profiler	yourkit
for example yourkit profiler demos page currently lists the following most popular analyses

133556
lisp	scheme
i would advise you to look into scheme rather than lisp

133556
lisp	scheme
scheme is a modified version of lisp with further enhancements

133582
wordpress	joomla
wordpress joomla drupal et.al.

133609
pascal	delphi
your first example is pascal code so unless you don t consider delphi a modern programming language that should answer the first part of your question

133641
accessor	properties
if all those variables are properties of the base class and children uniformly depend on them then declaring them in the base is appropriate and adding abstract get setters accessor would be the way to allow children to massage the data as they see fit

133647
public	protected
class with public accessors and protected mutators

133648
google-chrome	firefox
ohloh generates a set of incredible reports for your project to get a quick idea check out this firefox vs google-chrome comparison

133690
typename	auto
just like with auto we can avoid having extra typename

133733
put	get
i am working on application which goes and get s market data from different sources i am using polling mechanism where vendor broker put his data file and my application would go and hit that ftp location multiple times during the day to get data

133764
mvp	presenter
for client applications it s often best to adapt a pattern like mvp or mvvm and use data-binding from the form to the underlying viewmodel or presenter

133841
vim	emacs
personally i would just use vim or emacs gdb and use these tools on all environments or learn to love code blocks

133904
websphere	ibm
by the way i am a java programmer maven specialist build specialist and have experience with liferay and other portal servers ibm websphere and glassfish

133912
agile	sprint
customers are growing used to this agile way of thinking which returns results to them much faster than it did in the old days with highly iterative development sprint and fast turnaround between requests and implementation so they have come to expect a great deal of us

133948
getter	setter
the point with getter setter vs

133948
getter	setter
getter and setter should apply to properties not internal variables thus allowing calibration or conversion functions to be included

133949
getter	setter
exposing members whether as public fields or through simple getter and setter goes against the original ideas of oo

133949
getter	setter
so if you wish to do puristic oo every time you want to create a setter or getter you should ask your self questions about your design seeing that the need for getter and setter when not talking about values as oppossed to objects is a smell that you are not modelling what the system does behaviour but what it is data

133951
saas	iaas
the reality is that there is no one standard to connect to cloud providers whether that be at the paas saas or iaas levels

133958
getter	setter
getter and a setter

133962
getter	setter
bringing this back to oop and in particular java one of the main reasons for getter and setter is imo and i may be wrong a case of good semantic practice you obj.getstate and obj.setstate as opposed to obj.state and in both cases i would argue the process of doing so is imperative

133962
getter	setter
by using getter and setter you have provided a way for sub-classes to override access to your variables maybe add that bit of validation you never bothered with

133962
getter	setter
as for it being tedious regarding writing getter and setter this is really null and void as i think most ide s will do much of this for you and as i have just found lombok which looks pretty cool and reminds me of property etc in objective-c

133989
imperative	declarative
functional languages in general emphasize declarative style over imperative to minimize side effects

134008
apache	nginx
it s universally understood by apache nginx as the default for php files and most setups expect php files to end in this extension

134081
int	chars
the primary key of each table was int but managed as it was string chars of a fixed type with int up to 9999 9999 9999 9999

134115
implements	extends
when you implements an interface or extends a class you are generally declaring your intention to create a subtype

134115
inherited	subclassing
that definition is intentionally vague since inherited can happen in many situations but the most common is subclassing an object which has the effect of replacing the this pointer called by virtual functions with the this pointer to the subtype

134136
cpu	processors
in particular those three expressions assuming the i variable resides in the memory address stored in a cpu register let s name it d - think of it as a pointer to int and the alu of the processors takes a parameter and return a result in an accumulator let s call it a - think to it as an int

134136
implements	modifiers
binary operations are typically implements as modifiers of an accumulator register with an input taken somewhere where somewhere can be

134150
inherited	subclassing
the inherited approach would use a few polymorphic methods update_controls update_physics draw etc. and implement them for each subclassing

134238
opensuse	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	opensuse
my recommended distributions are ubuntu centos and opensuse

134238
vmware	virtualbox
but to solve the problem in your questions i think you can utilize the virtual machine tools vmware server virtualbox etc especially the features like snapshot or clone

134252
children	parent
if you re wondering i have children state machines within parent state machines because my exact project is quite complex and it is natural to encapsulate the internal workings of a child state

134284
puts	gets
on the other hand i got a bit wound up there and feel a need to provide some balance it is nice when using simple collections and maps to have adds puts and gets checked when written and it usually does not add much complexity to the code if someone else writes the collection or map

134333
disk	ram
thus everything that is on virtual memory is collectively on ram real memory and hard disk swap files

134400
versioning	upgrade
the biggest risk i talk about is versioning upgrade to vendor software when a company adopts this data management philosophy

134419
put	get
if you do not get a copy of the agreement then make your reservations very clear as to how the change could put the company in a bad position as regards the relationship with the vendor

134434
vb.net	vb6
before abap i worked as a freelancer in other projects with vb6 vb.net c# and asp.net building a lot of stuff here i ve made some utilities that are been using daily so i came with long experience in programming

134443
observer-pattern	mediator
in the original book that coined the terms observer and mediator design patterns elements of reusable object-oriented software it says that the mediator pattern can be implemented by using observer-pattern

134443
observer-pattern	mediator
however it can also be implemented by having colleagues roughly equivalent to the subjects of observer-pattern have a reference to either a mediator class or a mediator interface

134443
observer-pattern	mediator
or if it is implemented using observer-pattern the button would say hey observers which would include the mediator my state changed someone clicked me

134450
min	max
in .net for instance things like min and max are provided as static members on the system.math class

134455
facade	mediator
in order to understand mediator i find it easier when you consider facade first facade aggregates the functionality of separate classes entire subsystems sometimes and provides that functionality in a single interface

134455
facade	mediator
mediator same as facade except that it combines the functionality of all of the aggregate classes to produce new functionality

134457
peg	lexical
it makes sense to either do a lexical analysis with regular expressions or skip this pass at all and do a much more flexible and powerful lexerless parsing with peg or glr

134492
hide	show
2 - tabs as suggested by rachel this show only part of the information and hide the rest

134505
versioning	upgrade
to deal with the constantly changing schema i came up with a solution that embeds a versioning number into the xml namespace and i apply a series of xsl stylesheets to upgrade any given blob to the latest versioning

134513
erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme	lisp	scheme	lisp	prolog	lisp	smalltalk	scheme	prolog
languages where this is true include lisp scheme erlang prolog smalltalk perl python ruby and others

134572
dictionary	map
generally speaking frameworks like rails django or spring mvc allow you to decouple views from controllers by passing data the context commonly a map dictionary bag to a view where a view is an implementation of the template view pattern

134589
codeigniter	cakephp
php + cakephp codeigniter should we have considered others

134679
children	parent
of course layering is all over the place in computers such as in the networking stack iso model or in graphics photoshop or in soa services may call siblings or children but never parent

134728
division	multiplication
a lot of other algorithms will depend on multiplication division modular exponentiation gcd square roots etc.

134736
eventlet	gevent
co-routines greenlet gevent eventlet

134781
implements	extends
a service was implements to connect to both front and back databases and do the proper reading writing using some kind of retention strategy instead of writing every single trade on the sql server we hold the data to some extends say 1000 trades and did a bulk insert which was 40x faster than the original solution and did not lock many of the involved tables for a long time

134787
subclass	abstract-class
you d think that but putting a protected non-virtual method in an otherwise abstract-class dictates implementation to anyone who writes a subclass

134813
disk	ram
it s not just the code itself but your processor speed hard disk speed amount of ram whether the files were in cache or not whether your code is on a network drive what else is running on your computer etc

134821
boost	stl
this design enables libraries like boost which enhance the stl instead of replacing it without the stl needing to know anything about boost

134845
next	except
next i tried building a blacklist to match everything except known stop-words verbs and such

134848
profiling	debugging
you can weave this profiling attribute into the debugging build but not weave it into the release build

134884
ubuntu	mint
i m sure you can find a version of ubuntu or mint that you can set up and then you can do whatever you need

134981
division	multiplication
to calculate factorial for large numbers you can use a biginteger-library or arbitrary-precision library like or do it yourself arbitrary-precision multiplication is easy division not so by using an array of unsigned ints

134988
lisp	smalltalk
you ll have it out of the box if you code in say common lisp smalltalk python ruby etc

135014
easymock	powermockito	mockito	easymock
how do i do that with powermockito or easymock mockito which are part of powermockito

135027
post	get
the status is very important any time you get post info you ll need to get it s status or you ll want to filter post by status

135181
versioning	upgrade
but if i upgrade one to a new versioning i no longer have a prod branch which represents the one i didn t upgrade

135233
try-catch	exception-handling
though it is possible to try-catch the 404 exception-handling inside the helper function that gets posts the data should you

135233
post	get
again with the http get post example the question is should you provide a new object that describes what happened to the original caller

135235
put	get
they don t want to put in the time and if given a choice they d rather get software for free but you re still going to charge them right

135262
serializable	deserialization
yes object serializable and deserialization my be expensive in theory but what are the performance goals of your application

135287
agile	sprint
currently we are using scrum as our methodology in agile and it s based on sprint but i haven t been able to find any information detailing what s actually a generation in software development neither on agile based methodologies and non-agile

135325
int	double
if you pass the method sum a b a couple of int it knows that it should call the first implementation since the method call coincides with the method signature double sum double double will not work if you give the sum method two int

135335
free	malloc
do not forget to malloc each node before insertino and free after removal or usage

135336
free	malloc
every call to malloc should have a corresponding call to free

135379
google-chrome	firefox
the google-chrome protocol in firefox is a way to access the google-chrome registry

135385
profiling	debugging
not only is it good for debugging but it can also give you an insight in profiling

135402
implements	extends
if bakery does not change its behaviour dynamically and you can modify bakery class then you should extends existing interface as you initially proposed or introduce a new interface brownieinterface and let bakery implements two interfaces bakeryinterface and brownieinterface

135412
post	get	post	put	put	get
get post put delete todos etc

135412

get post put delete todo_services abc123 etc

135425
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
the advantages of this appoach is that it is not necessary to iterate a list or navigate a tree of queued items on push pop and also there is in general no malloc free realloc per push pop ie

135425
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
the memory-use issue can be mitigated by some extra code to malloc realloc free queue buffer space as necessary but this obviously requires more code inside the queues lock especially if it is found that a queue needs to be realloced larger impacting contention

135442
inherited	subclassing
additionally decorator must not be a subclassing of decorated so that nothing is inherited from decorated and decorator must provide its own implementation for

135463
versioning	upgrade
some oss projects keep selling new versioning and release the previous one as opensource at every major versioning upgrade

135534
interpreted-language	compiled-language
ruby is an interpreted-language with dynamic typing while java is a compiled-language with static typing

135542
apache	nginx
can someone confirm good performance using php + java webservice for heavy duty tasks running on nginx or apache because php is slow in completing some heavy tasks and i want to make a web service in java to communicate with php via soap or reat or json

135545
postgresql	mysql
soundex is the most widely known of all phonetic algorithms in part because it is a standard feature of popular database software such as postgresql mysql ms sql server and oracle .

135548
pascal	delphi	lisp	scheme
but other languages existed and they still do some of them even predating c - there s the lisp family cl clojure and scheme being the most popular modern dialects the ml family with several modern dialects there s a whole army of basic dialects vb.net and vba are modern implementations there s pascal and its relatives delphi being the best known one and many oddball languages that took influences from many other languages and invented a few things themselves

135575
screens	tablet
a smartphone screens will have a different devicespace than a tablet

135595
getter	setter
on the other hand sometimes the comments are really unnecessary for example at trivial getter and setter in java and if company creates an official comment-writing policy programmers are at risk that they will be forced to write comments even in such situations

135615
agile	srs
no agile does not call for the need of hld or srs business requirements document or lld or technical specification to be associated with user stories

135693
children	parent
i m building site with a very simple data structure documents that are nodes that reference other nodes that each have arrays of parent children and siblings so the structure is

135693
children	parent
what is most important is making the following query fast and easy all nodes with uuid x in their children parent siblings array

135700
printf	strcpy
i think the real problem isn t that these kinds of bugs are hard to fix but that they re so easy to make if you use strcpy printf and friends in the seemingly simplest way that can work then you ve probably opened the door for a buffer overflow

135706
jsf	wicket
some of the wicket guys have been saying things about jsf performance but according to this elaborate benchmark jsf actually performs better than wicket

135706
jsf	wicket
also for the gwt vs jsf wicket graphs it should be taken into account that the browser s rendering step is trivial for jsf wicket since they mostly serve ready-to-render html but the gwt client still has some work to do after receiving the server response

135712
nunit	moq
after a lot of testing and a bit of a lengthy review process i ended up settling on storyq which i ve been using for about a year now combined with nunit and moq

135721
printf	strcpy
any modern c standard library contains safer variants of strcpy strcat printf and so on

135750
cakephp	yii
i was doing a small list of php mvc framework like zend cakephp yii etc... and i noticed that all of them are open source

135771
getter	setter
however when using eclipse and tell it to create getter and setter it does this

135779
rss	feed
as an aside atom is also the basis for a popular rss feed format. atom is extensible and odata has taken advantage of this to create well-known extensions

135779
sorting	filtering
for example with an odata service there are uri conventions with many capabilities such as filtering filtering by date or customer name and sorting and so forth

135796
super	self
is self documenting that you are setting the current instance and not some variable in a super class which should idiomatically use super

135804
getter	setter
the lombok library provides getter setter annotations to alleviate you from having to write and others to read dumb getter and setter methods

135804
getter	setter
there is even a de-lombok option to generate source code with the appropriate getter and setter in place without any dependency on lombok but i wouldn t recommend it unless you have to meet some really weird requirements.

135897
rss	feed
one approach is to ask all of the sites to publish an rss feed with prices in a specific format

135897
rss	feed
part of atom rss feed is that it specifies metadata inside that says essentially don t check back more frequently than hourly or whatever which may help handle knowing how often to poll each without having to manage that data centrally assuming price volatility may vary by source

135959
strtol	strtod	fgets	strtod	fgets	strtol
they aren t told about using fgets and strtol strtod because those are considered advanced tools

135980
django	web2py
if this is a concern however then you might consider web2py instead of django

135984
mouse	keyboard
i ve documented myself on computer health and such purchased an ergonomic keyboard mouse however since i wish to take a career in programming this question keeps coming in my mind

135994
erlang	scheme
as an aside this has to do with dynamic typing not a lack of a compiler there are a number of languages that are compiled but are still weekly typed scheme and erlang come to mind

136003
hudson	bamboo	ant	maven
fully automated analyses integrates with maven ant gradle and continuous integration tools atlassian bamboo jenkins hudson etc.

136138
profiling	debugging
i use debugging viewer in conjunction with a profiling

136184
lisp	scheme
but if you know java python scheme and lisp chances are you re going to pick the best tool for the job

136184
lisp	scheme
write code in scheme php java python lisp perl c c++ c# visual basic ruby.

136248
geany	notepad++
i almost always do web development with a simple editor like geany or notepad++

136266
mockups	balsamiq
i use balsamiq mockups for ui design

136326
solaris	aix
i have a lot of experience with this making boost work on solaris making boost work on aix making tons of other things work on solaris like graphics libraries

136326
maven	buildr
i also like buildr which is a ruby alternative to maven compatible with maven

136348
wadl	wsdl
there are tools that can automatically generate client and or server code from a wadl or wsdl document

136376
ember.js	backbone.js
so started looking at current trending frameworks like backbone.js spine ember.js sproutecore

136413
jvisualvm	yourkit
i was asked to profile using some tool such as yourkit or jvisualvm a couple of implementations of the traveling salesman problem find the minimum path that visits all the given set of cities in the context of a algorithms analysis and design graduate course

136436
agile	sprint
so as developers we are being encouraged to perform agile by extending estimates when necessary but also complete the sprint on time which is confusing

136444
put	get
of course the need to get to market quickly will often cause firms to put more people on a project than is optimal from a cost prospective in order to attempt to get it done faster

136477
superclass	subclassing
if it wouldn t be the first statement in a constructor then the subclassing could do something with a superclass which is not yet constructed

136479
put	get
if not negotiate with your boss to get a mentor to help you to put some development process in place

136496
width	height
it s always been looked at that using width height attributes on images which aren t what the original image actual is is a bad idea

136531
multiplying	addition
this does start to stretch the paradigm though especially if you use the addition or multiplying operator for an operation which isn t commutative as you might expect them to be

136531
subtract	add
it uses and to add and subtract delegates register and de-register them

136531
multiplication	dot-product
it is obvious that is a scalar multiplication whereas would be a matrix multiplication a matrix of dot-product multiplication for instance

136532
haskell	scheme
i d also recommend to learn a trick or two from the other functional programming communities - haskell and scheme not all of their design know-how had already been transfered to scala

136543
int	boolean
the right implicit or explicit i forget cast operator from boolean to int and back did the trick

136558
superclass	subclassing
the original objectory method on which uml is based explicitly makes the case that actor is a kind of classifier and has subclassing and superclass

136560
width	height
speaking of bad idea it is not really a bad idea to adjust the width height by a few pixels or may be 10 or 20 pixels

136579
vb.net	vb6
it is part of the crazyness of vb.net trying to look like vb6 and feel like c# at the same time

136590
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
epsilon is really intended to be scaled by multiplication not addition or subtraction

136606
subtract	add
add or subtract two timespan s to get another timespan

136606
subtract	add
add or subtract timespan from a datetime to get another datetime

136643
swt	swing
you can use swing swt or something like jambi qt4 for java to build the ui for apps

136741
vim	textmate
our goal is to create a web based code editor that matches and extends the features usability and performance of existing native editors such as textmate vim or eclipse

136745
flask	django
you may look into django and flask as they have first-class support for applications

136745
flask	django
django specifies applications as simple python packages that follow a few conventions and flask provides an application object that describes a wsgi application

136788
fossil	git
version control git mercurial fossil

136788
trac	mantis	fossil	redmine	fossil	trac	redmine	mantis	redmine	trac
bug tracking trac mantis redmine fossil

136788
scons	autotools
build system autotools scons buildbot

136794
jobs	cron
at my company we have a quagmire of disparate cron jobs on multiple systems and manually kicked off processes which keep our business functioning that is a result of years of expedient development and subsequent neglect

136794
jobs	cron
jenkins claims that it focuses on monitoring executions of externally-run jobs such as cron jobs and procmail jobs

136809
jobs	cron
you ve not mentioned what your jobs are but your mention of cron makes me guess they are shell scripts etc

136838
put	get
if you have credit card numbers then you will have to put up with the problems the required level of security requires because theres bad guys out there who want them and will spend money and time to get them

136966
getter	setter
this can be easily implemented in java using inner classes by making the fields and their setter private and only exposing the getter as public members

136971
mouse	keyboard
i guess you could get two monitors but there is only one keyboard and one mouse

137007
ubuntu	linux
your home directory is a great place to store your code on a mac ubuntu linux based system

137018
agile	sprint
in agile this is the sprint planning meeting

137020
put	get
it seems to me that we could end up with hidden issues in this method in the fact that there are two ways to get to the same data and if we put some logic in the public exposed get property then we could miss that if we directly reference the private variable

137075
subtract	add
and if you ve learnt these things you will find mathematics much easier because you will understand that when we talk about a vector in a vector space then it s just an instance of the class vector which means that we can do all the things that vector does to that instance add subtract scale and so forth

137127
put	get
changing your oil takes time but you don t put it off forever or suddenly one day you get a nasty surprise

137163
public	protected
it is better to use the second construction for public protected methods and if you want something that is done in one line of code there is at least one way that i know of

137175
client-side	server-side
you may often find a server-side code in vb.net html markup and client-side javascript code mixed into a single source file although it is considered a bad practice by many

137188
perl	tcl
inline has support for c c++ java python ruby tcl assembler basic guile befunge octave awk bc tt template toolkit webchat and even perl

137231
versioning	upgrade
i would reserve branches for things like versioning upgrade changing one of the technology pieces working on a submodule for 3 months that has little in common with the main base

137237
cdr	cons
paul graham identifies seven primitives quote atom eq cons car cdr and cond

137264
getter	setter
for example if you have a simple java bean you don t need to write getter setter or constructors yourself as long as they re only doing routine work

137312
getter	setter
too many getter setter

137326
effort	xunit.net
even so i have managed to use xunit.net frameworks in a similar style without needing to invent a complete testing api to support my effort and while the asserts will still effectively short-circuit themselves they read more cleanly

137329
ant	maven
in my years of programming java and more recently scala i ve never used ant maven gradle or any of those build tools for java

137329
ant	maven
of course the conventional wisdom suggests that i should be writing my own ant maven gradle scripts and using that instead of the ide but what are the concrete advantages of that in my situation working alone

137344
getter	setter
they are not inexperienced at all far from it yet they write data objects the classic way - private members with a getter and a setter for every member

137383
getter	setter
relying on getter and setter all the time or worse yet on direct access of non-private members can get you into trouble before you know it

137452
ant	maven
i d suggest you look into using maven as opposed to ant

137452
maven	pom.xml
so anyhow what i do to get rid of this manual drudgery is that i configure my project to build with maven and i configure my pom.xml file with all the information required to in the case of a java web-app find and download the correct version of tomcat install it locally set up the correct tomcat configuration files deploy any project dependencies and the project war file itself and then start tomcat

137454
subtract	add
the generic operations are normally taken to be load add subtract store branch

137499
stdout	stderr
about stderr or stdout

137499
stdout	stderr
it s really simple if there s an error - write to stderr if it s just info - stdout

137501
implements	extends
afaik my class extends parent classes and implements interfaces

137501
implements	extends
it is possible i only have to use extends instead of implements

137502
implements	extends
and there is no reason to complicate the syntax just because in one other place where you actually implements an interface the distinction between classes and interfaces is relevant for example if you implements an interface you need to implements all methods it defines but you don t need to if you extends a non-abstract class

137528
hudson	bamboo
jenkins hudson bamboo other support + maven s support for integration testing practices

137537
vim	textmate
do you run google gem api reference manual irb ri side by side with your vim textmate like me most of the time

137589
getter	setter
the most annoying is the autogenerated javadoc for trivial getter and setter on pod classes we have lots of these

137589
getter	setter
when i see a class having 50 or more fields containing not much more than getter and setter for these fields and the useless javadoc taking up more than half of the screen real estate i often end up removing it completely

137609
getter	setter
unless the method does exactly what it said and absolutely nothing else apart from setter and getter i think this is relatively rare you need the documentation

137610
put	get
i also strongly put it that we will never get there either

137643
copying	overwrite
this would mean that when the copying is done the return address for strcpy is after the buffer instead of foo s return address and can be overwrite by whatever is in in

137679
pascal	delphi
the original code was 100 000 lines of delphi a pascal variant

137700
superclass	subclassing
everytime you invoke a subclassing from a superclass you are doing a method call so if you have nested five classes and invoke a method in the base class you will be doing five method invocations

137730
getter	setter
rule 9 no getter setter properties

137743
getter	setter
i think this rule is about public getter setter properties

137783
multiplying	add
knowing that a multiplying takes a lot longer than an add

137787
pull	push
instead you ll have to pull down all of the file entries modify them then push them back as updates

137789
superclass	subclassing
in a deep hierarchy isolating problematic code is more difficult because instantiating a subclassing requires bringing in the entire superclass hierarchy and a bunch of additional code

137789
inherited	properties
because of inherited the put and putall methods from hashtable have been exposed to users of properties

137789
inherited	properties
basically the semantics of properties are poorly defined because of the inherited

137862
daemons	systemd
such a systemd requires three components your existing web application a daemons or cron job and some kind of shared data store - a plain file in an easy-to-parse format a memory cache such as memcached or a database

137862
daemon	cron
the daemon process cron job downloads and parses the xml files at regular intervals say every minute or whatever makes sense and updates the shared data store

137885
lisp	racket	lisp	scheme	scheme	racket
you ll find the most powerful macro systems in languages like racket scheme clojure or other lisp

137890
public	protected
access modifiers know what private public protected means and when to use them to communicate to others whether or not your method is being used by other packages or classes

137905
email	dkim
from an email deliverability standpoint using a from address with a domain that you do not control has implications on a number of standards that have the potential to prevent delivery of your email dkim sender id and spf

137905
email	dkim
there is nothing to stop you from attaching a perfectly valid dkim or domain keys signature to the email however you would have to set the d parameter to your domainÃ¢ not the from address domain

138002
data-access-object	dao
to improve maintainability the data-access-object dao should solely take care of de- serialization

138009
put	get
sometimes you ll want to just put a query in there to get the right results before making sure its properly optimized and using an index

138093
yacc	bison
i would think the best place to start in practical terms would be a solid foundation in using lex and yacc or flex and bison since these are likely the tools you ll use to actually build the compiler

138113
restrict	shared
a shared static variable is in some sense a global variable although you can restrict access to it by using appropriate access modifiers

138126
gendarme	fxcop
i recommend using fxcop or gendarme for static code analysis

138131
rss	feed
any typical newsletter or rss feed or email are rather personal there is too and from fields that get the message to places

138144
initializer	class-method
or what about initializer an object somehwere in your class-method like pdo

138190
implements	extends
as a side note i just wrote a little library called peekable-arraylist that extends arraylist iterator and listiterator that provides a peekatnext and peekatprevious methods implements like

138196
kerberos	ntlm
about authentication wshttpbinding uses windows credentials ntlm or kerberos by default

138214
lisp	prolog
and while you might have heard of lisp or prolog haskell as well being popular

138293
springsource	grails
i thought rather optimistically that as springsource had an excellent eclipse build and were strong supporters of grails that this would be the way to go

138309
interpreted-language	compiled-language
the distinction is deeply meaningful because compiled-language restrict the semantics in ways that interpreted-language do not necessarily

138356
agile	sprint
when you actually start composing the web site borrow from agile and focus on yagni short sprint and visible progress

138361
button	checkbox
both mfc and wpf along with windows forms vb6 forms and plenty of other things contain concepts that come from the windows ui - the basic set of controls button text box checkbox etc the idea of properties for those controls text contents checked... and that some properties are common to all controls while others are just for certain controls

138455
post	get
concern about post get delete is not the primary objective of this article and is the concern on those actions themselves

138459
cvs	svn
real version control used to suck cvs a little svn there was no facebook to distract and no smartphones to circumvent lan restrictions so.

138504
post	put
a while back i ve put some of these thoughts in a blog post

138517
jar	war
i know this is often true because i have many times deployed jar or war without any cross-platform troubles

138524
vmware	virtualbox
if you want your own cyberdojo server the whole project can be found at github and there is even a turnkey linux appliance virtual machine linked from there which means that assuming you already have vmware or virtualbox installed you can be up and running within a few minutes of downloading the appliance

138546
google-chrome	firefox
in css i know how to create a shadow or a gradient which will work in google-chrome firefox and other normal browsers

138561
client-side	server-side
i see very little on writing web-apps besides writing it server-side and treating client-side as only a view

138565
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari
if it requires 1.5gb to process something can you really push that onto an unknown client browser ie safari opera firefox etc. on an unknown client platform

138584
pull	push
regular developers work...work...work and then submit a pull request to the trusted engineer who will pull review and push to the main repository

138608
jobs	cron
theoretically it makes sense for you to have a single location for controlling all the disparate jobs however based on industry experience that is like the holy grail you will need cron jobs here bash scripts there and cli scripts over here

138629
subtract	add
even updates can be done the same way subtract the old value from the aggregate add the new value

138678
matplotlib	scipy
and many more though i don t know many of their time lines aside from just browsing their download sites but python also has scipy built on numpy released in 2006 had bindings with r the statistics language in the early 2000s got matplotlib and also got a really powerful shell environment in ipython

138698
vim	emacs
finally if you pick an editor like emacs vim then you can use it for any language that arises and with blindingly fast speed

138728
client-side	server-side
since then others have appeared coffeescript comes to mind dart is on its way but also large javascript frameworks the revolution of server-side js with node.js and others and a strong comeback for javascript as good enough all-around language to be used not only on the client-side but also in other parts of your business stack

138759
ubuntu	linux
change the file to be owned by the user your apache or whatever webserver you re using is running for example wwwrun.www on suse linux or www-data.www on ubuntu

138760
srp	principles
pluralsight has a course principles of object oriented design that covers srp as the first topic in about 12 minutes

138772
agile	greenhopper
greenhopper works awesomely for agile planning and the integration with base jira works really well issues can be estimated and have time tracked on them which are reflected real time in burn down charts

138772
agile	greenhopper
agile greenhopper jira

138773
vim	emacs
a c vim master using vim to develop c is far more productive than a java eclipse master using emacs to develop cobol

138777
postorder	inorder
there is no obvious inorder traversal for rose trees m-way trees unlike for pre- or postorder traversals because while you clearly need to process the leftmost subtree first and the rightmost subtree last it s not clear when you should process the current node

138867
put	get
put away you compiler and get out you requirements management tool and resolve the requirements problem

138903
profiling	debugging	profiling	instrumentation
something a bit more humane than debugging symbols or profiling instrumentation

138928
memcpy	memset
routines like memset or memcpy are often done in assembly

138934
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the other browsers - firefox opera google-chrome etc have been much better about adhering to and supporting the standards

138965
folder	directory
one workspace does not allow the same tfs folder to be mapped to more than one local directory

138977
children	parent
this is in addition to the children storing the id of the parent as a member of the group

138980
children	parent
if you delete the row designated as a primary child from the children table what will you do for the parent row

138996
children	parent
my reason for this is that your parent object has two attributes a list of children and a primary child

138996
children	parent
if you re concerned about your child objects referencing the wrong parent object then have the parent object set the parent property on all children when they get added to the parent object s child collection

139034
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
i ve been warned that lgpl v3 forbids any kind of modifications that would prevent reverse-engineering including software protection such as obfuscation

139037
short	base
therefore i am trying to write a license header that is as short as possible while covering most base

139056
dictionary	map
you would only use the dictionary if you needed to map or associate meaningful keys to values whereas a list only maps or associates positions or indices to values

139069
postgresql	mysql
tools like mysql and postgresql open up the power of databases to millions of people and organizations that might never use a database if they had to buy a license from oracle

139113
srp	principles
this keeps the myservice class completely free of cross-cutting concerns thus following the single responsibility principles srp

139197
pull	push
when they use it they use it for simple things like push pull

139212
super	implements
put your class name or a super type or an interface it implements on which logger exists where it says yourtypenamehere

139230
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
lxml is not a new parser it s a python binding for libxml2 and libxslt

139230
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome uses both check google-chrome credits and firefox uses expat 1 check about license which similarly to libxml is a standalone library

139301
pull	push
first they will commit and push pull with a central server

139357
pull	push
depending on their workflow some people might fork-then-clone just in case they ever want to send a pull request which is why it looks like they just push the fork button

139371
versioning	upgrade
don t upgrade your mission critical jenkins instance until you ve tried the new versioning somewhere else first

139371
teamcity	jenkins
just because jenkins is well-suited to do this does not mean others teamcity buildbot etc are.

139418
accessor	properties
i have a public properties with a get and set accessor

139419
vbscript	vba
also the vb.net language is very similar to vba for excel and vbscript which are also used quite a bit in my area of the company

139424
getter	setter
this will help prevent you introducing bugs in future if you do add other logic in the property getter or setter which you would then bypass if you directly accessed the field

139435
post	get
so to get the automation we need i just wrote a wrapper so that i can call the post from my code using the proper parameters and go from there

139467
put	get
since it really doesn t matter whether we put semicolons at the end of our lines or not we might as well switch to c# to get rid of this false toy project image

139485
ada	algol	ada	pascal
the algol pascal ada bcpl b c pl m and other families of languages happen to use the semicolon

139526
salt	md5
generate the checksum by adding salt a set collection of random characters before and after the id and doing an md5 on the value

139534
richfaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	icefaces
primefaces icefaces richfaces prettyfaces etc...

139552
ada	algol
ada followed pl i s lead on this one item rather than algol s

139552
ada	pascal
bcpl begat b b begat c c begat c++ java d and a whole host of things considerably less well-thought-out than pascal and ada

139564
subtraction	addition
why does everybody use + to indicate addition or - to indicate subtraction

139577
opera	google-chrome
such mobile browsers include opera mini and newer versions of google-chrome on ios at least

139589
sudoku	crossword
that might mean crossword puzzles number games like sudoku and logic puzzles etc.

139666
put	get	mouse	keyboard
i very often find myself in situations where i should have opened a parentheses but forgot and end up furiously tapping the left arrow key to get to the spot i should have put it and doing the same to get back to where i was - that or removing one hand from the keyboard to do it with the mouse

139666
subtract	add
i might get to the end of the statement and realize i wanted to subtract the sum of var1 and var2 from 100 and not add var2 to the difference of 100 and var1

139741
post	get	post	put	put	get
you talk to this resource through only 4 methods aka get post put delete -or if anything that transport allows but that method doesn t become description of object

139750
int	chars
in java primitives are numbers int long etc. and chars

139751
int	double	int	chars
for example in languages like c and c++ you have a number of built-in scalar types - int float double chars etc

139755
int	boolean	int	double	int	chars
java has eight primitive types byte short int long chars boolean float and double

139790
rdf	owl
the different technologies of the semantic stack cake are trying to solve different problems some of them are more flexible but less structured for example xml while some others rdf owl are more rich regarding the structure and semantics of metadata

139790
rdf	owl
i agree with you that the semantic web as such is mostly used in academia but individual parts of the semantic stack cake are also used in the industry xml for creating meta-languages rdf in compilers owl for creating ontologies used in medicine food and drink industry etc

139790
rdf	owl
tim berners lee describes semantic web agents as automated tools that can interpret the rdf owl contents of web ontologies and make inferences about them

139817
rdf	owl
rdf and owl are established standards for encoding semantic data and their schema on a much deeper and generic level than an ad-hoc markup

139817
rdf	owl
for example with owl you can define new schema which will be at least partially understood by other tools because you can mix different owl rdf schema together

139848
srp	principles
yes even tests can be wrong however if you develop test first stick to the srp and dry principles refactor mercilessly and define your unit tests as a means to to validate your specifications you ll find that you ll end up with far fewer logic-related issues

139849
lisp	prolog
in my university we have a course that teaches paradigms of programming languages they involve prolog and lisp basically since we already cover pascal c and java on previous semesters

139880
redmine	trac
you can tailor trac redmine pivotal tracker or even jira to exactly meet your needs

139904
put	get
my problem is that i generally get put on teams of folks with essentially no experience with programming like vba would be a huge stretch for anyone i work directly with

139909
ocp	principles	srp	ocp	srp	principles
however i sense that a violates the single responsibility principles srp and the open-closed principles ocp whereas b doesn t

139927
getter	setter
if you go back a bit in the cqrs history you ll find arguments that domain objects shouldn t have setter only getter and a single handler method

139929
subtraction	add	subtraction	addition	subtract	add	subtract	addition
are more readable than add or subtract when performing addition and subtraction

139931
subtraction	addition
+ and - are obviously addition and subtraction for example which is why pretty much every language ever uses them as their operators

139966
queue	fifo
i hope you can tell that the second array is used as a round fifo queue

139969
put	get
i wouldn t put the get reviews for product functionality in either the product class nor the review class.

139980
children	parent
this is the only time you would ever delete the parent before the children

139982
tapestry	wicket
it s actually pretty straightforward particularly if a framework such as spring tapestry or wicket is used

140022
agile	sprint
in agile before you start your sprint you should have a meeting to discuss which user stories epics features

140045
ada	pascal
pascal resisted the trend but its successor ada gave up on it.

140054
children	parent
each tree node can have multiple children parent a node can also have a connection to it s brother

140075
feedback	review
it sounds like what you re doing is basically equivalent to a code review except that rather than providing feedback to the developer you re making all the changes that you would suggest in a code review

140075
feedback	review
you d almost certainly be better off doing an actual code review where you or someone else provides feedback to the original developer about code quality issues and obvious bugs and ask the original developer to fix them

140086
spaces	delimiter
in languages that have explicit complex statement delimiter c braces pascal begin end whitespace would be collapsed to a single spaces character before feeding the code to the lexer

140111
pull	push
then you can push pull all you order data in to your order into order processing accounting systems normalizing it at at that time

140164
post	get
is it wise to update the tokens after ever post request or should the updation be done only whenever the user makes a get request and keep the same token till the next get request is made

140167
wordpress	joomla
you run the risk of them pointing out things like the websense security study from 4 days ago showing that 94 of recent website infections were against php websites running software like joomla and wordpress

140181
antivirus	norton
the program is available for download but some antivirus like norton detects it as malware while other antivirus like avg has no issues with it

140260
ubuntu	linux
my main os is windows 7 but i ve used linux and currently dual-booting with ubuntu

140293
emacs	textmate	vim	emacs	vim	textmate
every team i ve ever been on has had a multiplicity of ide and editors eclipse netbeans idea vim emacs textmate rubymine -- it s never been an issue

140294
put	get
fires get put out

140297
pull	push
you can just push a branch and have another dev pull it to get it working if he really can t figure your toolset out

140317
pull	push
i was reading extreme programming explained second edition and in the chapter 11 the theory of constraints the authors talk about the old and obsolete push development model and the xp way the pull development model

140317
pull	push
if the only difference about those is that one is waterfall and the other is iterative them why push and why pull

140337
pull	push
the difference between a push and a pull system is how the units of work are assigned to the person who will be carrying out that unit of work

140337
pull	push
the concept of push and pull aren t unique to software development - the idea originates from logistics and supply chain management

140337
pull	push
the concept of push and pull aren t related to iterative incremental versus sequential development

140337
pull	push
a team using iterative incremental agile techniques could use a push system while a team using sequential development could use a pull system

140350
ubuntu	linux
ok so i am familiar with developing form and console applications on windows using visual studio .net with c# but where do i start when it comes to linux distro s like ubuntu is there an equivalent

140405
bazaar	svn
i have used vss tfs svn and bazaar in my career but tfs is where most of my experience has been

140405
bazaar	svn
in my previous job bazaar was used sitting on top of svn devs worked in their own small feature branches then pushed their changes to svn which was tied into teamcity

140434
pull	push	bazaar	git
but any of the three distributed systems git mercurial and bazaar will serve you well and you can often even mix them mercurial can pull and push to from git repository and i believe so can bazaar

140443
pull	push
any authoritative central repository that you might set up in a dvcs workflow is just another clone and the only time you need to interact with it are when you pull down other peoples updates or when you push your own changes so that other people can see them pretty much everything else can be done off-line

140462
versioning	upgrade
oh and they also quickly upgrade from xx-2 versioning too

140479
vmware	virtualbox
you can use vmware or virtualbox

140502
interbase	firebird
in the case of borland s interbase now called firebird there was a hidden super-user that the system required in order to work

140524
versioning	upgrade
the best way to deal with this is to keep feature branches on the latest versioning only and make customers upgrade to get the new features at the same time perform bugfixing directly on the release branch and merge them upwards to all the other release branches when complete

140532
spaces	delimiter
i might describe what you have as a modified radix tree that is forced to use spaces as a delimiter

140535
disk	ram
in the analysis of this problem the question is if the performance cost - ram that is 75 the speed - is worth the benefit - caching 70 of the data ahead of disk

140571
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
for the project i m working on i ve even got wrappers around malloc realloc free to insert canaries track statistics etc

140578
websphere	ibm
do you mean the old websphere process server or do you mean the current product ibm business process manager aka ibm bpm

140609
children	parent
even if the parent was responsible it should simply delegate that call down to the children it has

140612
inherited	subclassing
the advantages of this approach are that it flattens the subclassing hierachy and avoids most of the needs for interfaces multiple inherited duck types

140637
public	protected
in c# starting protected or public name with underscore is against common language specification

140647
put	get
it ll let you get an understanding of what things actually matter and what is just something put in there by a manager getting the wrong end of the stick

140660
lisp	scheme
i m currently playing with lisp particularly scheme and clojure and i m wondering how typical data structures are dealt with in functional programming languages

140690
put	get
it does have the unconventional but pleasant syntax of using single-quotes for strings since it doesn t on an american keyboard require a shift-key press to get at and you type a lot more strings than characters comments using the double-quote is a bit odd but arguably people put up with longer key strokes for comments since they are typed in a different mindset than code.

140910
octree	quadtree
say a quadtree or with colors an octree

140955
submit	submission
for example if submission a form should do x make sure the test is about submission the form and not about clicking submit

140969
mvp	presenter
model view presenter mvp

141000
getter	setter
the fields should be private and access should go through setter and getter to ensure the class invariant

141024
django	turbogears
i ve been procrastinating learning some framework for web apps w some library for ajax something like django with prototype or turbogears with mootools or zeta components with dojo grok jquery symfony.

141040
hash	salt
you also need to use a salt hash to stored user passwords and properly hash or encrypt other sensitive information in the database appropriately

141073
int	chars
i have to scan from a file hundreds of lines of code and store it in a array which i can normally do a ok job with however at one point the code will specify a number that then corresponds to the next batch of chars int and floats going into various arrays

141077
minix	linux
that said with its driver architecture dynamically loaded modules and multiprocessing optimizations which make kernel space communications increasingly resemble a microkernel s message passing it s structure more closely resembles a microkernel design as embodied by minix than the macrokernel design as embodied by linux s design at the time of the discussion

141088
cpu	processors
x86 processors since the pentium-pro era 17 years ago use op-code translation to allow an essentially risc core to look like an x86 cpu from the outside

141111
wordpress	phpbb
thats how virtually every blog entry think wordpress news article and forum post think phpbb on the internet is stored

141136
goto	break
in c++ and java the variable begin to exist when its definition is encountered and end it existence when the end of block that contains such definition is reached either by the sequential flow or by a jump-ahead instruction like break goto return throw

141137
agile	sprint
what ever if you are agile you get the result after each sprint say 2 weeks and you get an opportunity to get customer feedback and make sure all are on the same page

141242
inherited	properties
yes the prototype properties on a given object refers to the parent object which allows the given object to inherited all its properties and methods

141242
inherited	properties
the object also inherited the properties and methods from the parent but it is all self contained within that one object

141247
playstation	wii
your thing here could be hardware software user interaction methods think wii vs playstation xbox or whatever

141256
filtering	grouping
that s just fine breaking it up by filtering or grouping of filtering is just adding extra complexity for no real benefit

141268
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
there is rush ruby shell which tries to implement a shell in ruby there is rush which is an internal dsl for shell programming in ruby there is hotwire which is a python shell but imo none of those come even close to competing with bash zsh fish and friends

141343
teamcity	jenkins
in my view though i ve somewhat less experience with jenkins than with teamcity both are excellent and very capable tools - i d be happy in an environment using either

141389
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest isn t restricted to http but consider the situation where every api you write web facing or otherwise simply consisted of objects containing get post put and delete methods

141390
disk	ram
more terse languages however got more code into a given chunk of both disk and ram and thus compiled larger chunks at a time

141405
client-side	server-side
when people tell that you must store only hashes of passwords they are talking about server-side storage not client-side

141405
hash	md5
things are different if you use an obsolete and depreciated hash algorithm like md5

141406
rss	feed
some small websites may have fancier ways to access data like a csv file for the older information and an rss feed for the changed one

141460
ssl	https
using url rewriting for session management for plain http communication is a recipe for disaster however does some of that risk go away if you re using ssl https

141481
put	get
get put delete etc serve to reinforce the orientation

141503
put	get
this drive will push you to do all the things manupk put in his answer and you ll like it because it ll allow you to get closer to finishing your project

141514
getter	setter
he suggests that where there is an excess of getter and setter on a class we should endeavour to move the methods that call these getter and setter into the class itself - the intent being to eventually remove access to the data and only allow operations on an object

141535
post	get
talking in terms of programming basically i keep pointer to the original post in a separate table and when need to get post posted by user and also shared ones i do a left join on post and shared post table

141616
error-handling	try-catch
try-catch allows for more object-oriented error-handling as was mentioned by avoiding the use of magic numbers

141623
vim	emacs
how do you manage a project when you re writing all the code in emacs or vim or nano or whatever

141626
metaphone	soundex
for english the soundex and metaphone algorithms encode which sounds are ambiguous

141626
metaphone	soundex
soundex is probably too simple but metaphone incorporates some good points

141658
getter	setter
even a lot of the state-specific functionality of a program can be thought of in terms of behaviours when you present state through getter and setter methods

141679
perl	tcl
as you are on linux i would suggest looking at tcl perl and python

141679
bash	tcsh
and use bash sh and or tcsh scripts to your advantage also

141679
perl	tcl
there is no reason why you cannot use a sh script to split the work into three bits and use tcl perl and python for each bit according to their aptitudes

141707
versioning	upgrade
then you can provide an upgrade script which checks the versioning numbers and if the config file is not up-to-date it changes all module names it finds within the file and increases the versioning number afterwards

141716
dia	visio
a diagram tool such as visio or dia makes it really easy to draw change and delete diagram blocks so i recommend grabbing something like that to help you work it out

141733
lisp	smalltalk
is this possible to implement this in kind of concept on lisp smalltalk or c++

141734
pull	push
set the remote server up with a proper public private key pair for remote push pull

141758
min	max
the config file itself could be a little more complex and might contain attributes for the editor to use display name help text value type min max value etc

141803
config	ini
so the config files are all versioned with that interesting syntax and then we generate an adhoc unversioned config file for my specific instance which replaces those variables with unversioned settings specified in unversioned ini files

141811
rss	feed
for example you could use the same chess board view with an rss feed as a model to illustrate famous games

141838
subtract	add
in c you can add something to a pointer the address or subtract something to point to things that are nearby or point to places that are at any place

141998
express	node.js
technically i ll be using express node.js and mongodb+redis for the databases

141998
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
will be a good option to hash the user and password with md5 or similar and some salt

142095
mvp	presenter
i have a windows forms project using the model view presenter pattern and would like to build a web forms project on top of the same mvp structure

142095
mvp	presenter
one of the commonly mentioned benefits of mvp is that it allows for building different ui s on top of the same presenter models etc

142113
lan	intranet
for a set of applications that are hosted on intranet and possibly in one lan the best can be a tcp connection for services

142129
dropbox	skydrive
as i already noted i don t think you really have a proper vcs solution til your code is on at least two machines specifically two distinct hard disks and ideally in more than one location - although cloning and pushing to say usb stick or cloud storage skydrive dropbox et al is another way that should work as well

142162
modula-2	oberon
i like the approach of designers like niklaus wirth every time he felt the need for a different language he designed a new one pascal modula-2 modula-3 oberon

142175
sml	scheme
learn some sml and caml as well and to brush up my little knowledge of scheme

142182
put	get
you get back what you put in not some random weirdness and due to isolation there is no way that i o can corrupt your internal program ideally

142200
mouse	keyboard
in a traditional program your code draws the scene the user uses the keyboard or mouse to tell the character to move to another position and your program draws the movement to the screen

142227
mouse	keyboard
nothing is more annoying that an app which is intended to be multitouch and which does it totally wrongly being at the same time unusable with mouse and or keyboard because the developer doesn t care that some people still use those input devices

142276
loops	if-statement
loops can become very involved and one or more clean breaks can be a lot easier on you anyone else looking at your code the optimizer and the program s performance than elaborate if-statement and added variables

142276
loops	if-statement
the ending condition should be checked by loops structure for the reasons you mention but not at the cost of adding whole new variables adding if-statement and repeating code all of which are even more bug prone

142330
algol	smalltalk
smalltalk was the result of this conception borrowing and extending the concepts of object and class from simula which simula in turn inherited from algol as described on the development of the simula languages by kristen nygaard and ole-johan dahl 1978 page 253

142330
lisp	smalltalk
it can be done in smalltalk and in lisp

142338
division	multiplication
for example i think you d be nuts to routinely re-jigger arithmetic to replace multiplication and division with equivalent bit-shift operations to save a cycle or two

142340
for-loop	arrays
also you can help the optimizing compiler for example by making simple for-loop through an arrays with explicit start and end indices may allow the compiler to optimize away bound checking which is about the only thing that makes java arrays slower than native arrays

142354
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
rely on abstractions when i use a jquery animation i know it will work in google-chrome firefox safari opera and even internet explorer

142381
postgresql	mysql
ms sql server postgresql or mysql will work fine

142382
cos	sin
i d also like to add support for inline functions such as sin cos log and random

142386
devise	cancan
i m using devise for authentication but i think something like cancan would fit better

142405
singleton	facade
it is my understanding data access objects the component that connects directly with the web services and convert them into the data types i can then work with in my domain objects should be singleton and will act as an adapter facade am i correct

142412
put	get
if that s the case it might be better just to get a clean break the advice to put a positive spin on things by looking forwards is very good advice

142433
free	malloc
and furthermore new delete is exactly equivalent to malloc free but safer because it guarantees correct construction and destruction of heap objects totally necessary

142458
gtk	fltk
there are qt gtk fltk etc

142462
yacc	bison
there are a variety of powerful language development tools out there right down the old stand-bys of f lex and yacc bison

142464
freebsd	linux
emacs and vi are free open-source and easily available on any unix-like system linux freebsd macosx and with a little work can be installed on windows

142464
mouse	keyboard
you can and modern versions of these editors support using a mouse but they are designed so it isn t necessary because using one is slower and takes you away from the keyboard breaking your concentration

142464
vim	emacs
programmers familiar with vim or emacs may not need or want to use an ide in many cases

142464
vim	emacs
vim and emacs provide powerful searching auto-completion of identifiers syntax highlighting and auto-indenting

142464
vim	emacs
standard emacs or vim it doesn t matter

142464
vim	emacs
although basic versions of vim and emacs may be installed on the mac download the latest stable versions from their web sites

142481
disk	ram
when the program is running under an os that virtualizes memory access to that location might cause a page fault resulting in the program being put to sleep until the required page is brought into ram via peripheral disk i o the program restarted via a context switch and the cache mechanism does whatever it s going to do with it

142481
put	get
that s where the similarity ends because the cpu now has everything it needs to put the 5 into register r and get on with its business

142504
codeigniter	cakephp
chances are you ll be expected to know css html4 5 and most definitely javascript dom ajax jquery plus at least a viable framework such as zend corporate america s taster s choice codeigniter cakephp etc

142506
postgresql	mysql
p i ve done mysql and postgresql off and on over the years and with my cheats text files where i save particularly useful queries i can pick that stuff up real quickly

142507
vim	emacs
not to disparage on vim everyone has their favorite power text editor and emacs is mine.

142568
websphere	ibm
see business process standards part 1 an introduction which includes a short section on the relationship between the standards and business process standards part 2 how the standards are used in websphere products which describes specifically how ibm incorporates them into their own products

142573
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
or you could possibly add a ping function that would send you the versioning number and some unique id each time the app is run for the first time after an installation or upgrade

142628
agile	sprint
we re doing agile so you should be able to accomodate what i need within the sprint as i identify it.

142643
agile	sprint
granted it wasn t built with agile but the point is this developing life or property critical is no place to say we ll clean that up on the next sprint or we don t need great just good enough.

142661
int	chars
id table is int key chars used 1 1 is used 0 is not

142706
floating-point	integer
amd and intel for example classically differ on how many logic units they dedicate to floating-point versus integer math

142714
g++	gcc
c code would be compiled using gcc c++ code using specific version of g++ and new c++11 code compiled again with possible different g++ version into separate shared libraries

142736
versioning	upgrade
then when you start a new project you just use your latest released library in that project and upgrade to a new versioning whenever needed

142747
pseudo-class	classname
words in css class names should be separated with dashes classname as that s how words in css properties and pseudo-class are separated and their syntax is defined by the css specs

142779
agile	sprint
what i learned was that this place has adopted several agile practices such as daily standups sprint plannings and sprint reviews but none of the principles just in time just good enough mentality exposing failure early rich communication

142848
getter	setter
it has some getter setter some query methods etc

142858
comparator	comparable
using the myentity parameter on comparable simplifies your comparator method in that you don t need to do any type checking or casting in your code

142880
namenode	hdfs
the namenode is a single point of failure for the hdfs cluster

142881
ready	each
the software team can discuss with their customer the relative priorities of each requirement and as soon as the hardware prototype is ready the software will likely be available in an early release form and can be used to help in testing the hardware

142900
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
transaction monitors are still all the rage its just that websphere weblogic jboss and glassfish are now the dominant brand names

142901
affinity	processors
that are cache friendly and set affinity to processors cores either

142902
opensuse	linux	redhat	fedora
one example is fedora linux vs redhat enterprise linux or opensuse vs suse linux enterprise editions

142906
serializable	deserialization
it also has the added benefit of being able to generate the serializable deserialization code for you automatically so you can use strong-typed objects in your program code

142933
versioning	upgrade
my advise is to upgrade as much as possible while remaining lazy about it you read a object from a previous version- you overwrite it with the same now upgrade object from the current versioning

142933
versioning	upgrade
but you will run into trouble if you ever tighten up the data invariants or simply do a complete overhoal so an older versioning cannot be upgrade

142946
getter	setter
a javabean is a java object that is serializable has a nullary constructor and allows access to properties using getter and setter methods

142966
width	height
in an effort to cope with those limitations i m trying to figure out how to visually losslessly reduce a data set for a given scale and map extent and if necessary for a known map pixel width and height

142998
implements	extends
the immediate down side is that any class that extends implements this class can t extends another class which may be a problem now or later

142998
implements	extends
on the other hand you can make one or more of your methods concrete and save work in all the extends formerly implements classes

143078
ncover	fxcop
our ci build process besides compiling the code runs stylecop fxcop and ncover and runs unit tests

143139
vmware	virtualbox
if you want your own cyberdojo server the whole project can be found at github and there is even a turnkey linux appliance virtual machine linked from there which means that assuming you already have vmware or virtualbox installed you can be up and running within a few minutes of downloading the appliance

143148
getter	setter
example if you have a java getter setter method that maps a method to a local variable a unittest for this would be overkill

143149
yacc	bison
programming language grammars are not fsms but the parser generators like yacc or bison generally have a way to put in one or more error states so that unexpected inputs can cause the generated code to end up in an error state

143156
put	get
put in debug statements with careful if-statements to avoid 999 999 999 unneeded messages and you need to make a billion runs just to get one useful message

143160
multiplying	add
i don t quite understand why you add first and then divide for the fraction but multiplying first then add for the whole

143173
pop-up	dialog
if you wanted to get really fancy annoying use some text-to-speech package and trigger a dialog pop-up

143219
switching	screens
i usually use one i created which is a tiny window in the corner of my screens with buttons for working notworking and i just click whichever one i m on whenever i switching focus

143236
lisp	scheme
the term lisp or lisp-like is an umbrella for lots of different languages such as common lisp scheme and arc

143282
jython	pypy
the pypy runtime plans to fix it but is not there yet and while the jython and ironpython implementations don t have the limitation they are rather incomplete they don t have much of the standard library you have to use the standard library of the hosting environment in them

143300
sorting	filtering
the data transfer object is generic and would have all your filtering parameters sorting etc

143312
hash	salt
for security there you ll need to properly hash and salt the passwords.

143316
getter	setter
in that case adding a new feature such as a date range is as simple as adding setter and getter for the date range to your data object and then adding a bit of code where the parameterized query is built

143323
awt	swing
awt html forms with the controls in table cells swing xaml android and asp.net all use it or borrow from it

143378
versioning	upgrade
what if office versioning is upgrade or if not all users are using the same versioning

143410
short	base
you can refer to other short url recommendations like this one for info on base 62 hashing conversion

143456
webkit	gecko
i would begin by studying the gecko layout engine used by firefox and of webkit which might seem to be mac-centric due to its apple roots

143467
memcached	apc
apc and memcached are some of the caching solutions out there

143501
int	double
well i ve come to the conclusion that eventually all classes distill down to for lack of a better term atomic variables strings floats double int resources you get my point and that i tend to try to construct all classes with those variable types or objects - but not arrays

143556
kde	gnome
gui file and windows managers kde gnome

143559
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux	redhat	fedora
for an operating system to be branded unix it must undergo a conformance testing and for linux this would mean that every distribution out there ubuntu debian fedora redhat etc would have to separately undergo this conformance testing for every release

143560
x86	64bit
oracle corporation solaris 10 operating system plus patch 118844-06 for x86 and on on 64bit x86 based systems

143560
freebsd	linux
vendors of open source unix like systems mostly linux and freebsd typically don t register with the open group either to avoid the costs of certification or well because they don t find much value in doing so

143560
minix	linux
the history of linux article on wikipedia explains the origins of linux and it s relationship with unix via minix and gnu in some detail and you should also take some time to read through the references of the article if you are interested in learning more

143563
ada	pascal
c++ to use your example though the same would apply to c pascal ada etc. doesn t give any real visibility into the heap

143580
unix	solaris
in terms of standards conformance both solaris and mac os x are officially unix but you don t have to spend much time before you find rather large differences between the two

143599
freebsd	linux
i once read that linux is what you get when you take a pc developer and ask him to write a unix os whereas freebsd is what you get when you take a unix developer and ask him to make a pc os..

143599
freebsd	linux
this means that unix freebsd and linux all appear to be pretty much the same thing

143599
freebsd	linux
the directory layout will be different but many linux distros use their own mostly compatible but still different layouts anyway the filesystems are different unix uses ufs freebsd uses ffs linux uses ext3 to be simplistic - all of them can use ports of common fss eg zfs

143599
freebsd	linux
then there are differences in core apis linux will give you the inotify api to tell you when files changes mac osx gives you fsevents and freebsd gives you kqueue

143599
freebsd	linux
at a closer look you ll find porting apps between freebsd unix and linux relatively easy compared to porting to alternative oss such as windows

143645
cpu	processors
sometimes referred to simply as the central processors but more commonly called processors the cpu is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place

143723
vala	genie
vala and genie are both languages that compile into c

getter	setter
all variables should be private unless they absolutely need to be public which is almost never you should use properties getter and setter

143740
getter	setter
in traditional lanugages like c++ or java you usually make everything private and only accessible by corresponding getter and setter

143740
getter	setter
in those languages you therefore get something called uniform access principle where one deliberatly does not distinguish methods like getter and setter but provides direct access to the variable function

143770
erlang	ocaml	haskell	ocaml
i know of at least 4 on erlang including mine one on haskell as well as titles on ocaml clojure and f#

143785
namedtuple	dictionary
many types of datasets ordereddict namedtuple array list tuple dictionary

143804
submit	submission
as far as submission your code you can compile and package your code into a jar file and submit this along with junit.jar and a simple batch file or shell script that will execute the java virtual machine to run your program

143820
getter	setter
i used to think it was silly to put getter and setter on private properties when you weren t really performing any kind of validation or other special treatment of the property to be set

143820
getter	setter
the other big advantage is that it s easier to have your objects hand off or interpret values differently from a getter or setter based on some kind of varying state context

143831
dictionary	map
i would be essentially injecting dictionary or other key-value map

143848
lisp	smalltalk
smalltalk was for instance heavily inspired by lisp and ruby is heavily inspired by smalltalk

143854
16-bit	64bit	floating-point	integer
the error is in the code that converts a 64bit floating-point number to a 16-bit signed integer

143860
free	malloc
otherwise rewrite it with malloc and free

143887
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i am trying to decide what technology libraries to use that will create a web-app that will work on android-web-browser ios-safari ie9 safari firefox and google-chrome

143919
agile	metrics
metrics like tdce and pce don t make sense in process frameworks like agile because agile specifically runs counter to viewing software on the macro project level especially bug resolution which inherently implies a rigid set of requirements before the development phase

143925
put	get
you typically need 3 basic commands for daily work download get changes from repo upload put changes into the repo and status what changes do i have

143925
bazaar	git
git mercurial bazaar and other distributed systems usually have a distinction between local commit and remote commit

143925
bazaar	git
in most of them git and bazaar as i recall at the least the command to locally commit is commit and the command to push your changes up to the remote system is push intuitively enough

143941
agile	sprint
the good thing about agile is that you don t see much difference between big and small projects as most of our concentration is on the specific sprint s that we are currently working on

143942
free	malloc
something that nobody has mentioned yet is that the variable length array option is probably going to be vastly faster than malloc free since allocating a vla is just a case of adjusting the stack pointer in gcc at least

144035
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
the c memory allocation functions malloc calloc and realloc all return pointers to the first element of the dynamically allocated buffer

144043
int	boolean
this is consistent with the use of other system types - int bool var etc although int32 and boolean are also correct

144073
int	double
..but as it s a keyword your syntax colouring editor ide will show it in keyword colour same as int double if else etc

144073
int	double	int	chars
this is a niche point though as although bool chars int double and string are all keyword aliases for system types string is an odd-one-out as it is a reference type and the others are value types

144093
put	get
when i was studying compsci at university studying comp sci games development the curriculum they used taught us c# in the first year to get the basics of compsci and software development we moved onto c++ in the second year so that we could study what you are calling the concepts and some hardcore comp sci and in the third year we moved onto c and assembly so that we could see the difference that speed and efficiency make to the design and the amount of work you have to put in

144099
vmware	virtualbox
if you want your own cyberdojo server the whole project can be found at github and there is even a turnkey linux appliance virtual machine linked from there which means that assuming you already have vmware or virtualbox installed you can be up and running within a few minutes of downloading the appliance

144101
jboss	weblogic
will these need an outage on the servers if deployed on jboss weblogic

144164
installation	upgrade
you can use this to wrap your modification and rollback scripts into a simple commmand than can be run as part of an installation upgrade

144181
int	chars
you can think bigger than simply juggling chars int arrays structures pointers handles etc

144189
put	get
again the scrum master should kick in here and tell you to put the item back on hold until you know enough to schedule it or get you to stop designing and answer the original question how long will it take

144192
inherited	properties
for javascript should the prototype match and should inherited properties also be compared

144278
config	ini
ini files are a good standard way of storing config and are tried and tested but they just feel a bit windows 3.1 to me

144327
children	parent
these two modules are children of a parent player module widgets.player

144348
getter	setter
i think you must try to use getter and setter always

144348
getter	setter
in general that s the kind of situations where using setter and getter would make your code easier to maintain

144348
getter	setter
there are many other situations like that and most of them encourage you to use setter and getter

144353
getter	setter
there s no particular reason to use getter setter if you dont need them

144353
getter	setter
otherwise you re just cluttering the code with getter and setter functions that may never do anything more than assign a value

144353
getter	setter
delphi for example has properties which can effectively act as either a wrapper around a private variable or a getter setter

144353
getter	setter
so there s no actual need to use a getter setter method if you dont immediately need it since a public variable can be recast as a property using getter setter keeping the interface to that class the same for the code that uses it even though it may be a getter setter under the hood to code setting an object s property it still does so as if it was a public variable

144353
getter	setter
if that means getter setter to you then use em

144354
getter	setter
otherwise getter and setter are recommended

144420
profiler	gprof
you can do this by profiling your code for example using the gnu profiler gprof

144429
put	get
so the presenter would expose methods like listofallusers which the view would use to get its list of users alternatively you could put an adduser method the view and call that from the presenter

144430
internationalization	localization
wincc that will be sold in many countries will take localization and or internationalization into consideration while it is being developed in order to make the product fail-safe ie

144438
internationalization	localization
wincc that will be sold in many countries will take localization and or internationalization into consideration while it is being developed in order to make the product fail-safe ie

144440
fossil	redmine	fossil	trac	redmine	trac
i was thinking about issue tracking software like redmine trac or even the one that is in fossil and something hit me

144440
redmine	trac
is there a reason why redmine and trac are not possible to be distributed

144441
redmine	trac
both redmine and trac are typical web based crud applications architecturally wise there isn t a reason why they can t be distributed

144452
devise	sorcery
authentication is handled by gems like authlogic warden and devise based on warden sorcery

144480
queue	fifo
in a fifo queue all new elements are inserted at the tail of the queue

144514
trie	tree
a trie tree or a radix tree are most likely going to be the most space efficient while still having fast lookup insert remove speeds

144540
maven	pom.xml
i added them as dependencies in the pom.xml and maven compiles my project well

144595
short	base
so in short the answer that it may at rare times be acceptable to defer major changes to code in order to make a deadline however it should not be considered normal practice to treat refactoring as an exercise independent of your daily implementation work and certainly never used as an excuse by teams unfamiliar with the code base as an option to avoid ensuring that their implementation is as lean and clean as they can possibly make it under the circumstances

144599
srp	principles
in the spirit of srp principles you can follow what michael feathers calls sprout class pattern and extract a chunk of your original class into a new class

144637
put	get
you won t find your object if you get with a different object that is equal to the object you put

144639
equals	gethashcode
the idea with a hashtable when you try retrieving an object is that the data structure computes the hash code of the object using the gethashcode method and then goes through a list using the equals method

144651
instances	transient
having said that i personally ab use eclipse s feature of adding a method parameter prefix a to fall back to coding habits from smalltalk which can t be beaten in terms of readability where method arguments are typically prefixed with the article a or an to indicate their more transient nature as opposed to class or instances variables

144690
getter	setter
one where i basically use getter setter to get and store data to the database from my controller to my model

144693
cdr	cons
car and cdr is better used when one exploits the feature that something tree queue list ... is built out of cons cells

144702
put	get
if the hashcode method is not overridden the answer to this question really depends on if the same key object which was used to put is going to used for get as well

144711
versioning	upgrade
for example vmware just released versioning 8 it s a major upgrade to their main product

144756
lisp	scheme
the scheme and the common lisp nil are quite different yet they adequately terminate a list exactly in line with your observation that it could be any arbitrary value

144764
button	checkbox
button checkbox

144795
integer	unsigned
if working with only positive values you can probably use an unsigned integer but for the most part simply using the int datatype is enough

144838
int	chars
now it becomes more efficient code-wise to use int for most variables instead of chars or shorts

144856
children	parent
add children when the parent has

144917
innodb	myisam
if he ends up building wonderful apps with nosql why would he have to know the difference between the innodb engine and the myisam engine

144959
inherited	properties
keep color properties or having inherited solution

144959
inherited	properties
i actually simply asking if using color properties will cause if statements better to use inherited

144972
wadl	wsdl
no wsdl wadl or similar complex stuff

144975
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
if a dropdownlistfor has its checkbox checked means that it must be part of the group by clause in the select statement

144991
aggregate-functions	sum
usually you want to run an aggregate-functions like sum or count on the grouped set

144995
subclass	abstract-class
of course one could try to model this in a more generic way by separating the properties of the pieces from their moving rules but this may end in an abstract-class movingrule and a subclass hierarchy movingrulepawn movingrulequeen .

145000
versioning	upgrade
this has covered us for upgrade to the application over 5 years with no bugs caused by deserializing old versioning of the objects into newer versioning of the application

145077
lisp	scheme
the interesting thing occurred to me while reading your question was that almost every language is c powered underneath lisp scheme python.

145084
superclass	subclassing
for example all pieces could conceivably invoke a moveforward or movebackwards method even if the move isn t legal but the piece s encapsulated logic uses the color property to determine the absolute value that represents a forward or backwards movement -1 or +1 on the y axis as far as your api is concerned your superclass and subclassing are identical objects since they all expose the same methods

145086
haskell	ocaml
i tried diving in at the deep end with ocaml and then haskell and just didn t get it

145091
teamcity	jenkins
take automated systems like teamcity jenkins or others

145109
getter	setter
don t mess with getter or setter because the sole purpose of the object is to hold public ly settable values

145111
put	get
put it to him that you don t want to risk letting the customer of the company down and that you d like to try and develop a strategy that can ensure you can continue to get your work done but that this means you need to make time to address your health concerns as well

145153
submit	submission
i then submit all of these to download.com tucows.com sofpedia.com submission each one individually

145158
pull	push
if these are too close to call then a decision will need to be made to pull based on the other node perhaps it is more important or to push to the other node this node is more important

145158
put	get
while the above is not perfect there are several situations where local and remote may get into trouble and having remote pull data from local is probably more efficient than stuffing it into a big put it does demonstrate how rest can be used during a bi-directional synchronization process

145181
ubuntu	linux
for instance gui development is wildly different on windows and ubuntu linux socket communication is probably not identical on unix and ibm z os and so on

145323
int	boolean
i used an int variable for that but i noticed some classmates using boolean

145330
post	get
the following is an example taken from the authorization header in a get or post

145335
int	boolean
the behavior of boolean operators applied to int treat 0 as false and everything else as true

145335
int	boolean
bool is just an hint suggesting a boolean behavior for a int

145368
put	get
with distributed version control you can put the client and a repo on a laptop or usb drive and work completely disconnected most of the time with lots of different ways to share your changes sites like github emailing bundles back and forth or even just pushing and pulling from each other s thumb drives or laptops on a lan when you get together for team meetings

145398
implements	extends
ddd experts used poco to differentiate from the initial entityframework model where your entities had to extends entityobject or implements a specific interface

145440
super	implements
if there s no shared vision among product owners be it implements by a super product owner or by a close collaboration among the po ...you ll be very likely to deliver a visionless product

145519
perforce	svn
some have their own built-in authentication mechanism svn with svnserve rtc and its user registry perforce and its p4admin they can have their own internal user database dedicated for their tools

145519
gitolite	rhodecode
if you need a finer-grained access control you need to add an extra layer to the tool rhodecode for mercurial or gitolite for git

145519
restrict	shared
for instance i have put in place both with dvcs used to allow third-party enterprises to collaborate on a restrict shared code-base with the company

145546
mouse	keyboard
keyboard ide mouse programming language .

145582
super	extends
however i don t extends the super class as i don t feel it fully fits

145582
super	extends
i can t imagine that this is good practice so should i just extends the super class or should i name the class slightly different than what i feel the original class should have done

145590
cvs	rcs
rcs is the per-file revision control system that cvs was originally built on top of

145605
post	get
i usually work with the apps which either fetch data via get or send data via post to some web service usually a php script which then either get data from the database or do writing into the database

145608
post	get	post	put	put	get
it effectively means using the inbuilt http commands such as get post put delete and a few other rarer ones to communicate back and forth between a client and server

145608
post	put
there are subtle differences between how post new and put replace are used as well

145610
post	get	post	put	put	get
all communication is via http get post put delete and all items are addressed via a standard url of the form only a pure url with no parameters etc

145610
post	get	post	put	put	get
the url identifies the thing the get post put delete identifies what you want to do to it

145655
put	get
http contains a useful set of generic verbs get put patch etc that can applied to arbitrary nouns expresssed as uris using http get

145655
post	put
post is to create put is to overwrite options for available operations delete to well delete the resource

145667
feedback	review
allocate junior developers to pair program then review their work and give them feedback

145677
put	get
i understand that threading is needed to get the maximum performance out of today s multicore processors but starting a thread is rather costly so you can t put every single calculation that can be done in parallel in an own thread

145680
led	electronics
i just got a batch of led matrix modules from sure electronics and a driver board

145691
dictionary	map
i would make the properties map a subclass of a dictionary and then put the above code in a method on that class

145736
put	get
i just get out of my chair and start doing other things when i see a bug or when i have a module that requires thinking and it takes me long time to come back sit and put my thought back to the code

145758
spaces	delimiter
some sql dialects allow embedded spaces in column names but they need to be surrounded by backquotes or some other delimiter before they can be used

145763
wikitext	mediawiki
i don t know if you consider mediawiki wikitext a language but names with spaces are definitely idiomatic

145763
identifier	ambiguous
ambiguous because identifier are always surrounded by lots of punctuation to separate them from raw wiki text

145768
rss	feed
you could do something silly and complicated like use a wiki page set up an rss feed specifically for this or give the team a freakin twitter account but when you stop and think about it email can already do what you want

145769
verilog	vhdl
the need from escaped identifiers in vhdl and verilog come from the fact they are often produced automatically from other sources such as schematic where identifiers customarily don t have the same restriction as in programming language

145773
pull	push
you can work in either subrepo as needed and push pull to update them

145786
post	get	post	put	put	get
use http verbs get post put delete options patch to perform relevant operations

145786
post	get
follow offered links in a content-type you understand get your user or your application to infer that in html expresses a state transition to create a payment resource through a post with a body containing some xml that represents the payment details like credit card number amount and so on

145798
assimp	glew
i use mercurial and use subrepositories for all my dependencies glew glm boost assimp bullet but am not convinced it s always a good thing

145818
identifier	ambiguous
the restriction of course is that an identifier canÃ¢ t contain a keyword when this would be ambiguous

145841
min	max
this is done by setting a max and min variable to the first element of the array and for each element after that if that element is less than the min or greater than the max set the min or max to the new value

145841
min	max
for each integer from min to max inclusively xor that value with x and store the result in x

145841
min	max
rearrange the array based on a pivot point which will be the max of the left side and the min of the right

145841
min	max
it ll be trivial to find the max and min of the full array while pivoting

145846
ssl	https
an effective way to get the benefit of tls ssl without having to do a lot any work is to have your server implement a web service that the client accesses using the https protocol

145884
post	get
check out this post for a quick way to get up-and-running with a mobile mvc 3 application using jquery and html5

145921
post	get
if you get nothing else from it you ll be able to write interesting blog post

145930
addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	division	modulo	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	multiplication	modulo	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	modulo	subtraction	addition
and honestly in every day programming unless you re into building a graphics engine or something too localized you ll most likely never need anything other than simple arithmetic addition subtraction multiplication division modulo and a few things about arrays

145977
min	max
start with the biggest cost max quantity min price

145998
dbcontext	objectcontext
static variables tend to be even worse especially with objectcontext and dbcontext

146023
profiling	benchmarking
that said i m not advocating the use of this or that method only that testing and profiling and benchmarking should precede any theoretical analysis about performance since most systems nowadays are just too complex to fully understand without a deep expertise in the subject

146086
pull	push
something like node.js on the server side appeals under this model where you will possibly have a lot of short lived potentially asynchronous requests to push and pull data

146098
int	double
i would say int int bool to double

146136
midi	osc
chuck supports midi osc hid device and multi-channel audio

146150
pbkdf2	hash
use bcrypt or pbkdf2 exclusively to hash anything you need to be secure

146161
clang	llvm
i did not check gcc or llvm clang

146169
getter	setter
so from this perspective your question really becomes should i add collection attributes getter setter to my dao data access objects

146180
pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	pbkdf2
there are some constructions like pbkdf2 and scrypt to create a slow hash function from a fast one by iterating it often

146181
quicksort	mergesort
in fact quicksort is used because it tends to be quite a bit faster than mergesort in the average case if quicksort doesn t degenerate due to badly chosen pivot elements

146194
128bit	64bit
most demonstrated attacks on cryptographic hashes have been collision attacks and have demonstrated the ability to generate colliding messages in less than 2 l time most have still been exponential-time but reducing the exponent by half is a significant reduction in complexity as it makes a 256-bit hash as easy to solve as a 128bit a 128bit as easy to solve as a 64bit etc

146197
mergesort	in-place	quicksort	mergesort
one more thing is to ensure your algorithm is in-place a major advantage of the intuitive quicksort over the intuitive mergesort

146253
versioning	upgrade
the current versioning of xxxx does not support the features you want we need to upgrade to the latest versioning

146258
post	get
first you re only going to get half the answer if you ask this question to only programmers so you should probably cross post this on while you re at it

146258
min	max
the calibration is a simple table that contains sectioned ranged between the min max values

146270
vim	emacs
while power users can still configure their industrial strength editor ie vim emacs to do the same things there s a very large segment of the population that don t such tools

146302
inherited	properties
that way directory and file will inherited the properties and the behavior

146358
put	get
what i would do is bring the candidate back inform him that the is on a short list don t say of 1 put him with one or two of his potential day to day co workers and get the team to solve the problem

146363
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
a recent trend in web development is using mvc implementations written in javascript like javascriptmvc backbone.js knockout.js and many others

146475
lisp	racket	lisp	scheme	scheme	racket
scheme is rarely used in programming except to refer to the sub-genus of lisp languages called scheme racket formally plt being perhaps the best known implementation of the scheme language standard

146477
hide	show
while it could be done with css alone in modern browsers javascript is most often used to show and hide the element sometimes with a fade effect

146498
hebrew	farsi	french	hebrew	french	farsi
are there other languages or modules that allow you to write in syntaxes inspired by other natural languages like french hebrew or farsi

146507
postgresql	mysql
if your hashtable becomes too big you will have to use a relational database management sysyem like mysql postgresql oracle sql server etc

146510
getter	setter
note i assume we aren t talking about getter or setter here but code that actually computes something

146513
put	get
however if you re willing to put a little extra effort into it then i m sure you can get something decent on windows

146525
ubuntu	debian
recently i have taken to packaging configuration information as debian packages we use ubuntu that are installed from a central repository

146639
filesystems	ntfs
i thought i would find a plethora of information on how filesystems like ntfs and fat32 are read by programs but i m only finding resources on how to work with the filesystems using pre-made software and not so much how to make such software

146695
debian	linux
i use debian gnu linux

146748
agile	sprint
obviously you want to prioritize getting them done in the sprint but to me the whole point of agile is to be dynamic you don t want to deliberately procrastinate or make it ok to miss finishing user stories in a sprint but at the same time when unexpected things come up and those stories do not get completed and are pushed to the next sprint you don t want the feeling that you did something wrong

146799
int	double
that if they work with mobile devices double and int have similar performance on desktops fp may even be faster but double may be a hundred times slower on low-end mobile devices without fpus

146826
post	get
this sounds like a pretty classic case of post redirect get and is sort of the expected behavior for web applications

146843
cvs	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn
scm integration svn cvs git mercurial bazaar and darcs

146852
sctp	mtu
i wouldn t be surprised to see sendmsg work without issue but if you are using sctp in stream mode and sending buffers bigger than the mtu this may not remain true

146865
setinterval	settimeout
an implementation of a javascript-enabled browser that needs to deal with the arbitrary number of timed events created with setinterval and settimeout

146869
getter	setter
use of getter and setter should be avoided as they break encapsulation and we should instead ask the object to do something for us instead of digging in to the object and getting its fields

146869
comparator	comparable
so i find use of comparator interface better as compared to comparable interface

146869
getter	setter
but then i will have to use getter and setter for to access individual properties to compare to objects in a different class

146873
getter	setter
it is certainly true that having getter and setter for every field provides little more encapsulation than having those fields be public and it s unfortunate that this kind of design is very widespread

146873
getter	setter
but it s nonsense to conclude that getter and setter should be avoided altogether

146873
getter	setter
if everything a field does can be handled by domain-specific methods don t have a getter or setter - this is the best case

146873
getter	setter
if the value of a field is by itself useful and necessary for other classes add a getter not a setter

146873
getter	setter
if the fields represents something like a configuration value a way for the behaviour of the object to be influenced from outside add a setter and a getter iff knowing this configuration could also be useful to other classes

146873
comparator	comparable
a comparator could be seen as an example for case 2 especially if the comparator is deliberately used instead of having the class implement comparable

146876
getter	setter
in such a case it s ok to use not only getter and setter but even direct access to fields of siblings classes

146906
translation	localization	internationalization	localization	internationalization	translation

146979
versioning	upgrade
it s not unheard of for an application to live 10 - 15 years with only a few versioning upgrade in there

146993
agile	sprint
however agile allows for the development of software in sprint and when each sprint is complete and green-lit by qa it should be pushed to uat for the users to bang on and give feedback

147026
screens	tablet
the need for screens space on tablet will change the scope of how ides display information too

147030
public	protected
at its simplest encapsulation is achieved by providing an external interface to classes your public stuff and an internal implementation private protected stuff

147066
nsexception	nserror
there the nserror is the preferred way to handle errors despite the existence of what a java developer would call true exceptions try catch throw nsexception class etc

147088
