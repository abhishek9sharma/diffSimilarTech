573
goto	break
if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks

getter	setter
it generates the constructor and the getter and setter for you

1589
getter	setter
it infuriates me when i have to use a dollar sign prefix for variable names or underscores for private variables even with no getter setter

1672

haskell	scheme
that s why i learned haskell and scheme - they introduced me to function programming and mostly-functional programming respectively

3071
haskell	scheme
i wouldn t have cared less whether scheme and haskell were widely used aside from how that would affect the available documentation and resources

3080

post	get
the depth you can get from a book is unmatched by for example reading various forum post

3139

with a desktop computer all these issues are taken away and left with how you sit your mouse and keyboard layout etc

3246
mouse	trackpad
i don t use the mouse often but i d sure as hell use one over the trackpad or that trackpoint garbage

3374
min	max
this is wholey different than specifying a prefix suffix convention for things like min max avg size count index et cetera which is fine

3474
lisp	scheme
like many alliterations it has become an epithet and pitted against real features. but lisp and scheme for example would be unreadable if not for the let shorthand and others

3521
fortran	ada
years ago we decided to use ada for our next product but as we all used fortran in the previous product we ended up creating fortran constructs in ada

lisp	scheme
thus if you only know c-like imperative languages then learning scheme lisp is extremely useful

4907
put	get
once you put together a comprehensive list of purposes they would change before you could get it built

4912
lisp	prolog	lisp	smalltalk
and sometimes niche languages have been around far far longer than any of the mainstream languages - smalltalk prolog and the lisp languages leap to mind

junit	testng
i ve used testng and junit

7118
disk	ram
ram runs in nanoseconds disk in milliseconds so you can see the problem

7137
inherited	properties
to me these are the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming complexity management code centralization and improved problem-domain modeling through the creation of object classes inherited and polymorphism and increased safety without sacrificing power or control through the use of encapsulation and properties

7209
accessor	properties
data fields brain-dead properties accessor and similar boilerplate overhead

7246
client-side	server-side
most of the early web servers supported server-side includes so a client-side textual include was likely thought to be unnecessary given that the same functionality was available also with frames

udp	tcp
tcp ip you should know how a socket works how to open one the difference between tcp and udp

7384
division	modulo
division and modulo usually rounds toward zero but it s implementation defined

lisp scheme - the strange but incredibly powerful ur-language that great hackers think defines cool

7505
entity-relationship	diagram
i ve been handed the entity-relationship diagram for a quite complex database

7533

7564
collabnet	svn
for svn there is collabnet and others

7578
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i recommend testing in the latest stable build of firefox google-chrome safari and of course ie 7 8

7917
mouse	keyboard
i hate the idea of touching someone else s mouse and keyboard

8055
versioning	upgrade
if i would start to focus on the .net platform and be self-employed then i probably would like to have some windows 7 windows server 2008 visual studio 2010 licenses just for the development environment and for testing and then a few licenses for the production environment a windows server 2008 web and added to that upgrade when new versioning is available

8149
min	max
in the last 10 years i don t think i ve needed to use anything from the math library other than ceil min and max which shows that even though computers were devised to solved math-based problems the common use today is decision-making around the flow of data

8152
put	get
pair programming - when something really complex and does require broad analysis even we would put two excellent people together and get the task done in quick time

8157
teamcity	nant
we currently have a teamcity server that builds and deploys .net projects with msbuild msdeploy nant

8217
post	put
for web articles blog post interesting emails put them in evernote

8364
opera	firefox
but after looking at opera it seems to me that opera has all of the same web development functionality that firefox has built into it

8409
opera	firefox
the main reason i stick with firefox rather than opera is that this is what the firefox bug tracking system looks like and this is what the opera one looks like - when something s not working and i m sure it s not my fault i like to be able to read and contribute to a discussion about it

8409
google-chrome	firefox
incidentally one reason why i prefer firefox to google-chrome is that i spend a significant amount of time trying to do web development on trains with no network connection and google-chrome has this issue

8491
hide	show
sites like filehippo even allow users to show hide betas and their updates.

8589
sorting	filtering
nowadays most apps are always downloading data from the web and you ll need to be converting that to objects keeping them in lists sorting and filtering them and pushing them to databases

8704
firefox	safari
so using firefox for development generally means develop in firefox then test in ie and safari

8704
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari
using opera would mean develop in opera then test in ie safari and firefox . just means more work for you to do

8803
boost	stl
one thing i did was grab a large scary library i did this with boost and stl for c++ and see if every line and every keyword make sense

8929
vim	emacs
everyone i know working with python uses emacs or vim

9007
dropbox	skydrive
but recently i ve enjoyed having some more precious no source code data off-site without having to constantly worry about backups in case of hardware failure using services like dropbox skydrive google apps etc

9016
bazaar	git
the advantage of a distributed system git mercurial bazaar is that even if your remote host does disappear completely you ll still have the full repository history locally from which you can start again elsewhere

9105
post	get	post	put	put	get
one advantage to using my real name a high school friend was able to get back in touch because i made enough apparently interesting post on a language forum to put me in several of the top 10 google results for my name

9283
getter	setter
support for code generation while obeying language rules think create all getter and setter for java classes unless a method with the same name already exists or dependent on annotations

9293
haskell	scheme
you can study languages that have a traditional emphasis on clarity and conciseness haskell scheme python or even terser paradigms like factor and other concatenative languages but ultimately everything you could choose to study should ultimately contribute to helping you write shorter less redundant code

9309
getter	setter
in eclipse generate setter and getter automatically similarly create methods in implements class from an interface

9318
primes	palindrome
edit the decimal conversion is also a primes so it s a primes that has a palindrome binary representation

9319
primes	palindrome
where they say it s a palindrome primes

9344
lisp	scheme
i have had a knee-jerk reaction to scheme in the past but now i am ready to give lisp clojure actually a shot

9344
lisp	scheme
edit ita software was founded by mit grads and scheme lisp was the only language that many of the mit grads learned

9439
cvs	svn
i usually put all of these documents together in a repository that i put into a revision control system like svn or cvs

9474
primes	palindrome
it would be neat if in ascii it represented the date when some department or faculty at university of waterloo opened. but palindrome primes is pretty sufficient to make it interesting and johnston has an easy walk over to a place where he can find a group of mathematicians capable of pulling that out of their hats

9483
firefox	safari
the facts are simple windows ie firefox mac safari firefox

9495
opera	google-chrome
opera google-chrome and ie 8+ all have good development tools built in to them

9495
google-chrome	firefox
i do most of my development in google-chrome nowadays but there are still a few tasks like managing amazon servers via elasticfox that i find myself doing in firefox

9496
pop-up	dialog
as far as tracking your time the most accurate method is to write a program that pop-up a dialog box every minute and asks you what are you doing

9552
put	get
# if paying unlocks some capability don t put that capability in the free version as it will get cracked - regardless of how much market penetration you get

9733
lambda	first-class-functions
some examples include referential transparency lambda functions first-class-functions lazy and eager evaluation and immutability

9746
versioning	upgrade
many corporate users are not on the latest versioning of windows still on xp but i think more home users have upgrade because of new hardware

10046
delphi	oxygene
oxygene included in delphi prism has the added benefit of being partially compatible with delphi native for native windows development but if you want to use ironruby or f# we won t stop you

10149
hide	show
they are a way to group projects included in your solution workspace in eclipse in a way that allows you to hide or show different sets of projects according to the part of the code on which you want to work

10230
hash	salt
i feel like these are serious issues and that if i were him i d want them pointed out to me but i m not a qualified programmer i m a social worker and i don t know if it would be rude of me to just buttonhole him and start blabbering about salt hash and normal forms especially when this is no longer a paid task of his

10434
versioning	upgrade
free downloadable content for paid users and free upgrade and patches training videos cheap upgrade or free upgrade to the latest versioning

10441
freebsd	linux
play with other operating systems like linux freebsd

10449
vb.net	vb6
a major disadvantage in vb.net is that they brought in a lot of vb6-era crap way back in .net 1.x to ease the conversion of vb6 code

10449
vb.net	vb6
when .net was introduced in our organization they more-or-less-officially went with vb.net because of all the vb6 coding that was already going on

10539
mouse	keyboard
you need to consider different input strategies - mouse keyboard touch etc

10539
hide	show
many modern gui frameworks provide themed widgets and have move size show hide animation effects often for free

erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme	erlang	ocaml	ocaml	scheme	lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml
then i heard that functional languages are where it s at so i played around with scheme lisp haskell erlang and ocaml

should i use plain php ruby on rails django cakephp codeigniter yii kohana or make my own

10684
lisp	smalltalk
chances are the ideas incubated in either lisp or smalltalk

10776
put	get
if you have to make 10 different source text changes and you only get 9 of them right you ve put in a bug

10857
getter	setter
it seems a bit of a controversial subject to document everything including the javabean syntax of getter and setter for fields people say its needlessly long and repetitive breaking dry don t repeat yourself that the naming convention should explain everything and it clutters code documentation

10936
getter	setter
for example if the getter is documented as never-returning null i generally don t document that you can t pass null to the setter unless there is a default

11050
pascal	qbasic
i used to be able to program in qbasic turbo pascal c c++ visual basic and assembly

many imperative programming languages ada c c++ turbo pascal foxpro have the ability to define pointer to functions or procedure name literals that can be evaluated and the procedures named after the literal invoked at run time

11669
yacc	bison
what is the advantage of having bison yacc etc

11700
yacc	bison
the most important thing about bison and yacc is that they generate a state machine which would parse exactly your grammar

11700
yacc	bison
bison and yacc make you concentrate on the grammar instead of its implementation

11719
hide	show
show and hide what i need

11725
put	get
personally i would put more emphasis on se than there typically is but i believe cs as a program is less appropriate for people looking to get into industry

11754
ocaml	scheme
f# being more ml-like than scala has more of a minimal lambda calculus-y feel to it the way ocaml standard ml and scheme have

11798
dbf	dbase
i once inherited a system where the prior developer re-implemented in java a large set of the ashton tate dbase iii+ api layered on top of custom dbf access library

11808
vim	emacs
integrates neatly to emacs and vim

11861
children	parent
consider an xml dom -- it makes sense for every node to have a reference to their parent and for every parent to have a list of its children

11863
put	get
it s trying to get you to put the data and those methods together

11995
mouse	keyboard
while i think your motives are good i would recommend not deciding on an ergonomic keyboard and mouse dual monitors etc

12095
rss	feed
blogs and rss feed can be used to announce updates news items etc

12108
pascal	delphi	ada	pascal
back then i took basic pascal i and ii c i and ii c++ x86 assembly expert systems delphi and ada before setting foot on a data structures class

12291
haskell	ocaml
f# syntax is inspired by those of ocaml c# and haskell

12306

important to you to be able to put your thoughts into writing and maybe get some feedback from other developers

12318
versioning	upgrade
how can you tell your end users that they will need to upgrade their browser to use the latest versioning of your website without a huge outcry

12318
versioning	upgrade
why does the expectation exist that it s ok for software to require people to upgrade windows mac versioning but a website cannot require a new browser versioning

12333
versioning	upgrade
first of all i don t really think people have any greater motivation to upgrade windows mac versioning here are the usage share of web client operating systems august 2010 windows xp 48.32 windows 7 19.81 windows vista 18.43 mac os x 6.42 ios iphone 1.40 linux 1.34

12333
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
by contrast here are the usage share statistics for browsers overall- ie 31.1 firefox 45.1 google-chrome 17.3 safari 3.7 opera 2.2

12333
versioning	upgrade
as for your other question-- how can you tell your end users that they will need to upgrade their browser to use the latest versioning of your website without a huge outcry

12390
cvs	svn
bro use a versioning control system svn git mercurial even old cvs is better than nothing

12442
internationalization	localization
updated with a couple of examples although not directly to do with programming as such i think the best example for this sort of thing is with localization internationalization

12442
inherited	properties
i ve seen one particularly nasty example of this in our code base where what was actually a parent - child relationship where the parent and child had properties with similar names was modelled with inherited

12446
children	parent
inheritance itself is not a problem as long as you see a real relation between the classes like the classic examples such as dog extends animal and you re not putting methods on the parent class that doesn t make sense on some of it s children for example adding a bark method in the animal class wouldn t make any sense in a fish class that extends animal

12447
inherited	properties
in general it should be preferred to create classes via composition and then converting to inherited those classes with the bulk of their properties in common leaving the differences as compositions

12494
yacc	bison
yacc and bison use regular expressions and a bnf style syntax for lexical and syntax analysis respectively

12494
yacc	bison
there are also yacc and bison like tools in for other languages

12552
inherited	subclassing
if you are subclassing a to class b but nobody cares if b inherited from a or not so that s the sign that you might be doing it wrong

12819
int	boolean
someone reading this section of the code might not realize immediately that actionsallowed is a boolean variable - it could also be an int representing the number of allowed actions

12819
int	boolean
so by adding true it becomes clear that x is a boolean and not an int being coerced to a boolean

13054
short	base
frequently when you see a code base for the first time just a short lists of therefores to answer the whys the code cannot can help immensely understanding what goes on

13163
put	get
it s very demotivating to think of the huge packages options and big fat bonuses the higher-ups get often in a year when a feature i implemented sells a large number of extra licenses - while i get the same salary no matter how much or how little effort i put in

13163
put	get
it tends to put me in the burned out unmotivated working just hard enough not to get fired mentality of peter gibbons from office space

13396
put	get
i m drowning in user emails and i d like to implement a better way to manage all these requests i get and put them in a queue where those people on a team as well as users have access to them and can make common notes

13468
cvs	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn
scm integration svn cvs git mercurial bazaar and darcs

13601
skype	ichat
skype ichat ventrilo make voice conferences easy tools like git mercurial and the associated project pages online make it easy to code as a group even if you re on opposite sides of the atlantic

13667
disk	ram
do not skip on ram - you want as much in memory as you can - some build processes are very heavy on disk usage

13691
implements	extends
simple examples of getting a helloworld which extends a custom java class and implements a custom java interface would be very useful to me

13768
activemq	rabbitmq
wcf nservicebus rabbitmq activemq etc. vanilla msmq restful api think mvc are all options

13772
implements	extends
implements interfaces works similarly just import the interface extends it using a class definition such as class myclass myinterface and implements what s needed

13802
int	boolean
for example to save space you may store multiple variables in a single 8-bit int variable by using each bit to represent a boolean

13846
disk	ram
the same question after you double the available ram disk cpu etc

13893
range	minimum
it allows you to define minimum supported hardware more easily so you can limit the number of customer complains - we all know most software runs on most computers it s just a matter of performance - if we set our specs so that people in the minimum requirements range has reasonably acceptable performance you limit customer complaints - and then when a customer calls in you can use the benchmarks to determine if there really is an issue or if the customer is just not happy with how the product is supposed to work

13929
phpunit	simpletest
most php frameworks these days are unit tests for a good example of the difference in tools zend framework uses phpunit and cakephp uses simpletest

14040
post	get
post it on hacker news - you ll get a lot of feedback

14060
super	self
and ask him with whom he she compare him self to make the assumption that he she is super

14109
cpu	processors
also two processors are a must so if an app locks eats cpu up the developer doesnt have to painfully way to ctrl-alt-del something

vsto	add-in
reason is i m developing a vsto add-in where there is my add-in small mb the vsto run-time .net runtime and primary interops

14216
16-bit	64bit
likewise the simd may only support parallel 8-bit addition without implementing addition for wider elements such as 16-bit 32-bit or 64bit

14256
post	get
next time you want to write i have been having such trouble for weeks now trying to figure out how to get the first 4 characters of a string with .net i was so confused but in the end i sorted it out and along the way i learned a lot about the string functions ... and then writing a useful post about string functions but possibly tainting yourself as someone who didn t know that basic thing start it instead some people are confused about all the different string functions

14305
for-loop	loops
if a language has a for-loop or iterator construct then using a while loops also demonstrates implementers level of understanding of the language

getter	setter
it doesn t matter if the fields are public or private and use getter setter it s still not likely part of a well thought-out design

14313
lambda	first-class-functions
for example think lambda functions or delegates first-class-functions versus single-method classes that implement a single-method interface

14459
post	get
junior developer can easily grab the ideas about code review process also they are able to get what is the coding standard for instance to create api in a proper way they will learn the standardization of the coding which may help them in future specially when they are become in higher level post

14486
collabnet	svn
give them a copy of tortoisesvn for a client and collabnet s svn server for a server and have them put their my documents folder under subversion control

14594
postgresql	mysql
it is written in the php scripting language and works with mysql ms sql and postgresql databases and a webserver

14784
awt	swing
it makes no difference if you learn awt and swing by writing applets or by writing desktop applications

14835
error-handling	exception-handling
when you write a routine that calls a routine that might throw an exception-handling if you know how to handle that error correctly put the call in a try block and put the error-handling code in the catch block

15050
rss	feed
this could be useful for book-marking sharing rss feed selection web crawlers

15229
client-side	server-side
deployment and server-side code a silverlight app is a client-side app plain and simple

15242
put	get
i ve seen this become a reality on occasion when the management or client put up too many barriers to simple changes quality reviews by people who know nothing about the system needing to get signoff from too many business areas that it s sometimes quicker and easier to just rip off the bandage don t tell too many people just make the change and if it works everyone s happy you might get a slap on the wrist for not following the process etc

15299
clipper	basic
5 some obsolete languages i used to know when i was young basic pascal clipper etc

15350
hash	md5
php s md5 hash of it becomes fe5d54132b51b7d65ab89b739b600b4b which i don t think will harm anything

15386
lisp	smalltalk
eventually java will go the way of lisp and smalltalk and c# will follow suit

15489
versioning	upgrade
by all rights most of these technologies could easily be just released as versioning upgrade of the older versioning but there seems to be a big need to put on this image of continually reinventing even something as basic as a data access layer

15493
public	protected
plus python s oop model lacks any sort of data protection there aren t private protected and public members

15495
ubuntu	debian
in this famous example the debian team broke the encryption for openssl for debian and derivatives like ubuntu when they followed the results of an analysis tool

15518
public	protected
a simple rule that i tend to follow is verifying private functions arguments with asserts and using exceptions for public protected functions arguments

15526
put	get
sure there may be compromises you might take a harder module because you enjoy it more and maybe you may get a lower grade than if you took an easier option but if you care about what you are doing and put the effort in you ll get good grades

15526
put	get
put it this way if you don t get good grades and feel you could have you ll regret it sooner or later

15574
mouse	keyboard
you can also connect a keyboard mouse to it so it s indistinguishable from a desktop when being used

15576
mouse	keyboard
i like to use a laptop that is docked to a large monitor with a real keyboard and mouse

15596
mouse	keyboard
i recently underwent a refresh and opted to use a laptop but only because i could have a docking station with an external mouse keyboard and 2 monitors

15699
erlang	lisp
looking at python ruby modern perl erlang scala clojure lisp you name it in every one of those languages no patterns from gof are needed since frankly the patterns are a good way to solve some problems inherent to languages without higher-order constructs

15774
put	get
all of these taken together have resulted in me writing code that generally has fewer bugs than before because i m now writing code that s far easier to understand and get wrong than what i previously put out

15845
matlab	simulink
matlab simulink

15923
vim	emacs
some of us use vim some use eclipse the crazies use emacs - but we have to do some tweaking to get the plugins the colors and the shortcuts as we like them

15931
pascal	delphi
besides many different assembler languages i have used c c++ c# pascal delphi perl php and some lisp

15965
macvim	textmate
if i need to do a lot of typing but don t need code-completion or debugger textmate or macvim fit the bill

15969
opera	firefox
thats why i prefer firefox over opera

15970
google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome because it feels lighter although i have no real evidence it is a better browser to firefox

16017
versioning	upgrade
generally though updates stay within a product versioning for example hotfixes while if you want to move to a later versioning you would upgrade

16057
short	base
for a short time a few databases followed the network model -- essentially identical to multiple inheritance and viewed from this angle multiple interfaces aren t enough different from multiple base classes to notice or care about

16086
haskell	ocaml
in functional programming the idea of a program as a mathematical statement is very strong and often the type system in a strong statically typed language like haskell f# or ocaml can be used for testing theoremhood through proofs

16086
int	boolean
for example let us say that we have addition and equality checking as primitive operations and int and boolean as primitive data types

16149
put	get
i would only caution - people think abstraction is somehow this wonderful thing that needs to be put on a pedestal and that you can t get enough of

16177
pascal	gw-basic
i d done gw-basic and turbo pascal programming a fair bit before being introduced to oo so initially it did do my head in

16207
free	malloc
doing things in java means that you don t have to deal with stray pointers and free malloc

16244
vim	emacs
as an example think of vim or emacs - would you like to use it without any customized settings plugins etc

16306
put	get
financial constraints start-ups are tied for funding so they look for folks who are willing to work long hours and put in extra effort to get the product service out the door for lesser money no matter if the code base internally truly sucks and is a real maintenance nightmare

16354
agile	sprint
agile methods provide one framework for organizing group planning--making planning visible to everyone user stories breaking it into smaller chunks sprint and providing retrospective analysis so you get better at planning

16450
mockito	easymock
there is nothing wrong with this except that when someone else comes along and needs to use an actual mocking framework such as easymock or mockito

16466
lisp	prolog
c c++ java c# python ruby any other language assembly lisp prolog etc

16466
lisp	prolog
from assembly to lisp prolog or haskell

16541
vim	emacs
for both perl and python emacs and vim

16550
spaces	delimiter
this limited vertical spaces is a problem itâ s widely acknowledged that individual methods should be as short as possible and that corresponding braces or other block delimiter should be no more than a screen height in difference so that you may see the entire block without scrolling

16610
post	put
on the other hand where code may be edited in other editors which does not support auto formatting it is dangerous not to put braces as mentioned in other post

16659
getter	setter
as guidelines go i would be more concerned with avoiding side effects on getter and limiting side effects on setter

16671
put	get
there are many times that i let comments slip and then when i get more time put them in

16735
inherited	properties
in order for this to work i made a localizeddisplaynameattribute which inherited the â displaynameattributeâ and adds the following properties displaynameresourcename and displaynameresourcetype

16777
post	get
what is the difference between http get and http post

16844

mockups	balsamiq
edit toby s answer lead me to balsamiq and that is now my primary tool of choice for ui mockups to present to other people

16937
agile	sprint
in some agile places the team can have a fair degree of autonomy in deciding what gets put into a sprint which can be a piece of what a pm handles

16951
rss	feed
rss feed were early examples but these days you can write a client app that connects directly to twitter through their api so that the web site itself is never actually involved

16962
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups are usually the first port of call almost as quick as using a pen and paper and reusable

17147
post	put
i don t think i can put it any better than he did but my short summary of his post is this

17166
hex	binary
short answer it means the information is entered as text rather than binary or hex etc

17170
srp	principles
the srp is one of the simplest of the principles and one of the hardest to get right

17204
try-catch	exception-handling
i do java and the single most important thing to get is the exception-handling stack trace from the point of failure and the second most important to get the arguments passed on the way down in the stack trace but that requires careful programming with try-catch around all methods

17215
put	get
if you cut corners and put out a buggy product to suit them you re going to get the blame

17387
getter	setter
also this does lead to anaemic entities customer would be just a bunch of getter setter but sometimes that can be a simpler overall design

17394
implements	extends
it should be non-invasive - that is it should not force you to extends special classes or implements special interfaces

17439
google-chrome	firefox
a guess would be google-chrome or firefox or perhaps open office or an instant messenger client

17456
i2c	spi
besides the limited memory resources one of the aspects of embedded programming that is unlike other areas of software development is that the programmer is often dealing directly with the hardware at the register level -- either on the micro itself or in a peripheral attached to the micro via serial busses like uart spi or i2c

17605
cvs	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn
scm integration svn cvs git mercurial bazaar and darcs

17613
agile	greenhopper
i use jira and its associated agile greenhopper tool

17650
boost	stl
there are some great c++ libraries stl boost that will make your life easier but c++ is like php come on

17660
lisp	prolog
go find out why lisp prolog haskell are still in use and how things like f# are taking the concepts forward

17688
gauge	progress
however this timesheet is really only used to determine whether or not we ve reached milestone x by a given hour usage y so its more a general gauge of progress than anything else

17776
agile	sprint
in agile you can do sprint zero to generate a backlog of user stories and make some estimations

17823
queue	fifo
a much simpler version of a task pool can be realized by taking priority out of priority queue where you more or less have a fifo scheduler that keeps track of time and resources

17862
bison	lemon	bison	sablecc	sablecc	lemon
just because there s a reason not to use antlr bison coco r grammatica javacc lemon parboiled sablecc quex etc - that doesn t mean you should instantly roll your own parser+lexer

17915
int	chars
like normal variables pointers also are of same number of types like int chars or float

17916
clang	llvm
llvm clang is currently the default compilator on macosx xcode but it s not exactly the same releases than the llvm ones so beware of the minor differences mostly difference of version numbers

17994
imperative	declarative
fundamentally languages can be broken down into two types imperative languages in which you instruct the computer how to do a task and declarative languages in which you tell the computer what to do

18061
client-side	server-side
if you want it to be all java all the time you can use gwt and write both your client-side code and server-side code in java

18061
client-side	server-side
or if you d rather have it be all javascript you can pick something like ext js for the client-side and node.js for the server-side

18068
folder	directory
in this regard linux works better for me because the location of everything is much better standardized than on windows where for example you can find your settings almost anywhere in windows folder in your home folder in app s install directory in the registry etc

18131
getter	setter
however the same sort of thing would apply to large class files with several methods that do related things like getter setter database updates etc

18160
i2c	spi
you ll be using lots of serial busses like uart spi i2c and usb

18188
submit	submission
well if you only need to submit to the graders once then why do you need to use svn at all until the final submission

18345
folder	directory
unless you ll need more than 65534 folder per directory you should be okay apparently this is the maximum for ntfs

18459
put	get
get invalid cases out of the way first either simply exiting or raising exceptions as appropriate put a blank line in there then add the real body of the method

18513
lisp	scheme	lisp	prolog	scheme	prolog
they had unix machines with lisp scheme prolog smalltalk80 and a ton of other tools

18597
nhibernate	queryover
using l2s you basically have to revert to calling stored procedures in these cases whereas for example nhibernate has several api s linq provider queryover hql etc that can be used when you want more control over the generated sql

18648
postgresql	mysql
coming from a startup background this made no sense to me - why not use mysql or postgresql

18677
filesystems	ntfs
although it s been modified and update since if you were being fair about things ntfs would probably be called hpfs 2.0 or maybe 3.0 -- there s no question that microsoft s best current filesystems is still closely derived from what he designed

18718
lisp	scheme
currently it s lisp scheme to be specific to the point that i find myself writing out programming notes in it

18743
lisp	smalltalk
solutions can be submitted in a variety of programming languages from c c++ to javascript lisp smalltalk assembler + some 40 more

18776
altera	xilinx
ease of use is better in altera than xilinx however

18853
nfa	dfa
this is then converted into a nfa nondeterministic finite automaton which is in turn converted into a dfa deterministic finite automaton

18871
haskell	ocaml
initially i looked at haskell and couldn t make head or tail of it then tried ocaml but didn t get much further with that

18947
g++	gcc
read about gcc g++ flags for compiling linking shared static debug optimized 32 64-bit modes

18960
cvs	rcs
this is an artifact from the old days where files were versioned on an individual basis think rcs sccs and cvs where modern version control systems think in atomic commits and not individual files

19043
put	get
amazon is chock full of books about it and personally that s the way i d go as i think it s useful to have something you can dip back into every now and then rather than a course which can fade in the memory if you don t get to put it to use immediately

19070
int	double
numbers were either int or double even when you could have used other type

19070
int	boolean
boolean fields bit were int no reason

19163
post	get
there is a tipping point however in which if you could get people to post perhaps thru a required business process at some point the wiki would just take off as it would be this great repository of information

19174
gmail	hotmail
will it in anyway be a game changer from the existing layer of highly successful web based email clients such as hotmail gmail yahoo mail etc

19248
getter	setter
they are like transforming procedural code to use many getter and setter functions supposedly making it oo

19273
pascal	delphi
i never did anything in oberon but reading the page oberon for pascal developers i really did not like many of the changes as a delphi pascal developer for example

19343
mouse	keyboard
you can write a mouse or keyboard macro by hand or use the macro recorder

19343
mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard	joystick	keyboard
create hotkeys for keyboard joystick and mouse

19343
mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard	joystick	keyboard
remap keys and buttons on your keyboard joystick and mouse

19395
textarea	textbox
the other day there was a question on stackoverflow.com in which a person was attempting to convert a input textbox into a textarea once it reached a certain number of characters i think it was 10

19395
textarea	textbox
i suggested he retain textarea and forget the textbox altogether modifying only the attribute rows

19449
ironruby	ironpython
i don t want to go with ironpython and ironruby however sometime later i may dip hands to explore them

19641
vbscript	jscript
in one of my previous jobs before i left one of my tasks was to help with this document that contained various tidbits about the code base which was a mix of vbscript jscript and c c++ for the com parts in addition to various mark-up languages as this was for a dot-com after all

19730
vim	notepad++
if you re including vim then notepad++

19764
vim	emacs
i think only gnu smalltalk doesn t where i suspect they use emacs or vim

19783
vim	emacs
here are the main reasons i think eclipse is brilliant and i assume other ide s and do not switch to emacs and or vim

19783
vim	emacs
one of the arguments i hear is that with emacs vim you can create your own plugins - well ok but you can do that in eclipse too

19783
vim	emacs
why are people using emacs vim

19783
vim	emacs
what are the reasons to switch to vim emacs

19793
vim	emacs
knowing vim or emacs is a good thing if you ever have to login into a remote server and edit a config file or something similar

19800
erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme	lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
right now i have ruby python haskell common lisp scheme and erlang all hooked into emacs

19841
vim	emacs
both emacs and vim are very configurable and powerful editors and both provide big productivity wins once the basic concepts are grasped

19908
vim	emacs
why should i switch to vim or emacs

19908
vim	emacs
so if you want a more powerful text editor to use alongside eclipse then i would definitely recommend you learn either vim or emacs

19935
puts	gets
this gets all of the latest source puts up a maintenance page migrates the database sets up the new code gets all the dependencies stops starts everything etc

19974
getter	setter
for example it might generate a getter setter pair for you

19979
getter	setter
with getter and setter you don t always want both but how is the compiler interpreter to know that

19986
interpreted-language	compiled-language
they could sit somewhere in between compiled-language and interpreted-language

19992
pascal	delphi	ada	pascal	fortran	ada
example though i am a bit of an oddball in 25 years i ve actively used apl basic more varieties than i can remember fortran several variants c c++ pascal delphi ada and a bunch more i can t even remember

19993
getter	setter
i need to easily generate the getter setter the big try catch block i m happy if the ide can help me with the for each loop

19993
getter	setter
ruby getter + setter + variable for my_var

19993
getter	setter
java getter + setter + variable for myvar

19996
getter	setter
the ide can generate some code template for a getter setter and then i am free to add additional functionality to that getter setter as my requirements dictate

19996
getter	setter
if the getter setter was an integrated part of the language then if i ever wanted to customize the behaviour i d have to write the getter setter myself anyway.

19998
getter	setter
for getter setter that is true for java which i guess is what you are talking about since that language lacks properties as a language construct

20009
getter	setter
the groovy language does exactly this getter and setter are generated on the fly

20009
getter	setter
explicit getter and setter as generated by the ide make it a bit easier to follow the flow of the program

20031
getter	setter
your specific example - generating getter and setter certainly shows a language problem

20031
getter	setter
you should only be writing a getter setter if it does something - but if it s generic that doesn t mean you let the ide generate it it means you don t need it in the code at all

20031
getter	setter
ignoring temporarily that getter and setter are more than likely a sign of bad oo design

20163
post	get
every get or post variable used is accessed via a function that will provide it a default if it doesnt exist

20198
min	max
write code showing how you can get the max min from that list

20222
disk	ram
estimate relative access times to l1 cache l2 cache ram rotational disk not ssd

vb6	vba
also to lend further support to rewriting i have since found out that when the porting to .net began the vba vb6 code that existed was basically translated to the .net equivalent

20257
profiler	visualvm
the sun 6 jdk has visualvm which is a nice entry level profiler which can analyze already running programs which is a killer feature

20280
ironruby	ironpython
also microsoft have recently made all dlr code and libraries open source under the apache 2.0 license which has enabled mono to make use of languages like ironpython ironruby and f# has been made open source only last week

20406
post	get
also can you suggest some such sites where i can post such codes and get suggestions for improvements discuss the code with others

any time a perl python c++ or tcl program halts with an unhandled exception those language runtimes take care to register a non-zero exit code for the process

20605
post	get
anyhow my boss is watching my screen a bit so i had better stop this post before i have to use my stack overflow reputation to get me a new job.

hardware a starting point is going to be a single server with capable hardware - lots of ram multi-cpu system high performance disk multiple disk separate os swap and data disk multiple network cards lots of incoming connections

20751
apache	nginx
setup a reverse proxy it s much more efficient to have nginx serving pages to slow mobile connections than have a heavy apache process waiting idle for the response to finish

20816
observer-pattern	command-pattern
now ask them to redesign the system without using an observer-pattern if they mentioned it - they may choose to go for a chain of responsibility approach or perhaps a command-pattern

20876
versioning	upgrade
if you have enough power make later versioning of your software not quite compatible with their predecessors and don t offer upgrade discounts

20876
versioning	upgrade
you can fix a lot of them in the next versioning see above about slight incompatibilities no upgrade pricing and removing functionality

you might want to implement a garbage collector use a static pool in lieu of asking the kernel for each block or do your own profiling debugging

21116
entity-relationship	diagram
draw an entity-relationship diagram representing the sentences

21172
post	get
if you re releasing source code or other materials for others to re-use your original post is absolutely correct - you must include a warranty waiver otherwise someone might turn around and say you released this code claiming it did x y and z - but it doesn t and i m going to sue you even if you didn t get paid for it

21602
scheme	racket
i ended up chucking it getting started with plt scheme now racket which comes with a comparatively simple cross-platform ide a centralized package repository and fabulous docs including an intermediate tutorial specifically aimed at web development

21602
lisp	scheme
this means that you can either pick up scheme or learn common lisp through some other editor first lispworks personal probably

21624
haskell	ocaml
in addition to java i d suggest doing a few small projects in a lower level language c is a good one for this a scripting language i prefer perl but python is also a good choice a functional language lisp is the general recommendation here but ocaml and haskell are also good choices and at least get comfortable with reading an assembly language

21628
perl	tcl
bash tcl and perl or javascript allow the use of undefined variables

getter	setter
getter and setter are often criticized as being not proper oo

21802
getter	setter
on the other hand most oo code i ve seen has extensive getter and setter

21802
getter	setter
when are getter and setter justified

21802
getter	setter
if your favorite language has properties mine does then such things are also considered getter and setter for this question

21802
getter	setter
sources for getter setter criticism some taken from comments to give them better visibility

21802
getter	setter
to state the criticism simply getter and setter allow you to manipulate the internal state of objects from outside of the object

21802
getter	setter
the getter and setter made the code much more complicated without affording proper encapsulation

21802
getter	setter
because the internal state is accessible to other objects we don t gain a whole lot by adding these getter and setter

21803
getter	setter
the basic reason for getter and setter in java is very simple

21808
getter	setter
when i expect to diddle with the data later on a getter setter is justified

21808
getter	setter
also if change is happening i often push the data into a getter setter

21809
getter	setter
having getter and setter does not in itself break encapsulation

21809
getter	setter
what does break encapsulation is having a getter and a setter for every data member every field in java lingo

21821
ubuntu	linux
i also wanted to become more exposed to linux so i installed ubuntu and started working with java since then

21840
getter	setter
your question is when is a getter setter justified

21843
client-side	server-side
did sun decide to concentrate on the server-side and let client-side stagnate

21857
getter	setter
if getter and setter violate encapsulation and true oo then i m seriously in trouble

getter	setter
what do i do without getter and setter

21982
profiling	benchmarking
if an app seems to be dragging unexpectedly then i ll use a profiling and see what i can find and then if something can be improved i ll start benchmarking various ways i can think of to do something faster and then see how it scales up

21994
google-chrome	firefox
here i think eclipse has an advantage similar to firefox s advantage over google-chrome there are many more plug-ins available and developers are much more likely to write an eclipse plug-in than otherwise

21994
google-chrome	firefox
i use both google-chrome and firefox but some things google-chrome just can t handle

22054
ada	pascal
a good school will expose you to c or some other procedural language like pascal or ada then c++ and a assembly leaving you to learn java on your own as you pursue project capstone courses on your junior senior year

22054
ada	pascal
in summary if they don t teach you a procedural programming language be it an industrial one like c or ada or one good enough for teaching like pascal and they give you if c++ if you are lucky or java c# if you are unlucky i would look for another school

22106
vim	emacs
other than using emacs vim with ctags or cscope or both are there alternatives to c++ code navigation of an existing code base

22139
outputstream	inputstream
inputstream and outputstream

22284
put	get
then you all put your shoulder to the wheel and get the job done

22305
firefox	safari
but there s an update for firefox every other day apple updates safari more or less annually

22305
versioning	upgrade
with ie we ve had the situation arise where we have to support an old versioning because the it department of the company in question does not allow the employees to upgrade

22306
google-chrome	safari
despite google-chrome s rapid update schedule the rendering and interpretation stays pretty consistent thanks to the webkit engine which powers by both google-chrome and safari

22307
versioning	upgrade
chrome s new versioning adoption rate is really fast because of their automatic upgrade

22308
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari and others use webkit as the core see

22333
firefox	safari
this is pretty much true for safari which also uses webkit and firefox

22395
bazaar	trac	bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
basically is there a way to do this with git bazaar mercurialand still use svn trac as intended

22430
i2c	spi
that is generally when you are writing code to interface with the various peripherals serial busses like uart spi i2c or usb 8 and 16-bit timers clock generators and adcs and dacs

22564
srp	principles
you re likely breaking srp single responsibility principles

22656
width	height
clearly it s width height are 3 3 but what is it s second point

22676
width	height
i always liked defining a rectangle as a point + width and height where the point is the upper-left corner of the rectangle

22682
width	height
one corner point height and width

22682
width	height
centre point half height and width uncommon but sometimes useful

22682
width	height
bottomleft topright width height centre diagonal length etc

22683
width	height
in two dimensions storing a rectangle as two points is clearer than defining a particular corner and a width and height - consider negative width or height or the calculations required to determine each option from the other

22683
width	height
performing rotations on a rectangle defined by points is also much simpler than one defined with a point plus width and height

22694
width	height
also some apis such as wcf s rect structure define a rectangle as x y width height which could then cause confusion over what 1 2 3 4 means

22728
width	height
simple syntax for properties xmin xmax ymin ymax width height so that the user does not need to know the exact choice of parameters

22728
floating-point	integer
note in order to minimize loss of precision during scaling transform it is sometimes appropriate to implement a second rect class that uses floating-point coordinates so that intermediate results can be stored accurately in a sequence of transforms and only rounded to integer in the last step

22745
put	get
it is just stupidly easy for me to put something together using code igniter i get it done quickly and get it out the door

22754
pull	push
additionally in an environment where you have several branches feeding a main repository if everyone follows the always pull before you commit or push the ci server might be a little over kill

22775
wordpress	joomla
definitely go with a well-known cms like drupal wordpress or joomla

22785
int	chars
it is strongly typed you can not accidentally mix bool chars int and float values

22944
ubuntu	debian
this means a maintained yum installation site or - for debian ubuntu an apt-get repository - so that updates are automatic

22999
free	malloc
so you re going to have to become familiar with malloc and free

23074
jsf	seam
for the last five years or so i ve mainly developed web applications in java jsf seam etc.

23146
hash	salt
and yes the passwords are going to be salt and hash

23166
hash	salt
you can t do this because you don t know what the passwords are so you can t compare them because all that you store is the hash of the password and a salt which you can store next to the hash password

23196
post	get
it doesn t take a long time to post a tweet probably less than it would take to get up walk to the water cooler and strike up a brief chat with a coworker

23241
client-side	server-side
the main difference between less and other css precompilers being that less allows real-time compilation via less.js by the browser. less can run on the client-side and server-side or can be compiled into plain css.

23270
ubuntu	linux
my main development os is windows 7 but i ve used linux and i currently dual-boot with ubuntu

23299
versioning	upgrade
but i ve upgrade big sites from 2.0 to 3.5 admittedly not a huge change between those two versioning without issue

23299
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade any project or solution that was last saved in an older versioning

23321
put	get
at the very least you will have something else to put in your resume but that really is not the best thing you will get out of it

23396
post	get
complexity rest demands much less in terms of setup it s just get post after all

23411
int	double
try out every primitive type int double string etc

23449
put	get
not only get but also put and delete should be exactly the same result if applied once or several times you re free of returning a 404 if already deleted or no change if the client is putting the same

23468
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
naturally their ie gpu enhanced lovely demos didn t quite work so nice on other html 5 browsers such as the latest google-chrome of firefox beta or opera

23502
versioning	upgrade
in the later versioning of visual studio you can upgrade the solution to vs10 and still target a previous framework

23513
rss	feed
read books tutorials articles blogs rss feed etc

23729
google-chrome	safari
normal browsing - on safari or google-chrome mac os x

23748
sse	avx
also array alignment w.r.t cache lines and sse avx boundaries is important to the generation and execution of efficient loops

23748
sse	avx
sse avx loads and stores can be utilized

24053
put	get
generics is the mechanism allowing a list to contain strings instead of naked objects where the compiler enforces that an item to be put into the the list is a string and it knows that when you get an item out of a list it is a string

24095
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
enhanced for each loops the for-loop syntax is extended with special syntax for iterating over each member of either an arrays or any iterable such as the standard collection classes using a construct of the form

24095
versioning	upgrade
upgrade of jaxb to versioning 2.0 including integration of a stax parser

24095
sorting	filtering
many gui improvements such as integration of swingworker in the api table sorting and filtering and true swing double-buffering eliminating the gray-area effect

24316
submit	submission
a might then be a way of drawing their eye to an important field that will be posted on form submission even though no action is technically required for the form to submit

24393
post	get
another use is converting get post data into appropriate types for a database

24469
put	get
that personal chef can put in so many touches that while yes it is expensive some people tend to believe you pay for what you get and want lots of little things that they do pay but they may be happy in the end

24482
mongodb	bson
classified as a nosql database mongodb eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of json -like documents with dynamic schemas mongodb calls the format bson making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster.

24543
lisp	scheme
it looks like you ve done your homework so you probably already know this but scheme is a dialect of lisp just like common lisp is

24543
lisp	scheme
if you like a lot of things about scheme but don t like its academic nature try common lisp

24544
scheme	racket
if you want to explore a really kick-ass dialect of scheme have a look at racket

24550
haskell	scheme
if you were interviewing at a blub shop and the developers just thought you were weird because of your proficiency at scheme or haskell or f# you probably wouldn t want to work there

24550
lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
i ve written some in scheme f# emacs lisp and common lisp and read at least a bit of haskell at least occasionally over the last few years

24556
put	get
but put it through convert and you get a nan

24560
cpython	pypy
this byte code can be interpreted official cpython or jit compiled pypy
