imperative	declarative
they have a place and don t necessarily need to be abandoned but most inline comments can be obviated by favouring a declarative coding style over an imperative style and using descriptive meaningful variable and member names

49601
folder	directory
however when i clone from github first i need to clone the repo and this goes into my default git directory c git as git cloned-project-name i then need to import this git repo as a project into my workspace and i end up with workspace cloned-project-name effectively duplicating the project folder in the git area

boost	stl
i m doing tdd using stl and boost etc

49873
ubuntu	linux
personally i ve found linux in the form of ubuntu very useful because it allows me to easily create and maintain things like a database server a mail server a test web server and much more in virtual machines without having to consider license costs plus the server versions require less resources than windows

50037
pull	push
in general i believe it may be helpful to pull information about the various candidates from the available news sources and media rather than allowing them to push the info they want

50227
hash	salt
when adding salt values to a hash value for something like a password that cannot be stored in plain text what is the best place to get the salt values come from

50232
getter	setter
nowadays there s very little excuse for using them when you can generate a getter setter pair with a click of the mouse

50235
getter	setter
no reason to create a getter and setter for every field when they are all public anyhow

50247
hash	salt
use a decent size salt - a good value is the block size of the underlying hash algorithm might be sha-256

if you want to create a diagram like the one you linked to then you need to find a chen erd shape pack

51082
lisp	scheme
lisp and dialects such as scheme common lisp and clojure haven t gained much industry support even though they are quite decent programming languages

51085
erd	diagram
i ve used it before and it does an adequate job my advice is to break your erd down into logical sections and don t diagram more than ten tables at a time unless you have access to an e-size plotter

51085
erd	entity-relationship
i don t think i ve ever reverse-engineered an erd that was comprehensible at first even with big-name tools like erwin and entity-relationship studio

51155
getter	setter
functionality - some simple bits of functionality that are non-trivial a bunch of getter setter wouldn t show that you know anything

51189
boost	stl
tdd stl and boost are all good things to mention

51306

i ve used salt + md5 hash to encrypt passwords and i tell webservers to use ssl

51406
hash	salt
you don t need to know anything but the very basics about cryptography what s a hash what s a salt roughly how hard it is to crack this encryption or that and so on but you have to know a fair bit about security in general

something functional haskell or lisp would be my first choice but maybe erlang

51447
lisp	prolog
lisp and prolog teaches students a whole new way to think which is imporant even if they never use either of these in the real world

51496
mockups	balsamiq
go spend usd75 on a balsamiq mockups desktop edition

mockups	balsamiq
the font used in balsamiq unconsciously reminds you that this is just a mockups not set in stone which helps you in rad

51528
salt	md5
they can simply salt and md5 their passwords to keep them safe

51528

disk	ram
it got to be so annoying i paid 500 for a 2mb yes megabyte memory expansion board so i could load all of the files into a ram disk

51722

i can use bootcamp to run a windows os natively or use parallels to run it in a vm

51733
kate	gedit
on ubuntu the major options are gedit kate and eclipse

51733
kate	gedit
kate is flaky i ve lost lots of data eclipse is very heavyweight so i mostly stick with gedit

51733
kate	textwrangler
xcode is powerful and textwrangler rocks as a free app that combines all the best features of kate and meld

51733
kate	gedit
and in the last ten years neither has crashed in a way that lost my edits which i can t say of either kate or gedit

51777

of course between vmware parallels and bootcamp you can just run windows on the mac also

51869
feedback	review
you may find he she has bad programming habit such as using magic numbers duplicate code excessive variables the list goes on.. and you want to provide some feedback to help improve the developers coding skills but i ve have the above theree questions in mind and try to steer people towards that in my own review

51869
feedback	review
you obviously want the feedback of your code review to be valuable and carry across to other developers

51985
agile	metrics
the principles are similar to those in scrum and other agile methodologies with a slightly different focus and different tools and metrics

52069
tax	shipping
i think the reasoning is two fold for placing the shipping handling tax etc as calculated fields on the header

52069
tax	shipping
if i was presenting a run of the mill ui shipping hanlding tax are generally summed values displayed as part of the order totalling process

52069
tax	shipping
if i was to give my opinion as to which route is best i d go with a normalized approach of providing the shipping handling tax and other fees as line items to cut down any calculated fields on the order header

52124
lisp	scheme
i believe they use scheme or some other dialect of lisp

52132
versioning	upgrade
we are using ruby on rails which provides versioning of data migration upgrade and rollback

52173
disk	ram
chances are the bottlenecks which will hamper system performance lie with ram clockspeed and throughput and the hard disk

52173
disk	ram
it ll be difficult to write a simple script which you can remmber off by heart which will accurately test the capabilities of a system bearing in mind you ll be wanting to do fully random reads writes read-writes to both ram and the hard disk

erlang	lisp
i have dabbled with other functional languages f# haskell erlang but haven t felt the draw that lisp has given me

52697
minix	linux
i use and have used linux in production for 16 years and love it but since it s a production quality highly-tuned system it is much more baroque to understand the source and minix is much more accessible and straightforward for teaching these concepts

52724
verilog	vhdl
li probably a hardware definition language like verilog or vhdl

52771
daemons	systemd
systemd programmers write daemons utilities and other tools for automating common or difficult tasks

trac	bugzilla
bugzilla trac or others are good but they all require hardware installation and configuration before use and maintenance is definitely a non-zero expense

53003
accessor	properties
on a very basic level what s the difference between a struct and a pure data class one that has no functionality apart from properties accessor

53087
observer-pattern	command-pattern
many of the classic gof patterns can be implemented with delegates for example command-pattern visitor pattern strategy pattern factory pattern and observer-pattern can often be implemented with a simple delegate

53138
trac	bugzilla
depending on the project you can get by fine with writing bugs down on paper maintaining a list through a shared online document or using free bug tracking software such as trac or bugzilla

53262
client-side	server-side
do you use both client-side and server-side validation techniques side by side when validating input from a user via a contact form

53349
disk	ram
after that more ram will help as will a solid state disk

53353
put	get
they will just put junk into the newly required field becasue they can t get the data in

53357
lotus	sametime
the three companies i worked for all three fortune-10 companies respectively had jabber lotus sametime and msn communicator used extensively installed by default

53386
ant	maven
the bottom line is that you might have a more direct comparison between ant and make automake--but not maven

53387
postgresql	mysql
i use django sqlite3 browsers and ocassionaly only if i have no choice i install postgresql mysql apache or any other servers commonly used in the internets

53387

in college i just wanted to get lisp and scheme as far into the rearview mirror as possible and never look back

54114
cruisecontrol	teamcity
now not only are you versioning your code but your specifications and your continuous integration tool think teamcity cruisecontrol hudson etc is enforcing that all specifications are still valid on every build.

54121
client-side	server-side
web programming by it s very nature forces you to separate business logic back-end server-side programming from ui programming client-side html or javascript because the two exist in entirely different spheres of programming

54152
client-side	server-side
in layman s terms client-side code is run on your computer in your web browser and server-side code is run on a computer on the internet and the results of the server-side computation are then sent over the internet to your browser

54159
easymock	jmockit
in fact i got the idea from steve maguire s writing solid code where he discusses this exact idea on pages 228-231 saying that such facilities were common in microsoft code of that early-90 s era. however i m only familiar with easymock and jmockit for java and neither afaik have this function or something similar with different syntax

54204
put	get
it will take one or two employees to get caught before any one will put anything on their work computer

54335
postgresql	mysql
in that case php pdo library makes handling the response from a mysql or postgresql database the same

54335
postgresql	mysql
since mysql is mostly used as a datastore - moving to postgresql would give you the oracle power that you could slowly add into your app where you need it

54343
postgresql	mysql
see this question at so for extensive comparisons of postgresql to mysql that say it better than i can

54350
postgresql	mysql
mysql lacks true sequences they use auto-increment - postgresql sequences allow multiple tables to use a single sequence so you can guarantee cardinality across multiple tables

54350
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is acid compliant mysql is partially compliant

54350
postgresql	mysql
postgresql implements character varying and text in the same manner toast tables - this approach most would argue is better than mysql

54350
perl	tcl
postgres allows server-side functions written in tcl python r and perl

54350
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has good support for asynchronous drivers in python - i think it s a bit hit or miss with mysql

54370
cvs	svn	folder	directory
the only way i ve thought of doing this so far is to use svn to track the existing files and use mercurial cvs git or some other version control to track my new files so in the directory i m working in i d have both a .svn and .hg folder

54678
postgresql	mysql
integrates with the web server software such as apache iis etc and database server software such as mysql postgresql ms sql server

54700
folder	directory
make copies of the production directory into folder with the current date time

54700
folder	directory
replicate the build dropping folder to production directory

54700
robocopy	xcopy
both xcopy and robocopy allow skipping files

54718
int	double
it is easy to make one for classes you define in c++ with operator overloading and i believe such thing is possible also in java but when talking about primitive types such as int double and so on you ll have to use library function like math.power and usually have to cast both to double

54724
int	double
sure you could do this for double and floats but not int but why make the language inconsistent for a rarely used feature

54759
post	get
once in a post interview while talking to a human resources representative i noted that while i had a favorable impression of everyone i talked to and they seemed like a good group to work with it was an interview so everyone is likely on their best behavior and you really don t get to know people until you have been working with them for awhile

54826
agile	scrummaster
since it only requires a two days ass-to-chair course to become a scrummaster i d say that the thing that makes a better scrummaster is actual experience from agile projects

54870
switching	screens
if you are on a phone screens with someone and they are having problems then maybe just switching over to easier questions or give them one more before wrapping things up and saying you will be in touch

54884
vxworks	threadx
the same functionality was ported from a threadx device to a vxworks device to a linux device with good speed though this might have been due to rhapsody s nice platform agnostic framework rather than case specifically

55069
direct3d	directx
moreso because the bindings for opengl and directx are aimed at c++ altho im pretty sure you can do just as much direct3d stuff in c#

55076
integer	unsigned
if it s an integer is it signed or unsigned

55113
put	get
in the implementations i ve seen there a set of unit tests with missing values and the user has to put them in to get the test to pass

postgresql	mysql
say get another server running postgresql or mysql and start translating your schema to that db while your oracle is running

55205
postgresql	mysql
qa the hell out of your postgresql or mysql server and then start to run that server live and kill the oracle one

55205
postgresql	mysql
i suggest using postgresql over mysql

55205
postgresql	mysql
mysql is own by oracle and it s gimped as hell compare to oracle or postgresql

if you love fishing put together a website to accept post from fellow anglers about their favorite fishing spots and look into what s required for adding google maps integration add a fish database and so on

55284
lisp	scheme
i came across scheme and common lisp as the 2 most prevalent dialects and wanted your opinion as to which is the most favored useful one to learn - and would be immensely gratified if you can suggest any resources for a rank beginner to start from

55290
lisp	scheme
i rather like scheme if you want to work with the jvm you should check out clojure which is a lisp that is designed to work in the jvm

55320
lisp	scheme
traditionally scheme is a fairly academic dialect of lisp and common lisp was the industry dialect

in an object oriented approach create two separate functions for both the operations make them private protected and have a public method call the two in sequence

55553
for-loop	loops
for example if there s a for-loop add in a print statement for loops counter

55767
pascal	delphi
delphi pascal language don t allow multiline strings without using concatenation

i would recommend model view presenter mvp

55975
put	get
put a proper plan for them in motion and make it fun get involved with them all the way as i said having a proper sit down with them each week helps a lot simply letting them shadow you is not enough when they shadow you ask for feedback from them how would they solve the problem

haskell	scheme
why don t you write yourself a scheme using haskell

often the leaders of these different areas will help promote good ideas or ideas they recognize for promise and often linked to a more complete thought via a blog post and from those promoted retweets you ll get a sense of what to pursue further

56384
width	height
almost all monitors have an aspect ratio where width is much bigger than the height and yet almost all websites are designed exactly for the other way round

56425
width	height
this means that the browser window will have a small width and a big height

56425
portrait	landscape
in the first case you may notice that most websites are not optimized neither for portrait nor for landscape mode

56425
portrait	landscape
in the second case if you are viewing the page in full-screen mode on a 24 inch screen there are chances that this website will be displayed correctly in portrait as well as in landscape mode

56428
portrait	landscape
why do we print paper in portrait mode when landscape is a perfectly viable option as well

getter	setter
even if each of these variables were to have both a getter and a setter

57491
getter	setter
i tend to quickly lose interest in a project every time i need to have a variable in a class that could have simply been declared public instead of private with a getter and a setter

57491
getter	setter
or could i declare some variables public whenever they require both a getter and a setter

57494
getter	setter
if all you are doing is making private variables and using getter and setter you might want to think about why you are doing this

57494
getter	setter
there are a lot of people who say that getter and setter are evil see this article or this article by alan holub

57494
getter	setter
getter and setter unless

57494
getter	setter
getter setter methods often make their

57501
getter	setter
there is a very good reason to use getter and setter in java instead of having public fields

57502
getter	setter
write a small script that will take a java source fill find all the public vars convert them to private and write the getter and setter for you

57505
accessor	properties
java differently from other languages like ruby differentiate between direct access to a properties and acces to a properties through accessor mutators

57505
getter	setter
that said i recently came accross a library called lombok which allows me to write just the properties and it ll generate the getter setter on-the-fly

having to use both mouse and keyboard for this task is bad and sadistic.

57620
submit	submission
with the ios sdk you re able to submit apps to apple for submission to the app store using a gm version

57670
lisp	smalltalk
some ways that the output can include works created by a third party would be that you ve linked to third party libraries wizards might have done this for you you used a compiler that injects proprietary code into the output there are a number of legitimate reasons that compilers may do this or your final program output is a virtual machine image that incorporates other people s work this tends to happen with image-based languages like lisp and smalltalk

post	get
you re going to have many more interview ahead of you and since you re genuinely interested in the subject evidenced by your post here you can only get better at them

58710
put	get
if you come up with a better algorithm after the interview is over then it s just something you can put in the back of your mind should you ever get a similar question

58732
lisp	smalltalk
can be done in smalltalk and in lisp

58797
folder	directory
since i m stuck in the filesystem paradigm i know that i could put all those into a single folder directory but what if they already exist in disparate directory and they need to stay there

59006
hgrc	hgignore	pull	push
in tortoisehg i pull push commit merge update tag rollback backout import export revert edit hgignore and hgrc files watch the history graph guess copy renames and bisect

59021
redmine	trac
trac redmine etc.

59024
put	get
iirc the application packager that shipped with vb could package up your app the vb runtime and latest common controls dlls and supply you a standalone exe installer that you could put on a cd and get to customers

59275
put	get
i do know what you mean most of the code i write on a daily basis is just standard vb.net get the data from the sql server put it on the form save it back to the database make some reports

59277
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
if it is you should be able to use monodevelop or sharpdevelop to program your app

59324
put	get
i don t think i ve ever met a developer who thinks their coding can t be improved but something tells me these guys would be about as far from rockstar as you can get - to put it mildly

59342
put	get
if you get enough orders to make a port worth it put in the time otherwise refund them and you now have proof not enough people care to make it worthwhile

59372
hash	md5
you have probably seen md5 or sha hash before it looks quite similar to this

59504
collabnet	svn
subversion sometimes called svn is an open source version control system founded by collabnet inc

59613
serializable	deserialization
dynamic typing is very useful for serializable and deserialization but for most other things it really doesn t contribute much of an advantage

59635
int	double
in designing a layout what s important is that a certain number is a vertical measurement on the page not whether it s int unsigned float or double

59664
solaris	bsd
think about the number of applications the average linux user interacts with daily that are written in c or c++ and run not only on windows and linux but also macos bsd solaris etc

59664
debian	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian
actually making the packages is not really all that hard and most of the major distributions are using either debian packages debian ubuntu etc. or rpms fedora suse centos mandrake so it s very minor to modify some scripts to produce multiple packages from a baseline .deb and a baseline .rpm and for everyone else just throw up a tarball with binaries and a readme people will figure out how to get it installed

59670
ubuntu	linux
you need only maintain a small handful of packages -- say perhaps ubuntu fedora and a single lsb-compatible tarball -- and the various linux communities will take up the rest of the work

59804
mouse	keyboard
ergonomic wireless keyboard mouse

59872
cvs	svn
if you re coming from the cvs svn module it was common to have a structured single repository which could compose of multiple repositories for a number of projects

59931
for-loop	loops
take a biginteger or equivalent stick it in a similar for-loop using both idioms make sure the inside of loops doesn t get optimized away and time them both

59955
super	extends
the proxy extends the original class and weaves the aspect before handing back to the super class

59964
put	get
in larger companies these functions are put into silos lines of management but to get things done you generally need the time of someone from all of them

59992
getter	setter
as for properties getter setter methods i usually use private protected variables to store their state plus getter setter methods

59992
accessor	properties
in the constructor i assign default values to the properties state fields without calling the accessor

60009
postgresql	mysql
for the database you could use mysql postgresql google app engine s python or java datastore etc

i am starting to learn scheme by the sicp videos and i would like to move to common lisp next

60025
forth	smalltalk
the same applies to haskell ml o caml forth smalltalk ...

60030
udp	tcp
for example tcp udp and dns are all built into linux unix and windows and are made available to the programmer through low-level system apis

60043
clisp	ecl
cl on the other hand has some very nice high performance or specific-use implementations high performace sbcl commercial allegro embedded ecl portable clisp java abcl ...

60055
ready	each
since you comment that most of the code is in your head and you are ready to dive in and program using this approach may help you focus on each section without your mind becoming clouded by the system as a whole

60172
scheme	racket
fortunately there are scheme implementations racket that do not have that limitation

60189
jboss	glassfish
later you can use it standalone as an alternative to tomcat glassfish or jboss for when you want to host your web application

60255
put	get
this is an attempt to understand the elements i need to put in place to get a start on this

60331
hide	show
as they are looking for talent they will show you all the good sides and hide those bad facts

60334
scheme	prolog
there have been many variations on the basic concept going by different names like prolog scheme etc

60521
post	get
from the web design the skeleton is mainly handled by the web browser combined with the web server which manage application states each page could be compared to a state which in some way wrap the whole application and give you access to the basic informations like the post and get variables and many others

60643
x86	64bit
the platform is windows does tfs run on anything else and the intended use is version control through visual studio 2008 2010 with the scope for continuous integration on x86 or 64bit build servers depending on the product

60742
sdp	turn
the only correlation that comes to my mind is that low quality sdp can result in more bugs which in turn reduce overall product quality

60763
ravendb	couchdb
i have been looking at a number of document databases ravendb couchdb mongodb and there are two things about them that i really like and makes me what to incorporate them as much as possible and that is the schema-less natural not that they are schema-less per-say but that it is a very flexible schema that is much easier to change than ones with rdbms and the fact there is a lot less impedance mismatch when mapping the database data to code

60843
clang	llvm
svn because llvm clang use it and i am following the project

60872
sorting	filtering
that result set is processed with a ruby script that does the sorting and filtering necessary to obtain a file that looks like this

60945
resharper	justcode
we work with justcode because we re already using the teleirk components so it was a natural fit but we ve found that using some form of analysis and refactoring tool like this or like resharper or coderush which have already been mentioned is a significant development boost and well worth the investment

60958
subtraction	addition
you need to learn some basic concepts first addition subtraction ... then move on to more complex topics algebra calculus

60978
imperative	declarative
querying data and settings with a declarative language like sql is much more natural than traversing flat files or other objects in memory with imperative syntax

60992
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
such as jboss tomcat websphere glassfish weblogic

61080
postgresql	mysql
the process of actually winning the contracts was always painful and i was tasked with explaining why use mysql and not mssql or postgresql or oracle 11g why use php and not a compiled language or asp.net or java and the list goes on

61116
arp	tcp
you should start by reading the following documents rfc 2616 http 1.1 rfc 793 tcp rfc 791 ip and rfc 826 arp

61143
client-side	server-side
models are used on both the client-side and server-side for validation

61215
xquery	schematron	xquery	xproc	xslt	xquery	xslt	schematron	xproc	schematron
you can query an xml database with xquery transform the results with xslt as xhtml or atom get atom or other xml format from other web services get xml from users using xforms validate it with xmlschema relax ng or schematron process it with xproc save it back to the database with xquery update

61235
haskell	ocaml
even previously pure functional languages like ocaml and haskell include enough procedural through monads and oo features to let you do anything

61235
erlang	ocaml	haskell	ocaml
the dominating syntaxes today are those of more readable as opposed to easily writable languages like c c++ c# java objective-c scala go iml css javascript and also python pascal fortran 90+x smalltalk ruby ml miranda ocaml haskell erlang and sgml html xml

61257
persistent	transient
transient or persistent endpoints

61327
mouse	trackpad
exchanging a mouse for a trackpad is fun to them

61345
width	height
why not just have one type of element- an inline element where you can also apply custom height width and use that

61456
perl	tcl
if you want to read a serious comparison between some different programming languages check the paper an empirical comparison of c c++ java perl python rexx and tcl

61490
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors from the log.

61555
public	protected
public members are obviously exposed by default however private and protected members are not

61599
versioning	upgrade
since october over 60 000 people have upgrade to or downloaded the versioning of this application with iads

61739
vim	emacs
there are so many keystrokes saved once you can utilise emacs or vim to a decent extent

61739
mouse	keyboard
moving my hand between the keyboard and mouse annoys me.

61740
mouse	keyboard
for me i can edit files much faster in vi as i don t have to take my hands off of the keyboard to move a mouse around

61742
vim	emacs
and while vi was getting kind of hoary vim has rejuvenated it and if anything it s growing feature-wise at least faster than emacs

61757
put	get
well they re generally pretty code-as-we-go so when i put time aside to do design spec documents and such like i tend to get oh

61780
vim	textmate
the only other editors i ever considered seriously were vim and textmate

61794
pascal	delphi
pascal several varieties including delphi

61795
vim	emacs
wouldn t it be nice if i could plug in my standard vim into emacs or code blocks but having the rest of the ide around it

61826
vim	emacs
i think the ide s visual studio eclipse intellij are fit to solve another class of problems than the ones you solve with emacs vim

61826
vim	emacs
however as soon as you have to work regularly in a terminal environment on unix-servers for example or you re using lots of different languages no ide can measure against the qualities vim emacs

61826
vim	emacs
one last thing is that working using vim emacs forces you to understand at least a bit of a platform language before using it

61826
vim	emacs
so using vim emacs will force yourself to gain some insight in what you re really doing

61827
csv	tsv
text can also be a list of numbers text can also be csv s tsv s and what not

61945
put	get
in particular the people who are importing data from another system might get tasked to put them on prod before launch if the dataload is going to take a long time

61950
hide	show
in mvvm the code to show and hide dialog is done in the viewmodel presenter

61984
vim	emacs
i have heard a lot of people praise vim and emacs for greatly increasing efficiency once the basics are nailed down

61984
vim	emacs
however...it seems that you would really have to be some sort of wizard of macros and hotkeys to be as efficient in vim or emacs as the average developer is in visual studio netbeans eclipse or other platforms

61984
vim	emacs
i know vim and emacs can do a lot of the same things very powerfully that vs can like intellisense refactoring etc. and it may be able to do some or all of the examples that i provided but is it realistic to say that someone working on these platforms would actually benefit from vim or emacs

61987
put	get
when it comes to programming you actually need to get out there and put what you ve learned into practice

61991
vim	emacs
but is it realistic to say that someone working on these platforms would actually benefit from vim or emacs

62048
floating-point	fixed-point
i think your are talking about floating-point numbers and fixed-point numbers

62048
hex	binary
all of this is just as true for binary or hex fractions as it is for decimals

62050
integer	fractions
a fixed-precision value is just an integer with a commonly assumed fixed scaling factor 1 2 n meaning that a fixed number of bits n from that integer will be considered as the number s fractions part

62125
integer	fractions
because math with floating point numbers is so much slower than dealing with discrete integer numbers you can simulate fractions values using integer numbers

62125
fixed-point	fractions
with fixed-point numbers we sacrifice magnitude so that we can keep our precision and gain fractions

62125
multiplying	addition
two times pi can be accomplished using simple integer addition as pi + pi 0003 1416 + 0003 1416 0006 2832 but what happens when we multiplying pi 0003 1416 by 2 0002 0000

62164
cvs	svn
on the flip side when i code with other developers having systems such as cvs svn git and following the conventions of a framework are invaluable

62169
children	parent
less likely to need family crisis related leave due to both less likelyhood of having children and having younger parent

62248
haskell	scheme
if you don t have any prior programming experience or your experience is in a language like scheme or haskell it may take you a week or so to pick up the syntax

62255
getter	setter
in all other places i use properties .net or setter and getter for classes that don t have properties

62268
vmware	virtualbox
if you aren t doing graphics heavy stuff then running msvc in vmware or virtualbox is fine if you have lots of ram then you can have admin in the virtual environment and their install is locked down

62383
getter	setter
easier to use than writing getter and setter methods

62383
getter	setter
getter and setter method pairs are a code smell

62383
getter	setter
objects that contain only state for persistence shouldn t be using getter setter and should be creating immutable objects at the time of persistence

62389
bazaar	git
you don t need to spend time configuring a server if you use a distributed source control system like git mercurial or bazaar

62394
getter	setter
getter and setter method pairs are a code smell

62395
getter	setter
they re totally different things although two kinds of methods commonly written - getter and setter - correspond to properties

62395
getter	setter
since comparing properties with methods in general is not meaningful i ll assume you meant to talk about getter setter

62395
getter	setter
getter and setter method pairs are a code smell

62395
getter	setter
not necessarily i d argue but either way this isn t a matter of getter setter vs

62395
getter	setter
is there a setter for this getter

62427
ati	nvidia
it was first released in 1995 when the world had much more than nvidia and ati directx vs opengl

62428
jrebel	hotswap
latest attempts from community to solve this problem are davinci hotswap project jrebel playframework

62489
getter	setter
back then they were only regular getter and setter - and were defined only by the naming convention - and this did indeed smell

62534
getter	setter
if the underlying setter or getter code changes to add significantly to processing required to set or get the state then really it s no longer a property and you should replace it with methods

62534
getter	setter
putting too much how much is too much depends code in a setter or getter is wrong but just because it s possible is not a reason to throw out the pattern in all cases

62604
getter	setter
when you use c# s property syntax the compiler quietly creates getter and setter methods with metadata that tells languages that understand properties as a first-class syntactical feature to treat them as such

62604
getter	setter
a few languages that can be run on the clr don t completely hide this detail from you boo if memory serves me and some lisp implementations and you can call the getter and setter explicitly

62604
getter	setter
now the broader question is whether getter and setter methods are in fact a good thing

62604
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
and it s quite possible that you ll risk violating the law of demeter using mutators methods whether called properties or getter setter methods

62604
getter	setter
as allen holub s article says just because getter and setter have problems doesn t mean you should never use them

62604
getter	setter
rolling presentation code into your business objects isn t necessarily the right way to avoid getter setter either

62611
flask	django
i m learning python and i wanted to advance my skills a bit further so i decided to learn django then moved on to flask before realizing that i was having difficulties understanding the very concept of web-frameworks

62693
haskell	ocaml
but marketing is very important and haskell does it better than lisp or ocaml and competes for the same userbase

62693
haskell	ocaml
this type of programmer is a large percentage of the programming population so this further limits the possible userbase of abstract languages like lisp haskell and ocaml

62704
haskell	ocaml
in the while other languages like haskell got a better compiler due to a different community approach i suppose and now ocaml speed of execution is not so great as in the past

62809
jboss	weblogic
that doesn t include the space needed to install oracle weblogic 5 jboss instances ides office software operating system etc

62819
vim	emacs
i doubt there are many who use vim or emacs exclusively any more

62821
gauge	progress
for what concerns quantity tracking progress of a programmer is notoriously difficult even if for the simple reason that it s difficult to gauge progress in the creation of a program

62843
grit	rugged
git grit rugged other

62851
filesystems	ntfs
please don t forget the 20 overhead that ntfs or other journaling filesystems assuming windows here needs to have room for journaling and keeping the hard drive healthy

62969
onenote	ms-office
functionally onenote easily integrates ms-office documents screenshots can have links to external sources and the like

62985
post	get
you re post ing data to the web server you re not asking to get

63033
composite	memento	composite	command-pattern	command-pattern	memento
you d probably eventually hear enough to recognize command-pattern the composite pattern the memento pattern and a few others with even a short conversation

63059
ready	each
this solves both of your problems - it allows each bug to be tracked individually and they really should be in a complex feature and it also lets you clearly know if the feature is ready to ship or not

63090
pascal	delphi
the original code was 100 000 lines of delphi a pascal variant

63090
lisp	scheme
i included lisp and scheme in the mix

63090
lisp	scheme
during the audition we looked at a variety of lisp and scheme implementations

63090
bigloo	gambit
on the scheme side we looked at i believe bigloo chicken chez gambit

63090
lisp	scheme
having produced somewhat significant chunks of code in both lisp and scheme here are some compare and contrast points

63090
lisp	scheme
having said that scheme s syntax-case is far more subtle and complicated than any one thing in lisp

63090
for-loop	loops
first it allows individual developers to be more effective--but it s more difficult for developers to grok each other s code because the signposts that most languages have for loops are missing in scheme there are a million ways to do a for-loop

63090
lisp	scheme
to sum it up i think i d say lisp and scheme offer some capabilities not widely available anywhere else

63090
lisp	scheme
in our case the determining factors between whether to go with lisp or scheme had more to do with very fundamental features platform support platform threads run-time compilation run-time licensing than they did with language or library features

63090
lisp	scheme
also just to reiterate we looked at the various lisp and scheme a long time ago

63117
for-loop	loops
this loops requires you to perform your own increment logic so it is more flexible than a for-loop

63209
subtraction	addition
doing any kind of date arithmetic addition subtraction directly on a unix epoch time integer for example

63210
ubuntu	linux
i can install ubuntu linux in about the same time and effort as windows 7 windows 7 needs me to additionaly add a licence key making it slightly more difficult

63221
inherited	properties
you will finally understand oo design by contract inherited c# properties and much more

63299
mvp	presenter
the most popular is the mvc mvp approach model-view-controller presenter

63328
mapquest	directions
some may have used mapquest or google maps to find a place and then follow the directions given

63364
bazaar	git
i think the learning curve is much lighter for bazaar than git and bazaar has more structured support for different vcs layouts than git

63364
bazaar	svn
that means you can use bazaar a lot like svn and even use an svn repo as the remote repo for a local bazaar repo

63433
datalist	repeater
or using asp.net with template bound controls datalist repeater rather than figuring out how to rearchitect things with an asp.net mvc approach

63435
int	chars
good values are a happy path normal value a zero or empty value nulls a very small value a 1-character string the int 1 etc. a very large or very long value and strange values specific to the type unicode chars for strings negative numbers for int etc.

63471
datalist	repeater
controls datalist repeater rather

63487
httprequest	httpresponse
web_site httprequest - httpresponse

63487
httpresponse	request
template content authentication request - httpresponse

63518
datamapper	activerecord
but it looks like propel uses activerecord doctrine 2 uses the datamapper pattern

63605
integer	fractions
therefore it may be a scaled integer fractions that has been adjusted to deal with non-integral of 2 related problems

63623
postgresql	mysql
ttp code.google.com p runjasperreports i haven t looked at the latest release but the one i ended up using supports mysql postgresql and a couple of other data sources and shouldn t be too difficult to extend if you can find the right odbc drivers

63639
saas	iaas
for example how can you integrate iaas and saas

63639
saas	iaas
you might use iaas to implement saas but that s not integration any more than a crm system is integrated with the c library.

63707
public	protected
you teach it you sell burguers public methods how to prepare the burguers protected methods but keep the patented secret recipe sauce to yourself

63766
put	get
if you don t own 100 of the you make use of gpl third-party libraries then you also need to get permission of those copyright-holders and you need to get a new license from them before you can put it on the appstore

63820
getter	setter	tostring	getter
lots of boilerplate code can be generated getter setter tostring clear

63839
kohana	yii
what makes you choose it over development from scratch or using a framework like yii or kohana

63845
kohana	yii
while yii and kohana are frameworks where you have options like zend code-ignighter as well

63847
codeigniter	cakephp
my personal opinion is to use a framework like cakephp codeigniter modx et al to develop your own cms and then maybe down the road migrating to something like joomla though by then you likely won t want to.

63925
width	height	mouse	keyboard
you re probably using a default keyboard layout with default key mappings default mouse button mappings the default browser typing in the system default language booting from the default os in the boot loader default positioned menus default color scheme default font width height face style default character set default monitor resolution default.

63960
tetris	pacman
at one time having a responsive pacman or tetris was the goal

64037
feedback	review
or perhaps you ll be asked to review a random snippet of code from their production stuff and provide feedback

64061
cpu	hyperthreading
alternately it may be possible that enabling hyperthreading on chips that don t support it will throw a code during post so the bios supplier just leaves it off because they don t know what kind of cpu the system will have

64077
mockups	balsamiq
i just started using balsamiq mockups for this process

64158
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
but mainstream linux variants like debian ubuntu etc

64196
getter	setter
model is the repository of business objects what some folks call data transfer objects collections of getter and setter

64300
lambda	first-class-functions
c# supports first-class-functions with lambda which are based off of lambda calculus and delegates

64330
glut	glfw
we will be using either the glut or glfw haskell wrapper projects as a base

64426
next	except
in other words you make simple loops into advanced library functions because you think you will need it for your next project anyway except that you won t in this exact form

64478
switching	screens
if i need to context switching i put on on each screens

64508
gtk	fltk
don t base it on an existing toolkit like qt or gtk or fltk or.

64532
libjpeg	freetype
in licenses such as that of libjpeg and freetype there are clauses like the following

64694
getter	setter
in case of methods as getter setter accesors is very common as previous answers mentioned

64699
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for 3 years now i ve been telling qa and the rest of the org if there s a bug with safari google-chrome firefox let me know

64705
base	fractions
even if ie6 was a small fractions of the overall internet traffic it probably makes up 80 of our client base

64745
heroku	engineyard
my complaint about heroku and engineyard for ruby developers is the mystery about how databases scale

64751
freebsd	linux	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux
for example ubuntu or other linux mac osx or a bsd freebsd

64752
vim	emacs
someone using vim or emacs does not have this problem

64931
post	put
i always put validation close to the source of incoming data whether that s data from a database data from a http post or data from a network socket

65007
peer	p2p
essentially you are talking about a p2p im protocol p2p peer to peer

65007
peer	p2p
note a big challenge for you with a p2p solution is making it so that when two peer are online they are connected to each other

65021
min	max
min max

65036
addition	multiplication
to clarify the result would be lifting the multiplication and then the addition over the range

65141
disk	ram
scaling up faster cpu more ram more disk space

65185
inherited	subclassing
inherited exposes a subclassing to details of its parent s implementation it s often said that inherited breaks encapsulation

65228
postgresql	mysql
you can download and install dozens of database servers oracle mysql sqlserver postgresql etc...

65237
free	malloc
if yes malloc free

65275
mouse	keyboard
i m searching for an app that is cloning all my commands mouse and keyboard to a second window

65280
mouse	keyboard
as for linux - although there are tools to track mouse and keyboard events and send them to windows xdotool i would rather try to record a macros and then run it for different versions of the site because to my opinion relying on x events for a task like visiting links and clicking buttons does not seem reliable enough

65381
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
to make things more interesting there are other alternatives to macports like homebrew and previously fink

65392
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
by the same line of thought you could argue that addition has few real-world uses since it can be replaced completely with subtraction and negation and multiplication

65392
division	modulo	division	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
sometimes doing these operations with multiplication and division and modulo etc. can be as much as ten times slower as the equivalent bitwise ops

65503
eiffel	smalltalk	lisp	smalltalk
it was influenced primarily by perl smalltalk eiffel and lisp

65522
jobs	cron
i realise the data import export could be done with procedural scripts and cron jobs but am wondering if there is a better way

65551
vbscript	jscript
vbscript jscript

65551
vbscript	jscript
switching from vbscript to jscript is the absolute worst for this - the files both end in .asp and look fairly similar at first glance so it takes a while to work out why i m getting errors

65623
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
actually composition over inherited often ends up being composition + inherited over inherited since you often want your composed dependency to be an abstract superclass rather than the concrete subclassing itself

65634
mouse	keyboard
this generally amounts to a more generous area with mouse selection or fewer keystrokes with keyboard selection

65700
codeigniter	cakephp
well php seems to have a lot more mainstream frameworks cakephp codeigniter symfony zend framework and a lot of other smaller frameworks than asp.net

65704
rss	feed
in fact in one instance i have the server hit an rss feed strip the xml out and put it in a json format cached locally before returning it to the device just to speed up that process as well

65756
prepare	execute
by the time your application begins executing the query or especially when you execute the same prepare query multiple times any performance advantage that you think your sp has is completely moot

65845
freebsd	linux
some background i have a 10+ years of programming experience on windows almost exclusively c c++ but some .net as well i was a user of freebsd at home for about 3 years or so then had to go back to windows and i ve never had much luck with linux

65957
ubuntu	debian
i would recommend some of the new distros releases from fedora suse debian or my prefered work station ubuntu

65961
perforce	cvs
every job since then has used version control systems including sccs pvcs clearcase cvs and perforce

66084
client-side	server-side
you leave them there in case something bad makes it to them but there should be a slew of defensive logic in front of them - client-side validation scrubbing server-side validation scrubbing possibly transformation into types that make sense in your domain model and finally getting passed to parametrized statements which could be parametrized sql statements or parametrized stored procs.

66172
error-handling	exception-handling
nothing groundbreaking but we both wanted to get some web experience. we did the thing with java servlets and it worked reasonably well but for some silly reason instead of opting to use exception-handling as our error-handling mechanism we chose to use error codes

66200
versioning	upgrade
sticking to older technology because it seems too much hassle to let your clients upgrade to a new .net framework versioning but it actually will take more development time to create the software because you can t utilize some time-saving components of the newer framework versioning

66203
post	get
most job post seem to require the alphabet soup you can get from job hopping

66262
subtraction	addition
time difference calcs are similarly messy unless you convert to an internal form that makes plain addition and subtraction operate conventionally

66276
yslow	pagespeed
pagespeed to check for this use yslow firefox addon or the online pagespeed check

66450
children	parent
mostly we have text nodes as children of parent nodes and we need to keep track of the parent nodes in order to determine what a text node refers to

66536
getter	setter
for me i like to look as others have mentioned at public methods as well as any publicly exposed properties i guess public getter setter in java

66558
free	malloc
if it s possible to use some c++ code in this project don t use malloc free instead use new and assign it to an auto_ptr and then when you return and the variable goes out of scope the memory will automatically be deleted

66598
junit	testng	ant	jdepend
junit fitnesse testng tam jdepend ant tomcat

66614
addition	multiplication
i learnt c c++ to a lesser extent on my own my prof was a total pain and the class was filled with code-jocks who had already learnt it in school and hence paid no attention to class and didn t let lesser mortals like me to pay any attention to class either and could whip up an awesome addition or multiplication program ones which now even kinder-gardeners whip up with way more finesse and a piss-poor knowledge of java which has even grown rusty in recent times

66616
folder	directory
the problem is that i need the script to run on a server that my client is paying for so is there any way i can secure a particular folder on the machine from root access or make it so only one particular use can access the directory

66628
lisp	scheme
on the other hand lisp languages scheme common lisp clojure are much more close to each other

66629
lisp	scheme
a powerful macro system is a defining characteristic of a lisp so these s-expressions can be easily manipulated at macro-expansion time to say slightly transform a common lisp program into a scheme program

66651
agile	sprint
don t ask the agile team to now refactor their java code base to python in the next sprint

66657
lisp	scheme
possible examples of where syntax could be modified without a strong type system maybe scheme forth and common lisp

66657
implements	extends
is it possible for weakly typed language to support syntax extension or does the ability to extends the syntax of a language from within the language itself require a type system to implements

66799
versioning	upgrade
otoh if the compiler provider usually deprecate features and make breaking changes with every versioning you will know it will be a painful upgrade

66799
versioning	upgrade
make backup copy of course and perform the upgrade on a different branch of your versioning control system

66803
scons	autotools
i see build systems like scons make jam ants autotools

66868
agile	sprint
my question is do you think i can use some agile methodologies here in a loose sense we re a waterfall company but maybe i could do scrum sprint planning poker etc

66880
agile	sprint
my question is do you think i can use some agile methodologies here in a loose sense we re a waterfall company but maybe i could do scrum sprint planning poker etc

66935
wordpress	joomla
for the sake of simplicity my question is focused specifically on wordpress instead of focusing on all content management systems including joomla drupal concrete5 or you-name-it

66939
subnet	packets
- i should be known that subnet might be isolated and packets need to be routed from net a to net b but all the details are way to much for a typical developer

67099
unsigned	short
static unsigned short fastdivide3 const unsigned short arg

67099
unsigned	short
unsigned short runningsum

67099

67233
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd	playstation	wii
mono can be run on android bsd ios linux mac os x windows solaris and unix operating systems as well as some game console operating systems such as the ones for the playstation 3 wii and xbox 360

67238
lisp	scheme
lisp with its many dialects common lisp scheme clojure

67238
ocaml	sml
ml sml ocaml

67427
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
example from maths is bodmas brackets of division multiplication addition subtraction

67432
post	get
following through from that post you can get to the following pdf

67639
kde	gnome
another virtue of mac is that you can install nearly anything kde and gnome included

67700
queue	fifo
i mean what would happen if someone implemented a stack as a fifo instead of a lifo and vice versa for a queue and named them otherwise

67709
int	boolean
so in these cases it is perfectly fine for a method to return nothing void instead of a boolean status flag or an int status code

67770
versioning	upgrade
aside from that even if you don t upgrade to v3 i advice you to put in a fresh versioning of jquery v3 comes with 1.4.4

67793
lisp	scheme
in lisp scheme it would be

67944
mockups	balsamiq
once you have that do a quick mockups i like balsamiq

67947
ocaml	ada
a more appropriate comparison would be between with another compiled language like c++ ada d go or even ocaml

67951
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
do i need to include the sqlconnection sqlcommand sqldatareader object in the diagram

67969
agile	sprint
some business are perfectly happy seeing agile sprint represented broken down into a gnatt chart

68048
joomla	phpbb
leads from a number of php frameworks zend framework cakephp etc and applications joomla phpbb etc came together in late 2009 to build the psr-0 autoloader proposal which dictates a class file naming scheme and namespace mechanism

68073
postgresql	mysql
i completely understand why we have a lot of internal expertise with java mysql postgresql and so on they re well-established and there s lots of good support for them

68177
chess	crossword
several approaches were tried abstract programming aptitude tests recruiting mathematicians as programmers recruiting chess players and crossword puzzle solvers and screening applicants with riddles and brain teasers

68179
vb.net	vb6
the cost of what is being done now will go up significantly without this technology like introducing vb.net to replace vb6 or if legal or regulatory requirements are changing and it will be hard to adapt the existing system

68220
mouse	keyboard
by default the wpf controls will still handle the mouse and keyboard events but if there are no registered handlers on the object itself it will pass the event up the hierarchy until something handles it

68274
post	get
write a class that gets all post get data and writes it as is to a singleton class called insecure_data

68274
post	get
then clear the post get arrays

68274
post	get
developers than have to retrieve post get data from the insecure_data array not post get arrays

68276
public	protected
even if the posts are considered public property like so there is no guarantee that the posted code is not already protected

68401
put	get
of those that remain they will start incorporating more of their personal lives into their daily work they have to since they have less personal time now and things need to get done so they will put in 48 hours but only be productive for 38-42 if that

68455
versioning	upgrade
now we wanted to upgrade it to latest versioning of .net

68461
pop-up	dialog
there are some aspects that feel poorly thought out pop-up dialog security

68469
cassini	iis
my question for discussion is why are we so automatically using cassini and what are the drawbacks of local iis

68508
cassini	iis
also you have to install iis which is easy to do but not the default on windows 7 for example cassini will be there with vs so no extra work

68555
subtraction	addition
technically it might be faster than the addition subtraction but really it s splitting hairs

68646
lisp	scheme
c++ templates are a sort of dumbed down lisp or even more scheme macros

68682
public	protected
when keeping track of whether a type method is public private protected static or sealed i find myself wondering what and why all at the same time

68686
public	protected
first public private and protected are access modifier you forgot internal

68723
trie	tree
for predictive text such index could be an trie prefix tree

68762
versioning	upgrade
if so it downloads a full install executable in this case a windows installer file .msi that installs the full versioning not just an upgrade to the previous versioning - too much to manage if there are multiple versioning out there

68793
post	get
what is more important is an understanding of how http works in particular get and post

68811
haskell	agda
almost totally because build-type dependency cycles are inconvenient in haskell and impossible in agda and coq and those are the languages i typically use

68864
inherited	subclassing
2 you cannot inherited friendly behaviour in the friend class s subclassing

68888
std	ostream
since we don t want to modify std ostream constantly our only reasonable option is to overload the operator with a free function instead of a member function

68893
put	get
a unique central repo for everything will never work you cannot put everything in a dvcs repo because it will get too heavy to clone around or it will contain unrelated set of files that get all referenced under the same tag which don t always make sense

68956
pull	push
for instance using the example from the hginit that vonc posted if bob found a bug in code that rose maintained he could hgserve his own repo she could pull in his changes update to his tip track down the problem and push her fix directly back into bobs repo without it going through the central server before updating back to her own work branch

68956
pull	push
i suspect that bob would have to clone his own repository let rose pull from and push back to that repository and he would then have to pull her changes in rather just updating to a newer changeset in his own repo

69011
post	get
legacy versions of php up until circa 2006 would escape all get and post input variables so that they were suitable for database query interpolation by default

69034
int	chars
one example of a programming test i was given recently was i had to write a method which would multiply 2 int without using the chars

69045
free	malloc
a malloc that doesn t get free d is good here for instance but string literals work too if you know what name+value you want to set at compile time

69045
alloca	malloc
they can be literals allocated with malloc alloca c++ s new char or they can just be a global or stack-allocated arrays

69050
vim	emacs
i know there are some advanced text editors like emacs and vim available solely for the purpose of coders

69055
vim	emacs
emacs and vim each have their distinct strengths but unless you use them a lot on a regular basis you will not benefit enough from them i think

69063
min	max
to establish your benchmark build your controller software with as large a buffer as you can afford for a test make sure that you have a means of recording buffer use min max average response times time in buffer whatever indicator will help you fine tune

69072
unix	bsd	sysv	systemd
importance of vi is that you will always find it on any flavor of unix standard both in sysv and bsd flavors or unix-like systemd

69170
vim	emacs
i think that learning emacs and probably vim as well is very useful

69170
haskell	scheme
this year i played around with haskell did a ton of javascript used scheme wrote some java screwed around with perl worked on a web site.

69255
jar	war
a library in that context from the point of view of java is surely a dependency jar war class etc

69424
profiling	debugging
profiling debugging options allowing for easier

69608
versioning	upgrade
any upgrade including buying a new versioning of vs costs money

69697
haskell	scheme
which of haskell or scheme would serve as a good intro to functional programming

69697
lisp	scheme
my understanding however is that emacs lisp is fairly different from scheme and is also more procedural as opposed to functional

69699
haskell	scheme
in scheme you may be pushed to do procedural stuff and its type system isn t nearly as helpful has haskell s which is great for a beginner as it pretty much checks that your code is correct at compile time

69700
ocaml	scheme	haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml
the real payoff was when i found that once i grokked the functional programming paradigm and mentally learned how to auto-magically decompose a problem into a functional program i was really no longer intimidated by the idiomatic aspects of other functional languages like haskell ocaml scheme scala and clojure

69702
scheme	racket
in addition scheme implementations tend to be very malleable -- for example racket takes that to an extreme and provides a lazy variant and a statically typed one

69702
haskell	scheme
in contrast if you use scheme or haskell and consider it a toy language for your purpose even if you know that some people use it for real applications then you ll never take the whole fp thing too seriously

69703
haskell	scheme
write yourself a scheme in 48 hours in haskell

69703
haskell	scheme
you will learn haskell using a real and interesting problem and you will learn the best lesson of scheme from playing with the interpreter you build

69704
haskell	scheme
between a scheme a ml and a haskell i would choose the ml because i think it s the most relevant to this definition

69704
scheme	racket	haskell	scheme
scheme doesn t have static typing there is typed racket but it s not for the scheme beginners and haskell has too much other stuff monads lazy evaluation... that while interesting may divert attention from the important basis

69704
ocaml	sml
sml and ocaml are equally interesting

69704
haskell	scheme
scheme and haskell are also very interesting languages

69704
haskell	ocaml
but as the core languages of ocaml and haskell are very much similar except for lazy evaluation that is distracting for the beginner it s easy to learn haskell once you know the basics of ocaml

69704
ocaml	agda	haskell	agda	haskell	ocaml
similarly once you have seen ocaml and possibly also haskell and still want to learn more you should look at coq or agda

69704
ocaml	sml	haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml
to make my point clear i think that learning ocaml or sml then haskell will make you as good a functional programmer as learning haskell directly but more easily or less painfully

69704
haskell	ocaml
besides ocaml and haskell both have good things differentiating them and it s interesting to know about the advanced features of both

69704
haskell	ocaml
just learning haskell is poorer in that aspect though of course you could learn ocaml after haskell

69705
haskell	scheme
not that i am knocking haskell or scheme - ideally learn all three

69738
rss	feed
i found that simplepie had a really good one in use with it s rss feed but it had a lot of features that i didn t need such as image cache-ing making relative urls absolute etc. so the actual amount of code that i m using that s more-or-less a direct copy of simplepie s code is maybe 20-30 of the original simplepie_sanitize class code

69865
ienumerable	iqueryable
use of iqueryable and ienumerable interfaces

69965
twitter	myspace
facebook myspace twitter etc

70069
lambda	first-class-functions
comprehensions object orientation reflection magic methods first-class-functions lambda iterators and generators metaclasses all of this is part of the language

70233
public	protected
according to the framework design guidelines when referring to public or protected fields

70367
put	get
put simply using this is easier because if you get it wrong your code won t compile if you use m_ it is a manual effort and you are not leveraging the tools

70382
google-chrome	safari
so stick with google-chrome and its tools while you re learning but you ll want to teach yourself firebug and ie and safari s built-in dev tools at some point

70485
unix	bsd
this applies to most variants of unix mac os x bsd except linux which uses gnu by default

70518
feedback	review
in any case be sure to do frequent review where he show you what he have done and you give feedback

70545
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu on my laptop and have used linux in some form as my primary operating system for over 10 years

70549
put	get
it can help debug compilers -- if what you get out isn t equivalent to what you put in then there s a bug somewhere

70596
clang	llvm
what are the pros and cons of gcc vs clang llvm

70600
clang	llvm
if you want to contribute new architectures or optimizations to an open source project but under a non-gpl license you can contribute them to the llvm clang

70608
ssd	sata
are they slow sata drives or fast ssd drives

70609
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
it s well like asking if by default you must add subtract multiplying or divide two numbers to find a result of a calculus when you don t know anything about it

70688
nginx	lighttpd
for static content web servers like nginx and lighttpd the web server almost always use very little memory and are limited by the disk-io speed

70691
ubuntu	linux
i run ubuntu linux for everything except windows testing

70722
vmware	virtualbox
osx is a niche system with very limited support from virtualbox or vmware

70839
facade	mediator
another hint is the importance of design patterns and the complexity of implementing them - as compared to some other programming paradigms - factories builder adapter bridge decorator facade command iterator mediator observer strategy and template method and maybe the composite are all in some way related to improving the modularity of oo code

70852
scheme	prolog
i m looking for some advice how to get started with logic programming and i am really enjoying working through the scheme book structure and interpretation of computer programs. is there a similar book that is geared toward prolog

70862
scheme	prolog
a possible alternative - being a bit closer in theme and technique to scheme sicp than to prolog art of prolog - is mozart oz with the the book concepts techniques and models of computer programming

70886
client-side	server-side
using any server-side or client-side

70888
postgresql	mysql
during the subsequent meetings allow for discussion to short list the potential offerings mysql ms sql server postgresql etc

70956
put	get
you may be happy with management your work people you work with but 10k difference in salary is important and the only way to get your true market value is to put yourself on the market

70998
post	get
please note that it s always good to post your resume online to get the market temperature

71002
for-loop	loops
with a for-loop you can move the post-statement empty and move it to the bottom of the code in loops

71004
for-loop	loops
the two forms are semantically identical and you can write a for-loop as a while loops

71068
for-loop	loops
by writing the increment in the for-loop declaration you are giving the compiler the best possible chance to optimise loops by unrolling it

71093
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
logically speaking you d use a for-loop to iterate over a finite sequence of elements such as in an arrays whereas you d use a while loops to iterate while a condition was true and a do-while loops to execute the sequence at least once and continue to execute while the condition was true

71161
multi-tier	3-tier
one of my friends has worked for nearly 10 years asked me why he needs to learn new things such as unit-testing mvc multi-tier architecture he creates 3-tier application but designs like 2-tier object-oriented programming or etc

71232
maya	blender
graphics tools such as photoshop maya blender illustrator

71295
lisp	scheme
if you re more academic than practical then i d go with common lisp or scheme

71338
filtering	grouping
the killer feature is map filtering fold and friends which allow a more succinct expression of a large grouping of algorithms

71376
erlang	scheme	haskell	scheme
right now i m spending most of my time on erlang but also took a look at haskell and have done scheme in the past

71377
maya	blender
graphics tools such as photoshop maya blender illustrator

71408
scheme	prolog
prolog and scheme are best match to you requirements except c-style syntax of cause

71425
freebsd	linux
i would suggest that you learn c c++ a bit about linux or other unix-like os freebsd computer architecture then assembler.

71446
dictionary	map
put the resulting word stems as keys in a associative array hash map dictionary and initialize each value with 0

71459
int	chars
in many languages such as erlang which uses atoms strings are actually just lists of chars or int

71487
sudoku	crossword
the miscellaneous section of p-99 presents interesting ai problems like eight queens sudoku crossword puzzle etc and their solutions in prolog

71500
min	max
6000 max 8000 l of beer but if the beer type is light then the min

71659
profiling	instrumentation
if you can provide an assessment of the memory pressure perhaps backed by performance tests profiling static analysis or code instrumentation designed to detect memory leaks you can build a case that there are technical and business motivations to invest in that area

71696
put	get
if you can get 4gb for a hundred bucks and the problem is solved it s not even worth considering to put just one single hour of work in memory usage optimization

71774
sorting	grouping
people i heard about a grouping recently that implemented sorting algorithms as a dance

71824
debian	linux
for linux most important are the major distributions such as fedora and debian and hopefully others although this is dependent on others trying to use it on whatever distribution as i cannot test all of them and will only test on fedora and debian myself

71850
unsigned	short
you might want to avoid unsigned short since a large value in one of those will convert to a large positive value in an int

71850
int	chars
don t forget that a chars constant in c is actually an int

71903
ready	each
we re using clearcase and the practice around here is for each developer to have their own development branch then an integration branch that we merge to when we re ready to start testing and one or more release branches for integrated and tested code

72029
post	get
today five years and a domain change later i am trying hard to get to the same post

72031
tetris	pacman
tell them to try making a pacman or tetris clone first and they scream that that s not what they want to do and that you should give me zuh koduz

72071
post	get	post	put	put	get
if you just need to serve up some xml or json in response to some get requests and perhaps a bit of data create update delete through post put and delete requests then resteasy is a good choice

72088
agile	sprint
in fact if you have a very large team it is advisable to break it up into smaller functional groups for efficient agile implementation imagine a 20-30 member standup meeting you ll get the point your product backlog and sprint backlog will be most useful even in a one man team in telling you if you are on track for the deliveries

72110
put	get
and even if you put the character back you will still get mixed results for the c c++ content

72151
pull	push
fgit disclaimer by me for pull push status and gc

72202
freebsd	linux
lazarus is available for microsoft windows several linux distributions freebsd as well as mac os x

72357
ant	maven
this strategy will also allow you to understand the various ways to build and architecture oss maven hudson jenkins ant make nmake etc...

72359
vim	emacs
if you use emacs or vim use etags ctags in combination with cscope

72380
pull	push
carl must pull down bob s changes commit them then push

72390
pull	push
the solution of course is for carl to pull down bobs changes merge them in and then push back that merge too so that you end up with all three sets of changes

72562
erlang	lisp
i write my answer mainly with haskell in mind though many concepts apply equally well to other functional languages like erlang lisp s and ml

72590
getter	setter
the whole point of using a property - even if there is nothing going on beyond the getter getting and the setter setting - is to funnel all access through that getter and setter so that if you ever need to change behaviour in the future it s all in one place

72634
cvs	svn
with some cvs svn it s harder to do with git it s trivial

72653
put	get
put them in the same sprint and since user stories are also prioritized in a sprint backlog you won t get any problem

72757
ant	maven
that said i would recommend not to use your version control system for dependency management and rather start using a build tool that can handle these things for you such as maven or ant

72759
versioning	upgrade
instead we go ahead and make drupal as much better as we can with each major versioning release and provide a migration path so that the database can be converted for the next versioning during the upgrade process

72779
int	chars
for example the algorithm takes a string and an int as input and does some sorting of the chars of the string

72822
feedback	review
i find code review most useful on very large projects where it is not possible for one person to really grok all the code where there are inexperienced developers who need the feedback in order to develop their coding and analytical skills or where there are non-coding members of the team who must understand the design and the code

72841
redmine	trac
since multiple answers point to trac as a suggestion i d like to suggest a similar but better in my opinion alternative redmine

extjs	mootools
other libraries such as prototype mootools extjs and dojo provide loads of other functionality for creating objects managing arrays collections manipulating strings and doing all the other nitty gritty things that we as programmers expect to be able to do
