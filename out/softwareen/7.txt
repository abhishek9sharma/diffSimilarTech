147786
freebsd	solaris	ubuntu	freebsd
i have a virtual machine for ubuntu fedora freebsd and open solaris

147827
versioning	upgrade
the most important thing is versioning control the scripts and automating the upgrade process

147830
ubuntu	linux
these days ubuntu has made it possible that users can configure and use linux as easily as a mac or a windows

147830
ubuntu	linux
within my ubuntu system i run virtual box to manage tiny core linux and bodhi linux

147860
feedback	review
during our pre-release review to some peers we received the feedback we should try concrete classes

147877
ocp	principles
remember that ocp is part of 5 other principles the solid guidelines

147877
srp	ocp
since real code rarely meets that guideline you often have to modify it to get srp before you can get ocp

147886
int	boolean	int	chars
or does that term include any structure that holds data such as composite types class objects structs enums etc. and primitive types boolean int chars etc.

147888
int	boolean
the term refers to both though things like int and boolean are typically considered primitive data types or primitive data structures

147954
debian	linux
if it doesn t build your own server - simply pick a decent linux distro i recommend debian it s super-reliable and easy enough to install but there s plenty others to choose from and install it either on a spare pc you may have lying around or inside a virtual machine on your own pc

147967
multibyte	substr
for example in order to get a substr you can t use substr but need to use mb_substr which requires to use the multibyte string extension

147986
int	boolean
the use of a boolean or an int for that matter to encapsulate state is perfectly justifiable in many cases

148000
pascal	delphi
i suggest that take a look to other programming languages how do they use interfaces classes like php delphi object pascal c#

148009
mongodb	bson
neither would using an xml data store instead of a json couchdb bson mongodb persistence layer

148015
int	boolean
in json the choice is usually obvious - it s either scalar int float string boolean null a simple list array or a key-value collection object

148024
getter	setter
it has a setter and getter method for the subject and body properties and an addrecipientrole method which takes a given role and finds the contact token an email address for each user in the role and stores it

148060
imperative	declarative
having worked with object-oriented imperative logic functional and declarative programming languages i would suggest something in the functional family

148060
ocaml	scheme
if you want something that also has types which means you might have to either parse the input or enter the data in a form much closer to what the data structure definition then i would suggest maybe ocaml scheme or f#

148061
lisp	scheme
any decent lisp or scheme where an arbitrary complex pattern matching can be implemented with metaprogramming

148072
erd	diagram
is it possible to specify alternate keys in addition to pk s in visio erd diagram

148085
packets	pcap
that watches packets via pcap from cho√¢ s old home page

148085
trie	tree
wikipedia s article on trie tree

148088
width	height
there will always be height width number of nodes moved with one pointer updated per node so there should be height width 2 number of pointers updated

148091
agile	sprint
this is why many agile projects usually start with a what i like to call sprint 0

148121
public	protected
one way is to add a public attach method and also a protected attachwithoutreciprocating method to each class

148129
put	get
usually when i get into situations like this that feel awkward but i can t quite tell why it s because i m trying to put something in the wrong class

148131
folder	directory
as one of a thousand things that could go wrong say you grab the path then that directory gets deleted then the folder path is changed to a good directory then you try and write to the deleted directory. the problem exists whether the folder path is global or is one of a thousand the program is currently using

148158
consistency	acid
the next is how you feel about the acid properties atomicity consistency isolation and durability

148176
filesystems	ntfs
see for example this article on the ntfs transactional filesystems api

148225
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i use firebug the tool very similar to developer tools from google-chrome

148256
csla	prism
we re about 1.5 years into a 3 year project using csla prism tsql and silverlight

148325
integer	unsigned
the comment talks about integer while the code uses unsigned int

148374
serializable	deserialization
there was a lot of serializable deserialization taking place between the two layers there was microsoft transaction server involved an idl odl type library .

148391
agile	sprint
with that said it seems to me like the only advantage agile has is working feature complete builds between sprint and for a lot of people and prjects this is not critical

148394
children	parent
nodes that have a list of children and in addition know their parent bidirectional navigable trees

148394
children	parent
events bubble up through parent down through children or both ways consider the windows message pump for example

148394
children	parent
examples are microsofts implementation of system.windows.forms.control or the system.web.ui.control in the .net framework but also every dom document object model implementation will have nodes that know their parent as well as an enumeration of their children

148397
agile	sprint
agile means that you might have to put in a couple 12 hour days at the end of the sprint

148408
n-gram	words
one n-gram is a sequence of n words

148411
pull	push
we can collect this data via a push pull mechanism

148413
dictionary	map
also it is not unusual to emulate map with a so the code using auto will work for both dictionary representations

148421
pull	push
you have the freedom to do this because you only have to worry that your changes break other people when they either pull from you or you push to the master branch

148464
ssl	https
i am new to ssl https so uncertain on the basics

148489
rss	feed
the project would be focusing on reading rss atom feed of any website that s all i can say now

148490
migrate	upgrade
we run these services on openvz containers that are easily migrate from one host to another for hardware repairs upgrade

148498
pull	push
and yes git only does that when you push or pull something to the remote repository

148522
queue	fifo
this imo fits to fifo queue

148526
queue	fifo
fifo is a queue - the first one added to the group is the first one served

148533
zlib	libpng
i use the zlib libpng license

148534
accessor	properties
documentation for properties always starts out with either gets or gets or sets to specify accessor

148542
codeigniter	cakephp
if you want to learn how to develop with a framework start off with something like cakephp or codeigniter

148543
return-value-optimization	nrvo
more relevantly there are simply new techniques and new language features- especially rvalue references and compiler optimizations are much stronger than they used to be with features like cross-tu inlining return-value-optimization and nrvo

148551
wordpress	expressionengine
for example i am thinking of products such as salesforce where you can have your own types of information frameworks such as expressionengine and the way it handles channels and channel field groups example or how cmses like wordpress have the ability to add fields to custom post types

148602
getter	setter
i mean what i think is generally meant by boilerplate but a good example is getter and setter in java.

148605
getter	setter
but that doesn t mean that all boilerplate syntactic elements from all languages are as wasteful as the getter and setter from java and c++

148615
downcasting	upcasting
what is upcasting or downcasting

148615
downcasting	upcasting
when converting a base ptr to a derived ptr is it called upcasting or downcasting

148641
put	get
then you get rid of all that annoying boilerplate and put it in a function

148658
maya	blender
if on top of this you want to learn a 3d software like maya or blender this is almost impossible

148840
post	get
so for example the user fills out the post item for sale form should that form get turned into an object which gets passed to another object which inserts the values into a database

148856
cvs	svn
if they were using a centralized cvs like svn every time one of them commits the build server will integrate and test their changes against the other nine developers work

148858
pull	push
you should follow a local commit with a pull from the base to merge and then push when your task is complete before going to the next

148883
post	get
majority of the functions in the framework are solid so we still use them as we ve never had any issues with them i m talking about the database functions and functions to grab get post parameters and escape data etc

148889
next	except
your interface should handle third friday of every month and worse the 3rd friday of every month except move to the next business day that both parties to the contract agree is a business day based on the holiday table for the region the business is incorporated under but you should only have to implement the cases that are real right now

148925
free	malloc
in embedded programming we always use static array instead of malloc when the malloc and free operations are frequent

148927
vb.net	vb6
that s very hard to do from vb6 but easy from vb.net or c# and i wrote them a .net assembly that looked to vb6 like a com component so they could call it

148927
internationalization	localization
internationalization and localization is much easier on a .net project this with an inquiry from a huge canadian customer who would need both french and english versions may have tipped the balance for my client

148941
direct3d	directx
direct3d not directx - directx also covers input sound etc actually doesn t have a left-handed co-ordinate system

148956
rss	feed
are you just reading rss feed or posting retrieving

148967
vb.net	vb6
first of all converting from vb6 to vb.net is almost always a bad idea and i did a lot of research on that

148967
vb.net	vb6
also if your boss thinks that vb.net is just like vb6 then he s completely mistaken and you have to change his outlook fast

148980
imperative	declarative
the declarative over imperative movement is part of this gestalt

148991
pull	push
git also lets you pull everyone else s commits merge your code in and then push a working version to everyone else so they don t have to guess at what they should have to merge based on what you changed

149021
submit	submission
if i have to take into consideration that the user has js off then i need to wrap my input elements within add a submit button and add additional mark-up on the current page to handle the form submission results..

149022
equals	tostring
for tostring that guarantees that any subclass of object will define it in a way compatible with an equivalence relationship read the javadoc for equals to see what i mean

149022
equals	tostring
it may work for a class where you know that tostring is compatible with equals but this is not the case for the values in

149073
srp	principles
dry can be taken too far its best to use the single responsibility principles srp in conjunction with dry

149076
integer	fractions
the price is expressed in cents and because you don t deal in fractions cents you decided to make the property an integer i ll use c here because i m not very familiar with c#

149123
min	max
if you re using c++ and not c sidestep this issue by using the standard library std min or std max in

149206
getter	setter
they d be a wrapper class that has all the fields set to public and no methods outside of getter and setter for those fields

149217
getter	setter
some methods do not need to be explicitly tested simple getter and setter because you will use those to verify the results of other tests

149219
hide	show
doing so in the browser is usually recommended to improve the user experience don t show me links to functions i can t do because it s just visual noise to parse through and it hide functionality that would otherwise be inadvertently communicated

149222
getter	setter
don t automatically create getter and setter for every property

149270
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
dealing with windows filename is more trouble than unix filename because filename in windows is case-insensitive while filename in unix is case-sensitive

149333
pbkdf2	salt
for example the project 1 uses sha256 while the project 2 uses salt and sha512 and the project 3 uses pbkdf2

149333
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
for example if the user successfully authenticate with the sha1 used by the fifth project you may compute and store the pbkdf2 hash and salt and remove the sha1 hash from the database

149340
mvp	presenter
i suggest you try the michael feather s humble dialog box which is also called model view presenter mvp and probably what you are looking for

149344
post	get
i would consider a synchronization operation as a resource that can be accessed get or created post

149406
gson	jackson
when witnessing a new developer writing his own json serializer and asking him why he s not using jackson or gson he says it throws errors and it doesn t work

149412
punctuation	words
for the same reason that they spell words correctly use punctuation consistently wear a seatbelt brush their teeth always starting on the same side and so on

149415
filesystems	hfs+	filesystems	ntfs	hfs+	ntfs
it also causes subtle errors and undefined type behaviors on case preserving but case insensitive filesystems the default modes of ntfs and hfs+

149446
lan	localhost
while in development you run the code on a development machine that isn t accessible from outside your lan or possibly not even from anywhere except the same machine localhost

149452
filesystems	hfs+
if you re developing on a system with a case-sensitive filesystems most linux filesystems hfs+ in case sensitive mode etc then you shouldn t have any problems

149452
filesystems	hfs+	filesystems	ntfs	hfs+	ntfs
if however you re working on a system with a case-insensitive filesystems ntfs hfs+ in its default configuration etc then you need to keep a careful eye on the filenames

149484
division	multiplication
it had an internal repertoire of the four arithmetical functions and could perform direct multiplication and division

149486
feedback	review
if you think this is the case it might be something to discuss but this can also be caught in code review and the he can get meaningful feedback he can learn from

149497
cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
it s much more an alternative to cpython ironpython or pypy

149513
post	put
when the number of spam flags hits 5 as in stack exchange say automatically delete hide the post and put a spammer flag against the user

149533
jsf	wicket
if you want to understand more clearly how jsf performs both mojarra 2.1.7 and myfaces 2.1.7 and compare it against a similar framework like wicket both 1.4.20 and 1.5.5 take a look to this in-deep comparison may 2012

149533
jsf	wicket
understanding jsf 2 and wicket performance comparison

149535
jsf	wicket
understanding jsf 2 and wicket performance comparison

149555
ats	mercury
obviously the two are not equivalent unless the language is single-threaded php or has either linear or uniquness typing system clean mercury ats

149569
int	double
everything other than primitives int long double etc are objects in java

149573
disk	ram
large object graphs make gc slower imply longer execution times in that you are probably going to have more method calls trigger more cpu cache misses and increase likelihood of your process being swapped to disk in low ram cases

149626
getter	setter
properties provide the opportunity to transparently implement custom setter and getter

149626
getter	setter
properties with custom setter or getter can be used to enforce a thread-safety strategy

149642
int	double
avoiding boxed primitives double int etc. can be a very beneficial micro-optimisation in certain circumstances

149642
int	double
since unboxed primitives double int etc. avoid the per-object overhead they are much faster cpu intensive work like numerical processing etc

149649
children	parent
when modelling an object with children it s common to include the children via composition as a member of the parent class

149649
children	parent
sometimes however the children need to tell the parent something they need to call a function of the parent

149663
children	parent
the point of using composition for the parent children is that the parent knows about the children but not vice versa

149698
cloudant	couchdb
couchdb on cloudant

149725
sctp	tcp
i m trying to understand how tcp retransmission queue works so i can implement it in my application that uses tcap over sctp

149727
post	get	post	put	put	get
it would make more sense to me to organize the api around resources and use the verbs get put post delete that come with the http protocol in short make it more restful that is surely considered good practice

149756
int	chars
int is 4 bytes in vb.net right and can store way more than 65k chars

149761
feedback	review
task+urgent or bug+urgent always review issues tagged as need feedback and leave a comment even if you don t have anything to add

149777
ready	each
at this point we ve got a possible release candidate in the form of the release branch and we re ready to run our ci process on that branch obviously you can do this on each developer branch but this is fairly rare in larger dev teams at it clutters up the ci server

149792
nunit	moq
this may sound weird but third-party libraries are usually not approved by our architect team think thou shalt not speak of unity ninject nhibernate moq or nunit lest i cut your finger

149813
boost	stl
do you feel like you can write a complex multi threaded multi tiered application employing c++ and some peripheral libraries stl mfc boost etc

149829
daemon	cron
i ve done similar things several times in the past always with a daemon or cron job

149883
clipper	basic
the old xbase database scripting languages as in dbase ii dbase iii+ clipper etc. were quite closely related to the various non-standard basic of the time

149885
strlen	strcmp
an example of what i mean by coding style is using std string to represent strings even static strings and perform operations on them instead of using the c library such as strcmp strlen and so on which can work both on dynamic strings and static strings the latter point is beneficial since it does not require an additional allocation to access string functions which is not the case with std string

149888
16-bit	64bit
all it took to explode that rocket less than a minute into its maiden voyage last june scattering fiery rubble across the mangrove swamps of french guiana was a small computer program trying to stuff a 64bit number into a 16-bit space

149902
post	get	post	put	put	get
now concerning put and delete some tech problems could appear you ll get them with html form often developers bypass this problem using post for each put and delete request

149902
post	get
my experience pushes me to use post and get every time

149918
post	get	post	put	put	get
as you ll read in the articles above the key is to think of the accessible pieces of your application as resources that can be created retrieved updated or deleted using the existing http verbs get put post delete

149918
post	put
also know the difference between put and post and when to use them

149918
post	get	post	put	put	get
get put and delete should be idempotent transactions post should not

149929
skip-lists	trie
i would definitely look for an existing open-source implementation of a trie or a bloom filter or a skip-lists before i tried writing one myself

149984
queue	fifo
if i understand correctly you need each item in the queue to expire after a certain amount of time but you still need items which are not expired to be consumed with observing the fifo rule

150104
ubuntu	debian
finding a solution described on an earlier version of ubuntu or even debian on which ubuntu was originally built would yield better luck

150114
pull	push
i am pulling in the dev branch of ci-bonfire using git i want the entire project to be git controlled as well but i want to be able to just pull the latest changes from the dev branch of ci-bonfire but push my entire app to a different repository

150128
dictionary	map
if you are wanting to create a hash map from an unchanging dictionary you might want to consider perfect hashing - during the construction of the hash function and hash table you can guarantee for a given dataset that there will be no collisions

150157
put	get
common mistake #1 - fixing concurrency issue by just put a lock around the shared data but forgetting about what happens when methods don t get called in an expected order

150194
queue	fifo
if the time to use is the time when it entered the queue then you need no priority queue just a simple fifo

150236
tablet	galaxy
extra info the application must run anywhere in any os including tablet ipad galaxy tabs etc. smartphones iphone android phones etc. and also on the web

150263
feedback	review
one for daily work driving a continuous integration server running all the unit tests integration tests to get the nice tight feedback loop and another for stable work where commits are less frequent but have to go through review

150288
client-side	server-side
however i don t think it makes a difference whether you start with a top down approach where you build all of the html css first and then work on the server-side code or whether you start with the server-side code and then work on the client-side as long as you have a clear vision for what the application will look like and what it will need to do

150293
bazaar	git
my question is what could be an indicator of the current location of distributed version control systems i mean git mercurial bazaar etc

150299
yacc	bison
i suspect that the prime motivator for their use is that lex yacc bison output is primarily in c

150303
cvs	svn
per my recollection centralized cvs svn back then had an advantage of being capable to run on windows and linux while teamware sccs has been locked in solaris filesystem at linux it run more or less if one knew how to hack over spurious zero checksum bugs

150306
cvs	svn
it seems more likely to me that distributed version control is just an improvement on an existing category of products just as svn was an improvement on cvs

150327
superclass	subclassing
what is the implementation when designing a class why subclassing will rely on the implementation detail of superclass

150332
factors	mean
by no interaction i mean that during computation the variables wouldn t be altered by an external factors

150335
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
a subclassing relies in the implementation of its superclass because it inherited from it

150335
superclass	subclassing
anything from the superclass that is visible from the subclassing becomes a dependency and a potential source for error

150335
superclass	subclassing
if the superclass implementation changes then the subclassing may no longer be correct or even compile

150383
pull	push
you can do a push notification about file update or you can set some timer on client to periodically check for file updates and pull it if necessary

150384
apache	nginx
it does such a fantastic job with http and websocket which means you can skip apache or nginx altogether while also running very well on windows linux and os x for both daemons and for regular ol desktop apps

150398
inherited	subclassing
the implication is that you should look at what the derived class aka subclassing inherited as a sort of contract with the base class

150417
put	get
so far my idea involves trying to set up a ci server and get our build process automated it takes about 10-20 minutes right now to simply build the application to put it on our development server since pushing tests and or tdd will be met with a lot of resistance at this point and constantly force us to break larger projects into smaller chunks that could be done iteratively in a three-week cycle

150491
getter	setter
these wrappers forward the requests method calls getter setter to an underlying shared_ptr of myspecialobject

150499
getter	setter
but in general permissions r w x are made explicit through the use of methods rather than having a publicly accessible member you provide explicit read or write access through getter and setter

150525
config	ini
they re usually stored in an ini or config file or possibly baked into the executable itself

150529
wan	lan
indeed with an appropriate api a web service can actually improve performance by batching together multiple database queries within the data center lan rather than requiring multiple round trips over the wan

150556
versioning	upgrade
also if you use the same database you also get a very practical business benefit - you can easily upgrade a customer to the full versioning without a complicated data export import

150615
mergesort	heapsort
at the same time other sorting algorithms are studied which are o n log n in the worst case like mergesort and heapsort and even linear time in the best case like bubblesort but with some additional needs of memory

150636
heapsort	in-place	quicksort	heapsort
for example bottom-up heapsort wegener 2002 outperforms quicksort for reasonable amounts of data and is also an in-place

150666
scrummaster	sprint	agile	scrummaster	agile	sprint
as a point of reference i m a product owner and am mentoring the scrummaster right now in my company and of all the agile meetings we have scrum sprint planning sprint review sprint retrospective the only one we take official minutes of is the retrospective because that gives the team something concrete to work toward and refer to in the next sprint and those minutes are a couple sets of short bullet points

150669
postgresql	mysql
i am working in php and mysql for this project but is the issue the same for most environments ruby on rails php .net and databases mysql postgresql

150681
disk	ram
if you do a select with any blob column you will always do a disk access while without blobs you have a chance to get data straight from ram high throughput db will be optimized to fit tables in ram

150738
screens	tablet
fluid does not mean it adapts to smalleer tablet smartphone screens

150748
partition-problem	np-complete
this is the optimisation version of the famous partition-problem which is np-complete

150760
public	protected
we now have a problem not only with code fragmentation but also encapsulation as methods within a class that may have been private or protected have been judged to represent a reason to change and have been extracted to public or internal classes and interfaces which is not in keeping with the encapsulation goals of the application

150764
implements	extends
make sure the hot valve delivers hot water the cold valve delivers cold water that the water flows in the first place that you can extends pipes wherever needed and then worry about implements actual plumbing to all rooms of the house or what the house will actually look like exactly

150781
srp	principles
that said srp like most principles out there can be over-applied

150787
consistency	acid
acid consistency including a rollback of an update which is complicated when the files are stored outside the database

150802
yacc	bison
note that bison is the gnu yacc

150805
filesystems	ntfs
when comparing the ntfs filesystems and sql server 2005 blobs smaller than 256kb are more efficiently handled by sql server while ntfs is more efficient for blobs larger than 1mb

150834
children	parent
in unix all processes except init have parent and any process which spawns other processes has children

150854
mergesort	timsort
for most purposes timsort - the hybrid between mergesort insertion sort which exploits the fact that the data you sort often starts out nearly sorted or reverse sorted

150854
quicksort	timsort
the simplest quicksort no random pivot treats this potentially common case as o n 2 reducing to o n lg n with random pivots while timsort can handle these cases in o n

150854
quicksort	timsort
according to these benchmarks in c# comparing the built-in quicksort to timsort timsort is significantly faster in the mostly sorted cases and slightly faster in the random data case and timsort gets better if the comparison function is particularly slow

150854
quicksort	timsort
i haven t repeated these benchmarks and would not be surprised if quicksort slightly beat timsort for some combination of random data or if there is something quirky in c# s builtin sort based on quicksort that is slowing it down

150854
quicksort	timsort
however timsort has distinct advantages when data may be partially sorted and is roughly equal to quicksort in terms of speed when the data is not partially sorted

150854
quicksort	timsort
timsort also has an added bonus of being a stable sort unlike quicksort

150924
cvs	svn
certainly in my limited experience i spend a lot more time working independently in my current team using mercurial than i did in previous roles where we used svn cvs p4

150936
subtract	add
the goal is to create an application that has objects that can represent some operations add subtract etc

150936
subtraction	addition
i could create an addition class a subtraction class etc

150945
super	abstract
the first approach is to extract common code into abstract super classes

150957
pull	push
either he pushes to the server first which is fine since you already have his patches and no conflicts should occur or you push first which means he will only get your patches when he pull

150973
base-class	subclassing
an obvious way is to wrap the instance representing the base-class into the instance representing the subclassing

public	protected
depending on the type of variable private protected public other things such as the current class subclasses or other classes can act on and may have the ability to change the value of that variable

151060
factors	mean
you mean you have to factors cost of parking

151066
return-value-optimization	nrvo
in reality nearly all reasonably modern compilers do what s called return-value-optimization return-value-optimization and named return-value-optimization nrvo

151066
return-value-optimization	nrvo
in this case return-value-optimization nrvo won t help because we re not dealing with the return value from a function or anything very similar

151096
hash	md5
a record was accompanied by a packing slip meta data including its 64 bit md5 hash caching rules etc...

151163
shim	polyfills
as a lazy front end developer who doesn t like css hacks shim and polyfills i think it s ok to at least try going back to ie9 mode and see what happens while we re still in private beta

151184
put	get
if you re building a 10-story building and you overestimated the load-bearing capacity of the foundation you put in your design you either can t build the building to 10 stories or you have to tear out a significant amount of work to get back down to the foundation and reinforce or rebuild it

151206
getter	setter
i would like to forgo the traditional getter setter in favor of fluent interfaces all throughout the code not just in builders but fear doing so since this is traditionally not the way way object oriented code is written in java

151224
pull	push
the fundamental idea in di is simply to push dependencies into objects rather than letting them pull dependencies from outside

151301
agile	sprint
incidentally i read about agile and scrum about backlog and sprint

151322
ienumerable	ilist
an example of encapsulation that prevents users from doing wrong things with your api is returning an ienumerable instead of ilist when you don t want to give the ability to the user to add or remove items in the list

151388
getter	setter
there were fields private variables private data in an object there were getter and setter methods which exposed something to the world and properties which was the exposed thing

151388
public	protected
i know the difference betweeen private protected and public keyword

151392
put	get
before leaving a project i make sure that i put things in order so that it s easy for me to get the context back in my head

151392
switching	screens
so when i need to switching back to the project i can start the vm up and it will present me with all of the information already on the screens

151426
client-side	server-side
another thing to consider is if a form has both client-side validation and asynchronous server-side validation

151437
spaces	delimiter
if you mainly want to recognize things and your input is lines each line consisting of fields delimiter by spaces awk is easy to learn easy to use and quite effective for what it does

151439
fortran	ada
fortran 90 and ada also have this feature as does fortress

151445
jobs	cron
i used to work with php and there were some behind the scenes stuff done with php scripts that could be run on the command line with cron jobs even

151476
nsmutablestring	nsstring
imagine that the function above took an nsstring argument instead of nsmutablestring and that i d passed the literal hello instead of a mutable copy

151547
netmsmqbinding	wsdualhttpbinding	wsdualhttpbinding	basichttpbinding
they include basichttpbinding supporting the ws-basicprofile 1.1 and basic security profile 1.0 wshttpbinding wsdualhttpbinding wsfederationbinding nettcpbinding netnamedpipebinding netmsmqbinding msmqintegrationbinding netpeertcpbinding

151558
git-rebase	amend
barring the presence of an exposed git-rebase or amend this worked quite nicely for the above requirements

151611
lisp	scheme
i find clojure a bit easier to get started with then common lisp with far better feature set library support than scheme

151611
textmate	sublimetext
there s pretty good eclipse and netbeans support for clojure or so i m told but i generally use textmate although sublimetext 2 is quickly becoming my editor of choice

151669

interpolation	splines
splines interpolation

151719
quicksort	heapsort
it begins in quicksort and switches to heapsort at certain recursion level

151725
getter	setter
accessing private members via public getter setter doesn t seem like it could add much overhead

151728
getter	setter
you re also making the assumption that public fields are unquestionably bad and getter setter are the only way which i don t think you d find 100 support for even on this site

151733
getter	setter
i have four years of experience in java programming and as i see it the first thing people do after creating a class is generate getter and setter in the ide thus making it mutable

151742
post	get
if ajax calls are being made then its very likely its either some post or get url with some variables

151742
post	get
once you know the above information you simply make a get or post request to that endpoint and parse the returned data

151779
getter	setter
as a p.s. i sense that java getter and setter are getting out of hand

151789
actionscript	mxml
mxml is just an abstraction of actionscript

151789
actionscript	mxml
when compiling a flex application the source code will translate mxml to actionscript

151789
actionscript	mxml
there are some people who say that a view should contain no logic when implemented in mxml but that is plain stupid since you need actionscript to define behavior

151798
agile	sprint
you can t function in an agile project methodology if individual project resources are going to reprioritized at a moments notice or if the sprint will be put on hold

151835
google-chrome	firefox
this is great also because you can test it in say google-chrome s console or firefox developer console and verify it works before writing even one line of other code

151848
versioning	upgrade
i may be totally wrong here however it looks like nuget doesn t automatically upgrade project s dependency when a package versioning gets upgrade

151858
getter	setter
automatically creating setter and getter is a horrible horrible idea yet it s the first way procedural-minded people try to force oo into their mindset

151858
getter	setter
setter and getter along with properties should only be created when you find you need them and not everyby default

151858
getter	setter
in fact although you need getter pretty regularly the only way setter or writable properties should ever exist in your code is through a builder pattern where they are locked down after the object has been completely instantiated

151869
pop-up	dialog
without the null check passing a null pointer into this function will cause a segfault and there is nothing you can do - the os will simply kill your process and maybe core-dump or pop-up a crash report dialog

152204
getter	setter
make commonlib a property in bar and declare getter and setter

152208
put	get
the bonus over gc languages is that you ll also get instant deallocation of them once no-one is using the object anymore so you can put your enemy death throes routines in the destructor and let the system automatically call it when the enemy is deleted

152213
width	height
resize to fit screen enlarges image s width and height independently until they match the screen

if you are using anything other than tomcat or jetty as a server then you will be frustrated by long startup times of websphere weblogic jboss

152248
appfuse	grails	appfuse	spring	tapestry	grails	tapestry	wicket	tapestry	appfuse	wicket	appfuse
whenever a new framework came out tapestry wicket gwt stripe grails appfuse play richfaces spring etc i would try it out and see if it was any better and most times it was only a little better and sometimes not better at all

152248
jboss	weblogic
in my past i have used weblogic websphere jboss tomcat and jetty

152446
facade	command-pattern
you typically call methods on a uow interface from command-pattern class es facade

152474
prepare	execute
that s probably a sign that you want to refactor part of this code into one or more helper methods to prepare and execute the query to comply to the dry principle

152602
free	malloc
malloc and free are intended for use only in c and not in c++

152612

152622
jboss	weblogic
are you using servlet engine tomcat or a full enterprise server jboss weblogic

152622
freemarker	velocity
if the application is not using jsps then it s likely using some other template engine such as velocity or freemarker

152652
put	get
usually i d say grab all the stakeholders within reach put them in a room drive them through litigious issues and incrementally try to resolve these - and get priorities while you re at it

152729
changeset	cherry-pick
you can use patch queues to cherry-pick stuff coming in or you could just use hg backout to remove the changes of just a changeset see the hg book and look for hg backout here

152748
superclass	subclassing
in smalltalk by contrast the accepted terms are superclass and subclassing so trying to use most derived class would seem odd foreign and quite possibly at least mildly confusing but no i don t recall smalltalk documentation having a specific term that corresponds to most derived class

152756
multiplying	add
i didn t memorize whether i should add or multiplying probabilities or

152756
addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	division	modulo	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	multiplication	modulo	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	modulo	subtraction	addition
in particular if you re going to code in php then you should understand the basic data types numbers strings arrays basic things that you can do with them for numbers addition subtraction multiplication division and modulo

152784
multibyte	substr
if i output these strings on a utf-8 terminal you won t see any differences but string lengths and other multibyte operations substr will produce wrong results

152826
switching	screens
if we must switching screens the data is lost from our mind and we have to spend time reloading it into our brain

152826
switching	screens
speeding up the context switching to the new screens in this case the browser could allow you to remember your data longer

152835
division	modulo
but you can do fizz buzz without using the modulo or comparing float division to integer division

152835
lisp	scheme
start with a cs book that introduces a programming language and the cs background with the famous example of structure and interpretation of computer programs which will teach scheme -- a lisp dialect or possibly something else like think python how to think like a computer scientist which i have not read

152847
folder	directory
i would seriously recomend you keep your images in a folder under the root directory of your web server htdocs or equivalent and store a reference to the file name in your database

152863
hash	salt
if chrome or ie or what ever it was i am using could tell me that a password box is instantly going to be client side hash using a server generated salt and effectively sandbox the password itself - then i would know that as a user i could reuse a password with less risk

152867
ssl	https
for security reasons i would add that the webservice should be hosted with ssl and use https

152899
for-loop	loops
if you need a loops count inside a foreach loops why don t you just use a regular for-loop

153021
ninject	spring.net
to use interception via a dynamic proxy castle windsor spring.net ninject 3.0 etc your target class needs to implement an interface or inherit from a base class

153037

here are two post that i put on stackoverflow in the last few days that relate to this

153041
agile	greenhopper
full disclosure i m a little biased because i m the greenhopper product manager at atlassian but i ve also been involved with agile outside atlassian for a long time

153107
pull	push
because of this merge conflicts simply won t happen and it seems silly to pull down the work branch and the stable branch merge them and then push the changes back

153125
folder	directory
backup the folder that the project is in its root which includes the .git directory tree of files that are the contents of git

153128
lisp	scheme
what is scheme s dotted pair construct analogous to in other lisp implementations

153152
ironruby	ironpython
someone asked here if there s an equivalent to c# for groovy and the answerers somehow missed the point with ironpython boo and ironruby because groovy is almost a superset of java while these may at most generate clean c#

153175
folder	directory
so if you have the typical producer consumer pattern one process produces files the other watches a directory and picks up everything it finds writing to a temp folder first and only then moving to the real location means the consumer can never see an unfinished file

153200
webkit	gecko
for example firefox uses gecko and google and ios use webkit

153224
dynamic-languages	typechecking
the advantage is that this is relatively easy to implement and gives the programmer full flexibility any method can be glued onto any object but obviously you won t get the benefits of a static type system but then if you re using a dynamic-languages you have already decided to let go of static typechecking

153264
pull	push
work normally with the code under mercurial do hg pull perforce to sync up hg push to export a changelist

153283
pull	push
after it just do pull and push

153289
pull	push
at the end just pull and push from developer local branch to master

153327
cvs	svn
one of the advantages of older version control systems such as cvs and svn in enterprise development is that anyone can connect to source control and see all the projects that the company has

153351
i2c	spi
i am designing a simple logic analyzer i know that the best way to decode a protocol like i2c spi uart is whit something like an fpga but i want to do it by software by now i am running on an omap4460 arm proccesor

153351
i2c	spi
i would like to know if there is an special way of decoding protocols like i2c spi uart or it is simply if and flags as the normal way

153356
public	protected
testing input conditions should be done in all public and protected methods

153370
put	get
if i put them all into a single class i get some advantages because copying then becomes easy

153371
client-side	server-side
this unifies the traditional front end client-side development language javascript with the server-side language

153438
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
question i get better performance using a short arrays but using loops every time i need a minion or using long arrays but no need for-loop and getting values directly from the id name

153497
filtering	grouping
as long as one firewall is alive in a grouping traffic through them moves smoothly and correctly for all of our packet filtering functionality

153543
agile	sprint
we used agile with fortnightly sprint

this is what put post and delete are for

153587
srp	principles
actually patterns based on principles srp dry etc

153597
gitolite	gitosis
besides gitosis and gitolite there s also excellent gitlab looking like github

153629
mouse	keyboard
decent input devices keyboard mouse maybe trackballs...

153629
mouse	keyboard
it s a different issue when you get a crappy mouse or trackball or keyboard but i don t see a clear win for one or the other

153635
put	get
put all of the information into a neutral object that both b and c can access and let each of them get what they need

153742
getter	setter
and it sure brings in lots of java code with getter and setter for each message attribute validation code etc

153742
imperative	declarative
this would change my design approach from an imperative to a declarative style

153825
min	max
as others said familiarize yourself with the language in c++ especially the stl it has both common functions that you d want to use binary_search min max and robust data structures to save you time stack to avoid straight up recursion queue for bfs even priority_queue for dijkstra if you like it that way

153832
processors	hyperthreading
yes many of the jit compilers and hyperthreading processors take synchronous code and help parallelize the execution

153919
serializable	deserialization
but for protobuf i have to modify the .proto file then update the serializable and deserialization logic which moves the data in out of the protocol buffers and into pojos

153919
serializable	deserialization
it s happened more than once that a release has happened where someone added a field and forgot to put in either the serializable or deserialization code for the protocol buffers

153925
queue	fifo
any fifo collection that can be iterated over can use queue and use while queue.peek instead of an iterator

153939
queue	fifo
you could introduce a simplified example of a scheduling queue and assign them some homework to write a program that generates or accepts a task of a given size and processes them in fifo order when they start it

153954
put	get
it is therefore entirely possible to get sub-centimeter fixes from gps a marketing guy might claim 1 cm and then in the fine print put accurate to 10mm 10 of the time

153984
maven	pom.xml
if you use maven already then consider making a private maven repository accessible to your customers providing your binary artifacts and have your installations have pom.xml file for assembling the final installation

154037
post	get
the verbs get and post may not be enough

154062
agile	sprint
mine is an agile shop building a saas app with a team of 4 developers and a tester working on 2-weeks sprint

154062
children	parent
when the team decomposes stories we create a parent ticket and children tickets that roughly work out to be model changes view changes and controller changes broadly speaking to achieve the goals of that story

154062
children	parent
the owner of the parent ticket is the go-to for questions about that feature or component whatever the case may be until all the children are completed and the owner works through the whole item at the parent level and is ready to send it as a bundle to the code review status

154062
children	parent
here s where ownership comes into play again -- the owner of the parent is responsible for any fixes in the parent or its children

154140
put	get
i think that you get a bit of a culture change this way and you start to remove the barrier to doing it reflexively as you put it

154176
width	height
height and width of page adjust according to screen size if they have more information then they use scroll-view etc.

154218
clang	llvm
but when you find cpu-bound code that is a bottle neck one of the best ways to understand which of your alternate implementations would be better using clang c c++ - llvm ir is a great idea

154218
clang	llvm
the ir intermediate representation generated by clang and llvm are virtual machine instructions

154385
rdf	owl
their data set uses owl as a knowledge representation to provide semantic context to the wikipedia data set through rdf xml based metadata

154403
ready	each
but now i m ready to learn more about the internals difference between each of theses protocols

154486
stateless	stateful
a stateful operation modifies or requires some state of the system and a stateless operation does not

154494
children	parent
eg parent scene children bullet1 bullet 2 player

154499
stateless	stateful
to illustrate the concept of state i ll define a function which is stateful and one which is stateless

154521
perforce	svn
look at all of svn git mercurial and i d toss perforce in there too the trial license is for 20 users 20 workspaces unlimited files

154525
put	get
so - either get moderators to approve reject each image or put a system in place that allows your users to flag images as offensive and that will remove such images when a certain threshold has been reached

154537
client-side	server-side
in fact it seems that client-side java applets desktop applications ... is dying completely and java is primarily becoming a server-side language

154542
cpu	processors
really with today s processors and ram java is no longer that heavyweight the f1 live timing app starts reasonably quickly on my atom netbook and there are certainly flash apps which choke more my cpu upgrades are differential iirc and the initial install under today s network connections is a shade of what it was back in the day but still applets are not the answer to many questions

154557
awt	swing
you have swing or awt skills and don t want to learn yet another language gui framework

154570
trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla	mantis	bugzilla
in general i d say the best way to track tasks todos is with an issue tracker like jira bugzilla or mantis or more complete solutions like trac or hosted ones that come with private repos like on bitbucket github or assembla

154610
lisp	scheme
inspired by the numerous posts about the importance of learning lisp scheme i started to learn scheme two days back i am using the book the little schemer and have completed half of it

154623
scheme	racket
and make sure you ll learn a scheme with a proper define-macro implementation i d recommend racket or bigloo not just standard hygienic macros the latter would not surprise you at all if you re familiar with the c++ templates

154623
lisp	scheme
most scheme textbooks would skip this stuff unfortunately but i d argue that there is nothing nearly as important in lisp as the proper macros

154624
imperative	declarative
packrat could be sufficient it works really well with a c syntax and it is extremely flexible you can mix a high level declarative parsing logic with low level imperative recipes for recovering from errors and giving comprehensive and useful error messages

154655
ocaml	scheme	haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml
or solve some euler-project problems in scheme haskell ocaml whatever

154668
lisp	scheme
the little schemer is an exercise book aimed at giving you a grounding in the scheme dialect of lisp

154668
lisp	scheme
it is most emphatically not a textbook on lisp or scheme programming much less a text on functional programming

154674
versioning	upgrade
each versioning upgrade should be defined as an action and upgrading across several versioning means running the actions one after the other

154724
srp	principles
bob martin uncle bob who originated the solid principles of which srp is the first says about this i am paraphrasing can t recall the actual words

154743
put	get
if you re up for a little civil disobedience get the team to agree to put a list of all the developers in that field for each bug

154747
versioning	upgrade
i suppose it could pick the oldest versioning but that makes it difficult to upgrade

154758
submit	submission
you could avoid redirecting you could have the form action field submit to the current page and have a snippet of php higher up on the page to watch out for the form submission save the data and show a thank you message then

154767
post	get
read about rest for an approach to http methods that goes beyond get and post

154785
required	placeholder
for example i want to use the placeholder and required attributes in a web form i m building and it has no labels to show what each is

154798
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
in this another generate a binary problem like addition subtraction multiplication or division

154800
getter	setter
actually when designing common objects not beans or objects representing strictly data structures it is a bad idea to provide setter and getter since they kind of break encapsulation

154843
filesystems	ntfs
the complex part is the filesystems such as ntfs storing the files withing the container

154848
switching	screens
you could very easily switching over to being the business a blue scarab production by changing your website and the splash screens of your apps

154856
forth	smalltalk
i m sure the designers of the clr took a good hard look at the jvm to see how it could be improved just as the designers of the jvm got insight from earlier vms p-system forth smalltalk

154925
hash	salt
while talking with one of my coworkers he was talking about the issues the language we used had with encryption decryption and said that a developer should always salt their own hash

154939
rdf	owl
if you are familiar with the java rdf and owl engine jena then you have run across their philosophy that everything should be specified as an interface when possible

154968
public	protected
the library exports an object with both public and protected functions

155009
goto	break
i also use goto if the alternative do while continue break hackery would be less readable

155064
user-stories	srs
we are planning to adopt user-stories to capture stakeholder intent in a lightweight fashion rather than a heavy srs software requirements specifications

155064
user-stories	srs
user-stories eliminate the need for a formal srs like artifact to begin with so what s the point in having an srs

155064
user-stories	srs
how should i convince my team who are all very qualified cs folks by the way - both by education and practice that the srs would be eliminated if we adopted user-stories for capturing the functional requirements of the system

155064
user-stories	mockups
so here s my work-flow argument capture initial requirements as user-stories and later elaborate them to use-cases which are required to be documented at a low level describing interactions with the ui prototypes mockups and are a deliverable post deployment

155064
user-stories	srs
thus going from user-stories to use-cases rather than user-stories to srs to use-cases

155064
user-stories	srs
how are you all currently capturing user-stories at your workplace if at all and how do you suggest i make a case for absence of srs in presence of user-stories

155118
rss	feed
can read rss feed and probably could be updated these days to .

155129
pull	push
sync push and pull only differ in direction

155134
public	protected
the reason obfuscators exist for java is because the mapping between java byte code and java source code is fairly well defined and the names of all functions and member variables are stored in the byte code regardless of whether they are public private or protected so a java byte code interpreter can present some generic java which shows the structure of the original source fairly well for unobfuscated source

getter	setter
for the globals our code has introduced i think i will set them as dependencies in the constructor or in getter setter so that i don t rely on them being globals and then refactor the old codebase little by little so that we have no globals

155246
erlang	lisp
with another thinking perspective some problems disappear or are transformed to different more manageable kind for example many c++ style design patterns just disappear when you are thinking in lisp see for example this peter norvik s presentation and erlang frees you from thinking of some low level concurrency or distributed computing constructs and lets you just concentrate on the application logic

155265
versioning	upgrade
once the software is released the responsibilities for bug fixes upgrade and new versioning could be handled either in-house or by another development company

155276
debian	linux
this may be required by the gpl v3 or it may just be debian s approach to free software but debian s views on copyright are definitely worth considering if you re licensing linux software under the gpl and tackling the issues that you ve asked about.

155306
goto	break
in java i use a labeled break and everywhere else i use a goto .

155337
srp	principles
the process itself is called refactoring the code and method is called extract method and it is a good match for applying srp single responsibility principles to the code

155348
r5rs	r6rs
with all the controversy surrounding scheme r6rs i stuck with r5rs and i am wondering why the designers decided to not implement a module system

they use pdo php data objects this library adds a lot of portabilty to the applications because the functions you use are the same for mysql mssql postgresql etc

155575
put	get
if the outputs you get from git shortlog and git log do not look satisfactory and useful yet you ve put in a significant amount of effort in the project during the day and checked those changes in then you probably didn t do it right

155589
queue	fifo
it s atomic only inasmuch as how you write your fifo queue structure

155589
queue	fifo
wrapping a mutex or some other form of lock around the fifo queue is probably the easiest way to guarantee concurrency and atomicity for the environment you describe

155589
queue	fifo
synchronization on writing to the queue is then handled within the fifo queue process itself

155616
setinterval	settimeout
barebone settimeout and setinterval

155633
srp	principles
138 the single responsibility principles srp states that a class or module should have one and only one reason to change.

155649
int	chars
now conceptually construct a hash table with int keys and the contents of a 1000 element chars array as your values

155742
getter	setter
properties also relieve you of writing your own getter setter and take care of much of memory management themselves

155775
super	abstract
first have an abstract implementation that is a super set of all the attributes that both bar and club share

155786

windows itself seems to be a rather rare development platform in valley and valley-ish companies - developers tend to use mac osx or linux and companies use linux for servers due to cost and general availability on platforms like amazon ec2 heroku and engineyard

155841
put	get
the problem is i m not good in front-end design and have put many many hours to get the hang of the stuff

155846

our actual application will be a pure web-delivered mobile-friendly application so what we want on the homescreen is basically something that just acts as a link to bring up safari or google-chrome now i guess

155967
gentoo	linux
if you do want more of a head-first dive into linux gentoo is a good option

155975
interpolation	calculus
i used a lot of calculus for creating continuous interpolation

155978
extjs	mootools
did you ever fervently consider the notion which is better jquery extjs yui dojo mootools backbone underscore require etc.

155986
put	get
there is at least one more reason why you do not want to change the sequence because it ll put too much emphasis on trying to get accurate forecasts instead of rough estimates which is what story pointing should get you

156037
rdf	owl
rdf owl vs xml is false alternative

156037
rdf	owl
also rdf owl vs microformats is false alternative

156037
rdf	owl
multiple triple-stores compatible with rdf owl for most any programming language

156053
superclass	subclassing
by adhering to lsp you can be pretty sure that there actually exists a is-a relationship between your superclass and your subclassing

156053
lsp	principles
it can be regarded from a pov that relates to the previous principles by the fact that it does not let you create large interfaces so that their implementation could break lsp

156066
hide	show
views - this is where i put html css and javascript code form validation code for the current form looping through the data supplied by controller a few if statements to hide and show things depending on the data supplied by the controller

156106
jobs	cron
in the past i have typically used cron jobs with the quartz scheduler running within a web application server but i know that this isn t likely a scalable solution for the truly massive userbase that management is telling me to expect granted they are management and are probably highly optimistic about this and also for how important the role of these tasks are in this web application

156106
jobs	cron
my question is if scheduled jobs like cron running on a web application server are a wise design choice given the time sensitive game tasks of this application or is there something more appropriate for running a scalable game engine parallel to the web application servers

156120
vb.net	vb6
the company i work for uses vb.net since there are many programmers who moved up from vb6 to vb.net

156120

i use postgresql and mysql myisam daily so those are what i m most interested in but answers for other databases are of course welcome

156223
accessor	properties
they simply expose accessor to query and update their physical properties position size mass inertia etc. and an overall gamephysics object is responsible for checking all your objects and updating them

156225
junit	mockito
i am using junit mockito and sonar for testing

156288
put	get
but as computers get faster and gain more memory people put more data into their databases and do fancier queries

156298
superclass	subclassing
basically you make it into a singleton then modify the singleton so that it supports overriding the class of the instance with a subclassing and if needed move the logic that creates the instance to a separate class that can be subclassing which you would do if creating the superclass instance then replacing it later is a problem

156314
pull	push
you can pull and push this branch from both machines with little effort and when it s ready to merge into master or production rebase it to create a more maintainable history

156330
lisp	scheme
f# is a descendant of the ml programming language which in turn was heavily influenced by languages like lisp and scheme

156335

i created a clone of my repositories in a skydrive folder it could equally be dropbox or another magic sync tool of your choice i have then configured the instances on my two machines to automatically push to the skydrive repository on commit

156343
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort is a bit more complex quicksort more so and radixsort even more so

156343
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort and quicksort are nlogn and radixsort is generally considered linear technically it s nlogm where m is the largest number in n

156343
profiling	debugging
there are profiling tools that can take a binary assembly and its debugging symbols and show you after running through some use cases what lines of code were run the most

156385
entity-relationship	diagram
that and a glossary and a logical physical entity-relationship diagram of the database preferably hosted on a wiki of some sort is about all you can do

156426
cvs	svn	folder	directory
like cvs svn makes use of .svn directory inside the source folder to store state of the local working copy and to allow synchronization with the server

156450
copying	overwrite
firstly a vcs protects developers from themselves and from each other - if it served no other purpose than to allow two or more developers to work on the same codebase relatively safely it would be of huge value and i have been in a team where the previous days work has been overwrite by a bit of careless copying

156465
octal	hex
for example flex lets you specify input characters in terms of octal or hex values

156478
post	get
to get counts or see if records exist for that particular post

156481
getter	setter
i often take the pattern of container classes complete with getter and setter for validation and database access performed by a single singleton class

156482
put	get
i suppose i could put the predefined templates in a different namespace to get around this drawback

156485
jar	manifest.mf
the chosen approach where every class can have an invocation method is quite flexible especially in combination with the main-class line in the manifest.mf file in a runnable jar

156500
nitrogen	chicagoboss
if i had to choose then i would probably give zotonic the first chance then chicagoboss and then nitrogen

156504
udp	tcp
i would also like to point out that even though it s not a case of redundancy here redundant practices with acronyms are being done all the time especially with technical terms atm machine tcp ip protocol udp protocol smtp protocol etc.

156508
liferay	alfresco
i ve used both liferay and alfresco trying to use them as the document management system for an intranet

156523
pull	push
they will pull changes from the repo make their own changes commit locally and then push back into the public repo when they have something working

156548
flask	django	flask	pylons
once you ve built a few django apps and shipped a thing or two then go and learn pylons or flask and add sqlalchemy to your tool belt as well

156637
int	double
int and maybe floating point arithmetic on a variety of data sizes single or double precision

156637
octal	hex	octal	decimal
usually assemblers provide some way to specify numeric data in hex octal decimal floating point and occasionally character data

156646
gentoo	linux
i m running gentoo linux source-based distribution and from my experience i can say that with more or less recent hardware is the best value

156646
disk	ram
if you have enough ram and a fast disk set

156679
preorder	postorder
you start at the root or the current node and visit each node in order preorder postorder whatever order you need performing the required task at each node

156684
vim	emacs
first one focuses on adding .net project support to any editor including vim and emacs

156704
children	parent
properly stored each skill references only its parent skill and trying to find children and siblings takes forever even with a small table

156704
children	parent
each node would reference its parent and have a list of its children so you can rocket around the thing as needed

156704
children	parent
so if you want to know about a long sword you find it in the map by name and now you have all the information plus its parent and all its children

156704
jtree	jtable
unfortunately i needed to make it part of a table and it proved easier to skip the jtree and expand and collapse rows in the jtable directly

156725
put	get
but make no mistake about it if you are willing to put in the time and the effort to master assembly you will get better and you will become a stand out in the field

156769
integer	unsigned
in most cases where a 32-bit signed integer would too small but a 32-bit unsigned value would suffice for today it won t be long before the 32-bit unsigned value isn t big enough either

156771
feedback	review
i have been using an agile methodology scrum for about three years now and i see certain advantages to it especially in the short-term feedback at many levels from customers having early access to implemented features from testers that can test features as soon as they are implemented from other developers that can provide very early feedback on new code through review etc

156791
hex	binary
unfortunately ms sql server does not support utf-8 varchar so instead you have to either use utf-16 instead and waste space for ascii text use a non-unicode code page and lose the ability to represent foreign characters or store utf-8 in a binary column and deal with inconveniences like sql string functions not working properly or having to view the data as a hex dump in your gui db manager

156805
pull	push
in this workflow developers have to update pull from the central server first before they can push a new commit

156824
mouse	keyboard
i suppose real world interfaces are things like a keyboard mouse remote control atm screen

156827
ilist	icollection
examples are ilist icollection

156875
ienumerable	iqueryable
extension methods over iqueryable or ienumerable are easily chained together

156945
factors	matrix
i leave it as homework - iirc depending on various factors for large matrix it can be even 10x

156981
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
inherited is tricky particularly when the superclass programmer doesn t know what the subclassing programmer will need and the subclasser can t modify the superclass

156981
implements	extends
if i could make each of them implements my own simple interface by adding extends myinterface --they ve both already got the methods i d be all set but i have to treat them as distinct unrelated classes

156989
floating-point	integer
to force a floating-point division when x is an integer in languages which do not have distinct operators for integer and decimal division

157000
agile	targetprocess
1 i am evaluating agile project management service targetprocess and each user story must be tied to a parent feature

157039
versioning	upgrade
i mean old versioning will use them to upgrade to the new one sure but should a fresh install have its database go through all the historical changes before arriving at the current shape

157095
cpu	processors
i m not sure how the locks will work with multi processors cores i m going to use shared memory in my application or fifo what worries me is the locks i have a server with 2-cpu how the lock will be able to lock a variable on one cpu while the another operation went to the 2nd cpu for the same variable

157172
hash	salt
i m bootstrapping my own project it has a registration login area via devise with ror properly hash and salt of course

157197
implements	extends
also if you use a sufficiently powerful language with metaprogramming capabilities a lisp it becomes relatively straightforward to extends the language yourself to implements any design pattern

157230
getter	setter
java s equivalent of properties for example would be getter and setter

157232
srp	ocp
i ve tried passing in interfaces of dependencies from the constructor of the system all the way to the class the depends on it and registering for events on it but this gets extremely complex and crazy and definitely violates ocp and srp at least

157232
srp	ocp
i m considering making an event system that all event dispatching and listening classes would be coupled to providing a layer of indirection for classes that require interaction with classes from other systems however in the worst case behavioural classes could be responsible for the behaviour of a class handling events and dispatching events- so that definitely also violates the srp even though i m pretty sure it would follow the ocp

157236
interpreted-language	compiled-language
is there really any difference between these popular interpreted-language and popular compiled-language that compile to vms

157259
post	get
but i see that some frameworks provide automatic xss filters for incoming post and get data

157272
width	height
if myrect is initialized to x 1 y 2 width 3 height 4 the effect of should be the same as or even though it wouldn t be the same as

157272
width	height
a rectangle which stores x y width height and exposes them as read-write properties may have a right property but attempting to set it would affect one of the others

157282
put	get
get a diff history look at what he put in and see if any red flags jump out at you

157286
postgresql	mysql
both mysql and postgresql support ado.net connectors which saves you a lot of development time

157286
postgresql	mysql
i typically develop all my databases in sql server management studio then make minor changes to the generate sql scripts task output to get them to work in mysql postgresql

157320
emacs	sublimetext	emacs	textmate	vim	sublimetext	vim	emacs	vim	textmate	textmate	sublimetext
so go ahead and find an editor you like you might like emacs vim textmate sublimetext text.

157323
event-sourcing	saga
combining the two i.e letting aggregate roots use event-sourcing to outsource saving their changes before reporting back to the saga enables lots of nice possibilities one of which concerns my question.

157370
versioning	upgrade
a development.cfg configuration could override specific versioning clear the pins for others or pull in a whole new set of versioning by also including the configuration for a large framework versioning upgrade

157370
rss	feed
the python package index pypi publishes an rss feed of new packages various projects have their own news channels and for internal updates we use similar mechanisms

157370
versioning	upgrade
it is important for us to keep our buildouts repeatable and predictable however so we only upgrade packages when we actually need the changes in the newer versioning and have tested the upgrade

157384
yacc	jflex
i would like to compare these techniques with antlr with others tools like lex yacc flex jflex that i used while playing with several simple language designs described in different cs courses available online

157398
singleton	facade
write a facade or a singleton in a non-oo language

157405
width	height
edit i am trying to tweak the width and height of this css in order to make it smaller and is broken

157408
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
it follows similar principles to fubumvc openrasta and nancyfx unlike mr2 and asp.net asp.net-mvc which follow a base controller pattern

157461
tostring	gethashcode
there s also inheritance you can be sure that tostring gethashcode etc are available on anything and everything

157523
openbsd	freebsd
fsf recommends freebsd or expat aka mit over openbsd isc

157537
perl	tcl
swig is used with different types of target languages including common scripting languages such as perl php python tcl and ruby

157537
scheme	racket
also several interpreted and compiled scheme implementations guile mzscheme racket chicken are supported

157593
entity-relationship	diagram
i was doing my entity-relationship diagram for a rails application i m about to begin with and there i have an entity called class news so i d have a model classnew but i don t know if i will have problems in the future with the new part or what would be the right way to do this o how should i call the model

157646
pull	push
if your software does lots of different things you might want to use different commands or command subcommand git pull git push etc.

157646
stdout	stderr
use stdout stderr correctly

157716
pascal	delphi
i develop in object pascal delphi and once i came up with an idea i called it wident for simplifying navigation in the long files

157791
children	parent
every commit is effectively a branch any commit can have multiple parent and multiple children

157791
pull	push
you can t push that and if you pull from a repo that has the branch you stripped locally it comes back

157831
getter	setter
however reading guide designing for performance | android developers about internal getter setter it seems oo is not a good approach

157831
getter	setter
my question is what is best approach when designed android applications should i still use lots of classes with getter setter and lots of object passing around

157908
int	boolean
all functions take simple data-types as arguments boolean int floating point constants arrays as functions taking pointers can be awkward to translate into some languages

157922
iboutlet	ibaction
being of no programming background except for what i ve taught myself i personally believe that ib and all it s features iboutlet ibaction help coders of my skill level and all skill levels for that matter complete projects of theirs in less time

157957
singleton	facade
don t look up your code and try to find the right place to implement a singleton or factory or facade or whatever ...

157964
centos	linux
our setup is a virtualised centos linux machine with several linux user accounts where development takes place and the svn central repo is on a separate server authentication is using our ldap login the same corporate login used to login to our windows machines

157964
centos	linux
could there be another place on our centos linux machine that caches the login

158007
primefaces	icefaces
it has strong 3rd party library support primefaces icefaces etc

158043
bazaar	git
i don t care about which scm it uses - git hg bazaar all are fine

158047
rdf	owl
the most important advantage of using owl rdf is the exchange of knowledge between different knowledge bases or classification hierarchies and creating useful inferences without having to engineer all these bases beforehand to allow them to communicate

158061
post	get
in http the client asks the server to get post delete head etc

158083
pull	push
providing you keep the repos properly in synch this means you can use ordinary dvcs change propagation operations clone push pull and ordinary repos to build a replication system

158083
pull	push
changes can be propagated via push or pull

158083
pull	push
have a single repo at hg.duke.de and have the developers in all locations clone and pull from here and push changes here

158083
pull	push
all clone pull and push operations would go across slow long-haul network links

158083
pull	push
the other changes will be replicated to hg.duke.mx so i ll pull these changes locally merge and then attempt to push to hg.duke.de again

158083
pull	push
in mercurial you can set up a local repo to pull from one location and push to another by putting something like the following in the .hg hgrc file

158083
pull	push
continuing with hg.duke.de as the blessed repo and the others as replicas we can propagate changes via pull instead of push

158096
vim	emacs
also vim is always my first suggestion for anyone wanting to improve workflow or emacs if you re like that

158099
agile	sprint
try to use agile approach by delivering your items in sprint 2-3 week and making uat user acceptance test with client

158125
super	abstract
all the other stuff polymorphism abstract classes sub classes super classes is pretty much icing on the cake and varies greatly form language to language

158167
versioning	upgrade
i d generally prefer xml to json mainly because you can use xslt to transform xml when you need to upgrade the versioning

158167
serializable	deserialization
whatever you are serializing stuff as the deserialization logic and data storage should allow for versioning of the serializable data

158167
serializable	deserialization
version info should probably be outside the serializable data makes it a bit easier to get at and choose the right deserialization strategy

158185
required	placeholder
there are other situations that are more problematic like cyclical inheritence dll references recursive type declarations that often required placeholder types or are simply not viable given other design constraints

158206
srp	ocp
you would instead roll your own very-similar-but-incorporating-your-minor-change solution for this one case violating srp and probably ocp and slowly turning your codebase into a patchwork quilt

158206
cruisecontrol	teamcity
the usual solution to the above need for discipline and a natural tendency of humans to get lazy and compacent is a build-bot running a continuous integration software package like teamcity cruisecontrol etc which performs unit tests calculates code coverage metrics and has other controls such as triple-c coding convention compliance a la fxcop

158235
awt	swing	gtk	motif
it can be that a factory pattern is used to decide between two related families all providing the same interface but for example one being a swing ui component library the other being an awt ui component library or motif and gtk or a real implementation and a mock-up implementation for testing

158264
mvp	presenter
for example the mvp model view presenter pattern helps to introduce separation of concerns in asp.net webforms development

158281
post	get	post	put	put	get
however it does have the drawback that if you put methods in your resources for handling get post put delete etc then your resources become coupled to the front end

158283
unsigned	short
in the above example i ve packed the 11-bits x variable as an unsigned short using the little-endian standard c format resulting in 2 bytes of information then encoded that to base64

158311
express	nowjs
i don t have any experience with nodejs nowjs express or socketio

158316
codeigniter	cakephp
for php at least the mvc hmvc design pattern does tend to dominate the mainstream frameworks available zend cakephp codeigniter etc. but there are many different design patterns that one could use

158362
kde	gnome
i haven t looked myself but i bet you could find examples in the source code for x kde and gnome

158372
pull	push
have them use the gui they just have to learn to use 4 buttons pull update commit push and learn 2 or 3 concepts in order to save and share their work

158374
erlang	ocaml	haskell	ocaml
the apache thrift software framework for scalable cross-language services development combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between c++ java python php ruby erlang perl haskell c# cocoa javascript node.js smalltalk ocaml and delphi and other languages

158492
mouseevent	mouselistener
then the jvm creates the mouseevent object as well as other necessary objects for handling the event and searches for the listeners of that event think that the button object has a collection of mouselistener objects and you added your listener to that collection

mouseevent	mouselistener
it invokes the mouseclicked mouseevent e method because the mouse have been clicked and all objects that implements the mouselistener interface implements the mouseclicked method and it s specified that when a mouse is clicked the mouseclicked method must be called

158535
strlen	strcpy	strlen	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
people introduce off by one bugs or use a different problematic language feature. strlen instead of sizeof strncpy instead of strcpy etc.

158612
client-side	server-side
but even then there is nothing stopping a rogue sysadmin from just changing the server-side code that causes client-side encryption to well not encrypt anymore or use a compromised encryption key

158631
getter	setter
when are getter and setter justified

158632
getter	setter
this has meant that people have written separate setxxx methods if they wanted a public getter but a more limited setter

158632
getter	setter
the basic rules are that you can t specify an access modifier for both the getter and the setter and you have to use the extra modifier to make access more restrictive than the rest of the property

158646
lisp	scheme
if you are interested in lisp in general as opposed to common lisp specifically i d also recommend you check out clojure a modern pragmatic functional lisp and scheme a very clean elegant lisp ideal for learning

158647
solaris	aix
aix solaris hp-ux .

158647
put	get
given that project managers and management can t put their hands on the code and actually see what is being done unrealistic expectations regarding timelines get generated

158716
dynamic-languages	introspection
if the answer is yes lsp incompatible with introspection then my other question would be is there some modified weak form of lsp which can possibly hold for a dynamic-languages possibly under some additional conditions and with only special types of properties

158772
lsp	principles
to quote wikipedia s article on lsp substitutability is a principles in object-oriented programming. it is a principles and part of the design of your program

158783
ada	algol
the burroughs 5000 series was designed to efficiently support algol and intel s iapx-432 was designed to efficiently execute ada

158836
hash	salt
always salt your password hash to deter brute force attacks

158838
hash	salt
in this case you could upon registration generate a hash of the entered password for every salt used so far then check these salt and hash passwords against all the passwords already stored

158890
pull	push
as a distributed scm git distinguishes between the concepts make a snapshot of the working copy commit and sync repositories push pull fetch

158890
pull	push
github is intended for sharing code so if your project is on github you can allow others to pull from there clone your project act on pull requests from their clones or even give trusted others push access to your repository

158917
hide	show
based on its setting show or hide certain controls swap out the itemssource for the presets dropdown etc

158942
pull	push
there is the potential situation where i may want to edit the subrepo code and push it back or fork the subrepo code with a new project-specific while still being able to pull and integrate latest changes in that repo keeps things flexible in emergencies and deadlines

158965
singleton	facade
i wrote a standalone singleton class scaffold tonight that serves as a facade to a few other classes including a template class and a view class

158973
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
before commit developers should test their changes locally to make sure that everything works ok in the latest versions of ie firefox google-chrome and opera

158994
cobertura	jenkins
i set jenkins to get java classes run tests with cobertura and then launch sonar once every night during week days

159042
hash	salt
when a user signs up generate a hash using a different salt to the one you otherwise use

159059
srp	principles
srp is a design principles not a philosophical concept and so it is based on the actual code you are working with

159059
srp	principles
however as a practical principles srp should help you find the code you need to modify

159081
pascal	delphi
perhaps due to pascal delphi influence

159106
entity-relationship	diagram
tools like entity-relationship diagram may help you to design high level as well as low level class diagram

159116
pascal	delphi
borland later decided to improve this language extension introduced its delphi product designed from the standard object pascal

159116
pascal	delphi
it use the delphi language descendant of pascal to create application for the windows platform

159116
pascal	delphi

159116
freebsd	linux
based on free pascal lazarus is available for numerous platforms including linux freebsd mac os x and microsoft windows

159121
agile	sprint
however agile team supposed to deliver working software pieces or user stories in each sprint

159171
superclass	subclassing
even then it might not be good idea everytime if you add a value component to a subclassing and the superclass also has the notion of a value component

159187
ready	each
if you cannot setup a ci server then the practice should be that you need to manually create a new build for qa each time a developer checks in his finished code and claims he is done with a feature and ready to hand off to qa

159208
srp	principles
the first reason for that is that it helps to follow srp principles as usually a lengthy initialization process is an indication that the class does more than it should do and the initialization should be done somewhere outside of the class

159217
min	max
for aggregation there s aggregate average sum max min

159223
children	parent
i think the question is relevant to c++ and java programmers since it s dealing with the responsibilities between children and parent objects when a value of the parent depends upon its children and grand-children

159234
google-chrome	firefox
there s the v8 javascript engine that powers google-chrome and firefox s spidermonkey

159266
hash	salt
in addition to that i would also have a unique salt that s used before performing another hash on the password

159288
bellman-ford	dijkstra
bellman-ford does the same as dijkstra s but is slower

159288
bellman-ford	dijkstra
it returns a numeric matrix. it is far slower than either dijkstra s or bellman-ford

159289
ocl	uml
they are no better or worse than uml s ocl but they re more easier to grasp perhaps but also less scientific

159306
post	get
web pages are displayed in response to get and post requests sent by the browser

159314
3-tier	n-tier
you should know that mvc is just a very popular buzzword right now like 3-tier or n-tier used to be up until 3-5 years ago

159326
nsmutablestring	nsstring
some frameworks cocoa have data container classes that are immutable nsarray nsstring nsdictionary etc. and also mutable subclasses of those nsmutablearray nsmutablestring etc.

159326
subclass	abstract-class
it s the other way around actually abstract-class are used to force you to create a subclass generally to ensure that important missing functionality is provided

159360
google-chrome	firefox
if you can limit your supported browsers to ie10 new firefox and google-chrome and don t care about users behind broken proxies using native websockets might be an alternative

159383
greenhopper	sprint
we re using jira with greenhopper and currently our business analyst has tasks for their analysis which will eventually lead to new stories placed in the backlog running alongside the stories for the current sprint and it feels kind of messy - especially because they don t overlap the workflow for the development stories

159417
wordpress	joomla
php skills php mysql phpmyadmin wordpress joomla

159440
postgresql	mysql
study or try to have some basic experience with each database that exist like sql server mysql cassandra hbase postgresql and the whole no-sql world like mongodb and couchdb

159450
perl	tcl
overall i ve learned and used professionally perhaps a dozen languages in my career including fortran c c++ c# java perl tcl ruby groovy awk python sh batch dcl javascript and a few small dsls

159452
short	base
you could define a short fat class hierarchy - a base class with a pure test method and a derived class for each classification test - but this seems like overkill to me

159482
lisp	scheme
if you know lisp well scheme should not be much of a problem

159483
hash	salt
you wouldn t want to store old passwords even though they re hash salt etc in your database

159489
post	get
this article is a summary of a set of blog post trying to compare speed of c++ vs c# and the issues you have to overcome in both languages to get high performance code

159503
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade versioning of pylint a popular python style-checker

159601
srs	sprint
we elicit software requirements during the sprint planning meeting and we document the software requirements in a master srs

159624
stdout	stderr
if you are referring to the gof patterns have a look at stdout stderr and stdin in c

159626
zlib	libpng
based on zlib libpng license

159638
vxworks	rtos
the underlying operating system is wind river s vxworks rtos

159670
mouse	keyboard
user input only came from a single individual who no longer performed these job functions so important key combinations lack of keyboard support hot keys poor tab ordering and the need for a lot of point and click mouse interaction caused productivity to plummet

159697
jsf	seam
we are a small java web development team creating applications using various frameworks and libraries like jsf hibernate seam all together deployed in jboss as

159701
configparser	argparse
when i need to write an elaborate script with various configuration options i use python with the argparse and configparser libraries

159710
versioning	upgrade
for example say you estimate one month to switch but not switching means you can t use a module that s only available in the upgrade versioning so you ll have to take two months to implement one from scratch

159712
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
you could convert it from borland pascal to turbo c and vice-versa you could change the server os from freebsd to solaris from windows to linux from intel to ppc whatever

159712
cvs	svn
every single user-initiated change request is ui-based this is what svn cvs git logs show of every system because that s the language the user speaks.

159716
versioning	upgrade
on the other hand i d recommend to upgrade your frameworks to the latest released versioning

159762
youtube	vimeo
could you just link to a youtube video or vimeo link

159763
pull	push
once this happens let your continuous integration system pull the files back out of prod and after some automated checks have been performed push the changed configuration out to the actual production system

159821
moq	fakeiteasy
when you re writing unit tests and using mock frameworks such as moq or fakeiteasy to name the two most recent ones i ve used you re implicitly creating another class that implements the interface

159829
rss	feed
the good folks at pubsubhubbub have a great solution using rss feed

159829
rss	feed
enable your app with an rss feed

159869
division	multiplication
in c multiplication and division have equivalent precedence

159880
x86	64bit
as x86 computers shifted from 32-bit to 64bit they also shifted from using 8259-style programmable interrupt controllers with 8 interrupt lines

159885
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if you have a class which inherited from two distinct classes does not this mean that your subclassing automatically does at least 2 things one from each superclass

159888
srp	principles
let s focus on the main principles for srp

159933
feedback	review
if people are afraid that what they said 3 years ago is going to come back to haunt them then they ll circumvent the feedback process and be less than forthcoming in their review

159942
comparator	comparable
it may need to be compared to other foo objects and so it implements comparable with the comparison logic externalized in a comparator class

159942
equals	tostring
all java objects have a tostring method and an equals object method which means every object in java is responsible for both equality and self-representation

159957
ienumerable	ilist
i have read that it would be better to return an interface either ilist or ienumerable as opposed to returning a list

160030
fortran	ada
on my first professional assignment i had to deliver code written in ada c and fortran along with some sql and shell scripts

160054
lisp	scheme
this happens even though as stated in the comments javascript is very different from java and draws more inspiration from lisp scheme than from java

160058
rpg	jcl
when people where doing cobol or fortran they also typically did rpg and or jcl

160062
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have an application built without any libraries using php javascript html5 css and mysql that will support major modern browsers - ie safari firefox opera and google-chrome

160074
firefox	safari
when we used to develop in javascript we had to write three version of the same function in order to make the function works in ie safari and firefox

160086
git-rebase	amend
as far as i can tell the only way to do that would be to specifically use a git-rebase amend or other history rewrite to remove the original author

160090
perl	tcl
although i prefer python i know and still use perl and awk and sed and grep and sort and tcl and c and ...

160097
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
i m writing in java and awt which already gives me a pretty large range of devices but i m mostly interested in windows and linux debian ubuntu

160098
width	margin
make whatever god awful hack you have to and if possible paramatize the change if it is something commonly tweaked like margin width or title so it will be a little more straight forward to update the next time

160102
lisp	prolog
js has more in common with languages like lisp or prolog than java

160116
ready	each
they are like some workers in a company ready to work on some tasks each one taking some work space to work each one having it s queue of task to process

160168
getter	setter
in python luckily most of the times you don t have to write getter and setter to get access to class properties

160177
int	boolean
almost all other functionality is either simulated with the primitive types boolean true is any int with a non-zero value or supported through virtual or non-virtual method calls properties methods overloaded operators coercions and conversions all use method calls internally

160201
inherited	properties
i created a class from wich all other viewmodels inherited and exposed a t selected properties to bind to the view

160201
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
problem is i do not want to pollute my models ef poco classes with inotifypropertychanged idataerrorinfo ieditableobject etc.

160201
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
for inotifypropertychanged i can use something like notifypropertyweaver but my problem is ieditableobject and something to be able to use the attribute validation

160220
int	chars
which says that if both operands are of type int or chars the result is of type int

160223
post	get
however simply following their tweet and post you may get a good idea where their next speaking event will be

160224
vb.net	vb6
vb vb.net vb6 vba...

160259
apache	nginx
if you re attempting to cache static web pages then using nginx or apache is the way to go

160259
apache	nginx
pages you generate once per startup you should consider generating those and then moving the page to nginx apache etc as part of your deploy process

160278
agile	sprint
a specification doesn t promise to meet all the customers requirements and often a specification is limited to a partial piece of the system a rup generation or iteration but probably a bit more than an agile sprint

160319
mvp	presenter
when designing a gui application you should use mvp design pattern or one of it s variation like presenter first or model-view

160324
mouse	keyboard
as for web conferencing or desktop sharing software which you ll need in order to view each other s desktops and control each other s mouse keyboard for paired programming i ve used netviewer commercially my client had a license in the past before they were bought up by citrix and more recently teamviewer which is similar from a pure desktop sharing point of view but seems to have a few less features or maybe i just haven t discovered them yet

160324
mouse	keyboard
and there are actually benefits you can t knock over the other guy s coffee cup and you can keep your own favourite keyboard and mouse settings.

160440
vmware	virtualbox
edit#2 if anyone from vmware can hit me up with a copy of vmware fusion i d be more than happy to do the same as a virtualbox vs vmware comparison

160440
vmware	virtualbox
i really would like to see if someone with vmware fusion also sees this for vmware vs virtualbox compartmentalization

160453
getter	setter
that is it may have constructors getter setter but no methods with real substantial logic

160465
haskell	scheme
you can also use google trends for example here s a comparison of haskell vs scheme

160475
vim	emacs
use some smart text editor vim emacs rubymine to edit and navigate those files

160485
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
android java eclipse vcs at least bazaar git svn should not be a problem

160490
bazaar	svn
if you are familiar with subversion then you should feel right at home with bazaar the most common svn commands work exactly the same way in bazaar too

160525
haskell	ocaml
granted you ll probably get more done in terms of production code with f# or ocaml but haskell will bend your mind into the proper shape in order to grok functional programming

160530
put	get
the latter means that you get or create some instances of other components put them into named boxes variables and use them access their data and services

160549
put	get
put yourself in their shoes if you were hiring somebody would you pick the guy who might not know what to do with a compiler or the guy who has been around the block a few times learned to solve problems and can get some useful work done without a lot of hand holding

160591
boost	stl
is there a library that will be adopted into the ecma standard the way the stl and boost library were adopted in to the c++ standard

160600
flask	web.py
staying to python as much as i can though i must say that for something more along the lines of a real application i would have to vote for flask or web.py

160600
flask	web.py
but as i stated depending on your aim and level of programming skill you may want to check out some other more rugged frameworks web.py flask

160600
flask	web.py
i am pro-django fyi and pro flask web.py

160639
put	get
its part of what makes git special - in that once you have all the source locally you can merge and branch quickly and easily but it means you do not get to put the corporate restrictions on it either

160652
awt	swing	swt	swing
instead of swing which is based on awt rcp builds on jface which in turn is based on swt

160676
haskell	scheme
i have started learning about fp languages a couple of years ago haskell scala scheme and even though i am far from being an expert i found out that they can make me extremely productive for certain tasks more than c++ or java

160676
ocaml	sml
as far as i know not very much actually sml and ocaml offer similar advantages

160678
getter	setter
but then i wouldn t use public fields but accessors getter and setter

160682
accessor	properties
note that wrapping dat within a properties will degrade performance and offer no benefit since there s nothing that a properties accessor could do other than read write the field which wouldn t break some implementations

160720
children	parent
i really don t foresee stabledependency changing or being replaced by another implementation but on the other hand the practice of passing dependencies down through parent classes to their children parent child in the composition sense seems to expose the details of the children up through the parent which would be a violation of the law of demeter

160722
icmp	snmp
but i ll contradict myself by mentioning icmp and snmp as two technologies to consider if you don t want to roll everything yourself

160743
awt	swing
i d use java as that allows you to be very high-level and have user interface libraries awt swing at your direct disposal

160755
put	get
new requests get put on the backlog and priorities can only change on iteration boundaries

160755
agile	sprint
an average of one week delay half of a two-week sprint is plenty agile enough to handle all but the most dire emergencies

160757
super	implements
your class needs to implements interface isomething in order for something in the super class to supply something to you

160789
queue	fifo
today we have the qos implemented with 3 priorities low normal and high and for each level we create a queue and as soon as the packages are queue we send it forward in a fifo way the scheduler spend 60 of time with the high queue 30 the time with normal and 10 with the low queue

160789
udp	tcp
under high usage tcp will slow down and udp will keep flooding our queue

160789
udp	tcp
it means in the end udp flows will have better priorization then tcp flows

160789
queue	fifo
the choosen queue will still forward the packets in a fifo way

160809
pull	push
myself and the three other developers hg pull from bitbucket make our changes then hg push to bitbucket

160813
tax	shipping
the monolithic method will become a maintenance hassle when you decide you need to implement tax on some items and charge shipping on orders as well based on the total weight of the order

160834
free	malloc
if you re building your own container you re responsible for matching up all the malloc and free calls making sure allocations are successful backing out any partial allocations in the event of an error etc

160870
for-loop	loops
i would suggest that loops index in the first for-loop could be total_threads

160878
getter	setter
otherwise use an auto-implemented property getter and setter like

160885
getter	setter
when looking at an unknown code i don t care how many getter and setter they have made but i want to understand what components subjects are there in it and only then what i can do with them modifiers

160917
getter	setter
the reason for this is if you hide the properties and only expose them through getter and setter you have far more control

160917
getter	setter
having getter and setter exposed and the properties hidden means sometimes you don t need a property at all

160943
debian	linux
there is an attempt to standardize on package formats in the linux standards base project however it seems that debian was excluded from giving input and a subset of rpm was chosen as the package format

160943
ubuntu	debian
there does seem to at least be a desire to standardize but if i had to take a bet i would say that debian s packagae management system will probably eventually take over simply because of the sheer market share of ubuntu and some packagers either only doing debian packages or doing debian packages first

160956
getter	setter
boilerplate property getter and setter like this are almost always a bad idea

160972
put	get
put this together and you get

161010
getter	setter
it may be more helpful to have fields of type imaybemutablefoo which is implemented by both the mutable and immutable classes and includes both getter and setter methods than to have the fields of type ireadablefoo which includes a getter but no setter and require a typecast any time one wishes to write to the field even after one has tested that the field holds a mutable object

161031
min	max
after the parsing step we must check that the setting values √¢ √¢ belong to a specific domain of validity for example the maximum size of a queue should be a positive value some values √¢ √¢ may be related example min max and so on

161071
int	boolean
i d guess that you could get by with just a handful strings int floats boolean and enums

161134
versioning	upgrade
the database is the heart of the company and stores all their information it s a worth while investment to spend 7200 to upgrade to an updated and currently supported versioning of the database server software

161167
mouse	keyboard
you run a browser full screen and everything that you might want to do - keyboard mouse interactions sound video games text images power point presentations - everything is happening inside of it

161167
mouse	keyboard
the browser would only need to understand a safe clojure one that cannot wipe your hard drive clean and be able to draw and play music and listen to keyboard and mouse and similar things and everything else - drawing text playing a video displaying a combo box and interacting with it would be all done in a carefully designed library

161170
getter	setter
b your getter setter have any logic whatsoever

161178
puts	putchar
mixing c-style printf or puts or putchar or ... output with c++-style output can be unsafe

161179
hide	show
the right answer is to use a css hover attribute but somebody who has weak design knowledge will prefer to implement a dual show hide function in javascript

161179
client-side	server-side
client-side or server-side questions

161192
int	chars
warning conversion specifies type int but the argument has type chars

161196
put	get
if the only thing you really need is a dynamicprobabilitytree and you feel like your code is simple enough to fit in one class put all your code inside dynamicprobablitytree and get rid of your other classes

161207
agile	greenhopper
the best agile tool you go with greenhopper agilo .

161275
daemons	systemd
a common example are race conditions with creating opening files in unix which can in some circumstances lead to privilege escalation attacks if the program with the race condition is running with higher privileges than the user interacting with it such as a systemd daemons process or worse still the kernel

161301
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
i m using a registration function that hash the email in pbkdf2 with a random and unique salt each time

161301
hash	salt
the hash email and his salt are saved in the db

161301
hash	salt
1 - i change my hash method and use a common salt for all emails

161301
hash	salt
2 - i hash the email with all the salt from the db and check for matches

161301
pbkdf2	salt
maybe hashing emails with unique and random salt in pbkdf2 is too much

161303
getter	setter
when are getter and setter justified

161303
getter	setter
but assuming that i have an auto property with a public getter and setter

161306
getter	setter
the setter and getter can be modified without making breaking api changes

161306
getter	setter
if you know without a doubt that you will not need to modify the getter setter then you might be ok but why risk it

161308
getter	setter
you can easily change accessibility levels for getter and setter

161309
accessor	properties
while the same as the json representation in code it doesn t have the same creep because i don t have to redefine the tuple every time and properties accessor hide the appearance of creep

161310
getter	setter
with getter and setter you can at least inspect the data and modify it if necessary so your object s internal state remains consistent and valid

161314
disk	ram
6 disk space ram

161317
free	malloc
i came from malloc free but appreciate it..

161332
pull	push
edit it on a local copy and push to your remote repository then pull the changes to the server as needed

161373
inherited	properties
to be helpful the code should have an inherited object to access a parent s properties and its inherited properties and a parent s function to overwrite a parent s function and and have an instance of a multiple inherited where an object inherited two other objects

161378
wordpress	joomla
i hear a lot about cms systems like joomla and wordpress but i think my main problem is that i don t know much about the available tools other than visual studio and i wouldn t know where to get started

161388
i2c	spi
if you are using arduino you can buy hardware for it and download software including the i2c spi and uart support very reasonably

161388
i2c	spi
what input does what function uart rx tx maybe dsr dtr cts i2c clk data spi miso mosi clk spid ssel0..n

161388
i2c	spi
i2c and spi are synchronous serial protocols so if you indicate which input is clock you can sample or if desired over sample to determine whether data bits are zero or one when the clock transitions

161388
i2c	spi
you will potentially be able to show addresses data words and either direction i2c master or slave read or write or selected device spi

161388
i2c	spi
i2c and spi will be separate of course

161388
i2c	spi
i2c and spi may need to be more flexible about timing

161418
versioning	upgrade
the hosting uses php 5.2.4 a versioning released on august 30 th 2007 and cannot be upgrade to a more recent versioning

161429
int	chars
then size of a short int is at least 16 bits and not smaller than chars

161519
wordpress	phpbb
i need to get to know a totally new system for example wordpress drupal or a framework like symfony or maybe a big forum system like phpbb

161520
entity-relationship	diagram
actually if there is an underlying database i would add an entity-relationship model or utilize an uml class diagram as erm replacement

disk	ram
exceptions are situations a program can overcome like say you try to open a file and it doesn t exist while errors are situations a program can t do nothing about like a disk failure or a ram failure

addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
i need to design a function to perform the basic arithmetic operations that are addition + subtraction - multiplication x and division between 2 numbers

161605
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
however i m having difficulties figuring out how i should represent and deal with the unit for multiplication and subtraction operations as for addition and subtraction it remains the same in a way that i can chain up multiple operations and properly update the resulting unit every time

161617
multiplying	add
when you multiplying physical quantities you can just add the powers of the fundamental units

161628
accessor	properties
let s assume for a moment that one of the stateful properties has a backing field and the properties accessor test that a new input is valid based on the current one maybe the new value can never be less than the old one

161651
inherited	properties
the controls inherited from the standard web controls and add additional properties and functionality i m creating an extendedtextbox and i m adding a required properties which if set to true will add a .net required field validator to the control automatically

161651
inherited	properties
as i can t use true multiple inherited in c# how would i design this to be able to share the methods and properties

161670
postgresql	mysql
i ve spent the last year becoming really comfortable with mysql but due to its increasing trendiness and my desire to homogenize my web-apps with heroku i d like to start using postgresql for my web apps instead

161670
postgresql	mysql
what are the critical differences that i need to understand - syntactical and conceptual - between mysql and postgresql that will affect me on a day-to-day basis

161676
postgresql	mysql
even though i ve worked with both mysql and postgresql i m not sure of any fundamental conceptual differences between them

161676
postgresql	mysql
however there are definitely some critical syntactical differences between mysql and postgresql

161680
ocaml	scheme	haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml
for someone who just wants to learn what fp is about the differences between ocaml ml scheme haskell aren t half as important as your comfort with the material books videos tools you use to learn it

161681
jasmine	qunit
i recommend qunit for unit tests and jasmine for behavioral tests in javascript

161686
ember.js	backbone.js
i haven t worked with any of these frameworks personally but i know devs using backbone.js and ember.js

161697
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
there are lots of javascriptmvc mvvc frameworks out there like backbone.js and knockout but they are decoupled

161775
button	checkbox
while the basic gui controls like button textboxes checkbox radio button etc were all designed for minimum surprise factor and are in the public domain as ui concepts and there are well-known combinations of same that similarly reduce the learning curve through familiarity it s probably a bad idea to take a novel ui concept that one company developed under your watch for doing a particular task and bringing it verbatim over to your next job where a new project has a similar need

161798
interpreted-language	compiled-language
has unit testing in loosely typed interpreted-language need to be more thorough because test cases need to assess things that in a compiled-language wouldn t simply compile

161805
interpreted-language	compiled-language
has unit testing in loosely typed interpreted-language need to be more thorough because test cases need to assess things that in a compiled-language wouldn t simply compile

161814
octal	hex
doing some standard calculations with different bases 10 hex octal both integer and floating point

161924
next	except
remember machines don t know anything except what you tell them so if you want them to visit points in a specific sequence you have to tell them what that sequence is so it can perform the calculations to move the arm from one point to the next

161963
int	double
if you can use an unsigned int this double to 4 billion

161981
integer	unsigned
i was under the impression that any modern database used a 64-bit unsigned long integer as a surrogate key unique identifier by default

161988
int	double	int	chars
other sizes either go by n-bit int or names that mean different things on different platforms word int long short double word etc. or in different contexts chars

162027
mouse	keyboard
suddenly chess isn t chess it is chess with a mouse which is different from chess with a keyboard or network connection

162031
vim	emacs
many professional programmers use emacs and vim

162056
haskell	ocaml
for haskell it is stg-machine for ocaml caml-light it was cam-machine

162095
put	get
i m intending to put fuller details of this solution onto a blog or into a code project somewhere when i get time so that it can be developed open source into a full set of controls

162118
client-side	server-side
but while server-side technologies are mature stable and well accepted by backend-developers client-side technologies are immature compared to big server-side framework and disliked by many long-established developers

162118
client-side	server-side
how could the new and diffuse client-side developing in html5 js possibly be superior to big and well thought server-side solutions

162121
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
you don t need to worry that everything will fail and will have to be rewritten once new firefox google-chrome ie opera gets shipped

162125
client-side	server-side
i ve made the switch in 2009 from a server-side php framework to a client-side extjs solution tied to server-side web services

162126
client-side	server-side
both server-side and client-side code have their pros and cons

162154
agile	sprint
many projects run into significant problems with properly determining velocity so many agile projects use points to determine what stories make it into the sprint however they use hours when calculating the burndown chart

162184
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
both solutions are cross-platform and i suggest to use a gnu linux distribution on that pc maybe ubuntu or debian

162231
i2c	spi
device level interfaces for i2c spi rs232 timers usb may also be prime candidates for this tab

162237
getter	setter
i ve been debating with myself for two days whether i should use getter setter or logical names for the methods which change the values to these styles

162237
getter	setter
the easiest way to allow other parts of the program to access these variables would be to write getter setter methods so that you can do styles.setbold true and styles.setitalic false

162237
getter	setter
not only because a lot of people say that getter setter break encapsulation is it really that bad

162237
getter	setter
one moment i think i should write the getter setter and the next moment i lean towards the other way

162243
getter	setter
yes getter setter do break encapsulation - they basically are just an extra layer between directly accessing the underlying field

162283
lisp	prolog
lisp prolog c++ ruby python.

162362
versioning	upgrade
hopefully you you can get these changes from upgrade documentation but you may be forced to compare database versioning yourself

162387
srp	principles
btw - i m aware of the fact that class adhering to srp principles is also considered highly cohesive class but in this post the term highly cohesive refers to a class that has several closely related responsibilities

162391
unix	aix
makefiles are important on unix systems aix linux os x

162396
haskell	scheme
in one of the answers you received to your question i found this link quite interesting because it gives you a a taste of haskell and scheme

162507
vim	emacs
now i myself tried using both emacs and vim and i honestly cannot understand why would anybody use these for any kind of serious development

162508
mouse	keyboard
also how does does switching from keyboard to mouse break your train of thought

162509
vim	emacs
the interesting thing about vim and emacs is not simply how quickly you can work

162509
vim	emacs
it s the simple fact that vim and emacs let you edit your text at nearly the speed with which you think about making your changes

162509
vim	emacs
so instead of stepping back and make a visual selection and changing my mode of thought from code-writing to text-editing vim and emacs allow me to perform the edit and be done with it without having to expend more mental energy on the task of making the change

162509
mouse	keyboard	switching	screens
and when you take your hand off the keyboard to grab the mouse it s another kind of context switching you re no longer thinking about the code but about the text you can see on the screens and the visual elements that surround your editing area

162509
vim	emacs
with vim or emacs this context switch never needs to be done and your mind never needs to leave the task at hand that of writing code

162509
vim	emacs
a lot of people myself included use vim or emacs as their preferred tools because they re liberating in the sense that you spend less time thinking about editing and more about what changes you re making

162509
vim	emacs
the only limit to vim and emacs is that their primary purpose is editing text

162509
vim	emacs
i think the source of your consternation is that you choose not to see value in vim and emacs

162510
vim	emacs
i expect in the future pluggable libraries will be created to provide intellisense refactoring for various languages so one can have the same level of language support in emacs vim as in ides

162510
vim	emacs
for some languages such libraries exist already. if it happens then emacs vim will be the preferred development tool for a number of developers because they provide a different experience than an ide leaner quicker simpler etc.

162512
vim	emacs
vim and emacs seamlessly interpolate with the unix toolbox to create a streamlined development environment that really has no equal

162520
matlab	simulink
i believe this function is similar to the saturation function in matlab simulink

162545
gtk	gjs
in addition to node.js there is also gjs which is a gnome-oriented runtime giving access to gnome gtk and glib libraries among others

162586
feedback	review
this should be a regular opportunity for stopping small problems from snowballing because no one likes surprises at review time but much more importantly it should be a way to get feedback on how you are doing as a manager what you can do to improve individuals lives and what you aren t aware of in the team perhaps a team member who isn t performing

162591
haskell	sml
if you want more search and read for operational semantics for sml and haskell - it is different

162597
int	double
this is a double dimentional int array that keeps

162657
public	protected
protected variables generally have some intrinsic invariance associated with them or else they d be public

162667
put	get
in most modern oo languages it is a good habit in java afaik its necessary to put each class into its own file please don t get nitty about c++ where you often have two files

162678
des	aes
see comparison of des triple des aes blowfish encryption for dat a for details

162685
post	get
meaning i get a post and get all postcomments

162685
post	get
this means i make a call for every layer and if i m calling 100 post i might make 1000 db calls to get 10 layers of comments each

162721
put	get
any new random functions get put there until enough of them have accumulated for a pattern to emerge

162723
getter	setter
the accepted way to work with fields is to make them private and access them with a property and or a getter and setter method

162805
ubuntu	linux
i ve personally used the excellent ruby game library called gosu which lets you develop for windows linux and mac i tried it on ubuntu linux

162819
public	protected
template method pattern uses protected virtual methods in combination with a public non-virtual one

162819
public	protected
the situation can be reversed too - public virtual methods in derived classes may use a protected non-virtual method in the base class to supply data or behavior that should be protected from users outside of the base class

162827
post	get
the best thing for you to do is just to start with the default mvc scheme - where controllers and actions are allocated by url convention with the first part of the path determining the controller and the rest of the url and the request type get or post determining the action that ll be called

162832
folder	directory
so if you need to remove the content module just remove the folder from the modules directory

162835
public	protected
what if java.lang.object changes protected void finalize access to public or private

162848
public	protected
having delved into mvc development through codeigniter i designed my first web application to perform user authentication for protected resources in controllers constructors in cases where every public function in that controller requires the user to be authenticated

162881
post	put
it s something that should have been put in place early in the project or when there s time put aside in the project schedule preferably post initial ship for potentially large offending code refactor

162885
getter	setter
use getter setter instead

162887
getter	setter
as such there is no reason to have getter and setter

162910
decltype	auto
new auto semantics and decltype depends on your compiler s features - eg. __typeof__

162917
agile	sprint
we follow many agile processes including automated tests continuous integration sprint reviews etc.

162917
agile	sprint
what s the right way to manage branching releasing and ci builds using agile when we have such short two-week sprint cycles

162964
hibernate	gilead
check out if there s not already a bridge library framework that deals with this issue like gilead for hibernate

162993
mamp	wamp
for simplicity grab a copy of lamp linux wamp windows or mamp macintosh server and install it on your machine make sure to install a mysql and php environment

163010
mouse	keyboard
that describes a mouse or keyboard perfectly

163019
vpn	lan	wan	lan
is the computer on the other end under your control on the same lan wan vpn accessible by you under some agreement with whatever remote network the computer is hooked into

163047
put	get
put a beta update online and when you are satisfied with it mark it as a release so that everyone else will get notified of the update

163063
executable	upx
download speeds are important but your installer already compresses your executable so compressing them again with upx won t make a substantial difference

163063
executable	upx
if you re trying to make a portable no-installation-needed executable then upx could help but that s something of a niche market

163093
width	height
have your createimage method take a width height and then return the image having been resized at that width height

163093
width	height
the image width and height would be fixed but you d either have a display method that took a position and a target height width or you d have some method taking a width height that returned an object that whatever display system you are using

163093
width	height
an image itself wouldn t have a height width

163093
width	height
instead it would start with one imagerepresentation that had a height and width

163093
width	height
to resize an image you d ask the image for a representation with certain height width metrics

163104
consistency	acid
in fact since xml is not a software all acid atomicity consistency isolation durability properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably in a shared environment are left to the developer to build with the exception of durability

163119
serializable	deserialization
the serializable deserialization overhead alone begs for a different solution

163164
width	height
one approach might be to have your image constructor take a resource containing the image and height and width parameters and create itself appropriately

163184
lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
with some googling i could easily find some documents in compiler design in c java and c# and even in haskell but not in lisp except implementing scheme lisp in lisp

163198
getter	setter
forced try catch getter setter etc

163213
debian	linux	debian	mint
in my opinion if you re ambitious enough and you ve just started learning roll a linux distro doesn t matter which one as long as it has a good package manager and is relatively stable - i recommend linux mint or even debian itself and learn c

163227
post	get
kind of like slashdot where you occasionally get people replying sarcastic responses to your post with there fixed that for you

163275
inherited	properties
in theory an example of inherited would be a truck is a vehicle properties common to all vehicles can be implemented in class vehicle while those specific to trucks can be implemented in class truck

163278
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
when you use inherited a subclassing depends on implementation details of its superclass

163278
superclass	subclassing
if the superclass implementation details change the subclassing could break even though its code doesn t change

163309
imperative	declarative
to me it looks like you are confusing declarative vs imperative programming rather than functional vs object oriented programming

163309
imperative	declarative
if you mean that you lean towards declarative programming and away from imperative then that is a good thing

163334
agile	sprint
i know this was waterfall-ish agile is the same except you always do only a tiny part of this eg a few scenarios per sprint

163335
autofac	castle-windsor
i ve used various ioc containers castle-windsor autofac mef etc for .net in a number of projects

163337
put	get
if you hate school you won t get more out than you put in

163353
lisp	scheme
i assume by books about implementing scheme lisp in lisp you mean such titles as lisp in small pieces

163353
lisp	smalltalk
for instance first prototypes of smalltalk were implemented in lisp back in the 70s while for a more modern example you can take a look at cl-javascript

163372
cpu	processors
depends on the cpu - risc processors have more registers so take longer

163373
vbscript	jscript
vbscript and jscript through asp

163415
pull	push
doing this gives you a central location from which to sync to and pull from just make sure you push your latest stuff before switching machines

163415
basecamp	harvest
things like freshbooks harvest basecamp and google apps help remove the headaches caused by multiple machines by removing the local machine to begin with save for having a browser to access them

163421
google-chrome	firefox
web browser use either firefox with firefox sync or google-chrome with it s google account to keep history bookmarks and preferences consistent

163437
cvs	svn
i remember the same discussion when svn was new and people were used to cvs lots of arguments were given for not using svn but eventually svn became the most popular version control system

163445
jobs	cron
my research on this matter found me several ways of doing this using cpanel cron jobs and setting up scheduled tasks on the server

163449
lambda	first-class-functions
you can use an oo framework to get first-class-functions see the way lambda functions are defined in c++11 for instance

163466
google-chrome	firefox
i would guess maybe the best practice would be to run every page and it s functions a couple of times witness the result and repeat this in firefox google-chrome and internet explorer and all smartphones apparently to make sure it works as intended

163496
children	parent
i don t want to have to code this all in literals with long lists of what type combo-box text field etc of children node should be allowed on what parent

163544
put	get
frankly i m not sure that you are the right person to get involved either if you aren t willing to put in the time or the effort to work with the non-technical user customer and develop good technical specifications this is a key role of anyone performing requirements engineering in any engineering discipline

163572
google-chrome	firefox
it is available for google-chrome firefox and ie

163573
yslow	pagespeed
good tools for checking website speed and identifying slow areas are yslow and pagespeed

163589
vmware	virtualbox	ubuntu	linux
virtualbox and vmware works very well under ubuntu and ofcourse you can always switch to kubuntu if you want your ubuntu to look more like windows but stay linux

163589
ubuntu	linux
it is great to have a linux and especially ubuntu laptop if you want to work with multiple environments

163591
sprint	roadmap
even if only the first sprint is put on there and the other periods are blank this should be an excellent roadmap to finishing the project

163593
cvs	svn
one of the reasons why programmers prefer svn over cvs is the former allows atomic commits

163596
cvs	svn
other benefits of svn over cvs explained in above article are

163601
cvs	svn
one of the advantages of svn over cvs as given here is cheap copying and branching

163608
dictionary	map
in a way it s the equivalent of using a dictionary map to hold name-value pairs vs having class members when programming

163608
dictionary	map
so would you use a dictionary map over class members

163614
ant	maven
your build should be executed by a single command to something like a makefile or an ant script or a maven script depending on your language and target platform

163646
inherited	subclassing
in this case i think baseworker should implement the interface and that implementation would be inherited by its subclassing

163663
lisp	smalltalk
the fourth abstraction then was object-oriented programming which made its first appearance in lisp programs in the 60 s but was later exemplified by smalltalk in 1972

163682
pascal	delphi
some german schools are teaching haskell to pre-teens programming languages like pascal or delphi are beeing taught in every german school

163687
int	double	int	chars
a config value may not be parsable to a double or an int or a chars

163708
ilist	icollection
does interface a logically extend interface b for example ilist adding functionality to icollection

163736
agile	sprint
in agile process the product owner put the unformal ideas user story backlog items to the sprint iteration

163826
klocwork	coverity
a static analysis tool klocwork coverity - look for spms silly programmer mistakes

163827
ibatis	mybatis
i had worked on a project that used this approach using ibatis - currently mybatis

163864
put	get
my main critique of your approach would be don t make your bl directly depend on your dal put a layer of indirection in their where the bl receives the dal via ioc or ipc which is basically a form of ioc then the consumers of your bl get to choose what dal it gets

163897
pull	push
all our my company currently applications pull information from that database is their a way to get the following types of databses to either push data or push an event to allow the application to pull data

163936
factors	mean
there are other factors at play like a lot of the code is disposable and wouldn t pass muster in a business environment - but that s because the limited lifespan of a game and the accelerated development timescales mean the code is almost designed just to work not to be maintained

164017
base	fractions
additionally the number of lines of code that actually related to the problem in hand was a only small fractions of our code base

164043
feedback	review
rely on review and feedback

164116
google-chrome	firefox
to tell the difference between browser time and server time just use the built-in tools in google-chrome or firefox that show how long each part of a page building took

164120
post	get
post commit - do this kind of a reviews when you want to get opinion on a piece of code that might be improved

164200
vmware	virtualbox
virtualize you can duplicate your environments in vmware or virtualbox and save them

164222
octal	binary	octal	decimal
but the decimal system is just a notation which happens to have gained some predominance well in the computing world the case could be made for binary octal and hexadecimal

164244
fontfamily	font-size
but also the font-size and the fontfamily

164244
getter	setter
the easiest way to implement this would be to add getter and setter for every member variable but this just feels wrong to me

164244
getter	setter
so to use logical methods instead of getter setter

164244
getter	setter
however if i would implement getter and setter there are also issues

164244
getter	setter
see object oriented programming getter setter or logical names

164249
folder	directory
i have an application where i have the core code in one folder for which there is a virtual directory in the root such that i can include any core files using myapp core bla.asp

164253
getter	setter
you are correct in detecting code smell concerning getter and setter

164253
getter	setter
what you want is either a simple data class - skip the getter and setter completely or you want to create a platform independent abstraction that places a facade facade pattern in front of the rendering and style setting

164253
getter	setter
this could allow you to avoid getter and setter completely if you chose to make your element immutable

164261
sorting	filtering
i want filtering sorting freely add and remove items and transforming ex

164267
websphere	ibm
the portlets are deployed in websphere portal and the container offers a technology called ibm mobile portal accelerator that uses xdime to render mobile pages according to the device

164285
post	get
specifically if you didn t get it from the rest of the post i may not have been clear enough i really need some guidance as to where to go in terms of the design decisions for this project

164295
imperative	declarative
anyone can pick up imperative languages but learning them first makes it harder to learn declarative languages afterwards

164295
imperative	declarative
learning declarative languages first teaches good concepts for life and saves grief trying to get your head around it after learning imperative languages

164295
imperative	declarative
so i vote for learning a declarative language in school then a more popular imperative language which is the best way to instill good planning behaviour while minimizing the learning curve

164296
int	double
it works whether you pass in floats int double strings etc

164314
public	protected
differentiation between public private and protected method inheritance virtualization

164319
free	malloc
use new delete instead of malloc free

164371
superclass	subclassing
an instance method in a subclassing with the same signature name plus the number and the type of its parameters and return type as an instance method in the superclass overrides the superclass s method

164371
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the ability of a subclassing to override a method allows a class to inherited from a superclass whose behavior is close enough and then to modify behavior as needed

164371
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
in a subclassing you can overload the methods inherited from the superclass

164371
superclass	subclassing
such overloaded methods neither hide nor override the superclass methods√¢ they are new methods unique to the subclassing

164375
interpreted-language	compiled-language
the antonym for a compiled-language is an interpreted-language in which the source code is transformed into bytecode instructions at runtime line by line as they are executed without a compilation step

164393
getter	setter
if all they do is store data then why bother with any kind of getter and setter

164429
post	get
the advanced topics show you how to make post and get statements and whatnot

164430
client-side	server-side
it s tough to really list all the things you can do with server-side code over client-side code although if someone else made such a list i would find it really interesting

164460
codeigniter	cakephp
i recommend symfony 2 but also have a look at zend framework codeigniter and cakephp to see if their framework style fits with your programming style

164468
equals	gethashcode
so every type has methods like equals ... gethashcode etc

164480
public	protected
a static base class will allow using of all public or protected functions and members of that base class everywhere through your object hierarchy without referring to a specific class name or namespace

164480
put	get
you will get a much better architecture when you put those static methods into separate utility classes and group them thematically

164512
rss	feed
my app is fetching data from news sources by rss feed of websites in the server-side

164514
rss	feed
read the privacy disclaimers on rss feed that you are using

164516
division	multiplication
for example in 8-bit cpus that lacked multiplication instructions and were short on memory restricting the opportunities for inlining 6502 multiplication and division have been commonly implemented as subroutines

164524
put	get
i d say no you should not remove ads from the feeds especially if you re just going to add some ads of your own - that may or may not be legal check with a lawyer but it s definitely rude as all get out to remove his ads and put on your own

164531
put	get
the next best option would be to put both projects in the same repository this could get a bit tricky to manage if your project grows in scope

164588
int	double
these are int double arrays and so on

164594
getter	setter
the exact syntax used for method calls you could have some syntactic sugar for getter setter etc.

164609
versioning	upgrade
your code won t suddenly stop working unless when php remove the functionality you upgrade your php versioning

164647
put	get
identify a few key areas you see as needing improvement work out a nice easy fix for each you can always improve again from there put together some estimates on how long each would take and then take this information to your colleagues to see if you can get some momentum going

164648
width	height
width and height

164649
width	height
rectangle description height width corner radius

164665
implements	extends
e.g. if i wanted to extends pascal with a new kind of loop or some particular idiom i would have to extends the syntax and semantics of the language and then implements that new feature in the compiler

164665
lisp	scheme
are there other programming languages outside the lisp family apart from common lisp scheme clojure

164668
children	parent
i have a situation where i need to fetch all the orphan children there could be hundreds of thousands of these and assign them randomly to a type parent based on the following rules

164692
min	max
calculate max countofa and min countofa

164692
min	max
update the sum of min and max values accordingly

164692
children	parent
when you are done with 4 you may have some unassigned children because of existing parent that had more children than your target value

164702
lisp	scheme
commonly-used languages in the lisp family like scheme don t really let you add new syntax in the parser sense

164703
verilog	vhdl
i am thinking to take the next semester a course called digital systems architecture and i know that we need to program micro-controllers with several programming languages such as c c++ verilog and vhdl

164703
verilog	vhdl
besides i know basic verilog and vhdl

164753
hide	show
another option also not great is to split the view into chunks with partials and build partial views for each of the child types that are loaded into the main view for the base type then deciding to show or hide the partial in a single if statement in the partial

164776
express	node.js
i m currently developing an client-server application in node.js express mustache and mysql

164801
dropbox	skydrive
that s the opposite what a cloud service like google drive skydrive dropbox ... does it tracks each change you made

164839
put	get
they put it off because they don t want to affect other people too early and they don t want to get blamed for breaking the build

164839
feedback	review
...if you learn to check in early and check in often you ll have ample time for feedback integration and review along the way.

164850
screens	tablet
what that means is that when you go to the settings - pc info screens of a tablet device running an arm processor it will show you √¢ ≈ìwindows rt√¢ and not √¢ ≈ìwindows 8√¢ ¬≥

164858
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
what are the advantages of weblogic or websphere over glassfish or jboss since they may reach costs of millions of dollars

164860
jboss	glassfish
note that you can get paid support for jboss and glassfish as well in the latter case via a separate oracle glassfish server edition

164864
versioning	upgrade
if it ain t broken don t fix it. in when is so going to upgrade their jquery versioning

164900
public	protected
if the enum is strongly linked with a class then put it as a public or protected static inner class

164906
tiff	png
there are only certain formats that work on a web page if someone uploaded a tiff image you might want to convert it to jpeg or png

164950
entity-relationship	diagram
edit- or better yet entity-relationship mapping diagram as david kaczynski suggested

164969
integer	unsigned
if an expression contains variables whose value is bound at run-time only some basic properties can be checked when comparing an unsigned integer with 0 like this

164980
int	boolean
if you know some things about your data say that it is limited to int values between 0 and 99 a simple approach would be to make a table of 100 boolean parse the vectors once to mark the table to show which elements are present then compare your test vector against the table

164991
quartz.net	log4net
the project would be using other open source components like- nhibernate fnh log4net commonlibrary autofac quartz.net scheduler etc etc

164998
children	parent
i simply created my own object that could accept new parent and children similar to an xml node

164998
children	parent
you can then have properties for each node that can tell you if a class is a skill and you can easily obtain parent and children of any node you want for use in a combo box or otherwise

165046
superclass	subclassing
maybe in your subclassing you are calling a method from the superclass which relates on the state of the instance field a

165072
cpu	processors
what happens here is called software rendering the graphics command are not handled by any graphic hardware but instead by your usual cpu the processors that generally runs software

165077
width	height
you have to obtain the height and width of the available windows space and do the cutting and arranging of strips into columns in javascript

165095
feedback	review
although i don t know of any particular site that you can dump a full project for a code review - you could put snippets of what you consider suspect onto codereview.stackexchange for their perusal and comment then take that feedback on board and apply it elsewhere where appropriate

165128
folder	directory
after we moved to tfs 2010 got rid of this project and simply added a support directory in that solution s folder in the team project parallel to our main branches

165136
getter	setter
i am practicing oop with php and i am struck at setter and getter methods

165136
getter	setter
i can directly access the class properties and methods with getter method then what s the use of setter method

165137
getter	setter
one of the reasons for having getter and setter is to hide your implementation

165144
mvp	presenter
controller or other things in mv class of patterns like presenter in mvp or view model in mvvm are the hardest to catch

165156
folder	directory
that makes it easy to reference that dll by a relative file path which does not change even when you change the main directory of your project to a different folder

165160
postgresql	mysql
the first option can be heavy for a db if you go for recording all events so mysql i m afraid can become too small and if you want to go for rdbms solutions you may think bigger like postgresql or proprietary like oracle or db2

165202
ada	pascal
pascal and ada programmers didn t like c s terse open and close braces

165209
wadl	wsdl
you may also find it better to use wadl rather than wsdl 2.0 because it is less verbose and way simpler imho

165245
addition	multiplication
in addition you won t believe this but ms word doesn t have a shape of cross so i am actually using a multiplication sign that look like a giant monster

165268
children	parent
as i read in the documentation of heap data structure the algorithm compares the objects with existing nodes and places them in such a way that parent object is greater than the children

165283
trie	tree	skip-lists	trie	skip-lists	tree
since you say that sort time should be very little you are pretty much limited to using some sort of tree-like structure tree skip-lists trie etc.

165294
twig	smarty
before i go in and rewrite the code i m wondering if it makes sense to rewrite the views with a template engine such as twig or smarty but i don t have experience with template engines

165297
versioning	upgrade
if you already had an application developed for the older system things would be somewhat different as you would just upgrade it dropping support for the older system and letting people that did not upgrade use the older versioning

165302
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
monodevelop sharpdevelop and visual studio express being some of them

165398
lisp	scheme
lisp sicp book teaches you scheme and a basic interpreter-compiler for lisp like language

165402
redmine	bugzilla
and of course a bugtracker and ticket systems like redmine or bugzilla is highly recommended

165431
processors	hyperthreading
intels current generation of multi-core processors tend to have hyperthreading on them as well

165431
cpu	hyperthreading
so for example a quad core with hyperthreading has 8 virtual cores if you view the task manager performance tab you will see the cpu usage divided into 8 columns

165483
haskell	scheme
now for haskell the windows-support is ok you can get the haskell-platform but latley i tried to get a basic clojure scheme environment set up and it s just a pain on windows

165483
haskell	scheme
to make it short i want to explore more haskell clojure scala scheme and of course need at least good tooling for javascript html5 css

165490
erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme	erlang	sml	erlang	ocaml	sml	scheme	ocaml	scheme	ocaml	sml	lisp	scheme	lisp	sml	ubuntu	linux	haskell	scheme	haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml
i use haskell and scala and also doing some scheme common lisp sml ocaml erlang all under linux ubuntu

165492
notepad++	sublimetext
keep all my code on the host or on a shared network drive edit on the host using favourite editor still undecided between notepad++ and sublimetext

165495
config	ini
ini files are an old way of storing application config particularly in windows 3.x such as win.ini and windows 9x and system.ini

165501
ubuntu	linux
just install the virtual-machine with linux ubuntu - it is free

165528
disk	ram
all important building blocks of computers - cpu s ram cache disk - are mutable

165530
getter	setter
the getter doesn t have a doxygen comment but it does have a comment mentioning that there is no setter

165550
elf	coff
coff and pe formats for windows alternatively understand elf

165561
yacc	bison
he focuses on top-down recursive descent which let s face it is a lot easier than lex yacc or flex bison

165569
scheme	racket
if you re interested in scheme i would encourage you to try out racket which emerged from the scheme jungle a few years back

165644
ubuntu	linux
i have been using linux especially ubuntu and windows 7 for a long time

165663
swt	swing
similarly i looked at swt to see in what ways it was different to swing and to see if it was worth using and again found the ui thread idea and i am sure that these 3 are not the only toolkits to use this model

165669
yacc	bison
use lex yacc or bison write a parser generator

165669
yacc	bison
the lex yacc flex bison page above says the following

165672
erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme	lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
you might have a look at lisp or any of its derivatives clojure haskell erlang scala scheme etc.

165673
versioning	upgrade
if the dependency specifications are too tight you are in danger of versioning lock the inability to upgrade a package without having to release new versioning of every dependent package

165689
ubuntu	linux
i ve used haskell on windows os x and ubuntu linux so i can offer a few remarks about that

165727
put	get
the more details you put in the readme file the better as it will help other developers consumers get up to speed on your project quickly

165732
perforce	cvs
it outclasses scm tools like subversion cvs perforce and clearcase with features like cheap local branching convenient staging areas and multiple workflows

165756
goto	break
coversely removing the break keyword from the end of your case blocks will cause the flow of execution to unconditionally keep falling through to the next case until either a break return goto is encountered or the end of the switch block has been reached

165782
resharper	justcode
in addition re-factoring tools can assist in implementing and learnig standards - like the resharper or justcode usage by developers

165797
unix	bsd
personally i believe that outside of the c# and java world where development environment is dictated by your ide a development environment should always be a flavour of unix whether it be bsd linux or osx

165804
switch-statement	break
the answer is no - the if-statement is not like a switch-statement without a break

165804
switch-statement	break
you also asked why the switch-statement needs a break statement

165873
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
if on the other hand you hash them with sha512 but didn t use the salt the stakeholder wouldn t be able declare this as a bug just because she expected pbkdf2 to be used instead

165909
versioning	upgrade
what is a good practice in managing document format versioning upgrade with local storage implementation approach

165977
entity-relationship	diagram
relational databases will usually have entity-relationship diagram

165980
vbscript	vba
vb vba vbscript are case-insensitive and this was a decision made to allow non-programmers to easily get the hang of the language

166015
freebsd	linux
if you are very particular with gwbasic compatibility then choose bwbasic gwbasic enhanced for freebsd and linux but i don t think there is much of any difference with some others

166030
resharper	justcode
basically most re-factoring tools like resharper justcode etc.. in the market are very effective in statically typed programming languages

166040
mouse	keyboard
you have a tower monitor keyboard mouse printer scanner and speakers

166040
mouse	keyboard
alright you could just unplug the mouse and keyboard and reinsert them so everything is fixed

166040
mouse	keyboard
also weaving your mouse and keyboard cords through the jungle is a hassle

166082
disk	ram
consider that the windows api goes back to the early 1980s with windows 1.0 released in 1985 and requiring a whopping 256 kb of ram and either two floppy disk drives or a single hard drive

166102
ostream	istream	serializable	deserialization
the network wrapper will keep a boost asio streambuf while serializable deserialization will happen over ostream istream

166146
agile	sprint
it appears to me that scrum which is certainly considered an agile process is all about managing features and sprint and roles and stuff with nothing to do with tdd pair programming ci refactoring and other developer centric techniques and practices that i though until now are the heart of agile

166190
hide	show
i don t show it here but the task would likewise hide the details of how it stores its current status

166190
public	protected
i usually have a protected list of historicalstates that i allow the public to query if they re interested

166212
int	boolean
i have a graph class that has a list of edges a value for the number of vertices and and an int value for edges as well as a boolean value for whether or not it is directed

166254
maven	pom.xml
doing something like this would introduce your students to the concepts of maven which is used heavily in the java world and get them used to using it to setup projects manage the pom.xml and run unit tests

166255
redmine	trac
since trac uses multiple instances for multiple projects anyway i was considering using that but i neither know how well it adapts to simply git ing the database itself which would be be easiest way to handle the distribution due to git being used anyway nor does it include all of redmine s feature

166255
fossil	git
finally there is fossil which starts from the other end by attempting to replace git entirely and tracking itself

166255
fossil	git
i am however not too comfortable with the thought of replacing git and fossil s non-scm features don t seem to be as developed

166263
lsp	principles
l lsp liskov substitution principles is contravariance 2

166277
superclass	subclassing
if you call superclass instances method foo only some-code-before and some-code-after happens inner does nothing but if you call subclassing instances foo it does some-code-before some-code-in-subclass and then some-code-after

166284
floating-point	integer
floating-point is generally undesirable in hard-real-time applications both due to accumulation of error and the fact that fp computation is typically slower than integer arithmetic

166289
put	get
in a lot of cases it s far easier to just put a blanket prohibition on fp rather than try to insure that everyone understands what they are doing and that the numbers can t get away from you in unexpected ways

166307
onclick	onkeydown
use onkeydown onclick and other such event handlers to react on user actions

166310
fortran	ada
a port of the gnu compiler collection gcc including c c++ ada and fortran compilers

166313
freebsd	solaris
you can always intall freebsd open solaris etc but i don t recommend those for your first plunge

166315
int	double
also i think i have a philosophical issue with #7 which uses casting to an int to round off a double

166319
centos	linux
i use virtual box on both an osx machine and a windows machine to host linux centos and with a dual monitor setup and plenty of ram you don t even realize that it is not a real machine you are using

166334
mootools	zepto
it is a library just like zepto yui dojo mootools and prototype - one of which may be a much better choice for your current project

166433
flask	django
in python you ve got flask and others to counterbalance django

166457
haskell	ocaml
on the other hand there exist statically typed languages with essentially the same advantages as dynamic languages compact and comprehensible--with types mostly inferred but very much there haskell is perhaps the leading example but ocaml f# scala and others are in this category also

166482
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	opensuse
if this is the case then you might have to know about linux unix in general and i suggest downloading a distro ubuntu opensuse fedora and poking around as well as doing some reading

166485
short	base
short answer difference is in ecosystems they represent and client base that each refer

166489
squash	branch
when feature work is complete do interactive rebase squash all the feature branch commits into one commit

166502
children	parent
a natural way to implement an updateable tree with arbitrary numbers of children per node is to reinterpret a binary tree such that the left hand link points to the node s first child and the right hand link points to the next child of the same parent

166512
public	protected
for everything else you can use abstract classes with protected methods so you will have the same commodity to force implementation in subclasses but without being forced to let them public

166531
getter	setter
currently i have a preferencesinterface class that hold all preferences and is responsible to default all values with a dedicated method called on create and when needed all values are public so non getter setter also it have virtual savepreferences loadpreferences methods

166535
getter	setter
it would be good having a preferences class and a preferencemanager class that extends uses preferences where the former will have getter methods for all preferences and the latter will add setter for the same

166553
consistency	acid
re atomic consistency - acid consistency may well be a requirement of the system

166553
consistency	acid
the above doesn t really argue against that and you should realise that acid consistency doesn t require you to run all your business logic inside the db

166588
ienumerable	iqueryable
instead of list return ienumerable or even iqueryable which will allow the consumer to filter it even more and instead of foreaching return the realitem from the selector like so

166640
lisp	scheme
i m making a programming language and having spent some time in lisp scheme i feel that my language should be malleable

166642
lisp	prolog
while i do understand the concept of lisp macros and how it extends the language the language that i most associate with this ability is prolog

166649
for-loop	loops
for example in a c-style for-loop the third expression in loops header is evaluated only for its side effects

166653
mouse	keyboard
it inputs commands from the keyboard and mouse interprets them according to the ui rules to determine their meaning and makes calls to the underlying os based on the meaning

166661
put	get
from experience i can tell you it can be frustrating to get estimates from team members who will put it off give you estimates they make in two minutes based on the task name without reference to a requirement or feature description or the existing code or who insist that several of the tasks you list can be done in some fraction of a day even though past projects have spent weeks on similar issues

166676
chown	sudo
if you want to make it to where you don t have to use sudo in order to install globally just run sudo chown -r user user usr local bin

166715
inherited	subclassing
you can now create a subclassing of foo and the inherited factory method would then produce instances of that subclassing

166725
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
this can be done with either a breadth-first-search bfs of a depth-first-search dfs algorithm

166726
post	get
thus it will have a clearly-defined api which consists of providing responses to http get and post requests made by a remote application

166726
post	get
for example receive all results of get and post requests as strings of xml json which requires a client-side parser

166739
srp	principles
i ve recently read clean code and want to heed some of the advice within with particular interest in single responsibility principles srp

166770
short	base
short answer author is just emphasizing that a class may inherit only from one and only one base class

166793
lisp	scheme
but when taking all dialects together - scheme for teaching and extension languages common lisp for enterprise-size applications emacs lisp for the one true editor clojure for the cool young java kids.

166793
lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
question three common lisp is decidedly non-pure while scheme more closely resembles pure axiomatic systems like haskell which rigorously separate side effects from computation

166800
lisp	scheme
within the realm of fp lisp common lisp and scheme being the most prominent dialects with clojure as a relative newcomer is probably leading the pack in terms of number-of-users as well as library and platform support

166818
erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme	lisp	racket	lisp	scheme	scheme	racket
for dynamic typing look onto erlang crossplatform makes emphasis on concurrency parallelism and network communications and lisp descendants clojure for jvm platform racket scheme native code

166818
sml	racket
sml family is dying except f# so i d probably stick with f# they say it has problems with mono or some racket dialect

166818
erlang	lisp
i clearly stay on static side but i m well aware that many prefer dynamics lisp dialects erlang and so on

166820
postgresql	mysql
let s assume a successful web spring application running on a mysql or postgresql database

166838
g++	gcc
then upon compiling you d just define either xx_linux_build or xx_windows_build via your build script which sets the required compiler command line arguments -dxx_linux_build with gcc g++

166840
post	get
i ll post the reply here when if i get one

166877
vim	emacs
take compiling good text editors vim emacs readily support error message parsing and will jump directly to the error in the code

166912
srp	principles
edit as patkos csaba correctly points out the principles being applied here is the single responsibility principles srp - the class you are trying to create should really have one responsibility defined as a reason for changing

166951
jobs	cron
is there any way to run schedulers schedule programs for example cron jobs using objective-c at ios platform

166951
jobs	cron
i think for this purpose cron jobs can be a vital part

166961
profiler	gprof
the gnu profiler gprof can be used to profile any application right on the device allowing real world profiling

167008
agile	sprint
agile projects typically employ a top level backlog known as a product backlog or release backlog and each agile team working on a project typically creates a backlog for each development iteration known as an iteration backlog or sprint backlog

167073
versioning	upgrade
i have personally introduced versioning control to 2 small companies have upgrade 1 medium company from something god awful to svn best option at the time and worked in another small company that had only some vc wrote their own vc solution for some code and had lots of code just not in any vc

167086
elf	coff
why doesn t open source compilers contain builtin funtionality for shared caching and reuse-fetching using sha1-hash of compiler-version build-flags target-platform and inputs of executable output objects elf or coff similar to what ccache does and scons

167104
trac	bugzilla	redmine	bugzilla	redmine	trac
i have used trac bugzilla redmine and a few others and we have settled on redmine

167157
stdout	stderr
in this case both the shell and the child process can interact with stdout stderr but stdin is typically intercepted by the shell

167166
fixed-point	fractions
fixed-point works by using sufficiently large integers and implicitly reserving a part of their bits for the fractions part

167166
integer	fractions	fixed-point	fractions
for example a 24.8 bit fixed-point number reserves 24 bits for the integer part including sign and 8 bits for the fractions part

167166
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fixed-point
fixed-point numbers used to be popular when hardware floating-point units were uncommon or at least much slower than their integer counterparts

167166
floating-point	fixed-point
while fixed-point numbers are somewhat easier to handle in terms of exactness if only because they are easier to reason about they are inferior to floats in pretty much every other regard - they have less precision a smaller range and because extra operations are needed to correct calculations for the implicit shift fixed-point math today is often slower than floating-point math

167166
floating-point	fractions
note that while decimals can accurately represent non-repeating decimal fractions their precision isn t any better than that of floating-point numbers

167166
rational-numbers	integer
rational-numbers store a numerator and a denumerator typically using some sort of bignum integer type a numeric type that can grow as large as the computer s memory constraints allow

167175
scheme	prolog
likewise there are prolog variants for rules-heavy applications scheme variants for compilers and so on

167178
int	double	int	chars
in a language like c or c++ simple native types like int chars float double in full features architectures with floating point hardware may typically become sequential machine instructions like the other statements in the code block

167178
x86	64bit
x86 was 1 3 as big and unlike the 8 bit architectures that had many run time calls for simple things like adding 32-bit and 64bit integers it was all generated by instructions sequences

167208
ready	each
quality assurance is a phase that each feature product must go through before it is ready for end-users

167218
ocaml	scheme	lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme	haskell	ocaml
otherwise you can try haskell common lisp scheme f# ocaml and others

167238
freebsd	linux
on the advice of my relative we switched to freebsd and linux and three months later rebuilt everything for virtually nothing using the same people

167257
children	parent
that can t be done because parent classes are totally oblivious of it s children

167333
agile	sprint
in the agile scrum methodology planning poker is seen as an effective way of using the whole team to rapidly estimate the effort required for the user stories in a sprint presuming this is what you are talking about

167334
punctuation	words
as you gain experience in a language you ll think less about the individual symbols and more about the idea that a given bit of code is expressing so a keeping a list of symbols handy is rather like keeping a words and punctuation marks handy to help you in your reading -- it s simply not necessary

167365
pull	push
author pull feature branch back and answer comments in similar way or improve code and push it back

167371
google-chrome	firefox
this is probably also why the browsers like google-chrome and firefox still need to restart to finish the updates

167445
userid	usergroups
and also how would it be good to store group membership in a user for example would be good to have id name password groups 1 myname mypassword 1 2 3 4 5 and explode it via php or one registry for every group membership in a table named permissions example userid usergroups values 1 1 1 2

167469
versioning	upgrade
so you should double-check if that open source project really requires 2.0 only or if it is possible to add under the current versioning and allow the project to upgrade smoothly

167483
hash	salt
make sure you hash encrypt your sensitive data passwords -- i suggest using a salt with your password encryption

167492
versioning	upgrade
it s written in delphi 7 has upgrade versioning over time and has been worked on by a lot of developers over the past 20 or so years

167567
post	get
in the meantime i want to get ready for the next challenge so i m reading their previous blog post and seeing how to solve their previous problems

167622
lisp	scheme
that being said javascript is not homoiconic in the same way as common lisp or scheme

167628
put	get
but i still believe in the old fashioned rule that you get out of it what you put into it

167628
put	get
or perhaps more accurately you don t get out what you don t put in

167653
lsp	principles
i think commutativity in a class hierachy should be ensured otherwise this would violate the liskov substitution principles lsp which says

167686
serializable	deserialization
a third case where reference equality is desired is serializable you need to keep track of object instances by tracking their references even if they are logically equal in order to be able to produce an isomorphic graph upon deserialization

167692
phpstorm	rubymine
you can see their other offerings with intellij and rubymine phpstorm pycharm - all avoiding asp.net and mvc

167701
lisp	prolog
for a few decades the programming language of choice for ai was either prolog or lisp and a few more others that are not so well known

167703
haskell	ocaml
thus i d say python is the recent language of choice but you could also use haskell or ocaml or f# or c# or even java

167712
mouse	keyboard
logical cohesion logical cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they logically are categorized to do the same thing even if they are different by nature grouping all mouse and keyboard input handling routines

167734
srp	principles
martin brings up the term fragile design in connection with srp the single responsibility principles

167735
guava	lambdaj
for a jdk8 collections comparison with pre java8 libs like guava functionaljava and lambdaj

167750
unification	inference
for prolog this is an inference engine based on unification

167750
unification	inference
as an example type inference in functional languages use hindley√¢ milner which is based on unification

167750
ocaml	prolog
the inference engine for prolog is implemented in ocaml and being translated into to f#

167791
typedef	struct
the interface can include #defines class typedef struct definitions function prototypes and less preferred extern definitions for global variables

167800
unix	bsd
ironically osx is based on a free bsd unix kernel

167802
quicksort	mergesort
as i attempted to make sense of the implementation of quicksort and mergesort it occurred to me that although i do programming for a living and consider myself decent at what i do i have neither the photographic memory nor the sheer brainpower to implement those algorithms without relying on my notes

167816
agile	sprint
one way that agile methods like scrum are superior is that scrum sprint for a time frame that does not get longer with iterations

167821
pull	push
just pull merge locally and run commit tests before you push it s simple

167848
vmware	virtualbox
even better would be a full up vmware or virtualbox virtual machine image that might include a full complement of preinstalled tools as well

167851
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian	gentoo	linux
google uses lots of linux internally i imagine they also have their own versions of red hat suse debian perhaps even gentoo and of course ubuntu

167851
ubuntu	debian
the good news is that the guys there have been good about sending us patches and we do our best to integrate them into mainstream ubuntu and push them on to debian and upstream

167851
ubuntu	linux
thomas bushnell the tech lead of google s goobuntu team recently august 29 2012 discussed goobuntu in his ubuntu gnu linux at google talk at linuxcon explaining that

167855
i2c	spi
patterns are something of a meta-concept and are no substitute for down and dirty details like memory maps programming peripheral devices like timers uarts spi i2c atod dtoa pwm etc

167858
x86	mips
arm x86 ppc mips itanium sparc .

167915
postgresql	mysql
i want to add databases traditional client server rdbms s like mysql postgresql as opposed to nosql or embedded databases to my toolbox as a developer

167954
cos	sin
so i can store sin 45 1024√¢ 1 and cos 45 1024√¢ 1 only.then use this formula

167961
imperative	declarative
i think the difference has to do with the way functional declarative programming makes statements about a problem as though it s a math problem where as imperative programming describes a process

167989
shadowing	named
as a side note gnu s c++ compiler along with others provide a -wshadow option or equivalent that warns about parameter named shadowing data member named

167989
shadowing	named
there is a third option with c++ use shadowing where appropriate in the declarations of constructors and setters but use different named in the definitions of those member functions

167997
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
2 teach them what radiobuttonlist and checkboxlist convert into along with label span panel div and the other non-obvious control-to-html stuff

167997
listview	gridview
teach the designers the basics of gridview listview etc

168010
mocha	sinon
currently we use sinon with mocha but ready to switch to buster.js since its features are really neat

168051
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
git is really great on os systems like unix bsd linux solaris and their derivatives

168051
bazaar	svn
if you re looking on getting out of svn you might want to evaluate bazaar for a bit

168057
getter	setter
getter and setter though i presume typescript will get those eventually

168075
hash	salt
passwords should never be written anywhere except to the database in a one way cryptographically secure hash function with unique salt for each user and multiple rounds of hashing see footnote

168075
hash	salt
footnote to log someone in hash the supplied password with the same hashing algorithm and the salt from the original hash for that user

168106
g++	gcc
however after switching from the command line and or geany to code blocks i noticed that code blocks uses g++ to compile the programs instead of the gcc that i am used to even though the project is definitely specified as c

168109
g++	gcc
both gcc and g++ are frontends to the gnu compiler collection

168110
client-side	server-side
we need a tool to auto-generate documentation for both the server-side and client-side code

168126
g++	gcc
that set for gcc doesn t included libm it is included in the default set for g++

168126
g++	gcc
g++ will not auto-detect additional libraries if they are needed afaik neither will code blocks libm is a very particular case some will argue that the fact that gcc doesn t link it by default is a bug in gcc

168134
getter	setter
is there a best practice for the order to define getter and setter in

168134
getter	setter
getter setter pairs

168134
getter	setter
first getter then setter or the other way around

168134
getter	setter
to illuminate the difference here is a java example of getter setter pairs

168134
getter	setter
and here is a java example of first getter then setter

168139
getter	setter
the oracle java code conventions section on file organization doesn t explicitly mention the placement of getter and setter but it does say

168141
getter	setter
ever java ide can generate getter and setter for you

168148
getter	setter
in java there s no real advantage to either order but in c# for example you have the concept of properties which group the getter and setter together so it kind of enforces that ordering

168148
getter	setter
setter private setter public getter you d probably do the opposite since the visibility modifier is given once for multiple methods rather than individually for each

168156
getter	setter
group the getter and setter for a single field together in pairs

168156
getter	setter
grouping all the getter together and all the setter together makes it hard to tell which fields have just getter or just setter

168156
getter	setter
when i am reading code or looking for specific functionality i envision a class as having fields with each field having a getter and a setter

168156
getter	setter
it doesn t make sense to me for a class to have a getter group and a setter group each having fields

168266
client-side	server-side
typically the view is either a server-side template which results in actual html being generated or a client-side template or other javascript code which results some html being updated on the client side in the latter case the model is typically sent to the browser as ajax

168266
client-side	server-side
my advice would be to figure out exactly why you d like this game to be heavily client-side cost user experience etc and to consider moving most of the functionality into the server-side

168314
cvs	svn
many vcs s physically change the file to show where the conflicts are - git svn and cvs use type markers

168314
squash	merge
you could squash all you merge commits together before you pushed for example

168320
ember.js	backbone.js
i m going down that path and experimenting with ideas of my own checking out git repos of popular code organization libraries like dojo backbone.js ember.js etc

168330
squash	branch
if i m working on a team by myself i can maintain useful commit messages when merging branch by squash all the commits to a single diff and then merging that diff

168330
squash	branch
in that situation the branch will be pushed to a remote repository meaning that i can t squash all the commits in the branch down to a single commit

168368
ethernet	wireless
for example what happens if you purchase the product on your laptop while you re using your ethernet card and then undock and start using your wireless card

168383
folder	directory
inside myproject folder are all the project files plus a directory that has svn or git info of my project the repo master

168388
pull	push
just need to make sure you push the latest changes when you are done so you can pull them when you get to the new workstation

168393
hash	salt
the first part is salt and hash on a first server and stored in the database

168393
hash	salt
the second part uses a different salt different hash and a database on a different server

168451
quicksort	mergesort
examples mergesort quicksort strassen√¢ s algorithm fft

168485
cobertura	jacoco
since several weeks we have recurrent discussions with the bangalore teams main part of the development is made offshore in india regarding the exclusions of packages or classes for cobertura our code coverage tool even if we are currently migrating to jacoco

168494
feedback	review
positive feedback might be just as useful for the developer being reviewed and for the others that participate in the review

168496
feedback	review
if i saw something in a code review that i really liked and was above and beyond good-enough code i d give positive feedback

168500
feedback	review
if everyone comes to the meeting with the attitude that this is not a personal review of the programmer but an effort to improve coding practice for the quality of the entire system then all feedback is good feedback

168500
feedback	review
at the very least if one doesn t go to that length it should be stressed that striving to do a good feedback bad feedback good feedback bad feedback cycle within the review process is only going to come across with the same backhand compliment feeling

168501
feedback	review
there are plenty of opportunities to give positive feedback without cluttering up the code review database

168501
feedback	review
set time that is specific to helping the developer outside of code review but that doesn t mean you should exclude code review feedback

168508
feedback	review
if you go to a code review and the best outcome you can hope for is no comment there is no balance of positive feedback the meeting could easily be titled in outlook find out how badly people think you suck

168536
feedback	review
positive feedback in code review is exactly as important as positive feedback in any sort of review

168549
move	drag
you can move the current execution while executing drag the arrow that indicates the current line

168601
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
very good especially given perforce s competition cvs svn etc over most of its life but no not as good as git

168646
initializer	class-method
as constructors are class-method whose sole purpose is to keep the object in a valid state when initializer

168651
capitalize	capitalization
the convention regarding capitalization is that the first letter of each word is capitalize

168654
multiplication	exponent
the reason why in mathematics stacked exponent are applies from the top down is that the other way you just get multiplication of exponent

168692
quicksort	mergesort
but the principle behind mergesort quicksort - recursion partitioning etc are very basic one and every programmer should understand

169802
getter	setter
you should also decide which version of ecmascript to target and if you are targeting ecmascript 5 use the provided language features getter and setter

169829
codeigniter	cakephp
i ve used cakephp quite a lot but i ve heard good things about codeigniter too

169842
vim	emacs
at times i used to resort to writing code in vim or emacs my favorite

169848
lisp	scheme
this question is centered around scheme but really could be applied to any lisp or programming language in general

169864
post	get
you get the post data and assign it to the person object and if there is any error it should happen there before you reach the mappign step

169920
vim	sublimetext
many python programmers prefer a text editor approach to coding using something like sublimetext 2 or vim where it s all about the code plus command line tools and direct access and manipulation of folders and files

169925
sorting	filtering
i have my code written so that it deals with the paramaters - sorting filtering the queryset then bit by bit does some processing on the objects my query has returned

169933
sorting	filtering
as you mentioned that your method involves sorting filtering then you better have separate methods or functions for these tasks

169962
vim	emacs
i am perplexed by this job requirement as my mentors and some of the best coders i ve seen in my life were vim emacs ninjas

169980
vim	sublimetext
many python programmers prefer a text editor approach to coding using something like sublimetext 2 or vim where it s all about the code plus command line tools and direct access and manipulation of folders and files

170191
width	height
i ve created a specialist kind of rectangle called square which maintains that width must equal height at all times

170191
width	height
every time you derive one class from another think about the base class and what people might assume about it such as it has a width and a height and they would both be independent

170256
ssl	https
in order to get around ssl and https you d need to be running an https proxy on your firewall

170275
sorting	filtering
i have my code written so that it deals with the paramaters - sorting filtering the queryset then bit by bit does some processing on the objects my query has returned

170293
mouse	keyboard
no access to the physical computer all the computers were stored in a locked room with holes in the wall for display keyboard and mouse

170384
superclass	subclassing
and herein lies the substitution principle a subclassing must be substitutable for a superclass

170429
agile	sprint
we work agile on the mainline with a rapid 1 week sprint using continuous integration

170444
division	multiplication
for low level languages such as assembly and c this can translate directly to processor operations bit shifting for division and multiplication for example meaning that using these number bases ends up with much faster code

170448
division	modulo	division	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
multiplication division and modulo powers of 2 are much faster than general division

170451
hex	binary
you will find very little use of bases other than binary hex and decimal

170454
short	base
the most common valid reason to use other base has to do with ease of conversion to base 2 it is trivial to convert a base-8 or a base-16 number to binary without using a calculator by memorizing a short table of eight or sixteen numbers

170454
hex	binary
when a number represents a bit mask it is more practical to write it down as a compact hex number rather than a much longer binary number

170454
octal	binary
certain architectures went out of their way to make their binary code easy to read when printed as octal numbers

170454
octal	binary
i knew several people who could read pdp-11 binary code off the screen without a disassembler but they needed the machine code to be printed in octal system

170457
ssl	https
and of course you still want to use https ssl to secure data on the wire

170460
hide	show
lots and lots of javascript and ajax code for things not related with the business but with the necessity to hide show that button refresh this listbox grey-out that label etc

170464
sml	scheme	sml	racket	ocaml	scheme	ocaml	sml	ocaml	racket	lisp	racket	lisp	scheme	lisp	sml	scheme	racket	haskell	scheme	haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml
most functional programming languages common lisp scheme racket clojure haskell scala ocaml sml support some common higher-order functions on lists such as map filter takewhile dropwhile foldl foldr see common lisp scheme racket clojure side-by-side reference sheet the haskell scala ocaml and the sml documentation.

170470
put	get
if you follow some pretty basic design principles while designing your web service you could also get significant benefits by reusing mature server-side infrastructure that has been put in place for example you can get cache and proxy services for free

170483
ravendb	couchdb
you might want to look out couchdb or ravendb -- both are document dbs with map reduce capabilities that work over json and http much like many modern web services

170484
hex	binary
x00 - some oss and hardware devices apis expect the arguments to be in hex binary

170492
button	checkbox
it will read all the forms load a home page that has links to them all or embed them in some tabbed or paged home page and for each of those forms it will read the various text boxes checkbox radio button submit button combo boxes labels and whatnot from the controls and form-to-control join tables lay those elements out according to the database and link all the controls to logic according to other rules in the database

170503
post	get	post	put	put	get
http has get put post as used mostly

170503
stateless	stateful
is this stateful or stateless

170553
octal	decimal
most commonly used programming languages support bases 8 octal 10 decimal and 16 hexadecimal directly

170553
division	multiplication
by directly support i mean that they allow entry of numerals in that base without resorting to mathematical tricks such as bitshifting multiplication division etc

170574
post	get
that is for example if i m fetching data to populate a menu etc. i would use get but to update data save a record i would use post

170608
haskell	ocaml
among the languages that have very tight compile-time checking but that are considerably cleverer than java about inferring what it is they are supposed to check ml ocaml standard ml f# haskell and scala are especially worth knowing about

170620
post	get	filtering	grouping
the reason i return iqueryable is for the same reason ayende mentioned in his post the client can further filtering sort grouping and even project the result using linq and you still get the benefit of it all being done server side

170646
haskell	ocaml
functional languages are usually the most careful on this regard and they have custom types to manage it maybe in haskell option in ocaml f# scala ...

170649
int	chars
in this case assigning an entire chars byte or int to each switch would be both inefficient and silly a switch or light has 2 positions - on and off - why would i assign something that has up to 256 positions or 2 16 positions etc

170649
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
using anything that s base 2 n in programming for things like handling rgb data lots of signal data - gps s audio ascii etc - is much simpler in hex binary and octal since that s how it s represented in the machine and one can more easily discern what s being presented and how to manipulate it

170653
recursive-descent	lalr
after that i searched how i could do this and that led me to stuff like ll parser lalr parser recursive-descent parser context-free grammars etc

170662
octal	binary	octal	decimal
octal fit real nicely on these displays and was easier than binary or decimal

170726
getter	setter
if a method is not complex enough like getter and setter

170740
getter	setter
a simple example would be testing a setter method when a getter is not actually needed for anything in the real code

170751
public	protected
you could add public functions to return the value of all the protected variables - but that would break encapsulation rather more

170820
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql both make it fairly straightforward to have one or more read-only slaves following a read-write master and to use them as hot standbys for the master too

170820
etsy	ebay
for a crowdsourced e-commerce system like famously etsy or ebay you have some users shopkeepers writing to the catalogue while others are reading from it

170854
postgresql	mysql
for relational databases popular choices are postgresql and mysql

170882
getter	setter
also getter setter are generally bad examples for are comments necessary

170884
getter	setter
in my practice people who write comments with getter setter tend to omit comments when those are really necessary like building a 20-line sql-query for a component with no documentation

170888
srp	principles
that way you can keep the single responsibility principles srp and also have a way to override singleton logic

170892
mouse	keyboard
generate client script that is device independent such as client script that responds both to mouse clicks and to keyboard actions

170940
decltype	auto
use auto and decltype wherever they benefit readability

170941
r5rs	r6rs
the current version is r6rs though r5rs is by far the more commonly implemented standard as of this post

170941
google-chrome	firefox
javascript happens to be common now largely due to the explosive growth in market share of both mozilla s firefox and google s google-chrome

170944
vbscript	jscript
microsoft had vbscript and for reasons probably lost to conjecture basically copied javascript but the name was owned by sun so they cheekily called it jscript

170966
public	protected
more specifically is there any functional gain to having public protected or private -scoped methods

170972
public	protected
the need for protected members in a public class should be relatively rare as a protected member becomes part of the class s exported api

170983
rss	feed
obviously they d be out of business quick if they just upped and refactored their entire apis so i have to imagine they have some kind of notification system perhaps even an rss feed etc

171025
put	get
by not creating a separate company whoever registers to put apps on the app store assumes 100 of the liability and is also not required to actually divide any revenue you get unless you create a separate contract stating those requirements

171030
short	base
in short it would be correct to say that never perform database specific operations in your code base as they are better addressed in your database

171048
filtering	grouping
while the sentiment in the title line is admirable and accurate to a point the nitty-gritty of filtering projecting grouping etc should in the overwhelming number of cases be left to the db a definition of well might be in order

171054
mvp	presenter
that is mvp mvvm provides slightly better structure to solve this - presenter or view model are parts which know of the screen size

171092
getter	setter
unlike getter which are meant to return values setter are methods to assign a value via an argument parameter

171110
hash	hmac
the standard hmac implementation would involve using the secret key k and the message m to create the hash h but i am running into issues with this

171119
gif	png
learn the differences between gif png and jpeg

171122
post	put
i m building a rest api which allows inserts post not idempotent and updates put idempotent requests to add update database to our application

171134
post	get	post	put	put	get
although i found myself overriding a lot of tastypie s methods for get put post requests so it became useless

171146
nginx	lighttpd
if this is due to concerns about high traffic you better implement it outside your server and use sth like haproxy lighttpd or nginx

171175
feedback	review
in short i would look for review and feedback about vendor and the product

171177
disk	ram
the bios makes calls to hardware ports and addresses used by the motherboard for disk and other hardware io and spins up disk gets the rest of ram working among other things

171203
client-side	server-side
in the context of web programming what are the differences between server-side programming and client-side programming

171210
client-side	server-side
much like the server-side client-side programming is the name for all of the programs which are run on the client

171215
daemons	systemd
the cron daemons exists on virtually any unix-like systemd and schedules commands to run based on a description in a file called the crontab

171244
versioning	upgrade
if you maintain the most recent 2 or 3 versioning then the ui code can upgrade at it s own pace

171248
cpython	pypy	jython	pypy
excellent test coverage tested on cpython 2.5 - 2.7 3.3 jython 2.5.3 pypy 1.9

171262
notepad++	sublimetext
can s he handle some coding in a different editor sublimetext notepad++ vanilla notepad

171274
ready	each
those of us who use software to build things and actually try to respect each license are ready to gouge our own eyeballs out with a hot poker every time someone talks about making new one

171281
lisp	prolog
in summary some ai researchers still swear by the classic ai languages lisp and prolog

171281
lisp	prolog
this is something old ai languages lisp prolog and newer √¢ ≈ìscripting√¢ languages perl python ruby or recent jvm languages such as clojure are great for

171386
post	get
another advantage using get instead of post for retrieval style requests means caching is possible

171392
srp	principles
don t put the code that actually does the validation logic in with the class itself - see srp principles

171407
pull	push
where they refer to sax push and stax pull parsers

171412
post	get
just read this in the rest api rulebook get and post must not be used to tunnel other request methods

171412
post	get
but then a lot of frameworks use tunneling to expose rest interfaces via html forms since knows only about get and post

171434
dictionary	map
to my mind the word map implies some kind of association a dictionary although there doesn t appear to be any association or pairing of data happening in your algorithm

171447
irssi	mirc
there are many client implementations such as mirc xchat and irssi and server implementations the original ircd

171508
apache	lighttpd
the server in question is running php and apache or lighttpd

171541
filtering	grouping
in my experience it helps when gathering requirements if there is a single or very small grouping of customers acting as a filtering for delivering new or updated requirements to a small grouping of development planners

171690
put	get
if you re looking for a free option wpf would be a great choice and you get the bonus of incredibly beautiful interfaces provided you put enough effort and time into it

171725
hash	md5
compute a hash probably md5 or sha-1 for each line

171736
udp	tcp
a port is part of the address in the tcp and udp protocols

171736
udp	tcp
an os has to support ports to support tcp and udp because ports are an intrinsic part of tcp and udp

171736
udp	tcp
most socket implementations support many protocols beyond tcp and udp some of which have no concept of ports

171736
udp	tcp
an os does not have to support sockets to support tcp or udp

171753
jslint	uglifyjs
free and open source java project which brings together almost all the modern web tools jslint csslint jsmin google closure compressor yui compressor uglifyjs dojo shrinksafe css variables support json compression less sass coffeescript and much more

171754
client-side	server-side
we are having trouble deciding whether to program the search function on the client-side with javascript or on the server-side with php

171763
postgresql	mysql
learning sql server t-sql will give you a deeper understanding of all databases and will allow you to easily pick up concepts from other relational databases oracle mysql postgresql etc

171776
put	get
no the and is correct if you put or you d get a condition that is always true because the status cannot be complete and corrected at the same time

171798
subtraction	addition
how should the data be handling in normal addition subtraction

171798
division	multiplication
multiplication or division

171807
accessor	properties
the standard method of implementing get and set accessor in c# and vb.net is to use a public properties to set and retrieve the value of a corresponding private variable

171811
getter	setter
make the mental shift so you have to justify the existence of a getter and separately a setter before you blindly implement them for all private fields

171812
superclass	subclassing
you have mapped each subclassing to a specific state in the superclass

171826
subtraction	addition
how should the data be handling in normal addition subtraction

171826
division	multiplication
multiplication or division

171826
min	max
depending on your os and programming languages you always need to check you max and min values
