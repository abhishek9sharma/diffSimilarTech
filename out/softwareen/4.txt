74058
inherited	properties
i said and each one has properties inherited from the abstract packet and then variations on that that are specific to its type of thing.

74149
put	get
you need to put them together and get a meaning out of it

74183
google-chrome	firefox
it is very easy to debug and analyze in firefox + firebug or in google-chrome

74188
int	boolean
if there are 20 bit columns non-null boolean is it better to explicitly hold them in an int type int32

74188
int	double
backgrounds the usage of these bit columns are left to be defined by the end user along with a few of other int float double varchar columns so as to make the table a little more extensible

74194
int	boolean
so if performance is an issue or if extensibility is an issue adding more boolean later without having to add columns use an int or long int column

74205
int	boolean
it seems only logical that if there are 1 to 32 non-null boolean columns it gets assigned to a single int field

74210
multi-tier	n-tier
when separation of concerns is applied to an application structure the result is multi-tier architecture or n-tier architecture

74233
agile	sprint
agile requries that you cannot change the sprint backlog

74240
put	get
the bottom line is how much effort are you going to put into the upgrade and how much benefit are you and your code going to get out of the upgrade

74249
feedback	review
i would really like to have someone or several people review it for feedback

74310
rss	feed
this could be formal classroom training or e-learning catching up on your rss feed reading technical journals watching videos having a mentor mentoring others etc

74336
bazaar	git
to start choose one of mercurial git or bazaar in that order and install it along with tools for your ide and operating system i prefer mercurial with hge for eclipse

74336
versioning	upgrade
if the experiment is for a new upgrade versioning then clone and then branch hg branch so you may keep all copies of the repositories updated without one experiment interfering with the other

74336
cvs	svn
linus torvalds who deals with tens-of-thousands of files and millions of lines of code in his projects gave a talk at google about why the tool can t be cvs svn or any of the many free and commercial ones around

74386
rar	zip
the ideal solution i think would be to be able to pack everything up is some compressed file like zip rar tar but still having the source code and views compiled in a dll file and build into the the core platform a way to allow a non-technical select the compressed file and install it automatically

74387
versioning	upgrade
convincing a client to install a patch is usually easier than convincing them to do a major versioning upgrade

74387
versioning	upgrade
as more and more old versioning of the software are kicking around it s advantageous to have branches you can check specific fixes into to keep the old versioning working for long enough so clients can have time to safely upgrade to new major versioning

74412
perforce	svn
the merging and branching mechanisms work as good as any of the other source control systems better than svn in my experience and about as good as perforce but what really shines is the project tracking and project management aspects of the product and the built in automation for builds and deployments

74413
ready	each
a maintainer usually the original author was assigned to each submodule and they were responsible for handling pull requests from other team members and for issuing pull requests to the team lead who would update the submodule in the main branch when it was ready to be integrated into the production branch

74440
vbscript	jscript
internet explorer implemented javascript in a way that allows pluggable scripting engines it came with vbscript and jscript

74459
cvs	svn	cvs	rcs
with svn and cvs and rcs and sccs branching merging was so painful i d rather have root canal work done without an anesthetic

74480
hudson	bamboo
most automated build systems bamboo hudson teamcity etc assume that you ll be working with a vcs

74514
swt	swing
and what benefits do i get from using either one over using plain swing swt

74514
swt	swing
do rcp applications require more dependencies than those developed using swing or swt

74630
cvs	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn
as counter-intuitive as it sounds a distributed version control system mercurial git bazaar is better to start with than a centralized system svn cvs

74659
pull	push
finally all of these options should suit your needs of a lightweight disconnected client to the internet-based repository as they should only use your internet connection when you manually commit update or push pull your local files repository to the server or vice-versa

74699
lisp	scheme	lisp	prolog	scheme	prolog
i will really appreciated if you can tell me in a specific manner how your x ie java c# c++ programming skills improved by learning y ie scheme prolog lisp

74725
memcached	apc
when using php you should use apc or memcached for speedup

74736
profiling	benchmarking
read first for a definition of the two terms profiling and benchmarking and the need for distinguishing them please read this answer to a previous question

74739
profiling	benchmarking
so the benchmarking has been done and the result was too slow and now we re trying to figure out why it s running so slowly so we go and profiling it

74739
profiling	benchmarking
profiling and optimizing before you benchmarking before you know whether or not the performance is adequate is truly falling into the premature optimization scenario

74751
profiling	benchmarking
profiling must be against realistic scenarios call that benchmarking if you like

74759
profiling	benchmarking
if it is relatively easy to get good code coverage from profiling because profiling tells you which functions are aren t called how many times and with what parameters how do i get good performance scenario coverage when doing performance benchmarking

74764
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
since then i ve used bazaar and git and svn when i had to for a software engineering class though mostly git to do version control on all of my projects

74802
put	get
does it make sense to be in the cloud when you know you need huge volumes of storage bandwidth and get put etc

74865
lisp	smalltalk
smalltalk and lisp both very dynamic took it to such an extreme as to ship environment images instead of building from source

75069
octal	decimal
there are native numbering systems that are 4-based 5-based 8-base octal 10-based decimal 12-based 20-based and even 60 -based

75196
implements	extends
because you can only extends one class while you can implements many interfaces

75207
implements	extends
another thing which is true for c# not sure about java is that you can only extends 1 class but implements many interfaces

75207
implements	extends
with interfaces you can have 2 interfaces called imathteacher and ihistoryteacher and then have one class that extends from teacher and implements those 2 interfaces

75253
feedback	review
the black box review is also helpful because it will allow you to get a sense of what works currently and what does not from both a technological and usability perspective which you can then turn into constructive feedback if when asked

75333
boost	stl
true the same can be said for say stl or boost but the .net class library is often good enough to make us intellectually lazy at times

75364
put	get
get your code out there document a bit of it write some tests and put your best food forward

75400
calloc	malloc
i built it just like the book told me call malloc for the 3 dimensions then allocate rows for the next dimension then calloc for the end nodes

75411
pull	push
as long as the developer performs a commit then push does the concept of a central repo as i would have known it with svn still exist making ci builds just a different config pull from git rather than svn

75412
vbscript	jscript
another option you have is to use vbscript or jscript for that matter

75422
datamapper	activerecord
there s an alternate to rails activerecord called datamapper but i haven t tried it

75527
pascal	delphi
yes cobol and pl i are old but so is pascal and it s still alive and kicking in the form of delphi

75540
rpg	4gl
rpg cobol propietary 4gl crap

75578
disk	ram
have your sys admin run stats on the file system for disk i o cpu ram and other such resource consumption

75603
pascal	delphi
for everything else i chose either c++ or a precursor to delphi called object pascal which was taught at that college

75606
nfa	dfa
what are the relative pro s and con s of both dfa s and nfa s when compared to each other

75606
nfa	dfa
i know that dfa s are easier to implement than nfa s and that nfa s are slower to arrive at the accept state than dfa s but are there any other explicit well known advantages disadvantages

75608
nfa	dfa
any language that can be defined in nfa can also be defined in dfa

75608
nfa	dfa
in other words to define the same language using dfa you would be required to define more states and transitions than when using nfa

75691
nfa	dfa
a dfa can be considered a special-case nfa - iow you can define nfa to mean potentially but not necessarily non-deterministic

75691
nfa	dfa
an equivalent nfa to that minimal dfa may well be much smaller but there is not in general one unique smallest equivalent nfa

75691
nfa	dfa
but a typical small nfa may be much smaller than its smallest equivalent dfa so that superlative may well be a red herring

75691
nfa	dfa
only the representation loses the perfect label and even then labelling the minimal dfa as perfect only works because you re ignoring the potentially better nfa representations

75703
dictionary	map
similarly you could use this rule of thumb to justify replacing switch or case statements depending on language with a dictionary or map

75717
interpreted-language	compiled-language
almost all non-really-high-performance websites are written using interpreted-language php c# .net java python ruby and others because they are much much easier to modify update setup and run than the most popular compiled-language

75717
interpreted-language	compiled-language
that said google.com amazon.com facebook.com are built over compiled-language c++ maybe with some c certainly combined with one interpreted-language for flexibility

75763
interpreted-language	compiled-language
without knowing the exact application its exact load and its exact architecture it simply isn t possible to say scenario x would be better solved using a compiled-language and scenario y would be better solved using an interpreted-language

75763
interpreted-language	compiled-language
even if you can clearly measure that an application using a compiled-language is faster than an interpreted-language or vice versa the question still remains does it matter

75776
textmate	notepad++
notepad++ is less powerful than textmate for app programming but has interesting features for web development

75822
atomic	interlocked
atomic operations in c# it s done via interlocked for operations that are not atomic by default

75929
organization	naming
it assists with organization of code and resolution of naming conflicts

75970
postgresql	mysql
it allows to abstract the actual database type from the module developer so you don t really care whether the server is running postgresql mysql etc

76097
client-side	server-side
if that means in the form of triggers and constraints on the db level server-side validations on the middleware and client-side javascript on the ui for web apps then it s imo a necessary evil to ensure the data is always pristine

76111
for-loop	arrays
if the list needs to grow in a another version it is easy to just add on to the database and change the code to handle the extra data in the arrays which may not even be necessary depending on the code eg listing the data with a for-loop using the upper bound of the arrays

76119
public	protected
know how the virtual public protected and private and static keywords behave

76171
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
naturally i m testing and debugging it on the same development machine in various browsers such as internet explorer firefox opera safari and google-chrome

76187
put	get
you might be able to get a short term contract with no pay but it s something to put on your cv and you ll learn a lot

76233
interpreted-language	compiled-language
this question is mostly about interpreted-language because when working with compiled-language this is usually achieved using build tool which is not needed to build program in dynamic languages

76247
hash	md5
some folks use google to decrypt md5 hash because they are so common

76289
opencart	magento
so we are going to make decision between magento and opencart php programmers would be happy to this end

76328
swt	swing
the best cross-platform gui toolkits are in my opinion swing which is totally cross-platform with a consistent look and feel and swt which also harnesses native components as used by eclipse

76350
agile	sprint
scrum and whole agile embraces the change - what will happen if after delivering first features customer requires some change which goes back to through all your initial sprint

76402
pull	push
when you push your changes they are made available to all other sites that use that module but they don t actually receive those changes until they decide to pull and test the latest revision

76478
bazaar	git
examples include git mercurial and bazaar

76534
saas	iaas
iaas paas and saas terms clearly explained and defined and

76534
saas	iaas
cloud computing â demystifying saas paas and iaas

76567
saas	iaas
however you only can use a restricted subset of java so it s actually closer to saas than to iaas which gives you a virtual machine and let you install whatever language stack or application you want

76577
division	multiplication
another is that multiplication by 1 does not help much this kind of thing may not be a saving with n 4 but could be if you were also for example looking at division especially if the smaller number is not a factor or divisor of the larger number as you can then remove a bunch of possibilities

76577
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
rzzzwilson s suggestion of stopping when the target is exceeded works in a similar way though only works if the all the operations are non-decreasing i.e addition and multiplication but not subtraction or division

76588
put	get
i would offer this advice don t be put off if you don t get great traction right away

76591
postgresql	mysql
postgresql server mysql server

76601
haskell	ocaml
i started haskell but still being not sure about it because there is ocaml

76618
public	protected
private fields i almost never have protected private fields i use protected public properties instead _camelcase

76618
public	protected
protected public fields properties pascalcase

76677
interpreted-language	compiled-language
then i would say that in general going from the least portable to the more portable languages you would have assembler low level compiled-language like c then c++ then interpreted-language or the ones that run within a virtual machine

76759
lisp	scheme	lisp	prolog	scheme	prolog	haskell	scheme
language design compilers haskell scala c assembly scheme common lisp prolog

76886
min	max
most of the applications need a min instead of a max heap

76947
hash	salt
the server sends a random salt string in the login page which gets appended to the password in javascript in the browser and the sha1 hash of the result gets then submitted back to the server for verification

76947
hash	salt
this way you can of course also avoid to ever send the passwords over the net even when the user chooses or changes his her password a random salt gets appended to the newly entered password in the browser and the hash of this gets transmitted to the server

76947
hash	salt
if the password change is accepted the server needs to store the salt and the hash for the user account instead of the plain text password

76947
hash	salt
the plain text password gets first hash with the static user account salt and this hash is hash again with the current login salt and this gets transmitted to the server

76947
hash	salt
the suggested approach uses a sha1 cryptographic hash function together with a salt

76947
hash	salt
the salt protects the hash values against attacks with rainbow tables and all other forms of precomputed values which could be used to grab at least the weaker passwords from the network traffic with easily available computing power

76947
hash	salt
weak passwords are still vulnerable since they can be deduced from the hash and salt with dictionary attacks and brute force for relatively short passwords

76994
x86	mips
the situation s worse on the linux side with a much larger variety of distros running on god knows what hardware x86 ppc mips sparc pa-risc etc.

76998
filesystems	ntfs
microsoft never shipped the 3d fahrenheit api that i once hoped for they never shipped the database filesystems that was to replace ntfs and they killed the deepzoom seadragon project that could have been awesome

77054
rpm	yum
creators of applications written in a write once compile anywhere environment c c++ etc benefit from pushing the compilation step down to distributors apt rpm yum etc that create and package binaries for popular architectures

77066
super	implements
no you shouldn t stop using super you should stop implements bad oo designs

77108
put	get
get involved in the community and next time you can put a face to a few names you ve met online

77125
ubuntu	debian
i work on debian and before debian i was on ubuntu

77187
versioning	upgrade
imho the advanced packaging tool apt is pretty key to the success of the whole affair but of course it also needs the small army of developers to somehow agree on stable versioning of libs synchronize upgrade efforts and do whatever hacking patching is necessary to get the diverse upstream sources to actually work with each other etc

77207
versioning	upgrade
upgrade patch - upgrade refers to the replacement of a product with a newer versioning of product.it is incremented only when upgrade is provided on designated major release.patch versioning starts with 0 and incremented only when bug has been resolved

77289
ftp	telnet
you can compare it with the ftp protocol the http protocol which you re using right now and the telnet protocol

77323
kde	gnome
both have libraries for gui programming in gnome or kde

77341
jobs	cron
cron jobs cannot utilize map reduce

77341
post	get
every get or post to another site is aborted after 5 seconds

77362
jobs	cron
now it would be nice if google opened up their infrastructure to allow cron jobs to utilize map reduce and let you run queries over your entire data set

77393
swt	swing
and of course there s java with swt or swing and python that can be used with a variety of widget toolkits like tk wxwidgets gtk+ and qt

77411
children	parent
3 i ve done numerous designs where you have a parent container and a set of children

77424
debian	linux
debian based linux distribution with some compatibility with debian

77424
vim	emacs
vim emacs and nano

77430
screens	tablet
for me at least the tiny screens and lack of a proper input device read full screens ergonomic keyboard and pen tablet means it s not a good idea to use a phone or tablet to program on

77437
scala	typesafe
you can also get support for the full scala stack from the typesafe crowd

77441
int	double
float double and int do not inherit from the same type

77504
vbscript	vb6
my company s codebase is littered with the pseudo-hungarian notation style from vb6 and vbscript if not full-blown hungarian

77516
int	chars
seriously on refactoring you might change a variable from int to long from string to chars

77525
post	put
be sure to put a post it note conspicuously pointing to the introduction where they highlight the importance of consistency

77525
put	get
to further drive home the point get a copy of clean code and put a bookmark in there on the section regarding coding conventions

77529
quicksort	mergesort
it should be faster than algorithms like quicksort and mergesort yet i hardly ever see it used

77536
integer	radix
unlike radix sort quicksort is universal while radix sort is only useful for fix length integer keys

77539
quicksort	heapsort
given a comparison function they work on anything and algorithms like quicksort and heapsort will sort with o 1 extra memory

77600
jobs	cron
cron jobs cannot utilize map reduce - never used map reduce but i think this requires a citation

77600
post	get
every get or post to another site is aborted after 5 seconds

77663
cvs	svn
also read if you come from cvs svn

77665
versioning	upgrade
if the dependency specifications are too tight you are in danger of versioning lock the inability to upgrade a package without having to release new versioning of every dependent package

77696
feedback	review
we were able to fail earlier and get feedback quicker than a downstream code review habit would have produced

77789
swt	swing
one example is using eclipse swt instead of swing

77793
pascal	delphi
it is in turbo pascal delphi 2009 and my source is version controlled cvs

77816
short	base
that is to say the length of term of software copyrights and restricting licences should be very short at the end of which the software and its code base enters the public domain and stays there

77909
np-hard	np-complete
therefore the tsp as usually stated is np-hard meaning that it s as hard to solve as an np-complete problem

77998
implements	extends
this is useful for extends built-in classes and classes in third-party libraries because you can just make up your interface to match the methods on the third-party class and it will automatically implements it

78012
ant	maven
i know that i could do that by creating ant or maven scripts but i would like to know if there is an open source alternative that handles all these complex stuff without the need of so much coding

78034
hash	md5
the md5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit 16-byte hash value

78034
hash	md5
an md5 hash is typically expressed as a hexadecimal number 32 digits long.

78099
codeigniter	cakephp
however frameworks as flow3 symfony cakephp and codeigniter provide a solid basis for oop and other powerful paradigms

78118
postgresql	mysql
none of what follows applies to star oss projects such as linux firefox mysql or postgresql mind you

78151
bbedit	jedit	textmate	jedit	textmate	gedit	textmate	bbedit	gedit	bbedit
that other example - how bbedit and textmate are able to appeal to a group of people willing to pay for a text editor given the avaiability of jedit gedit etc

78311
srp	principles
to apply principles such as srp and

78334
getter	setter
when are getter and setter justified is an excellent question which focuses on using getter and setter as part of the external interface

78334
getter	setter
by having getter and setter there is now multiple ways to update the state of the object since private fields can updated directly bypassing the setter or can be updated by the setter

78334
getter	setter
is there a way to prevent developers from accidentally bypassing the getter setter and use the private fields directly

78340
getter	setter
getter and setter are for external users of your api

78340
getter	setter
ideally the getter provides a clone of the internal state and the setter provides validation to ensure that valid internal state is maintained

78345
getter	setter
firstly you usually shouldn t have public getter and setter

78463
cpython	pypy
pypy has only just reached the stage where it is sufficiently mature to be a viable replacement for cpython in production environments where there are either no c extension modules in use or those which are needed can be adequately handled via cpyext or a quick rewrite of the interface code to use ctypes

78463
cpython	pypy
regardless the key thing to keep in mind is that unless you start writing rpython code it is easy to switch from pypy back to cpython 2.7 if you need a particular c extension module or you want to target a platform that pypy doesn t support

78534
awt	swing
applets are really just a different way of deploying swing or awt applications where you embed the application in a browser-based environment rather than running as a standalone application

78534
awt	swing
so my advice would be to focus on swing awt is somewhat outdated nowadays... and if you need to then you can always wrap the same code in an applet later

78577
next	except
there should not be too much waste except rare occasion where requirements from customer will change a lot because the product owner knows what are the most prioritized user stories which will be done in the next sprint

78598
postgresql	mysql
if you re using a database with true temporary tables that you can create and destroy on the fly eg postgresql mysql but not oracle then do create indexes on temporary tables

78599
agile	metrics
everyone who gets along with agile points out that it was never supposed to mean this but once everyone gets caught up in the metrics this is exactly what you get from a team that has no passion about the quality of the product and either is obsessed with test coverage above all else or with meeting their weekly deliverable deadlines regardless of the corner they have painted everyone else into because that is all that makes it up to the management level on a weekly basis

78771
lisp	smalltalk
python smalltalk lisp leap to mind

78863
forth	algol
c was and is an extremely successful language and many programmers were and still are familiar with it so it made sense that languages meant to be caught on as a general programming language follow its already familiar syntax for code such as blocks within braces and function declarations and so forth and many did for example see the wikipedia â œlist of c-based languagesâ and note that c itself owes something similar to algol

78885
mockups	usability
sometimes alternating between design to talk about the idea quick-and-dirty mockups so that the working elements can be tried out by test users to create functionality feedback and then design again to create even more feedback as to appeal and usability

78887
redmine	trac
redmine on your own server - ruby nice more flexible than trac but have some minor youngness lacks

78887
redmine	trac
jira on your own server - java nice more complete than redmine but not as flexible as trac - but does manage multiple projects

78889
lisp	scheme	lisp	smalltalk	forth	smalltalk
various language designers have claimed to hide lisp scheme forth simula smalltalk etc

78897
redmine	trac
i also use trac for a big project that i ve installed far before i learned about redmine

79094
agile	sprint
in waterfall i d be doing this phase by phase - high level design detailed design code unit test - in agile it would be sprint by sprint

79215
swt	swing
today a professor of mine commented that he found it odd that while swt s philosophy is one of making your own controls by composition swing seems to favour inheritance

79230
jtable	jinternalframe
you ll see it in classes like jtable and jinternalframe

79242
forth	rust
i m planning to polish the rust off my c skills and learn a bit about language implementation by coding a simple forth in c

79282
inherited	subclassing
i find only in strategy pattern code is reused well through inherited in most case the designer of the base class know its subclassing very well and that inherited is totally optional

79282
inherited	subclassing
i have a class that s inherited by 4 classes - an iohandler and it s subclassing for server side client side edge server origin server and it begins to drive me crazy

79310
memcpy	memcmp	memcpy	memset	memset	memcmp
however most examples i ve found tend to be based on string-processing the excellent dive into python roman numerals example and since we hardly ever use strings this isn t really suitable about the only library functions our code typically uses are memcpy memcmp and memset so something based on strcat or regular expressions isn t quite right

79314
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing and the superclass

79381
agile	sprint
once every week i assume that the length of iteration sprint in your agile process is one week for the sake of example do the following

79388
versioning	upgrade
have an upgrade process that involves updating tables and getting rid of inserting data that changed between versioning

79472
public	protected
not having public info out there is about the best way to stay protected

79530
udp	rtp
for out of order segments you add a sequence number to the frames using something like rtp in addition to udp

79530
udp	tcp
they just use tcp and do buffering instead of udp since they don t care about a few seconds delay between the server and client

79540
udp	tcp
keep in mind that while udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery network equipment doesn t intentionally drop packets just to punish application users who chose to use udp over a reliable tcp connection

79540
udp	tcp
so part of the answer is that while udp itself is not reliable almost all packets still make it across and in intranet environment where one company controls all traffic and equipment udp is virtually as reliable as tcp

79540
udp	rtp
that said one of the most popular video streaming protocols that is based on udp ip is rtp

79620
lisp	scheme
the best place to get started is probably the structure and interpretation of computer programs sicp which is based on the scheme dialect of lisp

79636
ocaml	scheme	lisp	scheme
you could write an interpreter for scheme or lisp with ocaml

79977
unix	solaris
in the early 80s when unix sun solaris machines were first coming on line there were no standards as to how or where to mount your drives other than the root one

80055
cpython	pypy
pypy is similar to cpython both has a compiler+interpreter

80062
put	get
mobile apps are a good way to get started since you can put your product in front of real users very easily

80065
quicksort	shellsort
algorithms sorting bubble sort insertion sort selection sort shellsort quicksort merge sort external sorting searching linear and logarithmic time searching graph theory adjacency list adjacent matrix dfs bfs topological sort dynamic programming greedy algorithms divide and conquer

g++	gcc
on a windows machine you can install mingw -- the gnu gcc g++ compilers for windows

80141
codeigniter	cakephp
i would recommend cakephp codeigniter or symfony

80142
opencart	joomla
the recommended cms frameworks to begin with are codeigniter opencart joomla 1.5 and tango cms

postgresql	mysql
sql mysql postgresql

80284
verilog	vhdl
vhdl and verilog a.k.a

80284
verilog	vhdl
vhdl and verilog are called hardware description languages hdls for historical reasons

80419
lisp	smalltalk
think the lisp machine and maybe smalltalk

80636
feedback	review
even with the wider audience you ll probably not get that much more feedback and most of what you do get will tend to be unreasonable moans or gushing praise - have a look at the review section of almost any app for examples

80734
google-chrome	firefox
as demian brecht suggested - look at html5 sure old browsers do not support it but it s up to us to convince other people to upgrade and forcing some old lady to upgrade or download firefox google-chrome instead of using ie8 will bring joy to us - developers

80756
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
has multi browser supoort ie firefox google-chrome safari opera and konqueror on multiple platforms windows linux macintosh etc.

yslow	pagespeed
dynatrace yslow pagespeed - for performance testing

80919
lisp	racket
i m developing a web site now in common lisp and i wrote a suite of in-house programs for my previous employer in racket

80919
scheme	racket
for the in-house code i chose racket then known as plt scheme because the employer was a windows shop and i couldn t get them to pay for lispworks

80919
lisp	racket
i took advantage of racket s case-sensitivity and implemented car and cdr which have common lisp s semantics

80919
lisp	racket
my new project is being done in common lisp which was the right choice because the racket community just doesn t believe in parallelism which is essential for this project

80948
postgresql	mysql
as to your last point about other alternatives as others have mentioned sqllite but i would add postgresql and mysql unless you have some requirement that would prevent or make their use impracticable they are both great alternatives

80948
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql are both open source

80959
ubuntu	debian
apt repo for debian ubuntu

80972
pull	push
with your scenario of multiple people working on the same module you just need to follow the general dvcs methodology work make possibly many commits at the end of the day pull any changes from dev and merge them and lastly push to dev

81145
versioning	upgrade
i don t think it lets you offer upgrade from a trial versioning to a paid versioning but i know you can post a free lite versioning with limited functionality or watermarks that disfigure the output

81169
apache	nginx
the apache is a fairly large projectâ much larger than say lighthttp or nginx or certainly the simple http servers you see floating around in c c++ tutorials

81173
put	get
they put javascript expert on there because all else being equal they d love to get someone who was actually an expert

81206
lisp	scheme
contrast that with lisp and scheme whose macro facilities differ where macros operate on the abstract program itself

81219
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
you can do things with apache you could not do right now with neither nginx or lighttpd

81269
haskell	scheme
unlike scheme which is also a sugared lambda calculus of sorts among other things haskell is strongly typed

81269
haskell	scheme
again unlike scheme but like the stlc haskell is a pure referentially transparent language

81269
haskell	agda
conversely haskell has served as both a host-language and an inspiration for a number of proof assistants under development such as agda and epigram which are rooted in developments in type theory very much related to the lineage of ch

81271
hash	md5
if i have a database that stores the login credentials of 1 000 000 users in plaintext how much effort will it take me to md5 hash these passwords

81354
prepare	execute
execute and transmit the software and to prepare derivative works of the

81365
client-side	server-side
the rendering code is divided between server-side code that performs the initial rendering and javascript code that performs client-side rendering

81367
ubuntu	linux
my suggestion is that if you re using windows you create a linux virtual machine something to go by like ubuntu redhat etc

81382
extjs	mootools
does anyone know if any of the major js libraries jquery mootools extjs etc or any newer js libraries are going to be implementing their libraries in such a way that an html5 implementation will be used

81410
hash	md5
secondly as mentioned by other users consider a different hash other than md5

81410
hash	md5
then using the regular update syntax from sql the set statement on lines 7 and 8 causes the password field in the original table to become equal to the md5 hash of the same password

81495
pull	push
the main drawbacks are a little extra complexity when you push or pull from the central vcs and the need to consciously resist the temptation to go too long between doing so

81537
children	parent
this is very analogous to mammalian parent producing new children - they both contribute their genes to the new child

81537
children	parent
when the parent breed they combine to produce children

81566
google-chrome	firefox
microsoft appears to acknowledge that ie will never beat firefox and google-chrome so instead they now hope that turning the entire windows desktop into some kind of super browser may prevent more people from moving away

81621
width	height
was it paintrect xstart ystart xend yend or xstart ystart width height

81668
getter	setter
or am i helpless for organization and i should just go back to the basics of having 15 private variables and 15 getter and setter

81675
getter	setter
the setter and getter could access some kind of private collection that you also make accessible

81732
postgresql	mysql
in terms of the database you have choices between database servers such as mysql and postgresql and embedded databases such as sqlite and hsqldb

81740
pull	push
out of date mercurial won t let you push if your local repo is out of date so you pull and merge your local changes

81742
pull	push
when you want to integrate your finished change into the trunk you load up the trunk pull merge push

81815
vim	emacs
emacs also fast but nowhere near vim speed of editing

81835
srp	principles
it s regarding the single-responsibility principles srp

81935
filesystems	ntfs
fourth linux filesystems make a lot more sense than ntfs

81961
put	get
the problem is that in some jobs you do more work and put in extra effort but get rewarded the same but yet next time around you are expected to do just as much or even more work than before

81974
vim	emacs
as a vim user i d also opine that the editor should respect vim emacs and other editors modelines and preserve the modeline s proscribed formatting regardless of what it ultimately displays

82118
bazaar	svn
look at svn bazaar hg git.

82129
put	get
buildout add a way to get multiple version of the same eggs and it build the system path inside scripts put in a bin folder

82129
accessor	properties
properties make your public variable wrapped by accessor mutator and do the job you want never broke things

82372
put	get
where these can get tricky is where you bring ip you gained working for a and put it into x

82380
getter	setter
i assume you re talking about read-only properties or at least property getter since a property setter is in almost every instance going to have side-effects

82413
cjk	shift-jis
deceze s answer has a very strong element of truth to it but there is another reason why shift-jis and others are still in use utf-8 is horrifically inefficient for some languages mostly in the cjk set

82413
cjk	shift-jis
shift-jis is iirc a two-byte wide encoding whereas utf-8 is typically 3-byte and occasionally even 4-byte in its encodings with cjk and others

82446
daemons	systemd
embedded software hardware drivers and operating systemd rarely use sql but application software be it web or desktop or service daemons based use databases all the time

82448
mouse	keyboard
in addition to these os controlled interrupts there are also interrupts caused by external events mouse keyboard serial ports network ports etc. which are process with separate interrupt routines which are usually connected to event handlers

82472
public	protected
visibility doesn t come into it i don t group by public protected private

82504
put	get
i ve put some links to those below so you can get more info

82539
octal	binary
in the intro to software section i ve found without fail they always put large emphasis on being literate in binary hexadecimal and sometimes even octal number systems

82546
hex	binary
hex and binary are very useful if you do any work with close to the wire protocols or close to the metal data transfer

82546
hex	binary
fundamentally data flows in binary which is trivially represented nibble at a time as hex

82548
octal	hex
i ve never used octal but it s not unusual to see hex in the debugger and on occasion it makes a lot more sense to use hex in your source code normally because the underlying data is bit flags.

82550
hex	binary
hopefully in the real world you won t be quizzed on converting hex to binary to decimal

82550
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
could i rattle off what 8675309 is in binary hex and octal

82618
octal	binary
as you can see most computer hardware and software use a binary representation and we humans use power of 2 representations like octal and hexadecimal to read the binary representation in a more efficient and painless way

82618
hex	binary
reading binary data is done on mostly in hex editor

82620
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
what binary hex and octal have in common is not that they are not base10 but that they are all powers of two

82625
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
octal these days is pretty rare but i use hex very frequently and often think about problems in binary

82625
hex	binary
it s a binary format and again it s most easily dealt with using hex or sometimes binary

82625
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
if you re going to spend your career writing perl to massage text strings then no you probably don t need to be very familiar with hex octal or binary

82625
hex	binary
but the moment you start dealing with the kinds of things i do hex and binary at least are essential

82663
feedback	review
for certain employees this pertains to code review feedback but others it can even include debugging suggestions even if they re right

82724
put	get
get some good quotes from reputable consulting or project managment firms or at the very least insist on a good chunk of time to gather requirements and put some definition around this thing

82741
getter	setter
i enjoy when i can view class definitions and quickly see what it does not how it setxtoone setytovector3 multiplynumbers + 100 setter getter

82749
hex	binary
but since computers rather use binary and binary usually is displayed as hex things usually are illustrated with hexy examples

82783
freemarker	velocity
i haven t used struts for ages but struts by default can render velocity markup freemarker as well as jsp maybe other formats too

82784
cvs	svn
can store the models in cvs and svn

82798
put	get
certain university departments even put it clearly they will not support students going on an internship to sap because they all tended to get employed as cheap labor their exact words and neglected their main goal of staying there such as conducting a research for a master thesis or doctor work

82852
ready	each
it s not hard to have a service that listens for file drops then reads in the file and generates either 1 message saying there s data ready or breaks up the file into each record in the large file to be processed

82877
floating-point	fixed-point
fixed-point numeric types are not used for the same purpose as floating-point numeric types

82963
pull	push
so i have recently realised that when we do pull from master repo then update merge and finally push we create these unnecesary large changesets

82980
pull	push
you push your updates and once you feel confident you tag it as a release candidate and pull it to your test environment that would ideally be as similar to your production environment as possible

83022
pascal	delphi
the name used to refer to the delphi language but the developers decided to return to the languages original name object pascal restraining the name to the ide which is used to help edit and debug delphi projects more efficiently

83022
pascal	delphi
delphi is an enhancement of niklaus wirth s language pascal and object pascal

83023
pascal	delphi
delphi is a language for rapid development of native windows os x ios and android applications through use of object pascal

83142
persistent	transient
they re transient objects that usually need to be persistent or serialized and therefore can t reference any abstract types as this would make them unusable

83168
for-loop	loops
if i need a control flow first i decide whether i need a for-loop or a while loops and then create the same old code that i used last time i needed one of these things

83363
postgresql	mysql
however there is no proof they really use oracle instead of mysql or postgresql nobody knows the secret

83418
gif	png
as a lossless raster graphics compression format png was developed in 1995 in response to unisys waving a patent around and demanding royalties from the myriad software companies who were supporting gif

83424
ordereddictionary	sorteddictionary
edit oh f i was ment to write ordereddictionary not sorteddictionary sorry folks edited my post

83478
dictionary	map
there are basically two ways of implementing a map dictionary

83493
postgresql	mysql
first is challenging the commonly received wisdom that banks use oracle over postgresql and mysql

83493
postgresql	mysql
i wouldn t dispute that postgresql or mysql is being used by banks just that it s not being used for the sort of mission critical high availability high volume systems you talk about

83493
postgresql	mysql
if you believe that you can architect a postgresql mysql solution that meets those needs to the standards a bank would expect remember these are very conservative people as a rule then go ahead with it but i suspect that they ll have questions about support and reliability and will want to see someone else using that platform for that sort of solution rather than being the first to take that sort of a risk

83534
tolower	toupper
i have these basic constructs already assignments expressions variables some functions random toupper tolower looping for and do-while until if block and single-line else decisions console based input input and output print and sub-routines with no parameters yet

83616
google-chrome	firefox
for example if you are using google-chrome right now and for web development you should be using either google-chrome or firefox with firebug installed hit ctrl+shift+j to open up the developer tools

83687
hash	salt
this needs to be hash with your salt and a timestamp

83687
hash	salt
convert license key to hash with salt

83687
hash	salt
if yes then store hash of dead + salt + timestamp truncated to day

83687
hash	salt
if no then store hash of live + salt + timestamp trunc d

83687
hash	salt
create hash from live + salt + trunc d timestamp

83762
vim	emacs
i tried vim and liked it but something stopped from using it i had to type esc to often very often something like each 5 seconds and it was highly uncomfortable so i stopped using it as a primary text editor now i use emacs nice for programmer as i am

83831
feedback	review
after some amount of feedback from his team about missed edge cases he will probably learn to consider those before the review

83851
cvs	svn
with centralized systems such as svn or cvs committing is more costly and it affects everyone

83896
folder	directory
for each folder use the map function to pull the data you need from it since you can distribute the number of directory to any number of threads processes that can perform the mapping function they can all run in parallel and as they report in you get a set of progress indications

83932
lisp	scheme
i came across scheme and common lisp as the 2 most prevalent dialects and wanted your opinion as to which is the most favored useful one to learn - and would be immensely gratified if you can suggest any resources for a rank beginner to start from

83932
lisp	scheme
i d wager that common lisp clojure scheme and emacs lisp are the four most widely used dialects and of those i d suspect that scheme is the most commonly-deployed

83973
multiplying	add
multiplying each rating by the percentage factor and add them up

83994
teamcity	jenkins
i have played with jenkins and will download teamcity when i get home damn you work enforced download filters

83994
teamcity	jenkins
can jenkins or teamcity integrate with git or mercurial repositories that exist only on a shared drive rather than a true server via http https ssh etc

83994
teamcity	jenkins
given the above will it be fairly easy to integrate either jenkins or teamcity with git mercurial or should i just stick with svn as it is more or less ready to go

84010
xsl-fo	xslt	xslt	xquery
if by xml you are including most of the related technologies which actually make xml useful such as dtd namespaces xpath xslt xsl-fo xquery etc. then i m not so sure that it is easy

84090
hash	salt
store a hash of the password preferably with a randomly generated salt

84097
teamcity	jenkins
with jenkins and teamcity you are free to choose git or svn or mercurial or tfs or anything else

84132
factors	mean
so a factors 100 in memory in 10-15 years will mean that the 64 bit address space will be a limiting factors in about 100 years since log 100 million log 100 is around 6 if the current trend holds

84215
put	get
if you put -1 into an unsigned 16-bit data type you get 65535 which is 1 less than 65536

84275
jasmine	qunit
javascript has jasmine and qunit

84289
x86	mips
compilers usually translate into the machine code but unless you want to learn x86 i suggest you maybe look at mips or making your own virtual machine

84294
int	boolean
2 do not delete records in your app. use a status field maybe int maybe boolean or bit that indicate that record is considered deleted

84383
post	get
but the principle is similar http request either a get with query string parameters or a post with www-form-urlencoded parameters

84407
lisp	prolog
i know that lisp is taught as an ai programming language in my university but prolog rarely is

84407
lisp	scheme	lisp	prolog	scheme	prolog
i am kind of fond of prolog but i m not an ai programmer so i don t think i m qualified to judge for myself why prolog is better than lisp scheme

84415
lisp	prolog
unsurprisingly really - originally that ai programming was done in lisp or some other language but prolog was written specifically to do the job

84423
punctuation	words
what about punctuation inside a words

84438
haskell	scheme
keeping with haskell there is a very instructive scheme interpreter which could give further ideas write yourself a scheme in 48 hours

84482
lisp	prolog
the way it was explained to me was that lisp tends to be used more in certain countries and prolog in the others

84482
lisp	prolog
in terms of which is best i only covered lisp briefly when i did lambda calculus in a theoretical computer science module so i m biased towards prolog

84494
client-side	server-side
the client-side code communicates with the server-side code using something like a restful api of get push requests

84560
put	get
a lot of this can be put into a general spec sheet. make it scannable though so we don t have to dig to get the information we need maybe it s just me but i use that documentation throughout the whole development process as a checklist

84577
minix	linux
minix is a nice unix clone which inspired linux which was written for teaching

84603
cpu	processors
a computer essentially consists of a processors or cpu and some memory or ram

84603
multiplying	add
this involves learning about boolean algebra how to build simple combinatorial circuits to add multiplying etc how to build memory and sequential circuits how to build a microprocessor and so in

84647
integer	unsigned
in languages like c where datatypes like int are platform specific an alias like dword makes it easier to ensure you are really using a 32bit signed integer everywhere when this is the requirement for your program even when you port the program to a plattform where int is 16bit unsigned and therefore dword has to be an alias for signed long

84696
cakephp	yii
i ve evaluated yii cakephp symfony a long time ago pre 2.0 and kohana.

84814
submit	submission
perhaps that could be offset by either the person submission code themselves or someone else only being able to submit code of a certain age

84917
debian	linux
make installation of your code automated as well rpm or debian packages are a must here for linux

84920
multiplying	add
one rule that i have heard is something along the lines of predict how long it will take then multiplying it by 2 then add two more weeks more of a joke.

84942
feedback	review
3 - i think that the manual commitments will give you a chance to review the code for your quality standards but also provide a great chance for real world feedback to the intern and suggest routes for improvements don t make it a nit pick session however

84959
interpreted-language	compiled-language
it s a fast statically typed compiled-language that develops like a dynamically typed interpreted-language but performs like native code

84978
centos	linux
for example red hat sells red hat enterprise linux and does reasonably well even though some people take every release remove everything proprietary and distribute it as centos

85069
wordpress	joomla
i myself am a php developer i love the language because of its convenience and i specially love the ecosystem of resources that surround it joomla drupal wordpress symfony2 doctrine2 etc

85089
cdr	cons
i eventually abandoned lisp because of the lack of a proper editor it s emacs or nothing and i hate emacs with a vengeance the weirdness in building a web app there are tools but they don t feel natural to use and the occasional quirkiness i m watching you car cdr and cons

85089
camping	ruby-on-rails	ramaze	merb	ramaze	camping	merb	camping	merb	ruby-on-rails
there actually are several other frameworks than ruby-on-rails merb camping ramaze sinatra etc

85089
erlang	lisp
if the language was at the core of the problem sites would be mostly written in c c++ c# java lisp erlang etc

85090
versioning	upgrade
i think major versioning number updates sometimes upgrade the repository not making it inaccessible to older versioning but sometimes causing some problems

85092
firefox	safari
that s a lot like asking if it s ok for your website users to use safari and firefox

85101
versioning	upgrade
for instance svn 1.5 would silently and irreversibly upgrade the on-disk format of your local copy to a structure that versioning 1.4 and earlier could not use at all - so if you upgrade your ide plugin but not the standalone versioning in your build system you would break the workflow massively

85179
int	chars
variable types string int chars etc. allow for up to 5 minutes can be combined with the first part

85180
post	get
for method naming it doesn t matter much but you may want to use different names for get and post requests like get and post

85291
lisp	scheme	haskell	scheme
if you don t have previous experience with functional programming i would recommend you to make detour and learn som basic lisp haskell or scheme

85322
implements	extends
in that sense base classes provide a way to extends the behavior of several types efficiently over time by adding and implements functionality in the base class all derived classes immediately incorporate that behavior

85330
folder	directory
and do i put the license in a license folder in the root directory or at the top of every source file or something

85397
jobs	cron
cron jobs would be a possibillity - an other way would be an event based solution

85497
titlebar	window
no one would listen to fvwm has small memory footprint is highly configurable and has perl bindings but a short video or a screenshot and look dudes i can make any window drop down and put titlebar on either side of the window for some reason turns out to be very convincing

85517
next	except
like your every other week suggestion except that when the developers are working on the feature the testers are working on test cases and when the testers are testing the developers are investigating the next feature

85521
put	get
i m not trying to hate on the languages i understand that they serve a purpose and do it well but when your employees don t know how a hash-table works and use the wrong sorting methods or run sql commands that are horribly inefficient but get the job done in an acceptable time it feels like more effort is being put into developing technologies that coddle new programmers rather than actually teaching people how to do things right

85522
division	multiplication
you won t understand percentages if you are not comfortable with division and multiplication as an example

85628
put	get
many times the idea to get it compiling and running gets in the way of actually solving the problem we have put forth

85628
loops	if-statement
do they know how to write a loops an if-statement and how to use variables

85644
mouse	keyboard
i have an acquaintance for whom it is actually physically painful to hold a pencil but a mouse and keyboard is fine

85671
bazaar	git
+one unique executable for everything -they say themselve that it s not meant to replace git or mercurial or bazaar but might fill the need for a complete compact solution for a small team

85691
mvp	presenter
mvp - model view presenter

85712
getter	setter
after that comes too many getter setter

85712
getter	setter
most novice programmers have the default to make a getter setter for every data member

85773
mvp	presenter
i think another term for the mvp pattern is supervising presenter

85779
spaces	delimiter
with delimiter between the elements sql doesn t play nice with spaces in column names and underscore works well visually

85785
svg	vml
if you want to support ie 8 and older which doesn t have svg support but instead uses its own vml vector graphics format you may want to look into raphael

85845
perforce	svn
are there any reason why svn git cannot replace perforce

85862
cvs	svn
git especially and svn to some extent are not that old -- if you needed solid version control in the mid 90s you almost had to go commercial as svn was in its infancy and cvs was well cvs

85866
perforce	svn
i m reasonably proficient with svn git and perforce both as a user and at setting up and maintaining servers

85866
perforce	svn
addressing svn is easy compared to perforce it s dog-slow

85866
vpn	lan
once you had the code updating the latest sources normally took seconds on the lan or a couple of minutes over a vpn connection from my house

85869
perforce	svn
because svn is well svn and perforce from the one time 4 years back when comparing tools does some things better than svn

85870
collabnet	svn
lastly while many foss products do have support behind them think collabnet or wandisco for svn it still gets the made by geeks in their back bedroom reputation

85920
feedback	review
in this case the manager should have been informed about this all along and thus should use that feedback when filling out his comment to the performance review

85968
put	get
for example a college computer science department wanted to get their students to use source control and put their code there for the teachers to look at

85976
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has adopted the google-chrome development model wherein version numbers are largely unimportant and so just supporting the latest publicly available one is probably the best strategy

85976
google-chrome	firefox
and since both firefox and google-chrome now update themselves automatically the average person probably has no clue or care what version they re running

85976
google-chrome	firefox
i m finding there are a number of organizations that mandate their employees use ie the head of it subscribes to the microsoft school of thought or mandate their employees use firefox the head of it subscribes to the ie-is-insecure school of thought so google-chrome updating constantly was a non-issue

85983
versioning	upgrade
while it s easy for browser vendors who are locked in a deep competition with each other to release new versioning people don t upgrade nearly as quickly as browser versioning are coming out

85990
google-chrome	firefox
i don t recall a single instance of a client calling me and telling me their site is now broken with the latest version of google-chrome or firefox

85990
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome firefox safari and the rest can keep updating as fast as they like as long as they keep consistently rendering sites as they have for years

86001
client-side	server-side
jsps use a syntax similar to php to dynamically generate html and client-side code but they integrate with server-side java classes which handle business logic and data access

86046
pop-up	dialog
3 calls just for one dialog box to pop-up

86058
subtract	add
my current implementation uses intdata- add n intdata- subtract n and so on

86102
getter	setter
it will also make it easier to notice unnecessary dead code because low-level boilerplate such as getter and setter will only be added kept if they are required by higher level features

86111
trie	tree
a trie also called digital tree or prefix tree is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings

it s a common mistake to put everything you think you can do on your cv and send that out to as many employers as possible trying to get a job

86192
irc	xmpp
honestly what you ve described sounds a heck of a lot like irc but xmpp is quite extensible and widely used so it s probably the easiest non-irc to get working and to get support for

a few languages that might shake up your mind assuming you re currently using something like c++ java c# vb ... haskell ml lisp various dialects to choose from erlang prolog smalltalk javascript if you let go of trying to make it behave like java and embrace its closure nature instead c pascal awk and probably a dozen more

86440
agile	sprint
we work using an agile programming methodology 2 week sprint deliverable every sprint 2-3 pushes to production every sprint for each team

86751
mouse	keyboard
they also seem to prefer using the mouse to the keyboard for moving around in a file

86763
vim	emacs
i m 22 i m guessing this meets your definition of new generation and i use vim admittedly not emacs when i m working with languages that don t have a first class ide examples of languages that do would be c# java and scala imho

86763
notepad++	gedit
i tend to find that the shortcuts available are more powerful and increase my productivity compared to an editor like gedit or notepad++

86815
haskell	scheme
you can write ruby code in functional style as if it were scheme not haskell

86843
vim	emacs
emacs and vim seem to follow the general linux philosophy of extremely powerful but you re on your own to figure it out

86843
vim	emacs
even the man page isn t helpful since it tries to show everything emacs or vim can do at once

86843

emacs and vim do the one thing that makes me go elsewhere they get in the way of me working

86843
vim	emacs

back in 2002 when i was an undergrad only an elite few used vim or emacs in the computer labs

86944
vim	emacs
they were all emacs users except for the intern who swore by vim

86944
vim	emacs
he really loved the keyboard shortcuts and claimed that there were some shortcuts in vim that emacs did not have

86944
vim	emacs
i did not meet anyone who was a vim emacs expert

86944
vim	emacs
emacs hurts my fingers although on a normal keyboard it looks like the trick for control is to roll your wrist...on a laptop that doesn t work because of the keyboard and vim vi just are too different

86979
multiplying	add
agree with him on a general ballpark estimate for the hours of work involved add extra time for bugfixes and support and multiplying it by the normal hourly wage at your company plus overhead costs for a normal software company 50- 100 per developer hour is about right for the total

87077
treeview	expander
the key difference is that a typical treeview node has 2 parts an expander and the node icon

87077
screens	tablet
the one exception is where screens space is at a premium for example on a netbook tablet or when multiple code windows are open

87468
versioning	upgrade
and if you are developing an open source product do you keep upgrade paths in mind when you develop new versioning

87470
floating-point	integer
in a sentence floating-point decimal types encapsulate the conversion to and from integer values which is all the computer knows how to deal with at the binary level

87471
int	double
one thought is that you would use the float or double representations when you need to deal with values outside the int range

87494
decimal	ieee
with ieee 754 standard representations a 32-bit float gives you about 7 decimal digits of accuracy and exponents in the range 10 -38 to 10 38

87558

punctuation	words
the paragraph above has 18 words and 4 punctuation characters for example

87642
punctuation	words
this paragraph has 19 words and 4 punctuation so within expectations

87642
punctuation	words
i expect that non-whitespace . whitespace or newline is very rare in code but common in english so this could be counted as words not punctuation

87688
fflush	gets
on most terminals on line buffered streams in general output gets fflush when a n is encountered so a line not ending with n could be shown on screen much time after it s been actually printf d or maybe never if the stream never gets fflush for instance if the program crashes

87731
put	get
it will take a day longer to get the disposal repaired and an even longer delay before he can put it back that s acceptable

87770
pull	push
copy the hgrc from your local repo to your local clone this will make the default path the same for both repos so push pull incoming outgoing will all point at the server

87838
put	get
when the day comes that the customer wants a pool put in on the 50th floor and you see that the last 20 floors were built with sticks and sand make sure that the big fat estimate you produce for it is technically justifiable and get ready to roll out the paper trail of low-bidder invoices to illustrate why it s going to cost so much

87867
post	get
i don t really want to get into the discussion which kind of culture is better see the other post if you are interested all i am saying that it will be beneficial for your mental health if you work in a company with the same approach

see directdraw the graphics component of directx only dealt with 2d graphics allocating graphics memory and doing bit-blits between different allocated sections of memory

88055
ati	nvidia
eventually only nvidia and ati now amd remained and both had a good opengl implementation

88055
ati	nvidia
so you needed an nvidia codepath and an ati codepath just to have shaders at all

88055
ati	nvidia
eventually the arb likely under threat from both ati and nvidia both active members eventually pulled their head out long enough to provide actual assembly-style shaders

88055
hlsl	glsl
glsl is not a vector-based shading language the way hlsl was at the time

88201

cvs	svn
we run several legacy systems inhouse cvs svn and our main repository is a git system with sync ed caches in outlying offices

88535
g++	gcc
afaik most other compilers don t support the gcc g++ extensions

88535

this rumour then lived on even though delphi was always equally easy if not easier since pascal is a sane and logical language

88839
fortran	ada
i ve worked on several systems where components were written in multiple languages the worst offender required me to deliver code written in ada 83 c fortran 77 sql and dcl whereas my last job required me to deliver c++ and java code

88843
setinterval	settimeout
you s better use asynchronous ajax calls and the same way use settimeout setinterval to split a long computation phase and keep your application reactive

88849
for-loop	loops
a for-loop is ever so slightly higher level then a while loops

88885
moq	typemock

pull	push
but if you really wanted some kind of an automatic push merge pull thing and it was my job to build it for you the next thing i would do is ditch subversion and move to mercurial or git

89421
nant	cruisecontrol	ant	cruisecontrol
i ve been using cruisecontrol.net for years which is a spin off of cruisecontrol and nant a spin off of ant

89421
nant	cruisecontrol
since cruisecontrol can run nant scripts you can set up the build server to do pretty much anything

89422
imperative	declarative
it opined that xml as a tool sucks for build tool configuration because when it comes to imperative and not declarative logic that some tools cannot handle

89474
fast-forward	merge
i assume with this answer that both you and your boss working on the same repositories so you are having to do real rather than fast-forward merge

89505
pull	push
it also speaks to the concept of having a centralized origin that everyone can push and pull from instead of you having to merge in from everyone on your team

ready	each
i m imagining i will need a bunch of fetchers each running in their own thread that get pushed the next url to fetch when in a ready state

89811
children	parent
if we handled this by subclass then other children might need to be moved to this under this as a parent

89811
getter	setter
existing class exposes public variables all would need to be refactored into getter setter methods and need to extract an interface so that dynamic proxy could be used

89821
imperative	declarative
haskell is only hard because it is highly declarative while most popular languages these days are very imperative java python flavors of c

89844
redmine	trac

ssl	https
https ssl aes etc i can t figure out if i need to do anything or not beyond the usa encryption ern that i ve already completed

90006
ssl	https
my app is only using the built in https ssl so it would seem likely that it does not need any authorization as the email states instead of or in addition to accessing or using the encryption in ios but better wait for apple s response

90015
junit	jbehave
by automated tests i don t think i need to make a distinction between unit tests junit bdd jbehave fitness and ui selenium watir because i think they all provide similar value but feel free to write an answer that disagrees

i started by configuring a cvs repo no svn available at the time put a web interface on it for the customer

90175
put	get
i get stopped to put together a half fast quote as i cannot be late on the deadline in the meantime three support calls comes in i give quote time too much in quote so they outsource it

90188
put	get
as much as i hate them use gantt charts to display time lines of projects...when you get pulled off one project to put out fires or write a quote for another show how that pushes back the must do project

90210
feedback	review
and - being direct also means giving feedback on work - when you review his code which you should do with some regularity and find that you ll need to throw out 50 of it then his job needs to change from writing new code to fixing code to meet your expectations

90220
public	protected
you want to test behavior and not implementation and if a class does all it s work in one big public method or in many smaller protected methods that get called is implementation

90247
verilog	vhdl
fpga development is mostly split between verilog and vhdl

90456
post	get	post	put	put	get
of course sql and relational databases don t work like this and the closest they can get is to do a join between post and comments that will return a lot of unnecessary duplication of data with the same post information repeated in every row which means processing time is spent both on the database to put it all together and on my orm to parse and undo it all

90456
post	put
even if i instruct my orm to eagerly load the post s comments the best it ll do is to dispatch one query for the post and then a second query to retrieve all of the comments and then put them together client-side which is also inefficient

90461
children	parent
this represented data in a tree like structure with parent and children much like you are suggesting here

90463
post	put
then you claim that even if i instruct my orm to eagerly load the post s comments the best it ll do is to dispatch one query for the post and then a second query to retrieve all of the comments and then put them together client-side which is also inefficient

90470
websphere	ibm
the de-facto enterprise messaging standard is ibm s mqseries or now hidden as websphere something or other by ibms marketing dorks

90478
int	chars
using chars instead of int for smaller

90486
verilog	vhdl
so when you look for the next work you need to sell these skills harder than the say c c++ java python for application developer or python perl java html css javascript flash for web development or verilog vhdl for embedded development or any other set of languages for other domain of applications

90706
pull	push
is there mature and easy-to-use software with push and pull capability which serves all repos in a given folder

90717

the max i can write is 255 0xff and the minimum is 0

91254
versioning	upgrade
the user doesn t have to install anything and the application silently upgrade on the next request if a new versioning is available

91263
int	chars
likewise most c compilers for the 8051 for example keil c51 support a bit type in addition to standard c types like chars short int etc

91322
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox 6 google-chrome and safari support websockets and have them enabled

91322
opera	firefox
firefox 4+ and opera 11 support websockets and have them disabled

91326
lisp	scheme
note however that while macros are used as usual in any lisp scheme code they are not a central point of this

91397
put	get
they need to understand not only the database structure and how to efficienty get data out of it or put data into it but they also need to understand the meaning behind the data

you re going to run into issues where you ll get blocked from sites for doing things that other sites found perfectly acceptable due to some rule someone overheard or read in a blog post on seomoz that may or may not be interpreted correctly

91799
public	protected
if explicit is better than implicit why aren t there explicit access modifiers in python public protected private etc

91799
public	protected
it s very simple to change protected to public - and if you have a convoluted inheritance chain that makes it difficult you have a poor design - your design should be refined rather than relying on a language feature that makes it easy to write poorly structured code

91808
google-chrome	safari
current versions of google-chrome safari and the ios browser have websockets hixie-76 included and enabled by default

91808
google-chrome	safari
i expect that google-chrome and therefore safari will switch hybi version of the protocol very soon

91849
pull	push
while we were on the work network we could then push pull normally

91866
redmine	mantis
for more advanced folks we just let them use redmine directly given it is quite a bit more modern and user-friendly than mantis ever was

91897
submit	submission
bonus points if you can have ticket submission that doesn t even require the tracker s ui either via email or through a simple form that only has the fields required to submit the ticket

91941
cpython	ironpython
i looked up ironpython but this 3rd party software apparently requires cpython to leverage it s api so i m not sure that will work unless i go the com route

91990
ant	maven
there is also a section with a comparison between maven and ant

92262
hide	show
without one code compares often show a mess of whitespace formatting and may hide actual code changes

92356
width	height
it has lenght width and height

92372
put	get
if you do data refreshes from prod on a regular schedule by restoring backups and one might happen between when he leaves and the new person is up to speed on where things are it might be a good idea to make sure that the changes to the databases on dev that might get overwritten because they haven t moved to prod yet are in source control and in a script that can easily be run to put the dev database back to it s changed state

92390
pdcurses	ncurses	sdl	ncurses
you can use the tried and true ncurses ncurses or pdcurses depending on your system which is extremely straightforward and easy to use or you can dive into a graphics library like sdl or opengl

92414
public	protected
you can t just take everything that s private and make it public or protected and call that open. if you allow someone else to change the value of a variable you have to consider how all the possible values will affect the class

92415
public	protected
making everything private by default sounds harsh but look at it from the other side when everything is private by default making something public or protected which is almost the same thing is supposed to be a conscious choice

92415
public	protected
in well-designed libraries classes that are worth extending through inheritance have protected and public members in just the right places and hide everything else

92445
public	protected
to o.o.p. i started using private class members but after many projects i ended using protected and eventually promote those properties or methods to public if necessarily

92486
public	protected
once public and private become second nature to you then you can start pondering the world of protected where the real fun begins

92571
vb.net	vb6
nowadays it refers to a shift from vb6 to the managed world of vb.net

if they post 200k and find out you were making 100k at the last place you re probably going to get offered somewhere between 101-120k you ll get told that the 200k was for a very well qualified candidate with your experience +10 years and and your degree plus a phd etc

codeigniter	cakephp
for php - cakephp and codeigniter are two popular frameworks

92818
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
current versions of firefox google-chrome safari and opera do support this and other browsers just treat it like type text so it can be used without problems althoug then you don t have validation of course.

92819
qmap	qvector	qstring	qmap	qstring	qvector
qt does not use the standard c++ library but has its own qstring qvector qmap .

92819
qmap	qvector
note that the same applies to std map vs qmap std vector vs qvector and so on

92830
gif	png
i have over 10000 images which about 2000 are duplicates in other formats as in jpeg png gif

92830
gif	png
it ll find all duplicates of that image but only the 8 bit png sometimes 8bit gif and rarely jpeg because of the images algorithmic i suppose

92830
gif	png
yet again the jpeg image is not 100 similar to the png or gif format the same reason as above

92884
agile	sprint
in agile at the end of each sprint or iteration which is a unit of development work usually lasting between one and three weeks the entire team from the most junior members up to the pm has a retrospective

92884
agile	sprint
they practiced the scrum agile basic methodology with daily standups pair programming sprint teams and retrospectives

92943
put	get
there is always a possibility that you will get a false positive of course so the use to which you put the bloom filter has to be tolerant of that possibility

92945
hash	md5
an example would be md5 hash

92983
put	get
edit oh and yes if you re doing outside in checking that the form or more correctly enough of the form to implement your scenario appears correctly is a good start - don t put too much emphasis on testing the gui though you can easily get bogged down in fragile tests

93039
erlang	lisp
haskell isn t esteroic and is becoming more mainstream possbily not as mainstream as lisp or erlang

93045
haskell	ocaml
from haskell you can transition easily to other ml variants like f# or ocaml both of which are more widely used

93045
lisp	scheme
scheme is the more functionally oriented of the two main lisp dialects smaller and purer than common lisp but less widely used in industry

93045
haskell	scheme
you can also split the difference and learn both sort of at once with write yourself a scheme in 48 hours in haskell

93095
filesystems	ntfs
now some filesystems eg ntfs save small file content inside the directory entries

93105
client-side	server-side	jquery	scriptaculous
i m thinking about to switch in middle term to node.js for server-side and mostly jquery and scriptaculous for client-side web development

93183
getter	setter
is it better to manage this state in setter or is it better to do it in getter

93183
getter	setter
i would think doing it in getter lazily would mean we would compute and presumably cache only what we need while doing it in setter means we re essentially overcomputing anticipating what getter may be called in the future and precomputing their results

93186
getter	setter
generally speaking if the logic takes a non-trivial time to execute it should be done in a method not a getter or setter

93186
getter	setter
by convention getter and setter are expected to return almost immediately whereas methods are expected to take...a little longer

93196
getter	setter
if it isn t then deciding whether to put that logic in the getter the setter or somewhere else is nothing compared to your wider architectural concerns.

93212
getter	setter
setter and getter for properties should not perform extensive computation

93212
getter	setter
setter and getter for properties should not be exposed in the public interface if avoidable

93218
getter	setter
i asked a similar question myself a while back and what i ve concluded is this getter and setter should not perform extensive operations themselves but may raise events which do perform a fair amount of logic

93262
ready	each
the testers results are less relevant because they don t know as much about what s going on the devs begin to dread the flood of what they consider to be inconsequential details that are in parts of the program that haven t been touched in two months the test team gets annoyed that none of the filed bugs are being fixed because the schedule is screwed up and the devs are busy getting ready for demos or adding requested features etc and in general both groups see each other as antagonistic others as opposed to team members

93324
folder	directory
you can easily know where the controller is since there is one one controller per folder but for classes like models you don t need to search for where the files are as they are under one directory that also keeps the names of the models cleaner

93457
interpreted-language	compiled-language
indeed this is one of the advantages of interpreted-language - the change test cycle time is reduced compared with compiled-language

93567
translation	localization
given that browsers chromium chrome thus far afaik seem to be introducing embedded site translation and utilities such as wibiya and given the amount of work that localizing a site can be depending on framework view re-writes database-driven message localization etc does it make sense to put in work to localize sites that are intended for an international market anymore

93610
translation	localization
online translation tools are intended to help people read things which aren t aimed at an international audience not as a replacement for localization

93610
translation	localization
if you don t know the languages or can t afford to do the localization then your best bet is probably to have an english version available partly because english is the most widely used globally but also as the translation engines tend to be better at going to and from english than other languages

93700
agile	sprint
having worked on numerous agile projects with varying degrees of fidelity to the manifesto and varying degrees of success my analysis is that our problem is sprint being too short

93700
agile	sprint
my first and most successful agile project had four week sprint which i gather is pretty huge by industry standards but it worked great for us

93717
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
i typically do this for equations containing only addition and subtraction i find it very easy to make a typo with multiplication and division that can seriously mess up the scope of the operator

93745
put	get
you ask the bookshelf to get a book down for you open put the book away and the bookshelf will handle all the details of create open and closed

93758
feedback	review
so if it s basic crud you re talking about then a good book some practice and pair programming or code review with confidence building feedback should do the trick

93801
vim	emacs
i think there is room for perfectly civilized conversation -- it s hardly vim vs emacs

93872
pull	push
i brought up my specific concern about indentation characters and he thought a better solution would be to create some kind of script that could convert all that when we push pull from the repo. i suspect that he doesn t want to change and this solution seems overly complicated and prone to maintenance issues down the road also this addresses only one manifestation of a larger issue

93972
paradox	bde
i work on a pretty old application which was converted from dos and flat files for storing information to paradox tables using the bde then to mysql relational database

93981
informix	ingres	ingres	oracle
oracle ingres and informix were all shipping server-oriented commercial relational databases in the early 80s and doing quite nicely at it

93981
paradox	dbase
the most popular microcomputer databases back in the 80s were decidedly not relational - this would include dbase foxpro filemaker and paradox

94061
range	max
if you re just writing standard business software running visual studio or eclipse and surfing stackoverflow for answers then the extra power is cool bragging rights but realistically a mid range machine will not max out the cpu or memory in a standard box today

94081
pull	push
dev 2 has to pull fetch and merge the latest snapshot of git repo a before he can push to git repo a

94100
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
keep in mind that in the worst case scenario where enough money is involved to make a few days of work worth the effort any programmer can take some open source libraries and write a browser like application that can send you mostly any kind of data he likes and fake being ie firefox safari or google-chrome on any os he likes your server to believe it comes from

94185
agile	sprint
as long as by the end of the sprint i still have working software then my project is agile

94361
put	get
put these in writing get commitment from everyone and stick to it

94379
teamcity	dotcover
a while ago i contacted jetbrains authors of resharper dotcover and teamcity

94379
teamcity	dotcover
since i am the leader of the open source project i got open source licenses for resharper dotcover and teamcity

94466
centos	linux
i also don t mind recommending using centos as the linux os for the guests

94568
svg	vml
i would recommend raphael javascript library for the graphics it uses svg if possible or vml in older ie browsers and is very easy to use for this kind of game graphics

94611
super	extends
as far as loc goes most companies probably use this as a pitch that their product is super powerful but i would be much more impressed by an erp system written in 500 loc than one written in 500 000 because the 500 line version is exponentially easier to maintain and extends

94611
short	base
in short no do not base your pricing scheme off of something that is 90 arbitrary and the customer associates no value with

94623
unix	solaris
i actually used a c api that was compatible with sun solaris and hp unix where compatible with compiled successfully on

94629
feedback	review
if you are still concerned send his finished code to one of your c# friends or perhaps a business partner and ask them if they could review it and provide feedback

94679
pull	push
then you code a little then get your tests to pass then commit then pull and push again

94705
postgresql	mysql
suppose the middle tier servers are replicated 3 way and the backend database mysql postgresql etc... is replicated 3 way

94881
agile	sprint
however you can still be agile and maybe use the other characteristics of the scrum like maintaining product sprint backlog and planning working under sprint iterations reviewing and getting feedback from all stakeholders and re-planning and so on

95020
width	height
otherwise i would add the first background to the node and then have the second background on a nested with 100 width height inside it

95020
width	height
the width height on the html node is mostly for clarity of my background pattern s intentions

95163
post	get
i am concerned that the sort of architecture mentioned above could get unwieldy pretty fast if we are passing hundreds of elements into the web service from a jquery ajax post

95164
processors	hyperthreading
otoh i doubt you ll see a single-core processors with hyperthreading disabled by default

95221
getter	setter
so if you know a person has first name then it is probably called firstname and the getter setter are probably getfirstname and setfirstname...

95280
int	chars
in programming languages when numbers either int or real are printed out are they firstly converted to the codes of the readable chars that are meant to represent the numbers and then the codes are then decoded into the readable chars

95317
post	get
this way the instance id is never in the open the instance id or a future one can t be guessed and spoofed because of the secret a user can t replay a particular instance id to the server and if the user attempts to use a valid running session to spoof an analytics post they will only be able to get one bogus request in before the real analytics code fails due to an out of sync instance id

95317
post	get
if you get an invalid instance id on an analytics post you ll at least know that that instance id s data is now suspect

95321
subtraction	addition
which arithmetic symbols represent addition and subtraction

95342
client-side	server-side
anyway if you re alone and you wanna create your own web application you have to be both server-side programmer and designer+ client-side programmer

95364
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading doesn t add new cores to the cpu

95434
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
have a look at javascriptmvc or backbone.js

95454
mri	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
yesterday i read this great article about concurrency in jruby from engineyard and i realise i need to leverage my skills about concurrency in ruby by mentioning ruby here i mean it could be all implementations of ruby jruby ruby mri rubinius ruby on parrot cardinal except ironruby i don t code in windows environment

95458
min	max
i d also avoid min and max values

95469
postgresql	mysql
you should also take the time to learn sql oracle mysql postgresql and mssql have much in common regarding syntax but if i had to just pick learning one for myself id pick postgresql just because it s bsd licensed instead of gpl you should look up a compare and contrast on gpl bsd licenses too

95528
ada	pascal
once upon a time i d have suggested modula 2 or a non-standard pascal possibly even ada as an alternative to c

95548
erlang	lisp
lisp haskell or erlang are my personal choices

95587
hex	binary
you re writing in hex with the high-order nybble on the left or binary with the most significant bit on the left

95615
webkit	gecko
some features are ignored by webkit browsers and some by gecko browsers and yet ie tends to just ignore everything quite frankly

95616
google-chrome	firefox
yet firefox and google-chrome does not

95667
ubuntu	linux
i m not happy with our build environment for our linux based ubuntu 10.04 equipment

95667
boost	stl
we currently use boost and stl libraries for obtaining as much platform independence as possible

95761
put	get
put some work into your job posting to get the type of people you want to join your team

95761
post	get
if you post a boilerplate posting you will get generic code monkeys that probably won t be a good fit

95775
jasmine	sinon
testing backbone applications with jasmine and sinon

95788
client-side	server-side
many web frameworks and dare i say methodologies mvc et al have been developed to create a boundary between the pure server-side work and the client-side work

95788
client-side	server-side
i make this seemingly rambly answer to challenge your statement that there are server-side developers and client-side developers

95789
boost	stl
boost is a set of libraries some being made of heavy metaprogramming black magic and are used in a lot of c++ shops as stl++ an extension of the stl and it is

95796
post	get
i get the impression it s not very liked based on some questions on stackexchange as well as post such as

95799
try-catch	exception-handling
you probably mean exception-handling handling in the form of try-catch statements however this is also a type of manual exception-handling handling c++ and it s been around forever

95816
google-chrome	firefox
that being said i only learned it so i could learn ajax to write some google-chrome firefox addons

95845
super	implements
in some sense since it s way of ruby to implements something similar to multiple inheritance but somehow more powerful you could say that they are a super class that accesses functionality in it s child classes which is a big load of coupling

95854
subtraction	addition
ok here s the reason as i ve had it explained to me addition and subtraction

95854
subtract	add
when you add or subtract multi-byte numbers you have to start with the least significant byte

95886
mouse	keyboard
and my own mouse and keyboard

95893
integer	unsigned
one reason why i don t use unsigned integer types all that much in delphi is that they can create problems when mixed with signed integers

95893
integer	unsigned
i had i declared as an unsigned integer after all it s an index into a list that starts at 0 it never has to be negative right

95916
mvp	presenter
does mvp sound reasonable with a model implemented in javascript presenter classes to implement events in an abstract way that s easier to unit test and the view to handle the actual dom stuff

95948
post	get
always good to keep learning and get post qualifications

95969
udp	tcp
note that for people to be able to join my router has to be configured to port forward 6112 tcp and udp see blizzard support

95994
subtraction	addition
however when you perform arithmetic like addition or subtraction you start with the end

95994
subtract	add
for add subtract or comparison it is simpler to implement if you already have logic to read the memory in order if the numbers are reversed

96091
google-chrome	firefox
so if your application incorporates this market you will have to cope with ie6 as well as ie9 and google-chrome firefox et al

96094
agile	sprint
the very purpose of agile methodology and sprint development is to support the new and changing requirements of the stakeholders

96208
portrait	landscape
what about a phone browser that switches landscape portrait modes as you rotate the phone

96245
post	get
its not necessary that you need to learn multiple language for oo concepts start off with one language which you like over a period of time you will get a strong foothold on the language post this its feasible to explore some things which you have done already and try to execute the same on a different language

96251
mouse	keyboard
i bring my own keyboard and mouse

96251
mouse	keyboard
my preference is to use a unicomp customizer keyboard and an evoluent vertical mouse

96251
mouse	keyboard
they can keep the keyboard mouse the machine came with

96269
range	percentile
the best course of action would have been not to provide any breakdown of how your rate is applied and say that you are covering your costs and trying to price at market rate or on some percentile of the range of market rates based on the scope of the project and your expertise

96308
wordpress	joomla
big companies spend almost thousands of dollars to get a good site in joomla or wordpress

96308
wordpress	joomla
in that case wordpress joomla drupal or any other cms could be a very good candidate and you shouldn t write your own cms

96308
ready	each
i actually wanted to use ready cms software but after a spending a valuable time on learning different cmss and finding weaknesses of each one i ended up creating my own cms

96318
cvs	svn
if you use dinasours such as cvs and svn as you main repo then less often can be an advantage and consider replacements

96318
cvs	svn
theres good reason to use git locally and deliver upto a central repo can be git cvs svn or almost anything you want at approiate times

96362
put	get
everyone should know developers take a while to get up to speed but there s an upper limit people are willing to put up with

96368
agile	sprint
the idea of agile is that you iterate fast and establish exactly what you re going to deliver at the end of each sprint so when the 2 3 4 weeks of your sprint is up you have tangible features in your application project that you can present to your client and get feedback

96383
try-catch	exception-handling
this means programmers often consider exception-handling as no problem situation but with standard exception-handling attitude they still have to bother with try-catch

96407
cpython	ironpython
sure jython isn t perfect - it lags 2.5 somewhat behind cpython 3.2 and even ironpython 2.7 but that just makes it contemporary with guido s book

96412
wordpress	joomla
only you can answer whether wordpress or drupal can do what you need a cms to do but if you want to try them out why not use a virtual machine from turnkey linux such as the one for wordpress drupal joomla or any of the others with the content management tag

96412
vmware	virtualbox
assuming you already have vmware or virtualbox installed within a few minutes of downloading any of these appliances you could be trying out the software yourself with minimal time investment

96429
getter	setter
getter are not referentially transparent - if a setter is called between calls to the getter the getter s return value changes even though its parameters have not typically no parameters

96429
getter	setter
i know in scala we just kind accept the fact we are meshing together two paradigms functional and object oriented and use getter setter as we would in a language like java

96429
getter	setter
in a language like haskell which i m not fluent with but i m told holds truer to a pure functional language i m just curious how you would model properties on objects such that getter are referentially transparent and setter are side-effect free

96454
filtering	grouping
we added filtering sorters and grouping so that rpt file was customizable but they couldn t create one from scratch

96467
pentaho	olap
to keep costs down we chose postgresql as the dwh database and pentaho enterprise as the bi olap analysis tool - we chose the paid version because the olap tool is much more user friendly

96521
int	chars
however this breaks down if you were to do a switch case on a string where trying to access the north index of an array would cause an error or if the compiler allowed this behind the scenes i still don t see how it would avoid comparisons when converting the chars array into an int in order to access the array.

96554
versioning	upgrade
for example as a user of ide i am perfectly happy to upgrade to new versioning once or maybe twice a year and i am never in a hurry to do that

96554
versioning	upgrade
another month passed - they released another new versioning our feature was there but same regression bug was there too again we didn t upgrade

96554
agile	sprint
for me one of the most important parts of agile is having a shippable release at the end of each sprint

96577
postgresql	mysql
besides there are other db engines to choose from at least two of which mysql and postgresql are free and don t have the concurrency limitations of sqlite

96590
feedback	review
also code review only give feedback to an individual engineer not the entire team

96594
opera	firefox
yes that is possible think firefox or opera for example -

96626
wordpress	expressionengine
simply put if cost wordpress cost expressionengine then spend the 300

96685
int	boolean
given the features you ve already built i suggest adding three data types int string boolean

96770
delphi	oxygene	pascal	delphi
i know there are a few different flavors of pascal delphi free pascal oxygene quick pascal apple pascal etc. and they introduced the same features at different times and in parallel

96787
pascal	delphi
does free pascal introduce any significant language features over turbo pascal then delphi or does it just introduce the turbo pascal delphi flavors of pascal to more platforms

96789
pascal	delphi
i was reading in the side bar of the java language wiki page and it says it was influenced by pascal and delphi

96789
pascal	delphi
i am curious if someone who knows java and pascal delphi really well could look at java and say feature x in java is influenced by feature y in pascal or delphi .

96789
pascal	delphi
additionally was the influence in later versions of java so the feature from pascal or delphi didn t show up until java version z or was it actually in the seeds of the java language

96789
pascal	delphi
alternatively it may be that delphi or pascal influenced the java platform in some other way and not the language specifically

96819
put	get
to put it another way there s an assumption that you always get what you pay for on both ends of the price spectrum

96848
pascal	delphi
delphi ships with the vcl as a standard feature and a lot of the language design specifically the changes that differentiate delphi 1 from turbo pascal 7 were originally put in place either to make the vcl work right or to make the vcl s form designer in the ide work right

96878
pascal	delphi
object pascal was the biggest unofficial standards leap with the release of delphi 1 in the mid-90s

96878
pascal	delphi
thankfully the free pascal project developers has been quite accommodating of features added to delphi by both borland and embarcadero

96893
jython	pypy
in the future you can need know others jython pypy etc

96928
pascal	delphi
anders was with borland until delphi 3 - he was the original architect of delphi as well as turbo pascal

96939
hide	show
onrunworkercompleted -- hide the previously displayed control show the new control the worker has been drawing on

96943
bazaar	git
i don t know how many such rants i ve seen the last few weeks but they all seem to consider it as fact that mercurial and or bazaar are objectively better than git

96947
implements	extends
i know that one class can implements multiple interfaces but can only extends one abstract class

96949
implements	extends
in an abstract class you can implements some methods and leave force the rest to be implements by the extends class

96953
implements	extends
here is an example of an class that extends an abstract class that implements two interfaces java

96953
public	protected
there are more aspects interface only public methods abstract class protected abstract and public abstract methods but you can read that for yourself

96991
int	boolean
that is because somewhere along the line somebody cast it to an int then in a function that is supposed to set it to true incremented it if it s 0 for false it would be set to 1 which is vb true so i can see the logic there then cast it back to a boolean

97022
disk	ram	wan	lan
from fastest to slowest on a modern server you have cpu l1 - l2 - l3 - ram - disk lan - wan

97022
disk	ram
the jump from even the fastest modern magnetic disk to the slowest ram is over 1000x for sequential access

97026
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
the other alternatives such as svn and bazaar were great they just did not make it quite as easy as git

97028
bazaar	git
git hg and bazaar are all perfectly good dvcs systems but a frightening number of people equate dvcs with git and think that all the lovely features of a dvcs are unique to git

97028
bazaar	git
and so they use git and recommend git and say things like git is better because it can do octopus merges so can bazaar or git is better because it is distributed so is any dvcs hence the name or git is better because it makes branching and merging easy again this is true of every dvcs

97033
bazaar	git
git mercurial and bazaar were the big winners here

97033
kde	gnome
git linux perl jquery ruby on rails eclipse gnome kde qt x

97057
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
you might be interested to read why the gnome desktop project chose git over hg and bazaar when it decided to move from svn a few years back

97061
pascal	delphi
this same site shows a more recent influence into java from c# which has its own lineage going back to pascal - turbo pascal - delphi through its architect anders hejlsberg

97116
bazaar	git
git seems much easier to extend than bazaar and you don t have to use any one particular api to do it

97116
bazaar	git
long story short i ve used bazaar for a very long time but git is quickly proving its awesomeness to me

97136
bazaar	git
this includes git with variants mercurial bazaar and lots of external tools notable exceptions opendiff and kaleidoscope on the mac so with good probability you are already using the best options

97159
put	get
i just want to make sure that you don t put in too much of your time reinventing the wheel and get frustrated at a certain point and just say eff it when you can stretch your talents and show people employers included what you ve got with the tools currently available

97222
int	double
int double and so on

97237
free	malloc
and two you can skip the garbage collector if you want to and just use c s malloc and free

97242
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
like you haven t switched to google-chrome when it appeared but you had and you still have to check if your website is compatible with ie7 to ie9 ff3 to ff5 opera safari and.

97251
mouse	keyboard
the hardware devices will take many form factors laptop hand held ear bud projector for monitor wireless keyboard and toe controlled mouse but they ll all run the same opperating systems and apps

97291
post	get
http is a network protocol defined in terms of sequences of octets but it s very useful at least for english-speaking programmers that these correspond to the ascii encoding of words like get post accept-language and so on

97291
decoder	encoder
the chunk types in the png image format consist of four octets but it s handy if you re programming a png encoder or decoder that idat means image data and plte means palette

97340
photoshop	fireworks
i personally have both photoshop and fireworks on my work pc and i perform both image cutting and capturing to create the most optimal css possible using the smallest number of images in sprite sheets

97350
ienumerable	ienumerator
the yield keyword can only be used in context of an iterator method having a return type of ienumerable ienumerator or . and there is a special relationship with foreach

97362
yslow	pagespeed
i know about pagespeed or webpagetest or firebug or yslow and plugins like that

97377
inherited	properties
the class that inherited this command class has the properties age and name

97446
getter	setter
if i have a class with a variable that is private and the class have getter and setter for that variable

97446
getter	setter
the only case i think you have to use getter and setter is if you need to do some operation besides the set or the get

97447
getter	setter
the user of getter and setter goes into the principle of encapsulation

97447
getter	setter
if a setter getter is used then you have nothing to change

97447
getter	setter
another possibility is changing the type of the variable in which case just add some transformation code to the getter setter and you are fine

97449
accessor	properties	getter	setter
a properties is a field that has built-in accessor getter and setter

97449
getter	setter
java for instance doesn t have properties but it s recommended to write the getter and setter to a private field

97449
getter	setter
so why do we need getter and setter

97449
getter	setter
however there are a lot of frameworks that assume that you are following the javabean naming convention talking about java here therefore in those cases you should declare all the getter and setter following the naming convetion

97450
getter	setter
using getter and setter also enables you to control what content gets stored in a particular variable

97450
getter	setter
the already mentioned change of a variable name is only one of many many changes that are much easier to make if you have functions like getter and setter

97467
openbsd	linux
besides linux there s two os worth trying one is plan9 which in some ways is a better unix than unix and the other one is openbsd

97493
getter	setter
setter and getter are a fairly bad idea

97493
getter	setter
i ve thought about it and honestly i can t come up with a difference between a setter getter and a public variable in practice

97493
getter	setter
in theory a setter and getter add a place to take some extra actions when a variable is set gotten and in theory they isolate your code from changes

97493
getter	setter
in reality i rarely see setter and getter used to add an action and when you do want to add an action you want to add it to all the setter or getter of a class like logging which should make you think that there ought to be a better solution

97493
getter	setter
by the way i m in no way advocating public variables--i m saying setter and getter and even properties are way too close to already being public variables

97493
getter	setter
the big problem is simply that people who aren t oo programmers are too tempted to use setter and getter to make objects into property-balls structures that are passed around and operated on pretty much the opposite of how object oriented code works

97504
converter	multibinding
build yourself some tooling out of binding converter multibinding etc that allows you to express more complex binding expressions

97544
integer	unsigned
since the positive maximum of a 32 bit integer is 2 147 483 647 then you should use an unsigned int if you know it will a never be negative and b might reach 2 147 483 648

97561
implements	extends
in java to have the gui do something on mouse click or key press you will need to implements whole appropriate listener interface or extends adapter class

97603
inherited	subclassing	implements	extends
if it s java then i will ask about extends and implements but not subclassing and inherited

97635
cpu	hyperthreading
first of a single threaded application will never take advantage of a multi-core cpu or hyperthreading

97708
zeromq	qpid
and with the advent of much of the new peer-to-peer code like amqp rabbitmq qpid etc. and zeromq it s much easier to split threads across different process spaces and even machines and networks greatly simplifying things

97728
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
check out backbone.js so far its one of the best solutions along with javascriptmvc to give some order into the caos beauty of large scale javascript applications

97766
rss	feed
the idea is to crawl one specific website that has multiple entries much like an rss feed but they don t offer that an rss feed of the site.

97850
extjs	qooxdoo
i suggest you check out knockout and jquery as well as qooxdoo and extjs if you re looking for something full-blown

97868
ironruby	ironpython
my initial idea was to turn my logical expressions into snippets of python or ruby then run these snippets through ironpython or ironruby to evaluate the result

97893
try-catch	exception-handling
putting all the code in try-catch statements is absurd but don t forget to report and log all exception-handling

97902
try-catch	exception-handling
you should use try-catch when appropriate but please oh please don t catch all exception-handling and not even log it

98009
ubuntu	linux
i imagine it d be faster if your linux install is in a local vm there s a nice vmware ubuntu appliance available on the web but i needed a set of tesla gpu cards that weren t installed in my laptop

98021
pull	push
then as you said i do a simple git push git pull on live to pull the info in

98057
dia	visio
dia is good but is not a great alternative to visio

98057
websphere	ibm
sure we could use websphere community edition with eclipse instead of rad but we ve had ibm help us with critical issues and bugfixes which is not something we had the time or resources to fix ourselves

98072
yacc	bison
normally if you wanted to write a parser of some sort say to implement a programming language you would have to either read the bnf specification and write a whole bunch of loopy code to parse it or you would have to use a compiler compiler like flex bison yacc etc

98072
yacc	bison
parsers can t really be done without either monads or special-purpose languages like yacc bison etc

98105
put	get
if you are working on a project put aside the new project and get on with the other original project.

98126
versioning	upgrade
i am in charge of the deployment or implementation work.due to my company s immaturity product there is a versioning upgrade serveral days

98126
versioning	upgrade
each time there is a upgrade versioning i had to notify the customer they had to replace their old versioning product.what i do is reconfigure all the configuration files for different customers who has its specific needs

98180
pull	push
commit then pull and push again

98311
public	protected
write unit tests for all public and protected methods member functions for the c++ crowd

98321
imperative	declarative
what language paradigm should i recomend him - imperative or declarative

98378
scheme	prolog
i used to teach prolog as a first language to freshmen followed by scheme and java in the next semesters

98400
imperative	declarative
declarative may be more math-like but in real life we much more frequently use imperative statements to convey instructions

98403
imperative	declarative
assuming that they want to learn in the first place a given student may do extremely well with a declarative language or may need an imperative language to get a conceptual foothold

98404
pascal	delphi
looking back at delphi s pascal language innovations - i would add the property method event pme model and the published section for classes

98487
g++	gcc
i ll be moving from using c c++ with gcc g++ to vb.net on vs 2010
