I was able to decode this in SQL, but I was a little wary of doing this since I didn\'t know exactly what was happening at the time.
63: Since my input is a basic string, I started with just a snippet of the encoded portion - 4445434C41 (which translates to DECLA) - and the first attempt was to do this...

...and all it did was return the exact same thing that I put in, since it converted each character into is byte.
64: I realized that I need to parse each two characters into a byte manually since I don\'t know of any methods yet that will do that, so now my little decoder looks something like this:

Things look good for the first couple of pairs, but then the loop balks when it gets to the "4C" pair and says that the string is in the incorrect format.

Another approach would be to utilize a private/protected method to actually do the getting (caching/db/etc), and a public wrapper for it that increments the count:

Germans use 10.000,50

My first approach would be to take the string, parse it backwards, until I encounter a separator and use this as my decimal separator.
110: There is an obvious flaw with that: 10.000 would be interpreted as 10.
111: Another approach: if the string contains 2 different non-numeric characters, use the last one as the decimal separator and discard the others.

235: Common pitfalls for client-side password hashing:

If the connection between the client and server is unencrypted, everything you do is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
236: The hashed password received by the server is less secure if you don\'t do additional, redundant work on the server.
237: Storing passwords
Don\'t ever store passwords as plaintext in the database.
238: The best hashing function seems to be bcrypt.
239: For instance, identical passwords mean identical hashes--this makes hash lookup tables an effective way of cracking lots of passwords at once.
240: See here for more on this.
241: Anything a security question does, a password does better.
242: Cookies can be hijacked: they are only as secure as the rest of the client\'s machine and other communications.
243: For example, when you return to visit Amazon, they show you a page that looks like you\'re logged in, but when you go to place an order (or change your shipping address, credit card etc.
244: Financial web sites such as banks and credit cards, on the other hand, only have sensitive data and should not allow auto-login or a low-security mode.
245: ('I would like to test a function with a tuple from a set of fringe cases and normal values.
246: ; what is more, main aim is to generate combinations of these values, with or without repetition, in order to get a set of test data.
247: The issue was that I had most certainly not developed my application for medium trust (or had any clue what that was.)
248: In C#, the \'int\' type is the same as  and is a value type (ie more like the java \'int\').
249: An integer (just like any other value types) can be boxed ("wrapped") into an object.
250: The differences between objects and primitives are somewhat beyond the scope of this question, but to summarize: 
Objects provide facilities for polymorphism, are passed by reference (or more accurately have references passed by value), and are allocated from the heap.
251: I\'m not 100% sure, but I\'m thinking that the Integer object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property (like the toString() method for example).
252: So Integer is a fancy way to work with an int (Just as perhaps String is a fancy way to work with a group of chars).
253: ('Sign up for an account on as many major email providers as possible (gmail/yahoo/hotmail/aol/etc).
254: If you make changes to your emails, either major rewording, changes to the code that sends the emails, changes to your email servers, etc, make sure to send test messages to all your accounts and verify that they are not being marked as spam.
255: I am always a bit careful when working with binary data, as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time).

258: ("I've taken to hand-coding all of my DDL (creates/alter/delete) statements, adding them to my .sln as text files, and using normal versioning (using subversion, but any revision control should work).
259: This way, I not only get the benefit of versioning, but updating live from dev/stage is the same process for code and database - tags, branches and so on work all the same.
260: A few things I would need to do include adding contacts to a given user\'s address book, sending emails as a given user and running reports on contacts for a user.
261: All of this is pretty easy to do with WebDAV, but if there is a better way that doesn\'t require any functionality that is likely to be deprecated any time soon.

Can anyone show me where I\'m being silly?
263: I would do this by picking combinations, something like the following in python.
264: Then you can more easily verify the tests are correct.
265: It's basically a two-click operation to compare two schemas and generate a sync script from one to the other.

267: ("I work the same way Karl does, by keeping all of my SQL scripts for creating and altering tables in a text file that I keep in source control.
268: In fact, to avoid the problem of having to have a script examine the live database to determine what ALTERs to run, I usually work like this:

On the first version, I place everything during testing into one SQL script, and treat all tables as a CREATE.
269: And I make the changes to the original, create a fresh database script as well.

274: ("The typical solution is to dump the database as necessary and backup those files.
275: I\'d like a similar function/class for C++ or C# which can generate more than 32 bits of randomness and which low-order bits are equally as random as high-order bits.

It must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode.
279: Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because you write less code, these operations do happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.
280: Some google results show a similar error with Python and FCGI so moving to mongrel would be a good idea.
281: Can anyone give me the most efficient code for this?
282: If you only run the numbers 1 more and 1 less than the multiples of 6, it could be even faster, as all prime numbers above 3 are 1 away from some multiple of six.

296: I've got Windows authentication mode set in the Web.config, disabled anonymous access and configured the correct default domain in IIS, but it's still asking the user to log in and, more annoyingly, the user is required to provide the domain too (DOMAIN\\auser), which is causing problems with non-technical visitors.

306: Rainbow table crackers like Ophcrack use space to attack passwords; incremental crackers like John the Ripper, Crack, and LC5 work with time: statistics and compute.
307: The better you can optimize your password hash function, the faster your password hash function gets, the weaker your scheme is.
308: MD5 and SHA1, even conventional block ciphers like DES, are designed to be fast.
309: On modern CPUs, raw crypto building blocks like DES and MD5 can be bitsliced, vectorized, and parallelized to make password searches lightning fast.

312: At that point you could store the session information in a database or memcache like solution so that all application servers have access to the data.
313: Storing your own sessions may also be advantageous if you are on a shared server because it will let you store it in the database which you often times have more control over then the filesystem.

319: If anyone has run across getting everything to run natively under OpenBSD that would be great, but what I think I may have to do is setting up a second server running CentOS with DB2 installed (most likely via ZendCore for IBM since it seems to do all this for me) and the driver so that I can set up a small transaction server that I can post against and get a JSON representation of the DB2 data that I need.

321: Here they\'re getting a list of files in a directory, then filtering the list for all files that match a regular expression criteria.
322: You could do this without regular expressions, for your example, for anything where your expression at the end returns true for a match.

388: ('Git is not better than Subversion.
389: But is also not worse.
390: It\'s by no means bad (there is a reason Linus wrote it for the Linux Kernel development after all), but I feel that many people jump on the "Distributed Source Control" train just because it\'s new and is written by Linus Torvalds, without actually knowing why/if it\'s better.
391: Edit: So this answer is now a year old and still generates many upvotes, so I thought I\'ll add some more explanations.
392: In the last year since writing this, Git has gained a lot of momentum and support, particularly since sites like GitHub really took off.
393: I\'m using both Git and Subversion nowadays and I\'d like to share some personal insight.
394: Two modes of creating repositories, checkout vs. clone, commit vs. push... You have to know which commands work locally and which work with "the server" (I\'m assuming most people still like a central "master-repository").
395: Also, the tooling is still insufficient, at least on Windows.
396: SVN has the advantage that it\'s MUCH simpler to learn: There is your repository, all changes to towards it, if you know how to create, commit and checkout and you\'re ready to go and can pickup stuff like branching, update etc.
397: Git has the advantage that it\'s MUCH better suited if some developers are not always connected to the master repository.
398: And from what I hear, branching and merging support is a lot better (which is to be expected, as these are the core reasons it was written).
399: This also explains why it gains so much buzz on the Internet, as Git is perfectly suited for Open Source projects: Just Fork it, commit your changes to your own Fork, and then ask the original project maintainer to pull your changes.
400: But even with this lengthy addition, I still stand by my core message: Git is not better or worse, it\'s just different.
401: But if you have a strictly centralized Source Control and/or are struggling to introduce Source Control in the first place because your co-workers are not interested, then the simplicity and excellent tooling (at least on Windows) of SVN shine.
402: Benchmarks indicate that it's considerably faster (given its distributed nature, operations like diffs and logs are all local so of course it's blazingly faster in this case), and working folders are smaller (which still blows my mind).
403: This represents a snapshot in time of what the repository looks like.
404: You'd think that Git would take up a bunch of space on your harddrive, but from a couple benchmarks I've seen, it actually takes less.
405: You can force variables to pass by reference using an &
Assigned by value/reference example:

413: If I'm developing a single project on my PC/laptop, git is better, because it is far easier to set up and use.
414: You can do this just as well with git as with SVN, but the benefits of git get outweighed by the need to do additional steps to synch with a central server.
415: SVN also has the benefit of better GUI tools, however the git ecosystem seems to be catching up quickly, so I wouldn't worry about this in the long term.
416: Obviously this is less then ideal but it will get the job done and let you use SCP/SFTP in classic ASP.
417: Certainly that would be the most sane route, then I believe you can migrate from 7 directly to 2005 pretty painlessly.
418: As for scripting out all the objects - I would advise against it as you will inevitably miss something (unless your database is truly trivial).
419: PHP\'s handling of objects has been completely rewritten, allowing for better performance and more features.
420: In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like primitive types (for instance integers and strings).
421: The drawback of this method was that semantically the whole object was copied when a variable was assigned, or passed as a parameter to a method.

The reason for this is that different languages often order the words differently, and concatenating strings directly will need a new build to fix, but if you used some kind of string replacement mechanism like above, you can modify your .resx file (or whatever localization files you use) for the specific language that needs to reorder the words.

494: The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.
495: Now here\'s the rub:
When it\'s run under a lightweight debug environment (say ) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an  when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify,  or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn\'t crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above , disk light is not on, the program\'s going as fast it can, box consuming  of 2G of RAM).
496: My current best guesses as to where to next is:

Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an ); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or
Rewrite operators  and  to use  and  to mark memory as read-only as soon as it\'s done with.

525: When data is stored on disk based storage devices, it is stored as blocks of data.
526: Disk blocks are structured in much the same way as linked lists; both contain a section for data, a pointer to the location of the next node (or block), and both need not be stored contiguously.
527: Due to the fact that a number of records can only be sorted on one field, we can state that searching on a field that isn\xe2\x80\x99t sorted requires a Linear Search which requires  block accesses (on average), where  is the number of blocks that the table spans.
528: The downside to indexing is that these indexes require additional space on the disk, since the indexes are stored together in a table using the MyISAM engine, this file can quickly reach the size limits of the underlying file system if many fields within the same table are indexed.
529: To find the address of the actual record, which requires a further block access to read, bringing the total to  block accesses, a far cry from the 1,000,000 block accesses required to find a firstName match in the non-indexed table.
530: Given that creating an index requires additional disk space (277,778 blocks extra from the above example, a ~28% increase), and that too many indexes can cause issues arising from the file systems size limits, careful thought must be used to select the correct fields to index.
531: With such a low cardinality the effectiveness is reduced to a linear sort, and the query optimizer will avoid using the index if the cardinality is less than 30% of the record number, effectively making the index a waste of space.

speed of updates (insert, update, delete)
speed of random access retrieval
speed of sequential retrieval

I think that you\'ll find that a data structure that is speedy will generally consume more memory than one that is slow.
565: This isn\'t always the case, but most data structures seems to follow this.

623: What distance metric in that space best represents human vision (euclidean?)
624: ("The problem with a generic tool is that it is very difficult to come up with a set of rules that will only match against a genuine attack.
625: ('In my opinion it is more a question of personal preference.
626: nAnt is a great framework and MSBuild is almost as capable.

629: ('The easiest distance would of course be to just consider the colors as 3d vectors originating from the same origin, and taking the distance between their end points.
630: If you need to consider such factors that green is more prominent in judging intensity, you can weigh the values.
631: ImageMagic provides the following scales:  

red: 0.3
green: 0.6
blue: 0.1

Of course, values like this would only be meaningful in relation to other values for other colors, not as something that would be meaningful to humans, so all you could use the values for would be similiarity ordering.
632: In other words, given a bunch of distinct colors, come up with an ordering so I can use as many colors as I need starting at the beginning and be reasonably assured that they are all distinct and that nearby colors are also very distinct (e.g., bluish red isn\'t next to reddish blue).
633: This is equivalent, roughly, to saying I want to sort this list of 1024 so that the closer individual colors are visually, the farther apart they are on the list.
634: ('HSL and HSV are better for human color perception.
635: According to Wikipedia:

It is sometimes preferable in working with art materials, digitized images, or other media, to use the HSV or HSL color model over alternative models such as RGB or CMYK, because of differences in the ways the models emulate how humans perceive color.
636: If it is greater than the number expected, then there is a decent chance that an injection was attempted, especially for fields that are unlikely to include control characters such as username.

646: With any of these you won\'t have to keep clicking all the pop-ups and you can verify, without a doubt, that the destination is exactly the same as the source.
647: /I    If destination does not exist and copying more than one file, assumes that destination must be a directory.
648: ('Do you mean that from a set of N colors, you need to pick M colors, where M < N, such that M is the best representation of the N colors in the M space?
649: As a better example, reduce a true-color (24 bit color space) to a 8-bit mapped color space (GIF?).
650: There are quantization algorithms for this, like the Adaptive Spatial Subdivision algorithm used by ImageMagic.
651: These algorithms usually don\'t just pick existing colors from the source space but creates new colors in the target space that most closely resemble the source colors.
652: ("You can split them in to RGB HEX format so that you can compare the R with R's of a different color, same with the G and B.

So the only thing you would need to decide is how close you want the colors and what is an acceptable difference for the segments to be considered different.

658: ('Well, as a first point of call, I\'d say of the common metrics HSV (Hue, Saturation and Value) or HSL are better representative of how humans perceive colour than say RGB or CYMK.
659: However this would mean that bright yellow and bright green would be considered just as different as green to dark green.
660: Moreover, difference vectors in the same direction in this parameter space are not equal.
661: For instance, the human eye picks up green much better than other colours.
662: A shift in hue from green by the same amount as a shift from red may seem greater.
663: Even better, you could see if anyone has already done such a thing online...

664: ('This also sounds to me like some kind of resistance graph where you try to map out the path of least resistance.
665: If you inverse the requirements, path of maximum resistance, it could perhaps be used to produce a set that from the start produces maximum difference as you go, and towards the end starts to go back to values closer to the others.
666: Calculate the distance (ref your other post) from each color to all other colors
Sum the distances for each color, this gives you an indication for how far away this color is from all other colors in total
Order the list by distance, going down

This would, it seems, produce a list that starts with the color that is farthest away from all other colors, and then go down, colors towards the end of the list would be closer to other colors in general.
667: Edit: Reading your reply to my first post, about the spatial subdivision, would not exactly fit the above description, since colors close to other colors would fall to the bottom of the list, but let\'s say you have a cluster of colors somewhere, at least one of the colors from that cluster would be located near the start of the list, and it would be the one that generally was farthest away from all other colors in total.

Running the tests becomes automate-able and repeatable
You can test at a much more granular level than point-and-click testing via a GUI

833: Edit: Also, Profiles are not cached, so every access to a profile goes to the database first (it\'s then cached for that request, but the next request will get it from the database again)
If you\'re thinking about writing your own thing, maybe a custom Profile Provider gives you the best of both worlds - seamless integration, yet the custom stuff you want to do.
834: You can get the book for the course as a PDF from the Pragmatic Programmers.
835: The final project is  a program that compiles a subset of C.  Because you use tools like ANTLR and LLVM, it\'s feasible to write the entire compiler in a single day (I have an existence proof of this, though I do mean ~24 hours).

848: If you have sufficient test coverage, you can do major refactoring, bug fixing or add features rapidly with much less fear of introducing other problems.
849: It\'s most effective when all unit tests can be run automatically.
850: The basic idea is to create a script which sets up the environment for your code and then exercises it; you write assertions, specify the intended output that you should receive and then execute your test script using a framework such as those mentioned above.

869: "Process size" as a concept is fiendishly difficult to pin down in the general case.
870: Answers in specific instances depend heavily on the actual memory management implementation in the OS, and are rarely as satisfying as the tidy "process size" concept that exists in the minds of most users (and most developers).

The method successfully alters the

  passed by value; however, a swap of
  pnt1 and pnt2 fails!
971: In the main()
  method, pnt1 and pnt2 are nothing more
  than object references.
972: When you pass
  pnt1 and pnt2 to the tricky() method,
  Java passes the references by value
  just like any other parameter.

"by value" is the only way in java to pass a parameter to a method

Lists and tuples, while similar in many respects, are generally used in fundamentally different ways.
1051: Tuples can be thought of as being similar to Pascal records or C structs; they\'re small collections of related data which may be of different types which are operated on as a group.
1052: For example, a Cartesian coordinate is appropriately represented as a tuple of two or three numbers.
1053: Lists, on the other hand, are more like arrays in other languages.
1054: They tend to hold a varying number of objects all of which have the same type and which are operated on one-by-one.
1055: Generally by convention you wouldn\'t choose a list or a tuple just based on its (im)mutability.
1056: You would choose a tuple for small collections of completely different pieces of data in which a full-blown class would be too heavyweight, and a list for collections of any reasonable size where you have a homogeneous set of data.

My original answer is certainly the most pronounced difference, but as Eric Lippert points out, it\'s not the only one.
1123: Other differences include:

You can\'t use the \'as\' operator to cast to a type that doesn\'t accept \'null\' as a value
You can\'t use \'as\' to convert things, like numbers to a different representation (float to int, for example).

1125: The "as" cast returns null if the cast attempt fails.
1126: Since you seem to be most interested in models that presume some sort of local continuity of the distortion mapping, the most obvious choice is the one you\'ve already tried: linear interpolaton between the nearest points.

this swap will change the value of the referenced parameter:

The caller of a method which takes an
  out parameter is not required to
  assign to the variable passed as the

  returning.
1176: a small pitfall is, like in java, that objects passed by value can still be changed using their inner methods
conclusion: 

c# passes its parameters, by default, by value

inner methods from a parameter passed by value will alter the object (if that method itself alters some values)

Previously defined instances are updated as well (as long as they haven\'t overridden the attribute themselves):

The function is not automatically bound when it\'s attached directly to an instance:

Inclusive - If the command is supposed to be "punch the monkey in the face" and they supply "punch monkey", you should check how many commands this matches.
