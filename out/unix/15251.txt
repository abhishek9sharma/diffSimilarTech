debian	linux
i installed the linux debian 8 os with gnome 3 desktop environment a couple of days ago

268462
mouse	keyboard
from the applications screen move your mouse to the top-left corner open settings type settings and click on the icon then keyboard and click on the shortcuts tab

268467
udp	tcp
raw counter names from proc are used each prefixed with its class udp tcp tcpext etc

268469
folder	directory
i could just directly specify to save in home my_username but then they would also get no directory found when they try to run it because their home folder have different names

268473
gentoo	linux
i m trying to install openvpn on nao robot wich is running opennao os opennao is a gnu linux distribution based on gentoo

268502
ubuntu	mint
i would like to know how to install ubuntu or mint and having the grub

268512
screens	tablet
i am running antergos linux with gnome 3.18.2 on a dell xps 12 convertible laptop tablet and am working on making the screens rotation more convenient

268516
octal	decimal
the standard command for that is od for octal dump though with options you can change from octal to decimal or hexadecimal...

268537
g++	gcc
get the exact path for gcc and g++ 4.9

268537
g++	gcc
use export to point gcc to the gcc-4.9 path and g++ to the g++-4.9 path

268576
ubuntu	opensuse
after a few years using ubuntu i decided to go back to opensuse

268639
stdout	stderr
if i start with stderr io-redirection i get different behaviour on stdout i get

268670
bash	zsh
as you know the name to operate on why not taking it to a variable and pass the variable to cut s stdin which you can do this way in bash ksh or zsh

268678
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i wasn t able to solve it so eventually i resorted to switching to ubuntu linux mint and then install the official deb-package from nvidia

268688
versioning	upgrade
either the packages were installed from another repository or due to not so frequent packages errors some dependency is not being satisfied or other requirements that cannot be satisfied without user intervention including the decision of major upgrade between somewhat incompatible versioning of a particular package

268692
bash	zsh
if using bash zsh or the korn shell process

268692
hash	md5
to get md5 hash of the server key fingerprints the old behaviour the -e

268698
elasticsearch	kibana
i never went outside of windows before last week i was asked to make a vm with elasticsearch logstash kibana jdk8 on it

268701
elasticsearch	kibana
in the following link the installation of logstash elasticsearch and kibana on centos is explained

268720
kde	gnome
later i added x-server packages for my card and a lightweight windowmanager i don t want kde or gnome so i normally launch x with startx however someone keeps on creating documents desktop download video music etc

268731
folder	directory
then it looks for every folder inside that directory with a loop

268740
ubuntu	linux
currently the laptop is using arch linux and the pi is using ubuntu mate

268812
bash	zsh
with bash zsh ksh93 mksh pdksh to invoke the exit built-in explicitly use builtin builtin command

268819
apache	nginx
if this seems irrational behaviour for apache note that nginx behaves the same way

268842
elasticsearch	kibana
there are a number of elk vagrant boxes out there that will allow you to install the elk stack with elasticsearch logstash and kibana all in one and using one simple vagrant command will be writing a tutorial on this soon

268874
versioning	upgrade
it has its snags if part of the upgrade was to change configurations the rollback won t necessarily be to the exact past versioning

268896
filesystems	btrfs
on opensuse you can easily use snapper with the btrfs filesystems

268905
folder	directory
when i konrad create a directory then apache have no rights to write to this folder which causes problems

268911
vim	emacs	vim	gedit	emacs	gedit	gedit	nano
replace it with gedit scite emacs nano vim or whatever editor you use

268931
ubuntu	linux
i am installing wfdb toolbox for matlab 2016a in ubuntu linux 14.04 64bit which instructions are here

268936
folder	directory
rob griffiths posted an article in 2007 entitled easily create lots of new folder on macworld.com wherein he discussed using the xargs command to read in a list of files to create directory using mkdir

268946
pull	push
i wish to allow another user from a different machine to push pull to

268954
solaris	bsd
l2arc cache on zfs solaris bsd

268971
pop-up	dialog
while i can t fully comprehend the source codes i could estimate that xfwm4 dynamically sizes the alt-tab pop-up dialog

268971
pop-up	dialog
the screenshot below is showing alt-tab pop-up dialog with 14 opened applications in xfce

268971
pop-up	dialog
hence the pop-up dialog in xfce is dynamically sized

268973
ubuntu	linux
on the first one i installed windows 7 with linux ubuntu - with different partitions

268994
debian	linux
i m a bit puzzled about the following behavior linux debian 8.3 ext2 filesystem

269008
put	get
perhaps on other systems you could get a hint about where to put it from sudo find -name .desktop

269030
debian	centos
the example below use incrond available in debian and red hat centos epel repo but you may want to use a tool based on fam if you use an nfs export

269031
filesystems	ntfs
i ve checked that the drive doesn t have any weird partitions that got created some how ntfs is correctly installed ajenti under filesystems list the correct device and mount point for the drive so it isn t like it is making some weird mount override that i can see

269031
jobs	cron
also there are now cron jobs that could be doing something weird as far as i can tell either

269036
stdout	stderr
i know i can configure sudo to log user input key strokes and console terminal output stdout stderr as explained in how to log commands within a sudo su -

269037
folder	directory
then you can use a tool that use the kernel s inotify feature to set the append only attributes on new files and directory see automatically set append attribute for newly created files folder

269043
switching	screens
i have been suffering for the unexpected disapperance on cinnamon 2.8 of the enable disable edge flip option between workspaces with the mouse i found really really annoying that every time i would pass and leave my mouse pointer in the edge of the screens it will start switching workspaces and i had to press the escape key to exit from this behaviour

269057
stdout	stderr
i have been testing various syntaxes for redirecting stdout and stderr to the same file which don t all produce the same results

269057
stdout	stderr
so with both of the above syntaxes it seems that the shell prints stderr first then stdout

269057
stdout	stderr
here it looks like stdout is printed before stderr but then we see that the beginning of stderr is cropped by the same number of characters as stdout

269057
stdout	stderr
the stdout is 6 chars long foo fz carriage return included so the first 6 chars of the stderr ls ca have been overwritten by stdout

269057
stdout	stderr
so it actually seems like stderr was printed first and that stdout was then printed over stderr instead of being appended to it

269057
stdout	stderr
however it would have made more sense to me if stderr had been completely erased and replaced with stdout rather than just partially overwitten

269057
stdout	stderr
also is there a reason why the output always displays stderr before stdout

269058
stdout	stderr
so i can not comment on any code but in syntax #3 you are piping stdout and stderr into the same file using two different pipes

269058
stdout	stderr
in syntax #2 you redirecting the stderr into the same pipe for stdout at that point the file has one pipe coming in and shell manages this pipe against race conditions

269059
stdout	stderr
it makes one file handle and points both stderr and stdout to the same place

269059
stdout	stderr
other commands may print to stderr after stdout or even alternate between them

269063
stdout	stderr
adding to wildcard s answer stdout is usually buffered stored in memory to be written out later while stderr never is you want error messages to show up even if the program crashes before writing anything out

269078
sudo	passwd
i would only expect someone with sudo any to be able to run the function as one of the things it does is change passwd

269090
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
rhel redhat centos fedora linux apache access file location â

269090
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
debian ubuntu linux apache access log file location â

269092
centos	linux
under centos red hat 7 the grub menu entry centos linux 7 core ..

269098
filesystems	btrfs
thus filesystems like btrfs and zfs implement their own checksums so as not to trust buggy drive firmwares glitchy sata cables and so on

269124
sudo	passwd
otherwise the sudo will ask for the passwd of the user foo

269129
disk	ram
are there command-line approaches to sleep suspend to ram and hibernate suspend to disk

269137
internationalization	localization
internationalization and localization changes

269206
stdout	stderr
now save the shell script and redirect stdout and stderr to log file

269207
bash	zsh
prompt in zsh like in ksh -p prompt in bash

269231
single-quotes	double-quotes
although i m voting to close because the answers to this question are primarily almost purely opinion-based there is an important difference between double-quotes and single-quotes here

269237
ubuntu	linux
setup a pc with working linux ubuntu in my case one usb drive

269241
sudo	passwd
use the pathname for the script using that in the sudo command and pass along an option which the script will check to call the passwd updating

269249
vlan	packets
as mentioned in comments and another answer there isn t specifically a way to send untagged packets belonging to a specific vlan because untagged packets have no way to describe which vlan they belong to due to lack of a tag

269249
vlan	packets
however this does not mean that untagged packets sent from your linux box can t belong to a particular vlan on your network

269249
vlan	packets
it is up to the switch to assign untagged packets arriving on a given port to a particular vlan

269249
vlan	packets
typically switches which are capable of vlans will by default assign untagged packets to the default vlan 1

269249
vlan	packets
however by changing the configuration on the switch you can instruct it to put untagged packets received onto vlan 10 and route them wherever else vlan 10 is assigned

269249
vlan	packets
if vlan 10 is set to tagged on a different port those same packets will come out tagged there if that s the destination of the packets and untagged on a different port that is set to untagged for vlan 10

269252
loops	while-loop
we then loops over the host names with a bash while-loop and resolve them

269270
put	get
the asknetwork boot option might be one option see link in linked docs or to not fight kickstart on this point and put the ip address configuration information into a dhcp server or to provide a hostname to the boot options that a kickstart script can then try to do dns lookups on to get the necessary static details etc

269284
cat	tee
cat - | tee tmp in.log | path to realapp | tee tmp out.log

269287
bash	zsh
this code requires dash bash ksh or zsh

269296
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs filesystems can be resized in either direction while mounted

269323
gentoo	linux
i am running gentoo linux using kernel linux-4.3.3-hardened-r4 and my sound system is only alsa no oss or pulseaudio

269326
daemons	systemd
i ve tried disabling mpd music player daemons using systemd

269334
ubuntu	debian
after problems with ubuntu i made a fresh install of debian 8.3

269340
ubuntu	linux
how to set up a terminal server in linux using ubuntu 9.10 and freenx

269360
bash	zsh
to find documentation about kill features related to jobs look at the documentation of your shell for example bash or zsh

269360
bash	zsh
then refer to the section about jobs bash zsh

269371
versioning	upgrade
the age also means that many people have probably forgotten how much change happened at that time i know i have but those versioning are close enough and both 2.6 so i guess there were no api abi-changes and that means it should be safe to upgrade the kernel and nothing else

269378
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
if the one year or so lifetime of fedora is too fast for you you can try centos also rpm based a clone of sorts of redhat enterprise linux thus quite close in handling

269392
kde	gnome
now every time my machine is switched on i m presented with gnome desktop environment whereas i want to go back to kde login screen doesn t let me change

269398
kde	gnome
i doubt that your display manager doesn t let you choose but i don t like neither gnome nor kde so i don t know what you ll be running but you can try some others

269399
folder	directory
i have more folder in the root directory of those backups but for those others i am rather sure i know whether i can delete them or might still need them i know i have to keep home or i know i can safely remove run . i am not so sure about these here

269403
openvpn	iptables
when starting openvpn on and trying to connect on port 10011 i cannot see any system logs generated by the log iptables rule whereas with openvpn stopped i see the logs and everything works fine

269408
centos	linux
i ve installed a fresh version of centos 7 i m new to linux

269410
mouse	keyboard
on my debian and arch keeps freezing randomly won t respond at all with keyboard mouse or power button

269415
ubuntu	mint
solution for ubuntu 14.04.4 but should work on mint too is

269436
ubuntu	debian
to install on debian ubuntu

269480
hash	md5
the only way to be sure you downloaded the complete file is to get the file size from somewhere else and better have its hash md5

269493
stdout	stderr
normally when you run a command remotely via ssh the command s stdout and stderr streams are sent to the local stdout and stderr which means you can redirect pipe them separately - for example

269509
freebsd	sunos	sunos	bsd
those are old bsd systems including sunos 4 and hpux 10 checking my memory against the manual page for env on freebsd

269538
ubuntu	linux
it is a custom mouse theme for ubuntu linux that has translucent yellow circle below the cursor which is almost exactly what the question had described

269553
bluetooth	usb
i was trying on both phones with both bluetooth and usb to ping 8.8.8.8 and it gives me network unreachable

269553
bluetooth	usb
how can i tether by usb and bluetooth

269555
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a more recent versioning of back in time 1.1.0 or above

269570
versioning	upgrade
if you have any third-party kernel modules and you upgrade your kernel then you may need to obtain matching versioning of the kernel module if they exist

269572
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
other popular choices include zsh fish tcsh ksh etc

269572
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
normally bash loads .bashrc zsh loads .zshrc fish loads .config fish config.fish etc

269582
unix	solaris
autofs is an automounter system available on many unix variants including solaris linux and osâ x with different code bases but similar interfaces

269584
debian	mint	debian	linux
under debian and derivatives including linux mint the convention for development packages is that their name ends with -dev

269592
min	max	min	median	median	max
and then some stats courtesy of is there a way to get the min max median and average of a list of numbers in a single command

269599
ubuntu	debian
not being much of a debian user other than raspbian here is a guide to changing ubuntu which is a debian variant

269601
disk	ram
however i m using embedded linux in a device where all the elf files are already resident in ram ram disk before loading them starting a process from each elf file

269617
debian	linux
coming from windows administration i want to dig deeper in linux debian

269626
ubuntu	debian
requires the perl libraries tk perl-tk on debian or ubuntu and

269626
ubuntu	debian
x11 protocol libx11-protocol-perl on debian or ubuntu in addition

269626
ansible	puppet
as for a remote framework for multiple systems administration ansible is a very interesting alternative to puppet

269629
bash	zsh
perhaps you can achieve your goal with a simple zsh bash function

269644
centos	linux
if you guest is centos linux then you need to install dkms dynamic kernel module support package

269671
debian	linux
i updated to linux kernel 4.3 on debian jessie via backports

269685
filesystems	btrfs
do frequent backups use snapshots ã la time machine if your filesystems is zfs or btrfs train your fingers to use the right commands but i would advise to avoid changing rm behavior and semantics

269691
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh you can use start..stop..increment and it works as expected when start stop

269691
bash	zsh
a method that works for both bash and zsh is to use seq

269691
bash	zsh
prints out 20 18 16 ... 0 in both bash and zsh

269713
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
for to work you need a shell with brace expansion support like csh tcsh ksh zsh bash or fish

269722
bash	zsh
as in bash in zsh this works

269722
bash	zsh
what works in zsh but not in bash is ranges with variables

269731
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	kde	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
the weekly live images are available with cinnamon gnome kde lxde mate and xfce

269763
rpm	yum
i know that i can use rpmbuild --rebuild to build the binaries but for whatever reason rpm-build isn t installed with yum and i can only find a source rpm file of rpm-build for fc13

269802
packets	multicast
i would like to do the same thing but for multicast packets

269831
put	get
i want to get the result of time command into a text file but it s not working it only put blank space in the text file

269840
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian
because i would like to know as much as possible about how to find and install missing man pages for professional use both now rhel centos and in the future ubuntu debian opensuse ..

269841
gnupg	gpgme
currently gpgme includes something like 500 separate functions or more and definitely covers pretty much anything you d do with gnupg on the command line

269841
gnupg	gpgme
it won t just search through any plain email looking for content that matches but that s neither gnupg s nor gpgme s fault

269841
gnupg	gpgme
if you upgrade gnupg and don t recompile gpgme to match then there will likely be problems

269841
gnupg	gpgme
on the other hand installing gnupg from source is usually recommended where possible so if going the gpgme route it becomes good practice to just run that recompile when updating gnupg and it should all be fine

269841
gnupg	gpgme
whereas those people who rely solely on the packages provided by their chosen distribution will also be subject to whatever the maintainers of those packages can be bothered maintaining and they may or may not always understand the requirements of gnupg and gpgme working together

269841
gnupg	gpgme
for example the macports package for gpgme is set to depend on gnupg 2.0.x which in turn is set to conflict with gnupg 2.1.x so most people installing 2.1 can t also install gpgme even though they clearly do work together

269847
subnet	packets
even trying to detect packets from different subnet is problematic - it is quite normal and legitimate for the same physical ethernet segment to have multiple subnet transported on it

269847
subnet	packets
you may see packets from the alternate subnet but none from your own subnet and assume that your subnet is wrong when all that has really happened is that there has been no traffic from other hosts on your subnet in the time you were listening

269851
rpm	yum
for the system using rpm yum package manager for instance here centos use yum provides or yum whatprovides

269851
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu based system which use apt as default package-manager there is apt-file thanks gilles for pointing out command which can do a job what you re looking for

269865
mp3	flac
if you want to convert from flac to mp3 you can use something like

269865
vlc	mkv
i suspect vlc will play the mkv

269873
cpu	processors
coretemp gives the cpu core temperatures on intel processors nct6776 is the motherboard s hardware monitor and jc42 is the temperature monitor on the dimms

269888
mouse	trackpad
for example if i hold my left pointer finger in the bottom left corner of the trackpad and try and move the mouse with my right pointer finger it will not move until remove my left finger

269899
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr will be redirected to a file nohup.out

269904
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr will be written to a file named nohup.out located in the same directory where nohup has been executed

269908
sudo	passwd
so in a terminal set the passwd of the current user sudo passwd xubuntu and enter a passwd twice

269934
bash	zsh
while discussing over the differences between usr bin time and the shell bash and zsh built-in time someone mentioned that one can use time as a shorthand to get usr bin time

269934
bash	zsh
is the observed behaviour of foo in both bash and zsh in any way covered by the posix definition of a shell and if so why does it behave like it does

269946
centos	linux
local machine is on linux and remote server is centos

269947
xfce	gnome
i have to installed xfce instead of gnome in arch

269959
rpm	yum
yum was written to complement the rpm command and not to replicate its features

269972
xfce	gnome
you can probably install xfce without uninstalling gnome first -- there are no package conflicts

269972
xfce	gnome
as far as i know xfce doesn t have it s own login screen display manager so be careful when you remove gnome that you don t also remove gdm or that you replace it with something else

269972
xfce	gnome
after switching you will probably want to clean up your dot-files so that the settings you had in gnome don t do undesirable things in xfce or just to free up the space used by gnome cruft

269982
bash	zsh
tested in zsh ksh93 and bash

269993
chown	chmod
i need to change the file from executable files green to normal files should i use chown or chmod and with which extensions

270004
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
basically there are two kinds of filesystems those who know the concept of file-ownership like the common unix filesystems xfs jfs btrfs â

270004
filesystems	fat
and those who don t like at least the â oldâ windows dos filesystems fat

270018
udp	tcp
if you want your openvpn server to listen on a tcp port instead of a udp port use proto tcp instead of proto udp if you want openvpn to listen on both a udp and tcp port you must run two separate openvpn instances

270018
udp	tcp
i think you can run two openvpn servers one for tcp one for udp bridge each of them with a tun and then connect the tuns

270019
ubuntu	linux
my ubuntu server returns linux 3.13.0-63-generic when i run uname -rs

270035
ubuntu	linux
the problem i had was running an ubuntu 14.04 image with docker on my host arch linux machine

270049
centos	linux
instead i would recommend installing vagrant and virtualbox on any system windows mac linux and creating a centos vagrant box to work with

270055
spaces	delimiter
if you import the file in excel natively you can use the text to table function or whatever it s called to break lines into columns using a spaces delimiter

270119
ubuntu	debian
btw i am running ubuntu so time is from debian

270122
opensuse	centos
i installed centos then opensuse and these problems persisted

270127
hid	keyboard
it enumerates as a hid device and more specifically usb keyboard

270156
children	parent
the file and the containing directory are both accessible to nginx but the permissions of the parent directory are drwx------ and that will block access to that directory and all its children

270185
rpm	dnf
if you would like to remove the downloaded rpm s at a later time you can use dnf clean packages

270199
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
for any given version or installation of linux mint how would i find out which version of ubuntu it is based on

270255
lvm	xfs	filesystems	xfs
i am using centos 7 and i have a home mounted on an xfs filesystems on a dedicated lvm partition

270293
stdout	stderr
if you re in a shell whose stdin stdout and stderr are not connected to its controlling terminal you can get a filedescriptor to the controlling terminal by opening dev tty

270322
filesystems	xfs
however you cannot shrink an xfs filesystems

270322
filesystems	xfs
according to the faq is there a way to make a xfs filesystems larger or smaller

270322
filesystems	xfs
an xfs filesystems may be enlarged by using xfs_growfs 8

270322
filesystems	xfs
using xfs filesystems on top of a volume manager makes this a lot easier

270322
filesystems	xfs
delete the xfs filesystems

270388
debian	linux
first i am running linux with an unstable sid debian distribution on a macbook pro laptop

270414
cpu	processors
cpu the percentage of the processors time used by the process

270436
bash	zsh
you apparently wanted or in ksh bash zsh and your if syntax is wrong you need for arithmetic comparison and something else entirely for string comparison and elif instead of elseif

270453
centos	linux
i am installing centos linux distribution on a fresh new machine

270460
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
even i changed from ubuntu to linux mint but i can t get sound from hdmi laptop connected to led tv

270501
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
1 revisit your applications you don t have a lot of cpu horsepower so i would scrap firefox google-chrome and go with something like opera or midori

270501
kde	gnome
2 consider using a lightweight desktop not gnome unity or kde

270512
xfce	gnome
i m aware of this because i had been using gnome 2 before switching to xfce 4.8 and newer

270513
vlan	wlan
but which apparently finds both dummy vlan and wlan devices to be of type arphrd_ether

270536
put	get
you format one partition in each disk you mount the os one to and the user one to home and it acts like a system that put everything on one real disk except you get that speed and affordability tradeoff you wanted

270538
width	height
use the ellipse select tool e to select a circle of your desire say 360px width height

270571
bash	zsh
there are easier ways to deal with those cases if you use ksh bash or zsh

270571
freebsd	linux
with gnu or freebsd find on non-embedded linux cygwin freebsd or osx there s an easy way to execute a command on all the files in a directory tree

270572
x86	64bit
for example x86 and powerpc are a single architecture but the kernel can be compiled using the 32-bit instruction set or the 64bit instruction set and a 32-bit kernel can execute only 32-bit programs while a 64bit kernel can execute both 32-bit and 64bit programs

270858
ubuntu	debian
you can install the latest kernel the easiest way in debian ubuntu is to download the .deb packages built by ubuntu kernel team

270888
memcpy	malloc
old programs have ifdef s for the inclusion of stdlib.h versus other places such as memory.h for memcpy malloc and the like

270893
ubuntu	mint
finally after all the options that i had tried i removed windows os and mint os which only gave the disk to load ubuntu mate os which eventually solved the problem

270896
gentoo	linux
i have a very minimal arch linux installation 646 packages installed in total on the disconnected laptop and my main laptop which was connected to the internet during the measurements was running gentoo with about 800 packages installed and no particular program running in the background other than the default ones

i upgrade from versioning 10 by directly exexuting the versioning 11 installer

270991
libxml2	libxslt
...and i have also run ldconfig after installing libxml2 and libxslt and prior to build php

271052

cpu	processors
processors 4x intel r core tm i5-6200u cpu 2.30ghz

271144
openbsd	debian
openbsd focuses on security and has a rather minimalist default installation so one can expect that debian s record isn t as good

271144
debian	linux	openbsd	linux	openbsd	debian
however openbsd does activate the ssh server by default which many distributions don t do. i m not aware of any study that s been done on debian or other linux distributions

271162
versioning	upgrade
it s not ok to upgrade if there are some abi breaks in the library between the compared versioning

271185
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
usually once you get the junk broken packages out of your apt system the upgrade will work fine unless you re running something like mint in which case all bets are off since they break both ubuntu and debian apt package pools

271238
debian	linux
this question is about debian but i guess it s the same in many linux environments

271264
pthreads	fcntl
if your mutex directive within httpd.conf is set to pthreads try changing it to fcntl

folder	directory
but when i list dev directory there is no pts folder and when i try to access virtual ports it says file not found

271270
ubuntu	debian
on the ubuntu family of distribution and probably on other debian derivatives one of the standard files in that directory sources the file .xsessionrc in your home directory if it exists it doesn t by default

271294
bgp	ospf
a better way to do this is to treat ipsec more like a typical logical network link make ipsec deal with point-to-point communication and layer gre on top with dynamic routing protocols like ospf and bgp you can skip the dynamic routing if you want but it s recommended

271294
bgp	ospf
better yet completely remove these static routes and have ospf or bgp handle routing automatically for you see quagga for this

271336
folder	directory
this is supposed to produce a list of all files folder in the current directory which have a group writable permission

271356

if you have you output in a file called tmp.json use jq to get the list of ids one per line and then with a simple for-loop make a post to your api

271358
stdout	stderr
variable assignments don t write to stdout or stderr right

271384
vim	emacs	vim	atom-editor	emacs	atom-editor
atom-editor is extensible by use of packages and themes written in the aforementioned computer languages and is similarly extensible to the gnu emacs and vim text editors

271384
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
its chief disadvantage compared to these text editors is the fact it has longer startup times and is less portable than these text editors with official binary releases available for 64-bit debian fedora opensuse ubuntu linux os x and windows only

271384
debian	linux
it can however be built from source code on other unix unix-like platforms such as 32 64-bit linux distributions that do not use debian or rpm binary packages and 32-bit linux distributions that do use these package formats

271387

stdout	stderr
variable assignments don t write to stdout or stderr right

271539
stdout	stderr
variable assignments don t write to stdout or stderr right

271585
chown	sudo
you could temporarily assign write permission to that file for the user sudo chown youruseraccount usr local matlab r2016a toolbox local pathdef.m and then do the install and change the permissions back

271585
folder	directory
this assumes that your home directory is your startup folder for matlab though the pathdef.m could be saved to some other directory and matlab started up from that directory or the initial folder path changed in the matlab preferences

271586
debian	linux
it s a debian based linux os with the kodi software on top

271615
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint

i prefer getting things done using the keyboard instead of the mouse

271675
move	drag

dnf	yum
this should work even if you have dnf instead of yum

271693
bash	zsh
it works in bash zsh mksh and dash only when interactive ksh93 only when two command are on separated lines

271731
installation	upgrade
upgrade are safe it s only new installation made using a compromised iso that are problematic

271744
filesystems	ntfs
if so you ve very likely lost data as ntfs will have written at minimum filesystems metadata over top your ext4 partitions

271750
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
so if he has write permission to a directory on the same filesystem as usr bin he can put the jail in this directory create a hard link to su or sudo in it and put a custom etc passwd and etc sudoers in the jail

271813
hash	salt
the secured data is the salt hash database which would end up on the primary drive

271814
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade your kernel package since the last reboot you probably have a running kernel that no longer matches the kernel versioning s on disk and so modprobe is trying to load a module for a more recent kernel

271822
chown	sudo
this is probably not a good idea but you could grant a given user or group the ability to sudo and limit that to the chown command

271872
ubuntu	linux
i ran git clone on ubuntu and downloaded arch linux b43-firmware-classic from aur on my ubuntu root partition

271940
post	get
in a previous post i was told how to get lubuntu to work using forcepae and

271942
sysv	systemd
to be quite honest what i d recommend here would be to ignore the sysv script altogether and just create your own systemd script

271953
filesystems	fat
you ll likely notice that the filesystems as shown in mount is not ext3 or fat it s iso 9660

in modern systems freebsd osx and linux provide the bsd semantics but netbsd and openbsd do not mention it

272006
jobs	cron
if a user is granted permission to schedule cron jobs by being listed in cron.allow does this make them any more of a threat to the system than a user without that permission

272007
jobs	cron
cron jobs can run at any time even when the user is not logged in

272009
jobs	cron
i really do not want an overzealous programmer to run a query against a software repository every night to see if there is a new release while choking network connections and running awk sed grep perl on humongous files bringing the system down to its knees hampering legit cron jobs and sometimes fail due to lack of resources

272021
versioning	upgrade
it tries to upgrade node to versioning 5.x.x

note new users are encouraged to use gtk+3 through the pygobject bindings instead of using pygtk with gtk+2

272072
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout and suppress unwanted parts

272077
integer	unsigned
time_t in your system is a signed integer so the library is making the upper limit check as the value of an unsigned integer which at +4294967295 seconds after january 1 1970 will give it an upper limit somewhere around year 2106

272077
integer	unsigned
for example changing time_t to an unsigned 32-bit integer which

my distribution is bunsenlabs i386 linux a successor of crunchbang debian based with a 3.16.0-4-686-pae kernel

272238
bash	zsh
i won t go into the details because bash and zsh have so many completion options but depending on the options it can be fairly easy to end up with foo when completing foo and foo is a symbolic link to a directory

272259
profiling	debugging
if so what do i need to do to get nsight for eclipse working to create debugging and profiling remote builds

272275
daemons	systemd
some other daemons is playing systemd s game and respawning the process

272296
ubuntu	debian
either a the reported temperature is wrong unlikely as then it would probably be wrong all the time instead of increasing so quickly or b the computer does actually heat up that quickly and ubuntu did wrong with not firing up the fans enough instead of debian being wrong in doing the opposite

272305
sudo	passwd
even with separate sudo passwd there are some potential security holes by default distro setup

272305
sudo	passwd
in general seems that secure separate sudo passwd can be achieved only with aid of custom pam module perhaps such module will compare passwd and sha-512 hash read from file or selinux functionality

272306
sudo	passwd
whats the mechanism behind sudo that stores the passwd for all subsequent calls to sudo

272312
centos	linux
usually if i want to image a centos 7 iso or any linux iso for that matter to a usb device i do this via dd as follows

accessible over the internet an ssh key already in authorized_keys and a sudo passwd for each server

272451
sudo	passwd
the simplest approach is to have a list with the server name ip and the sudo passwd

272451
sudo	passwd
the -s option of sudo lets you pass the passwd from standard input

272458
kde	gnome
newer versions of gnome and kde implement the wayland protocol and come with their own compositor display servers no xorg

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i ve installed cuda toolkit 7.5 on linux mint 17.3 using the ubuntu 14.04 local deb file

272752
cpu	affinity
we isolcpus in our grub.conf and also change the affinity of init so that child processes that init spawns are spawned in a specific different cpu so in theory we have total control over the cpu ptp is running in...but something is still keeping ptp from picking up packets when it should and i ve been pulling my hair out trying to track it

272752
daemons	systemd
for the record yes i do know that we probably should be running ptp as a kernel module and i have been able to avoid this problem by chrt ing the ptp daemons to fifo with a high low priority and that does seem to resolve the issue but this is more of a general question about tracking systemd performance on a specific cpu over time

272754
sudo	passwd
you can then sudo egrep jdoe etc passwd to verify

272767
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
most linux installations are similar i know at least ubuntu rhel centos fedora and debian offer similar from direct experience

272767
ubuntu	linux
however canonical the owners of ubuntu have really marketed ubuntu towards the casual user and have really gone out of their way to make it easy for users learning linux for the first time

272767
ubuntu	linux
if you really get into it ubuntu is a good stepping-stone to a more specialized distribution of linux

272818
ubuntu	debian
the ubuntu ones should work in debian if the problem persist the newest versions of the kernel have lots of improvements for intel devices

272826
folder	directory
search a folder if there is a directory by that name

272835
bluetooth	usb
it s not a problem with bluetooth nor usb since the mouse moves while the problem occurs

272859
ubuntu	centos
we have a standard basic server install of centos 6.7 for our servers and ubuntu 14.04 for our desktops

272859
ubuntu	centos
from my ubuntu desktop when i ssh into a remote server ie ssh into a centos instance my terminal tab shows user hostname path

272859
ubuntu	centos
i have overridden ps1 for both ubuntu and centos hosts

272859
ubuntu	centos
i have a local setting for prompt_command but nothing on any remote centos or ubuntu host

272859
ubuntu	centos
even if i unset my local prompt_command and then ssh into centos i get user hostname path displayed in the tab but nothing when ssh ing into ubuntu

272859
ubuntu	centos
so my conclusion is that there is something which centos is doing to display that information in my tab which ubuntu isn t doing

272859
ubuntu	centos
what configuration exists in centos but doesn t in ubuntu that shows user hostname path for remote terminal sessions

272860

is there a way to accomplish this in bash or zsh

272943
ubuntu	debian
assuming a debian or ubuntu type system

272965
bash	zsh
is there a difference between the behavior of pushd popd in bash vs zsh

272965
bash	zsh
it seems in zsh cd cd- behaves exactly the same as pushd popd which adds pops directory automatically when cd while in bash cd doesn t affect the dir stack

272977
stdout	stderr
given stderr and stdout aren t the same but why does less show them the same right up until i start doing something in less

273009
bash	zsh	awk	ksh
if you re using bash or ksh or zsh you don t even need to use awk you can use to remove a prefix...in this case the prefix of all characters up to the first space

273014
bash	subshell
for each test i re-executed bash ie didn t use a subshell

273028
cinnamon	gnome
i am running fedora 23 and have tried with gnome 3 mate and cinnamon they all show the same problem but it only happens with gtk programs

273036
ansible	puppet
btw pdsh is a different kind of tool to puppet or ansible or cfengine etc - they re for installing and maintaining a consistent environment on a group of machines such as a cluster or a vm farm etc

273061
debian	linux
my problem is that the console tty on my debian linux can t display any language other than english where it s a bit inconvenient for me as i have some folders and files on my disks with names in chinese

273083
xfce	kde
take into account the fact that from my experience if manjaro is the last linux installed the above procedure may lead to that system becoming unaccessible tested with kde xfce and fluxbox manjaro

273083
ubuntu	linux
in case manjaro was already installed at the time of installation of another linux like ubuntu manjaro will not boot as it will only work with its own grub

273088
bash	zsh
as far as i can tell zsh with default settings behaves very similar to bash

273088
bash	zsh
note whether the present working directory is considered an element of the directory stack differs between zsh and bash

273088
bash	zsh
that is because arrays in zsh are usually numbered from 1 while they are numbered from 0 in bash

273091
debian	linux
the following network trace was recorded on a raspberry pi running debian linux

273101
debian	linux
i am running debian gnu linux 8

273108
ubuntu	centos
iâ m running the initial mysqldump on a centos server and am seeing the same effects from cat on both the server itself and my ubuntu desktop so this seems to be a general bash thing

273129
rpm	yum
i am wondering if there is any option to ask yum to keep a backup of rpm and dependencies it downloads

273133
redhat	fedora
yum is the old fedora redhat installation tool that installs rpms and does dependency resolution for you

273133
dnf	yum
dnf is a new replacement for yum

273144
slackware	suse
never works with suse rh slackware distros policy documents.

273144
freebsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
also interesting if freebsd openbsd macos share convention with linux distros

273144
freebsd	debian
update 2 i compare freebsd and debian etc group file only 2 matches

273149
put	get
and hopefully be able to get and put files to the directory ftpmyserver is running in

273157
ubuntu	openbsd	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	solaris	freebsd	centos	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	debian	debian	centos	redhat	fedora	solaris	netbsd	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	centos	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	debian	centos	solaris
i discover that sys group share id 3 on debian ubuntu redhat fedora centos suse freebsd openbsd netbsd macosx solaris

273157
freebsd	debian
different distros have different human readable names for this group like nogroup debian nfsnobody redhat nobody freebsd nobody macos

273161
filesystems	ntfs
linux can use variouis ms-dos filesystems and ntfs and the permissions that files in those systems have is not exactly the user group other read write execute that linux wants

273161
filesystems	fat
since some filesystems ms-dos fat filesystems and reiserfs are examples don t have directories as files the virtual filesystems code doesn t treat directories as files with a special mark on them like the version 7 ufs does

273165
google-chrome	firefox
we know that google-chrome and firefox can remember the status of the tabs and can restore them next time

273169
versioning	upgrade
then i upgrade and it was still at the same versioning however i noticed that the writeup is a bit different

273208
xmodem	zmodem	kermit	xmodem	kermit	zmodem
to send files back one of several protocols could be used kermit xmodem ymodem and zmodem

273221
sudoers	passwd
orphaned sudoers entries - the etc sudoers file may contain a number of orphaned entries for which there is no corresponding account configured in the etc passwd file

273225
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
as far as i remember doing this with linux mint and ubuntu you load straight into the os and don t need to install it

273227
stdout	stderr
mksh blocks for the background process if it still shares any file descriptors stdin stdout stderr with the parent note this is probably the only valid use case for using instead of and only because we can guarantee these fds to no longer be used nor replaced by any new fds

273234
octal	hex
the octal 232 is hex 0x9a and referring to xterm control sequences

273245
gedit	nano
and then use nano instead if gedit

273278
ubuntu	centos
i m running ubuntu centos in a virtualbox guest and am trying to configure various services to run on it nginx php memcache and more

273278
folder	directory
i expect to serve most of my website content from a shared folder for development purposes so config files and things could be in a shared directory but obviously there are many other system folder i d need to have access to as well such as etc var opt usr .

273279
ubuntu	debian
i started seeing this problem after switching to ubuntu from debian

273281
bash	zsh
it works in bash zsh and ksh

273281
bash	zsh
in bash this syntax needs to be activated with shopt -s extglob and in zsh this syntax needs to be activated with setopt ksh_glob

273286
ubuntu	debian
etc resolv.conf is built from pieces that are in the directory run resolvconf interface actual location on current debian and ubuntu old location still existing via a symbolic link on debian

273304
installation	upgrade
after the installation was complete i was doing the standard dnf upgrade shell configurations and ultimately preparations for installing the nvidia drivers all of the computers i will use this on have nvidia gpus

273320
debian	linux
as has been said in the comments the only reliable way to build a single binary which will work on different releases of debian or any linux distribution is to build it statically

273320
ubuntu	linux
you will find cases where static binaries stop working but that s usually either related to libnss handling this is dynamic even in static binaries or changes in the x server s expectations this happens to old linux games or distribution kernels dropping support for features considered obsolete the oss sound interface on ubuntu kernels

273333
min	max
i need to compare the ps sensor value min and max value

273333
min	max
min greater than ps sensor greater than max

273333
min	max
if min value greater than ps sensor value ps sensor value is greater than max value then the line is normal lines and that should removed

273333
min	max
pa43410-2 ps sensor value 6.509000 min 6.327000 max 6.591000

273333
min	max
pa43410-2 ps sensor value 6.199000 min 6.017000 max 6.281000

273336
min	max
since awk splits its input into fields on whitespace by default the ps sensor value will be field 7 the min will be and the max will be

273336
min	max
therefore the command above will print all lines whose 7th field is between the min and max values

273340
centos	linux
local server centos linux release 7.1.1503 core

273340
centos	linux
remote server centos linux release 7.2.1511 core

273350
vpn	lan
even the local ip of the vpn gateway in the lan let alone any outside hosts

273393
post	get
please read a bit on the topic and post more questions here if you get stuck

273441
versioning	upgrade
upgrade apt on your system to a versioning newer than 1.0

273441
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning of apt and ensure that the repository you create or want to use supports the acquire-by-hash feature

273537
spaces	delimiter
you can see that cut is treating each spaces as a delimiter rather than any sequence of consecutive spaces as a delimiter the way awk does

273549
traceroute	nmap
nmap uses a different algorithm for tracing than traceroute 1 so the idea of a hop limit does not make sense

273549
traceroute	packets
traditional traceroute uses udp packets to high-numbered ports and starts with a ttl of 1 to discover the very next hop on the path to the target

273549
traceroute	nmap
nmap traceroute works a bit differently

273549
icmp	udp
if you performed os detection and got an icmp response to a udp probe then it can calculate the exact distance

273549
traceroute	nmap
it then begins to send probes decrementing the initial ttl each time until all closer hops are accounted for sometimes this means stopping once an already-found hop is found again to not duplicate results. if the target itself hasn t responded to any of these probes nmap will next start at ttl 10 and count up replicating the traditional traceroute algorithm

273561
folder	directory
all these folder must be available for mysql user not only endpoint tmp directory

273564
min	max
i need to compare the voltage sensor value min and max value

273564
min	max
min greater than voltage sensor value greater than max

273574
ubuntu	centos
note someone suggested to edit etc default grub file for ubuntu but i can t happen to find it in centos

273605
client-side	server-side
i use tmux with tmuxinator client-side which opens a few windows panes that ssh to my working directory server-side

273616
binutils	glibc
the system s basic components include the gnu compiler collection gcc the gnu c library glibc and gnu core utilities coreutils 8 but also the gnu debugger gdb gnu binary utilities binutils 38 the gnu bash shell 33 39 and the gnome desktop environment

273624
toupper	uppercase
from this question i how to use toupper to print in all uppercase but i don t know how to use it in a match because that answer just shows printing and doesn t leave the uppercase text in a variable

273662
debian	centos
i was testing with ancient suses some centos und with debian from lenny to jessie excludes dir wherever it is found

273677
ubuntu	centos
why can i tab-complete the core-file-name on centos but not on ubuntu

273681
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu linux 14.04 lts

273705
ubuntu	openbsd	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	solaris	freebsd	centos	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	debian	debian	centos	redhat	fedora	solaris	netbsd	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	centos	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	debian	centos	solaris
after own research found that such group exist across all touched distros sys group share id 3 on debian ubuntu redhat fedora centos suse freebsd openbsd netbsd macosx solaris

273718
debian-based	linux
i wish to create a simple two-way voice communication system between two linux computers running debian-based distros probably two raspberry pi zeroes

273721
daemons	systemd
it seems like the nscd name service cache daemons was causing problems with name resolution on my systemd

273734
freebsd	linux
and sshd ignores limits.conf on linux similarly login.conf on freebsd unless you configure things properly to route all incoming sessions through pam and use the appropriately configured pam module to check things like limits.conf first

273762
filesystems	fat
the moral of the story don t bother using filefrag for fat filesystems unless it says 1.43-wip and 2015+ at the bottom of the man page

273767
client-side	server-side
there is no way to get this information using xrandr client-side api though the server-side sends such info should it be considered as a defect

273795
dnf	yum
or because yum and dnf keep different additional data about packages and you seem to be insisting on using deprecated software you managed to install gyazo using plain yum and you got dnf confused

273795
dnf	yum
so transfer the transaction metadata from yum to dnf and if that doesn t help deinstall and reinstall gyazo by using dnf

273807
gedit	nano
edit the new configuration file in a text editor sudo nano on the command line or gksudo gedit for example

273832
ubuntu	debian
even though one of the error messages you posted mentions debian ubuntu i ll assume you re using a red hat system like your question suggests

273856
folder	directory
i checked the current directory but i didn t see the folder

273860
ubuntu	debian
i have a triple-boot system with windows 10 debian and ubuntu

273860
ubuntu	debian
then i installed debian and i used the same home folder for both debian and ubuntu

273917
debian	mint	debian	linux
what should i be aware of before installing arch linux as a debian linux mint user

273923
ubuntu	debian
the arch community is much smaller than many of the other larger and more popular distributions like ubuntu debian fedora et al but arch is not aiming for a large user base

273928
freebsd	linux
if you want to extract to a different directory with gnu or freebsd tar so on non-embedded linux cygwin freebsd and osx you can use

273931
filesystems	hfs+
efi table with a hfs+ filesystems taking up the entire disk

273931
filesystems	hfs+
disk utility gui in osx says that the partition table is in-tact and recreates a windows boot.ini file but it will not mount the hfs+ filesystems and says something like i am paraphrasing this from another language

273933
debian	linux
i use linux debian 8.3 with grub as boot loader and the disk is ext2 -formatted

273961
ubuntu	debian
i would say there is no need for complicated procedures and the best strategy is creating different home user directories between debian and ubuntu bellow home

273961
ubuntu	debian
as in home debian user and home ubuntu user

273961
ubuntu	debian
to change the default base home both in ubuntu and debian edit etc default useradd and change home for

273986
mouse	keyboard
be able to show the fedora desktop x.org not just a getty login and send mouse and keyboard input to it

274035
installation	upgrade
automated installation of security upgrade is a reasonably safe option

274044
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr and stdout in a bash script

274071
minix	linux
how are the terms posix unix linux and minix related

274077
minix	linux
linus originally used minix a unix-like system by tanenbaum et al but was unhappy and coded the first linux kernel

274093
tunnel	traceroute
when i traceroute out of my nas it goes through the tunnel

274094
tunnel	vpn
i m trying to add a static route in my vps to a client that is on the other side of the vpn tunnel to my vps and forwards it s traffic through the tunnel

274094
tunnel	vpn
the raspi acts as a router which itself is connected to an ap and the nas is connected to raspi and redirects its traffic through the vpn tunnel

274094
openvpn	iptables
redirect secondary network interface traffic along with port forwarding to tun0 openvpn using iptables

274108
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i had ubuntu and time ago i installed linux mint

274119
put	get
after i ll take a look at grub.conf and would try to get a solution for how to put a load ubuntu option string into initial grub2 loading screen

274120
cat	tee
in the 2nd case we pipe hi into tee using command substitution and one hi is printed by the tee d cat while another is printed by tee s pass through pipe

274131
daemons	launchd
add a new entry to launchd the xscreensaver daemons on startup as xscreensaver -no-splash

274135
cat	tee
echo world | tee cat

274137
ubuntu	linux
so if i install ubuntu 16.04 lts with linux kernel kernel 4.4 i will not get this bug

274142
ubuntu	linux
though i think that s a bit outside the scope of the question you posed which was simply so if i install ubuntu 16.04 lts with linux kernel kernel 4.4 i will not get this bug

274149
daemons	systemd
i have udev support in kernel config_devtmpfs thus my systemd does not strictly require udev daemons

274149
mouse	keyboard
lxde starts fine but keyboard and mouse are not working

274152
postgresql	mysql
i m working on a python script which takes care to migrate a mysql database with a certain schema structure into a postgresql database with a different structure

274152
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
since i will have to execute this script into many servers all of them will be gnu linux servers most of them centos some debian i m looking for a way to integrate python and all the python-modules dependencies directly into my script a sort of portable version of python if you know what i mean

274159
mouse	keyboard
to find the correct mouse and keyboard drivers i suggest you inspect var log xorg.0.log before you turn udev off you will see which driver it selects and which options it may apply to them

274162
single-quotes	double-quotes
the key is to use single-quotes when you don t want interpolation and glob expansion etc and either no quotes or double-quotes when you do want them

274165
folder	directory
folder in the current directory which will contain the python

274191
debian	linux
if it needs a wide selection of libraries and support binaries you may be best off using a regular linux distro debian or similar and just messing with the boot process a bit

274193
lan	localhost	wan	lan
although many entries stands for my wan interfaces and lan stands for lan one i don t understand what does localhost mean

274203
mouse	keyboard
i would like to disable any keyboard and mouse user puts in usb port regardless their id vendor name ...

274203
mouse	keyboard
any idea how to disable usb devices keyboard mouse wireless keyboard mouse and leave usb port enabled just for usb mass storage

274215
mouse	keyboard
and plug the keyboard mouse into a usb socket

274220
folder	directory
then unzip the folder content on the command line cd to the directory and build the dependency tree using . configure

274237
ubuntu	mint
i have current versions of ubuntu 15.10 and mint 17.3 running happily on an intel core 2 duo e4400 2ghz with 4gb ram

274261
fish	bash
switched to another tty and log as root change shell to bash and everything works so i am sure the problem is something in my fish configuration but didn t know how to determine what it could be

274261
fish	bash
so is there a way to determine from bash what is wrong with fish

274267
voip	sip
i would like to use the device in conjunction with pjsua to create a voip application so that the python sip hello world example works with it

274290
debian	linux
for your information kali linux 2.0 is based on debian jessie

274301
xfce	cinnamon
i have a frequent problem that occurs with window-based desktops like cinnamon or xfce especially on multiple monitors

274322
md5sum	dos2unix	chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
as of busybox 1.22 the following applets are noexec chgrp chmod chown cksum cp cut dd dos2unix env fold hd head hexdump ln ls md5sum mkfifo mknod sha1sum sha256sum sha3sum sha512sum sort tac unix2dos

274322
rmdir	pwd	rmdir	mkdir	mkdir	pwd
as of busybox 1.22 the following applets are nofork basename cat dirname echo false fsync length logname mkdir printenv printf pwd rm rmdir seq sync test true usleep whoami yes

274324
disk	ram
then the initial ram disk image initrd is loaded into memory

274333
sudo	passwd
you have set nopasswd for the script home mukesh desktop connect.sh not anything inside it that requires sudo passwd

274333
sudo	passwd
you also have another problem which is you have executable bit set for others any user can execute the file hence you are being asked for sudo passwd as the general permissions will be preceded by special ones like sudo

274333
sudo	passwd
and now sudo should not ask the passwd

274337
stdout	stderr
if you want to redirect both stdout and stderr

274337
stdout	stderr
now regardless of the script being in foreground or background the log file will have the stdout and or stderr

274339
ubuntu	centos
os centos ubuntu

274341
fasta	blast
so i have about 100 fasta files to blast and i need to find files with 50 to 90 similarities with the database file

274346
ubuntu	debian
64 bit .deb for debian ubuntu

274362
apache	nginx
php is paranoid enogh and there are a lot of options in apache nginx and php.ini configuration which may break your attempt

274370
daemons	launchd
on the other hand that might be a bogus daemons or something trying to launchd a process that quickly fails and doing it again in an endless loop

274379
umask	mkdir
the umask value is irrelevant because it only affects the permissions of the directories and files which mkdir and cp create mdash

274385
daemons	systemd
i am in the process of getting rid of udev daemons from my systemd

274404
stdout	stderr
i have to run a script background and also i have to catch the stderr and stdout

274407
stdout	stderr
and shows that both stdout and stderr get to the log

274411
ubuntu	linux
one is ubuntu and the other one is linux from scratch lfs which i built it my self

274473
folder	directory
i have to move the files to the target directory where the folder should contains the file name not exact match

274473
folder	directory
i want to read the filename from the source directory and i have to search the foldername containing filename and need to move the file to the matched folder

274486
ubuntu	centos
i m going to assume you re on centos 7+ or ubuntu 15.04+ which both come with systemd

274494
ubuntu	centos
also i have uninstalled networkmanager from the centos system and have disabled networkmanager for the bridge and physical devices on the ubuntu system so nm is not involved with these network devices in any way

274494
ubuntu	centos
is dhclient somehow configured or built differently on centos than on ubuntu such that multiple invocations of it is disallowed

274495
packets	multicast
possible for a host to receive mac-layer multicast packets for groups

274496
ubuntu	linux
i was building linux kernel from git master for ubuntu all day i was not able to build packages so i just ran sudo make module_install install

274502
ubuntu	centos
redhat s version of dhclient is modified so that might explain the difference between ubuntu and centos in this regard

274503
arp	icmp
now if i send one icmp echo request message to 10.10.123.2 source ip will be 10.10.123.3 then arp request messages are put onto wire and i can see that eth2 interface receives request who-has 10.10.123.2 tell 10.10.123.3 but for some reason it does not reply to this

274504
unix	bsd
according to the bsd man pages tar first appeared in version 7 unix in 1979 but shar first appeared in 4.4bsd which was released in 1994

274563
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
if you use stty sane that will fix problems with the terminal modes for echo and carriage return but on unix platforms aix hpux and solaris that sets the erase character to a value which you probably would not want

274630
debian	linux
...it really looks like there are no ready to download 32bit packages for debian and other linux flavours

274639
bazaar	git
these include subversion git mercurial bazaar among others

274652
bash	zsh
how to set up a run dialog with full bash zsh like autocompletion capabilities

274730
backslash	double-quotes
and that is what you need but you must preserve the double-quotes and double backslash

274754
udp	tcp
if the service sends udp packets you have to change -p tcp with -p udp

274761
debian	linux
i stumbled upon a weird behaviour of my bunsenlabs gnu linux which is based on debian

274785
debian	mint	debian	linux
i ve just switched from an old linux install debian squeeze to a new one linux mint 17.3 for my router i am using a full desktop pc with a linux install as my router

debian	mint
here are the two screenshots first from my old debian box whose routing works and second from my new mint box where it doesn t

bash	subshell
how do i resolve a variable in a subshell inside of bash -c

274894
gentoo	debian
is it possible to display debian style output on gentoo redhat systems as well

274901
gentoo	debian
debian 8 has version 3.3.9 which uses the old style with a separate line for buffers cache while gentoo and presumably rhel 7

274902
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	cinnamon	gnome
i have tried ubuntu gnome 15.10 64bit japanese and english and linux mint 17.3 cinnamon 64bit japanese

274912
filesystems	xfs
for example ext4 is a well known and stable filesystems which performs quite good pretty much always but in some cases competitors like xfs might be better with parallel i o for example

274962
filesystems	fat
i have 2 relatively small disk images for qemu raw format containing different filesystems say fat and ext4

274998
gentoo	linux
i am running gentoo linux hardened using kernel 4.3.3-hardened-r4 on an amd a4-5300 apu

275007
ubuntu	opensuse
experiences with ubuntu lubuntu manjaro cinnamon opensuse and a few other distros have yielded similar experiences as well unfortunately even though the graphical config tools have helped slightly

275023
versioning	upgrade
however being a newbie in linux systems and given the fact that my friend helped me to install fedora 21 back in january 2015 i am not sure how to upgrade my linux to a stable versioning of fedora with the highest conveniece as well as safety

275023
versioning	upgrade
could anyone help me with the upgrade for a non-advanced user as a result of which i will be using all the packages i have in fedora 21 but under a higher versioning

275031
dnf	yum
there are multiple methods for performing the upgrade dnf yum and fedup are the most common

275040
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu you can log in via ssh and use the linux tail command to display the last x number of lines of your var log auth.log file

275071
ubuntu	debian
on a side note mixing versions from debian and ubuntu like that is highly unlikely to work well

275093
ubuntu	linux
raspberry pi 2 is running linux dex 4.1.13-v7+ and the pc ubuntu 15.10 64-bit

275097
ubuntu	linux
first check if your distribution has software official for usb live creator suse linux ubuntu and fedora have this

versioning	upgrade
i would like to get portage to always install the latest available versioning of selected software software specified when running emerge along with all relevant dependencies that also need to be installed and upgrade to the latest available versioning in my local copy of the portage tree of installed software upon running

275146
versioning	upgrade
i know that portage by default installs or upgrade to unless otherwise specified the best available versioning of the software in question which is not necessarily the latest as the latest may have stability issues

275146
gentoo	linux
i would like to know how to make my gentoo linux vm bleeding edge with only the very latest software in my local copy of the portage tree

275165
folder	directory
is there a way that is not configured by setting by hand all the local folder automatically discovering each existent directory and skipping the mount of it

275172
daemons	systemd
then on your systemd try to log into the new ssh daemons with

275215
kate	kde	kate	geany
i ve also noticed that although it is present on konsole and kate it doesn t appear on geany and xterm and it could be related to the screen refresh routines used by kde qt as opposed to the gtk used by the later

chown	sudo
i can t use chown to change the ownership because that would involve using sudo

275247
sudoers	visudo
the sudoers file should always be edited by the visudo command which locks the file and does grammatical checking

275247
sudo	passwd
you have root user you know its passwd and you can fix sudo

275254
ubuntu	debian
while on debian ubuntu it uses a perl-style regular expression

275268
tunnel	vpn
for your own access you can either set up a tunnel into your local network or run a vpn server that you connect to

275278
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
distributions derived from debian ubuntu mint elementary etc. tend to follow debian on this point

275286
centos	linux
i m not 100 sure what flavour of linux is being used it seems to be centos

275304
mouse	keyboard
that device let you control the remote keyboard and mouse to control and view what s happening streaming the video

275314
icmp	telnet
you can use icmp and ping tunnel to forward telnet or ssh through it or 6to4 which is assigned its own protocol type 41 and is port-less or similar measures

275354
ubuntu	linux
i have setup my smtp server on a linux ubuntu 15.04 vps rented at ovh according to

275364
sudo	passwd
i then removed the sudo command from the ec2-user and added a passwd to root

275440
folder	directory
ubuntu has etc cron.hourly etc cron.daily etc so i was wondering if there was also a folder in the home directory it looks at

275442
stdout	stderr
you also might want to install sudo apt-get install postfix select local only to log any stdout stderr your scripts make in the file

275469
debian	linux
the solus operating system provides an independent not a derivative from debian or some other linux project complete vertical

275484
openvpn	iptables
i ve tried almost all iptables rules to block smtp on openvpn server but still clients clients can access remote smtp servers on port 25

275484
openvpn	iptables
iptables rules set by openvpn access server

275499
chgrp	chmod
regarding chgrp and chmod g+s of dmidecode in nils answer i guess this won t work as intended because saving gid with chmod g+s doesn t make dmidecode use it s new privileges

275505
sudo	passwd
sudo -p passwd rm a file

275507
sudo	passwd
sudo does not have an option to specify the passwd but you can still do the authentication on the command line like this

275507
sudoers	passwd
the sudoers policy allows uids that are not in the passwd database as long as the targetpw option is not set

275524
ubuntu	linux
for many things on linux you can get away installing to a small usb3 stick i use sandisk ultra fits and my usual distro is ubuntu studio

275533
stdout	stderr
ps redirecting stderr to stdout with is not necessary with nohup in your example because if standard error is a terminal it is directed to the same place as the standard output. nohup man page

275574
cpu	hyperthreading
there s even more to it the scheduler knows about multiple levels of cache coherency and tries not to migrate threads too far moving a thread inside the same hyperthreading core is very cheap moving to another core on the same cpu chip is less cheap moving to another cpu chip is more expensive etc

275592
stdout	stderr
the shell redirects stderr to stdout

275592
stdout	stderr
it then invokes nohup which inherits that situation stderr and stdout using the same file descriptor

275592
stdout	stderr
nohup always writes stdout and stderr to a file

275592
stdout	stderr
stderr follows stdout unless you explicitly redirect it to another file

275632
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
is there any generic command or steps which will work on all platforms like rhel centos ubuntu debian etc.

275647
udp	rtp
the pipeline is camera h264enc rtp udp receiver_and_display

275698

opensuse	linux
i am trying to allocate a linux partition to a disk using an opensuse vm in vmplayer

275714
opensuse	debian
sorry that i don t know much about opensuse but under debian there is a package called util-linux

275736
bash	zsh
note that this feature is not specified by posix only available in bash ksh and its derivatives zsh with base between 2 and 36

275754
sudo	passwd
a better solution if you want to run something with sudo without putting in your passwd is to allow your user to do exactly that one command without passwd

275754
sudoers	visudo
open sudoers file with sudo visudo and add the following line obviously replace the username at the beginning and the command at the end

275797
bash	zsh
in modern shells like bash and zsh you have a very useful redirector that accepts a string as an input

275802
ubuntu	linux
i need to keep ssh ing into many-different linux boxes ubuntu mostly and every time i miss my basic aliases

275861
spaces	delimiter
take out the spaces and fix your backreferences to preserve your delimiter

275869
ubuntu	linux
using gnu find 4.4.2 linux 3.13.0-85 ubuntu 14.04

275870
chown	sudo
sudo chown me test

275881
stdout	stderr
note also the redirection of all output from cmp both its stdout and its stderr since only its return code is of interest

275885
bash	zsh
are you sure you are using bash and not zsh

275901
temp	tmp
there re plenty system calls that creates temp files and directories in tmp including

275901

on a standard unix system based on the original sources uptime reads var adm utmpx and checks for the last time of reboot entry

275929
ubuntu	freebsd
how can i mount the freebsd ufs boot partition under ubuntu in this setup

275929
freebsd	linux
a linux logical partition and a freebsd logical partition which contains

275929
ubuntu	freebsd
versions ubuntu 14.04 with kernel 4.2.0-27-generic on x86_64 freebsd 10.3 release amd64 both fresh installs

275979
centos	linux
we have several linux centos live usb drives and i was wondering whether it was possible to just mount and update them from a linux desktop running from a hdd instead of booting and running yum on each one

275984
debian	linux
the linux machines are both running debian and the remote desktop machine windows 7

275996
udp	tcp
by default you re only going to have ones for tcp and udp loaded

275996
pptp	nat
that s why you re seeing your pptp traffic which is actually ppp over gre escaping without nat

276034
getattr	setattr
so how do i give the mysqld_t type read write getattr setattr etc. access to tmpfs_t

276044
sysv	systemd
i ve successfully converted my 4 year old installation of kde4 sysv grub legacy to kde5 - plasma systemd grub2

276057
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
historical unix systems have truss solaris aix etc.

276059
debian	linux
kali linux 2.0 is based on debian jessie

276085
screens	tablet
so i was using my laptop drawing in krita with a wacom tablet on debian wheezy and the screens suddenly turned blue like a windows crash dump and now looks like the attached image

276102
udp	tcp
there are other ways to configure remote logging with rsyslog including tcp based logging rather than udp

276107
kde	gnome
on systems with x window kde gnome this is practically mandatory

276125
folder	directory
for example lets say i have the following directory inside another folder

276125
folder	directory
the folder i intend to actually do this on can be worked on in any order the final splits can be totally arbitrary but they have no logical naming consistency - by which i mean they can t be organised sensibly alphabetically or numerically based on any key within the directory name themselves

276139
ubuntu	mint
from version 4.3.8 running on an mint 17 ubuntu system

276144
sudo	passwd
provide you with access to log in or masquerade as root such as with sudo or su with the root passwd

276153
daemons	launchd
from here i have to launchd a dbus-daemon for my user and export the resulting dbus_session_bus_address in order for gvfs to communicate with that daemons

276162
put	get
personally i get the entire scsi directory in lib modules 3.16.0-4-amd64 kernel drivers in example for jessie on a pc freshly installed and put it in lib modules 3.16.0-4-amd64 kernel drivers in initrd.gz of installer

276180
kde	gnome
x11 aka x.org foundation windowing is basically used by other desktop environments like kde and gnome among many others to provide the abstract interface to managing a gui

276180
kde	gnome
without relying on x kde gnome others would have to write the code to do low-level coding things themselves

276180
kde	gnome
instead kde gnome communicate back and forth with x it runs as a server process that clients connect to

276198
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
i created a dedicated backup-user and allow the user to execute rsync with sudo without being prompted for a passwd with the visudo rule

276198
folder	directory
i created a root folder for all the views of the actual directory that i want to backup

276217
spaces	delimiter
it appears to be appending a spaces rather than a tab because later on the size of details is the same as if the record were spaces delimiter instead of tab

276232
redhat	fedora	dnf	yum
since centos i believe still uses yum in place of the newer dnf that is in fedora redhat now.

276233
daemons	systemd
that will tell systemd to always start the daemons on startup

276235
folder	directory
i m able to write changes in the home directory but when it comes to the var www html folder it s not allowing me to make any changes or create new files or folder

276237
ubuntu	linux
i have an application written in c++ on linux ubuntu 12.14 which decodes audio and finds the peak

276303
debian	linux
i am new to linux and recently installed debian 8 to a guest virtual machine running under virtual box on a windows 8 laptop asus x552cl

276303
ubuntu	debian
before this i had tried to get ubuntu as second virtual machine os but just like with debian i ran in the same black screen of death

276325
gtk	motif
the x window system includes a basic library the athena widget set but most applications use fancier libraries such as gtk qt motif etc

276327
bash	zsh
but for what you re doing in fact in bash or zsh you don t need find

276328
ubuntu	mint
i would like to setup a dual boot system using mint and ubuntu with each on a drive of its own

276335
ubuntu	mint
suppose you want mint on dev sda and ubuntu on dev sdb

276335
ubuntu	mint
after you install ubuntu rerun sudo update-grub on mint and grub will detect and make menu entries for both oses

276335
ubuntu	mint
but even if you installed mint then ubuntu and used the grub installer on both it should still work ok

276352
next	except
and then disabling all except the next

276352
mouse	keyboard
but it didn t seem to have any effect - linux still was able to recognize the ports well enough to use my usb mouse and keyboard

276354
post	get
this dockerfile from this blog post demonstrate an ideal way to get started with a linux gui running in a docker container

276354
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
the author is also using ubuntu as his docker base image you might decide to use for instance debian or arch linux

276372
daemons	systemd
be aware that in a unix systemd a file only gives up the space being used ceases to exist when it is not used anymore hence the need for a syslog restart because if you are deleting a file using up all your log partition you won t see the space freed until you restart the syslog daemons

276395
apache	nginx
everyone and their grandmother want php these days and you really can t have home dumbuser public_html php_shell.php running as the same user that spawned your apache nginx right

276403
mp3	flac
i want lines ending with flac or mp3 to be considered a match if and are the same and the corresponding line to be excluded

276409
folder	directory
how to clear all the log files alone from all the log folder in these sub-directories using a single command from the parent directory

276419

if adding sudo is not fairly acceptable then change the ownership of folder use chown

276419
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r username username opt storage

276437
solaris	sunos
even the build-in wc from ksh93 matches the sunos output and a recent solaris 11 even uses the wc library implementation from ksh93 with no change in the output

276439
ssd	sata
my current software successfully works with sata ssd

276504
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu 14.04.4 lts gnu linux 3.13.0-85-generic x86_64 where i created a simple upstart job

276525
udp	tcp
you have to block tcp and udp ports

276542
ubuntu	linux
i am currently working with ubuntu gcc compiler and i run it on vmware .but i am looking for a open source software that can run on windows 8 or 8.1 platform which can code compiling run programs with linux unix system calls

276614
bash	tcsh
i am trying to write a bash function that behaves similarly to the where builtin in tcsh

276620
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
now if it s only the equivalent of tcsh zsh s where command you could use bash s type -a

276624
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
call the script with sudo from the main application and edit the sudoers list accordingly to avoid requiring a passwd when calling the script

276655
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
before i started using linux mint os i have been using ubuntu os on the same laptop and have always experienced the same problem but i can t remember if it does the same thing while the laptop is charging

276657
int	chars
so the first block in your example you pipe into awk is a string and the second block in your example needs to be an int number describing how many chars of all the blocks together starting from the first chars you want to get back

276660
apache	lighttpd
the prolem was that i was using apache conf syntax instead of lighttpd conf syntax

276668
tunnel	vpn
at least the vpn gateway address should use the regular default gateway otherwise the tunnel endpoint can not be reached anymore causing the tunnel to fail and you end up with nothing

276668
tunnel	vpn
it depends on the vpn gateway which networks are negotiated configured to go through the tunnel but you might be able to add some routing rules for other networks as well

276695
centos	linux
centos 2 the first release was based on red hat enterprise linux 2 and is the closest release to red hat linux 9 chronologically

276695
centos	linux
all these versions are over a decade old though so you d be better off using the latest release of centos or even red hat enterprise linux which is now available free in the developer subscription

276710
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your versioning of rsync

276710
ubuntu	debian
another machine this time ubuntu rather than pure debian

i use mostly gnome as my preferred desktop environment but use xfce occasionally

276749
rpm	yum
use rpm command to install individual package instead of yum

276749
redhat	fedora
for redhat fedora etc

276759
vim	emacs
i am a moderately experienced vim user who is now beginning to use gnu emacs

276759
vim	emacs
at about the same time as i learned that ctrl - p and ctrl - n are the default for up and down in emacs i also learned they are variants of k and j in normal mode in vim

276759
vim	emacs
it seems unlikely that a couple of random emacs shortcuts were borrowed into vim so their inclusion in both makes me think that they probably predate both emacs and vim

276769
folder	dir
however in some others my downloads folder there s a subdirectory or file with a - in it and it completes that dir

276770
sudo	passwd
sudo grep temporary passwd var log mysqld.log

sudo	passwd
i was trying to follow some linux instructions that involved sudo and tried a few times to enter the passwd unsuccessfully before realizing that i was getting it incorrect because i was typing in my ssh terminal

276815
icmp	tcp
no tcp packet is returned but a firewall can return an icmp packet which is less common

276853
stdout	stderr
captures the stdout but not the stderr of whatever the .

276853
bash	zsh
and the man page of the shell sh ksh bash zsh has a section about redirection and command substitution as well as on builtins not only which but also test is often implemented as a builtin

276859
mouse	keyboard
this thread has a couple of solutions based on detecting keyboard and mouse activity

276859
mouse	keyboard
remember that your keyboard and mouse may be inactive when watching a movie or running a cpu-heavy task

276863
filesystems	btrfs
it s even more special-case if you consider copy-on-write filesystems like btrfs

276888
ubuntu	mint
but is it possible to install 2 os on same pendrive like ubuntu + mint and have a choice everytime i boot

276891
daemons	systemd
your helper could either be running as a daemons started at systemd boot or better be activated as needed by systemd

276892
stdout	stderr
it looks to me like the bash exec preserves stdout and stderr of the executed command

276904
xfce	gnome
i m using gnome and occasionally xfce but am open to other de s

276907
debian	linux
i m a total newbie in linux and just installed debian and samba my debian computer name is debian but after installing samba it is showing like this in windows network places

276924
put	get
if you put the presentation window s on the projector and make them sticky and you don t put any other window on that monitor on any workspace then you ll get the desired effect

276926
chown	chmod
i dont want that he is working to much while he is root so i tried to add a group called home and chown -r home home and chmod -r g+w home but it is not possible to copy other users homedirs

276941
installation	upgrade
my raspbian installation is pretty old and has been upgrade from wheezy to jessie so it still uses the old way to configure network interfaces etc network interfaces

276957
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	netbsd	solaris	netbsd	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
it s in gnu coreutils busybox freebsd and netbsd and but not in openbsd or solaris

if sata is so trustworthy why are there checksummed filesystems like zfs btrfs refs

277033
filesystems	btrfs
how to find data copies of a given file in btrfs filesystems

277045
mouse	keyboard
out of the blue the screen mouse keyboard freeze while the system still runs in the background

277068
apache	nginx
at this point it doesn t require nginx or apache in front of it because it has a built-in webserver

277088
debian	linux
i m using debian gnu linux stretch sid though my knowledge of the system is not yet broad enough to my liking

277166
for-loop	arrays
i added a for-loop to go over all of the arrays indexes -- that s the syntax

277183

on x window system twm of my ubuntu 12.04 xterm has width of 484 pixel and height of 316 pixel and its geometry is 80x24 based on xwininfo

277276
width	height
how can i configure xterm of lfs 7.9 so that its width by height size can be like ubuntu 12.04

277295
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu s xterm settings are probably in at least that s where they are in debian

277374
jobs	cron
i suggest that you wrap your cron jobs in an outer adaptation script that does this job

277382
stdout	stderr
the echo output of the signal handler is redirected to stderr since stdout obviously already is broken by the time the sigpipe is trapped

277391
temp	tmp
your root file system is full and hence your temp dir tmp and var tmp for that matter are also full

277445
min	max
you can specify the max and min subdirectory depths

277476
cinnamon	gedit
i use the default gedit on cinnamon on linux mint but i find when opening files from within it i cannot navigate the open file dialog solely using the keyboard

277483
centos	linux
centos version as requested centos linux release 7.1.1503 core

linux and bsd consoles for instance are based loosely on existing practice in other terminals such as vt220 for linux and sco for the bsds technically unix for the latter but documented as sco

277492
implements	modifiers
the pc-style modifiers implements in xterm went beyond the shift and control adding alt and meta

277493

277494
ubuntu	centos
or lsb_release -a for centos ubuntu

i am working with a pcengines apu2c4 board with debian 8.4 installed.i am quite new to linux

277510
debian	centos
please read network card bonding and bridging on centos and debian

277511
tesseract	leptonica
recent versions of tesseract already solved this but because it requires compiling both leptonica and tesseract i m not entirely comfortable with it

277537
put	get
put together you get

277588
ansible	puppet
the best you could do is using a configuration management tool like salt ansible chef or puppet or to create the files through some other automated means

277591
bash	zsh
with recent versions of ksh93 bash or zsh you can shorten the set line to

277592
dpkg	aptitude
both apt-get and aptitude are convenient front-ends for the underlying dpkg command the debian package system

277598
daemons	launchd
i have launchd process named redmine that launchd by daemons user â redmine

277600
profiling	debugging
i don t care about os boot time or application launch times but i do care about compilation times time to launch stuff i am debugging being able to record videos fast being able to run windows performance tools and dump several gigabytes of performance data without degrading the performance of whatever i am profiling

277611
mouse	keyboard
i tried pressing the f9 key on my keyboard which looks like a mouse with a line through it but the exact same shape with the line appears on the screen which means it is turned off i assume

277624
daemons	systemd
i found a separate stackoverflow thread stating that systemd reads the .service files from bottom to top so i moved the execstartpost line to right above the execstart line reloaded the daemons files and restarted apache again with no success.

277642
sudo	passwd
it wouldn t require foo s passwd because with sudo you are using root s permissions or something

277649
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
my debian 8 system jessie is primarily an xfce system but i also use gnome and kde programs

277649
xfce	gnome
what do the xfce gnome settings-daemons do

277655
folder	directory
however now some folder have become binary files and nothing within my home directory can be opened

277700
folder	dir
let s say the folder you expect to be there is mydir and you want to create a link mylink2dir only if the dir exists

277733
putty	winscp
you must use winscp to connect to the remote ubuntu server not putty

277733
putty	winscp
putty allows you to connect to a shell prompt winscp allows you to transfer files so it s the latter that you must use

277763
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
as part of chrome platform deprecation cps 2015-10 we will end support for google chrome on 32-bit linux ubuntu precise 12.04 and debian 7 wheezy in early march 2016

we are facing a problem with managing cron jobs over multiple servers with dependencies

277800
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
only it s not as interactive as in zsh or bash or tcsh s i-search-back widget

277821
ubuntu	debian
according to mentioned posts and the above table one question comes to my mind is next lts versions of ubuntu based on actual testing version of debian

277821
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu 12.04 was based on debian 7

277821
ubuntu	debian
as you can see ubuntu 11.10 was also based on debian 7 so debian 7 was not testing release in that time but rather it was stable or am i wrong

277821
ubuntu	debian
i ve also seen that is not recommended to install debian packages to ubuntu and vice versa

277821
ubuntu	debian
why is this problem and why it is not recommended to install packages for next ubuntu lts xenial xerus from current debian testing stretch

277825
rar	zip
possibly because they come from a dos windows background where it is normal for compression and archiving to be integrated in a single format zip rar etc

277832
ubuntu	debian
up until ubuntu 12.04 ubuntu lts releases were based on debian testing

277832
ubuntu	debian
up until the debian import freeze packages updated in debian unstable or added to debian unstable are automatically synced over to ubuntu with a few exceptions

277832
ubuntu	debian
it s actually common to upload a package to debian unstable and see it synced to ubuntu s development release before it migrates to debian testing

277832
ubuntu	debian
since debian unstable is ever-changing it doesn t really mean much to say that ubuntu is based on a given version of debian unstable because there is no such thing

277832
ubuntu	debian
a given release of ubuntu is based on debian unstable as it was at the time of the debian import freeze

277832
ubuntu	debian
all supported releases of debian and ubuntu get upgrades after their release as you would expect for security support

277832
ubuntu	debian
these will naturally tend to diverge since the aim is to keep the changes to a minimum in each release branch debian 7 and lts debian 8 the various supported releases of ubuntu

277846
ubuntu	debian
according to mentioned posts and the above table one question comes to my mind is next lts versions of ubuntu based on actual testing version of debian

277846
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu have their own release cycle which puts out a release every 6 months during the early part of the release cycles they pull in updated source packages from debian

277846
ubuntu	debian
later in the ubuntu release cycle after the debian import freeze the automatic imports from debian stop though specific source packages can still be imported if conditions dictate it

277846
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu only import source packages from debian

277846
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is very often ahead of debian on core packages like gcc and glibc

277846
ubuntu	debian
there can also be packages where imports from debian are blocked either due to build failures or due to local changes in ubuntu that need to be manually merged

277846
ubuntu	debian
any correspondence between ubuntu releases and debian releases will only be approximate

277846
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu also have local changes in base-files so updates to that package from debian have to be pulled in manually

277846
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu 12.04 was based on debian 7

277846
ubuntu	debian
as you can see ubuntu 11.10 was also based on debian 7 so debian 7 was not testing release in that time but rather it was stable or am i wrong

277846
ubuntu	debian
i would guess that ubuntu simply didn t get arround to pulling in debian s updates to the base-files package

277846
ubuntu	debian
i ve also seen that is not recommended to install debian packages to ubuntu and vice versa

277846
ubuntu	debian
why is this problem and why it is not recommended to install packages for next ubuntu lts xenial xerus from current debian testing stretch

277846
ubuntu	debian
the thing with mixing ubuntu and debian is that most of the time it works but when it doesn t work you have a mixture of packages that noone has tested

277846
ubuntu	debian
that means neither debian or ubuntu is likely to want to support you with problems that come out of said mixing

277846
ubuntu	debian
i would say installing stuff from debian testing on the development release of ubuntu is probablly safer than the other way round

277846
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is often ahead of debian on core libraries and accidently pulling in ubuntu s version of said libraries may cause breakage in things unrelated to the program you were trying to update

277853
openkm	dms
if you re after an open source dms then openkm looks like a good choice for you - supported modern and desktop-based

277865
jobs	cron
there s one process per day so it believe it s related to the daily cron jobs

277865
jobs	cron
the start time of the process in ps aux 04 01 daily seems to coincide with the kick-off time for the daily cron jobs 04 02 daily

277923
rpm	yum
are you compiling from source or using rpm yum

277928
debian	linux
i have a debian linux server with exim

277941
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
apple doesn t install it afaik so you ll need fink or macports or homebrew or a manual install

277941
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
assuming a properly configured pkg_config_path for fink or macports or homebrew or the manual install in this case macports pkg-config might indicate the presence of gsl and bonus the various compiler flags to use

277949
bash	zsh
however terminal settings are not typically environment variables and shells like bash or zsh have a set command and other places they hide settings.

277951
ubuntu	debian
see how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

277967
width	height
to change the paper size replace 612 792 with the appropriate width and height expressed in postscript points 72 postscript points 1 u.s

277986
folder	directory
i have a directory full of folder and i was wondering

277986
folder	directory
if there is any command to compress all the folder in a directory x with date in the name of the file and not update old ones in case they existed

278008
folder	directory
i need a command which will recursively loop over the folder and clear all the contents from all the files present in that directory and its subdirectories

278012
openbsd	freebsd
does the fact that freebsd and openbsd source code is available make their job easier

278019
rpm	yum
do you use yum localinstall or rpm

278031
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
however they are for ubuntu and debian versions of linux and they proved unsuccessful when i tried them on kali

278080
children	parent
children but never on its parent environment

278087
installation	upgrade
try installing with upgrade from the installation itself

278122
ganglia	metrics
it has number of user-contributed gmond python dso metrics modules including a gpu nvidia module ganglia gmond_python_modules gpu nvidia

278157
daemons	launchd
a daemons is usually either created by a process forking a child process and then immediately exiting thus causing init to adopt the child process or by the init process directly launchd the daemons

278157
daemons	launchd
in addition a daemons launchd by forking and exiting typically must perform other operations such as dissociating the process from any controlling terminal tty

278157
stdout	stderr
i think you don t even have to redirect stdin stdout and stderr

278184
sudo	passwd
i have a sudo access for the other user with no passwd

278187
sudo	passwd
the -u flag to sudo will allow you to specify the user account under which a command should run but will require you to know the other user s passwd

278206
folder	directory
can i display git in prompt when current directory has contains a .git folder

278212
single-quotes	backslash
note that single-quotes are used when setting ps1 to prevent premature variable resolution and also note that a backslash before at the end of your ps1 is recommendedâ it s the same as unless you are root

278215
ubuntu	linux
i want to test different variants of tcp in linux ubuntu

278218
folder	directory
you would probably be happier with this is there a .git folder here or in one of my parent directory

278247

for further description of file and directory permissions in linux as you ve mentioned ubuntu see

278249
bash	zsh
firstly zsh is 74 slower than bash to load

i would like to find out why the ubuntu linux 15.10 live cd login appears sporadically after i disconnect and reconnect the comcast internet carrier cable at the back of the lenovo think station desktop pc after 15 minutes from selecting the ubuntu livecd install ubuntu linux gui item

278253
ubuntu	linux
we are installing ubuntu 15.10 live cd iso on a completely blank hard drive which was erased with the linux command fdisk

278253
ubuntu	linux
i would also like to know how to make the ubuntu linux 15.10 live cd login appear after 5 minutes consistently

278253
ubuntu	linux
this question may be important to people who buy computers with reformatted hard drives and wish to install ubuntu linux from a livecd

278262
ethernet	wireless
in the above lo loopback interface eno1 ethernet interface wlp2s0 wireless are up but i am getting internet only from wlp2s0

278292
ubuntu	centos
i have clang installed from packages on both ubuntu 14.07 centos 7 and fedoara 22

278338
wan	lan
one connected to my wan eth0 and one connected to my lan eth1 to distribute the ip

278365
debian	linux
the server is running a debian x64 system so if ffmpeg is not suitable i am open to other tools on linux which can do this efficiently

278368
stdout	stderr
dev stdout stdin stderr work in bash on these platforms

278369
sudo	passwd
we know of sudo or ssh without passwd

278382
ansible	puppet
in this space tools like ansible puppet chef and others will let you deploy software and configurations from a central location -- often maintained using version control software such as git -- across a few systems or across thousands of systems

278390
bash	zsh
i was lead to believe that there were no differences between aliases in zsh and bash however that appears to not be the case

278395
ubuntu	linux
the sporadic ubuntu linux live cd problem was caused by a dirty hard disk

278395
ubuntu	linux
i made ubuntu linux 15.10 gui installer start to function properly just now using usb stick with an universal installer i added last evening

278396
folder	directory
the problem is that linux file manager nautilus doesn t apply default acls when you move a file into a folder directory nor good old set-group-id

278417
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
debian and ubuntu flavors use apt-get and yum is used for centos among others

278418
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu ...

278418
redhat	fedora
redhat fedora dnf upgrade

278431
folder	directory
the filter -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -type d is selecting only directory at the second level where folder in current directory are at level 1 and their sub_folder at level 2

278465
debian	linux
on a bog-standard linux debian jessie linux kernel 3.16 dd from gnu coreutils 8.23 i get a highly variable number of bytes ranging from about 3000 to almost 4000

278465
octal	binary
posix defines other tools that read binary data and convert it to a text format uuencode outputs in historical uuencode format or in base64 od outputs an octal or hexadecimal dump

278468
centos	linux
python pip and many python modules are provided through the centos linux repos

278468
centos	linux
on centos 7.x linux i can install pip and pymongo with the standard distribution package manager yum install python-pip python-pymongo

278469
redhat	fedora
the fedora project is sponsored by redhat which invests in our infrastructure and resources to encourage collaboration and incubate innovative new technologies

278471
bash	zsh
wanting multiple inputs is a common problem so some shells ksh bash zsh offer a solution process substitution which is what don_crissti suggested in a comment

278473
ubuntu	linux
i don t have ubuntu 16.04 installed anywhere yet but based on current trends in linux system layouts i can make a pretty good guess at what happened here

278476
disk	ram
my netbsd-current build server is a xen domu with 8gb ram and 8 vcpus running on a dell pe2950 8-core xeon e5440 2.83ghz with 32gb ram and with a decently fast set of sas disk on the integrated perc 6 i controller with the build output going to a raid-0 partition

278519
bash	zsh
if you have to do it entirely in shell and can use a modern shell like bash ksh zsh etc but not ash or dash or similar strictly posix shell you could replace the seq command with

278553
apache	nginx
but on digital ocean they say that i ll have to do that via apache or nginx

278557
debian	linux
system debian gnu linux 8 jessie

278569
versioning	upgrade
on the stable release the available versioning is wpa_supplicant 2.3 with a regular sources.list it s not possible to upgrade the current versioning to wpa_supplicant 2.5 why does debian stable keep some obsolete vulnerable packages

278573
apache	nginx
i would say try running the application using nginx proxy or apache proxy

278607
centos	linux
if in doubt dd the drive to make a full copy and use centos or other linux live cd

278615
jobs	cron
when writing cron jobs you should use the absolute path to the binary if you haven t already done a export of your path in crontab

278616
debian	linux
recently i switched from shared web hosting to digitalocean vps where i have debian gnu linux 8 jessie running

278638
for-loop	loops
if you know prior to loops how many repetitions you are going to need such as iterating a countable number of static files to process you should use a for-loop

278649
fish	bash
i want to be able to check if a fish shell is being run in login interactive or batch mode and this question only discusses bash

278666
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
check if rlwrap is packaged for your distro it is for debian and probably ubuntu mint etc at least before downloading and compiling the source

278668
sudo	passwd
sudo -s means read passwd from standard input

278668
sudo	passwd
sudo -s on the other hand may have some importance with passwd

278678
bash	zsh
that s an extension of bash and also zsh ksh and its derivatives to allow shell variable contain invalid integer constant to be reused in arithmetic expression

278678
bash	zsh
zsh ksh and its derivatives behave like bash above and also busybox sh

278686
ubuntu	centos
remote_server a production vm of either centos or ubuntu running in the cloud

278693
bash	subshell
it might even have some temporarily open a bash subshell which is an even larger problem for your case

278723
vmware	virtualbox
i also tried with vmware and virtualbox but it still doesn t work

278730
cinnamon	gnome	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
see man xsession for the basic implementation though various window management systems gnome cinnamon kde ... sometimes place a management ui on top of this so a full answer to your question depends on which desktop environment within linux mint you are using

278733
ubuntu	linux
this is on linux ubuntu 16.04 64-bit gawk version gnu awk 4.1.3 api 1.1 gnu mpfr 3.1.4 gnu mp 6.1.0

278734
prepare	execute
once the prepare statement has been execute once for preparing dev sdb the partitions have already been made on dev ssd so preparing dev sdc fails

278734
filesystems	xfs
finally if we manually create our own journalling partitions should they use the xfs filesystems in production

278745
post	get
i had an original post but i did not get much answers helping me

278745
folder	directory
after that i went on my putty terminal logged into my remote server and created a .ssh directory in my home superjohnny folder my sudo user and i made a folder within the .ssh folder called authorized_keys

278745
sudo	passwd
i then did sudo service ssh restart and then i still get a passwd prompt when trying to log in

278745
sudo	passwd
but that did nothing at all when i restarted my terminal with sudo service ssh restart and then when i logged back into another terminal it still prompted me with a passwd

278772
dpkg	apt
i need to install apt package on a western digital dl4100 nas running a linux dl4100 distribution where the only package system is dpkg

278780
put	get
another thing to observe is that if you need some characters like ã ã ã¼ and ã for example and can t get your system to map them there is a nice trick on vim that put these characters right at your need

278798
bash	zsh
in a ksh bash or zsh script you can use â for both

278808
put	get
to get the same interactive configuration in both cases put the following line in your .bash_profile

278811
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
at least this is true for ubuntu 14.04 or debian jessie with sysvinit and probably for other linux distributions

278811
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu 14.04 or debian jessie with sysvinit the authentication logs are in var log auth.log

278817
sudoers	umask	umask	sudo
if set sudo will set the umask as specified by sudoers without modification

278817
sudoers	umask
this makes it possible to specify a more permissive umask in sudoers than the user s own umask and matches historical behavior

278817
sudoers	umask	umask	sudo
if umask_override is not set sudo will set the umask to be the union of the user s umask and what is specified in sudoers

278819
ubuntu	linux
the following behavior occurs in os x 10.9.5 with the bsd utils but not linux ubuntu 15.10 with the gnu utils

openbsd	debian
i recently installed openbsd 5.9 and i m trying to get it functional enough to use as a replacement for debian

278824
openbsd	debian
so i checked what resolv.conf looks like in debian when connected to the vpn and i manually changed etc resolv.conf on openbsd after connecting to the vpn and lo addresses get resolved and my ip seems to be in germany whatismyipaddress.com

278860
filesystems	fat
so to put the question another way if i or some piece of software wanted to mount a xxx.iso file onto a usb device is it necessary to have a pre-existing partition complete with filesystems fat x or ext x or is the .iso file - once in the mounted state - a lower level construct that performs the same similar role a filesystems or even a partition does

278884
put	get
i want to get something like this while outputting string in prompt_command save terminal cursor position print put .

var lock on linux mint is a link to run lock on ubuntu linux mint 17 and centos 7

278906
folder	directory
you need to create an id_rsa file in the .ssh folder of your home directory with ssh-keygen or convert from your .ppk puttygen generated file

278910
disk	ram
since ram is significantly faster than disk storage you can use dev shm instead of tmp for the performance boost if your process is i o intensive and extensively uses temporary files

278912
openbsd	netbsd
here i am finally using bsd openbsd netbsd and another bsd-based succesfully working

278912
debian-based	linux
it s a dead end trying on other linux debian-based arch redhat blabla

278915
nixos	archlinux
think this is a general issue as i experienced it on more than 1 linux distro nixos and archlinux and different desktop window managers

278923
google-chrome	firefox
when i scroll using mousewheel or two-finger touchpad gesture the page in google-chrome or firefox continues scrolling for a bit after i ve put my fingers aside from touchpad or mouse

278942
hash	md5
this results in the file 2016_04_25_10_30_am.log although with the current datetime being created with the md5 hash of etc mtab as its contents

278957
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
then remove that package using either dpkg or apt-get or apt or aptitude etc etc etc

278965
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	centos	debian	mint	centos	mint
i also had this same problem and did a lot of tests in some redhat centos debian ubuntu mint machines

i m new to linux i m using ubuntu 14.04 and i want to create a script to deny pendrive mounting

279059
rpm	yum	ubuntu	debian	dpkg	apt
your package manager may be on eof dpkg eg debian ubuntu etc apt eg debian ubuntu etc now obsolete rpm eg older redhat versions and newer ones don t kick it off for compatibility reasons yum eg

279059
dnf	yum
fedora centos dnf - dentrified yum eg.new fedora releases and so on

279059
dpkg	apt
for example in ubuntu you may see dpkg which feeds etc apt sources list

279072
zsh	subshell	subshell	dash
i tried 3 other posix-compatible shells zsh dash busybox and in all of them gave the same result as trap a subshell is run and the subshell does not show an exit trap

279072
bash	subshell
in general i ve noticed that the bash developers seem to have put some extra effort into making subshell handling work nicely

279097
vmware	virtualbox
it does work on virtualbox but not on vmware

279100
centos	linux
when i try to run the telnet service on centos linux release 7.2.1511 it throws the following error

279125
sudo	passwd
however it doesn t work sudo keeps asking for a passwd

279169
mouse	trackpad
both mouse and trackpad are unable to focus the windows click events are definitely working though

279219
sudo	passwd
well you know that if you call sudo and it asks for your passwd you can t see it when typing

279219
sudo	passwd
sudo does this by disabling echo which means that it disables the shells functionality to write on the screen until you finished writing your passwd

279219
sudo	passwd
by default sudo throws an error if thats the case and doesn t allow you to enter your passwd since someone could be looking over your shoulder

279241
cat	tee
since you only need root for the file access consider using cat tee or something similar and piping that to grep or whatever program you need to run

279242
put	get
the and lines would be what you put in your ifcg- file to get it to populate resolv.conf correctly

279255
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
it is yet present in linux mint 17.3 but was fixed in lm mate 18 here in mintmenu pressing enter after a search now launches the application placed at the top . just like in ubuntu mate 16.04 which comes with mate-menu version 5.7.1

ubuntu	linux
all linux entries seem to point at my dev sda6 partition which is ubuntu s root

279279
lvm	umount
gparted can t move the lvm to the left maybe it s because i need to umount the partition i m not sure

279300
freebsd	linux
is there any way to connect the disc directly to the freebsd box or will i need to copy data through a linux box ssh or nfs to the freebsd

279302
vmware	virtualbox
usually virtualbox vmware or other creates its own own virtual subnetwork so there could be some cases when the network protocols are not working properly for example in some cases nmap could not be working properly in such virtual networks

279327
lvm	umount
you don t need to umount anything lvm is designed for online operation

redhat	fedora
on redhat or redhat based systems like fedora you may do

279404
postgresql	mysql
sql and nosql databases oracle mysql postgresql

279408
stdout	stderr
or both stderr and stdout

279408
zsh	tcsh
the csh tcsh zsh equivalent being t csh don t support so it s the only way there

279433
stdout	stderr
remember that the only difference between file descriptors 1 stdout and 2 stderr is that the former is traditionally used for normal messages while the latter is traditionally used for debug or error outputs

279438

when there s no match depending on the version it will work like either zsh or bash -o failglob or bash -o nullglob

279473
jobs	cron
if a computer is running with the timezone set to dst the switch to and from might affect running of cron at and other scheduled jobs

279498
dnf	yum
dnf and traditionally yum would not let that happen and it would error out before it ever tried

279502
lvm	xfs
we use lvm and xfs

279511
hex	binary
the first one converts each hex line into a new binary line and puts a line break at the end of each line

279528

i need to delete a folder in my home directory

279573
debian	linux
i want to make an enterprise grade iptables firewall and was wondering if i will need to do my own kernel compilation like it says in the book or nowadays is it ok to just download the debian linux os server and plainly install iptables onto it and start configuring

debian	linux
concerning iptables vpn in linux i am using a debian also as a firewall and vpn with strongswan to secure a special network and it is not necessary to mess with kernel compilations

279759
stdout	stderr
when 7.0.56 was released they changed that entirely by making new scripts and wrappers in usr libexec tomcat to force tomcat to run in simple mode instead of forked allowing systemd to have control of the pid and stdout and stderr to go to the journal

279769
jobs	cron
all other services appear to be logging correctly and cron jobs are actually running verified with ps aux | grep rsync since i only run rsync via cron

279778
spaces	delimiter
i want to rewrite the following example so that the delimiter spaces between the arguments a b and c is replaced with tab or newline

stdout	stderr
i want to output both stderr stdout preferably in the order that they occur to a file as well as the console

279831
ubuntu	linux
the linux kernel source in ubuntu is open source so there is no problem with using parts of it just like you can use any other linux kernel source

279833
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
never mind for gnome and kde qt applications but running gnome-settings-daemon in xfce system

279835
ssd	sata
plugged in another 1tb hdd and it just so happens to be on a lower numbered sata port than the ssd so it took sdc and pushed the ssd to sdd

279884
ffmpeg	libavformat
it seems though that it s not mpv which is responsible but ffmpeg and libavformat which is supposed to decode the subtitles

279889
stdout	stderr
the problem is that sudo closes all file descriptors except for the standard ones stdin 0 stdout 1 and stderr 2

279891
put	get
there is no such thing or to put it another way all groups have â œgroup priorityâ if a file belongs to a group but not to your user and you are in that group then you get the group permissions no matter whether the group is your primary group or a supplementary group

279898
bash	zsh
use in ksh shopt -s dotglob in bash or setopt glob_dots in zsh to include them

279908
width	height
my intention was to look at the dimensions of each resulting image and divide the new width by original width and new height by original height

279921
hex	binary
07 hex is 00000111 binary

279941
sudo	passwd
so how can i make it so i don t have to enter the passwd every time i run the script like sudo

279951
sudo	passwd
the nice thing is that on most systems things are set up so that the access restricting passwd for a particular key is kept for 5 or 10 minutes so you only have to type the passwd once then can go keep on using it and on non-use it will expire much like sudo

279957
debian-based	linux
i installed linux distribution a debian-based one called pardus on hp elitebook folio 1040 g2 notebook pc and it has a spare ssd drive

279990
disk	ram
part of that storage may be in ram in the disk array backed by ssd disk backed by regular disk with spindles

279990
disk	ram
in this situation the disk that the vm sees might be only a little slower than the ram it can access

280018
folder	directory
when i ssh as user i can find the directory specified also it doesn t seem like an access problem because user owns the folder and i changed it so that anyone can write to it

280028
bash	zsh
and i use zsh now bash has the same problem

280030
csv	tsv
i need to make a frequency table in tsv csv format where the names of the rows are the name of each file and the names of the columns are the unique names found throughout the files

many preinst scripts stop services for packages which are being upgrade until their installation or upgrade is completed

280074
stdout	stderr
is to switch around stdout and stderr for filtering you can read more about this here if wanted

280153
folder	directory
as seen above my python_code directory is in root folder and i am trying to copy files from that folder to the directory input_userlocal which is inside hadoop

so i m really new to linux systems and have just downloaded ubuntu on my other desktop

280266
sudo	passwd
my question here is how can i enter into sudo domain without manually entering passwd

280268
sudo	passwd
if you don t want to enter passwd manually you use -a option of sudo

280269
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
what is the linux command to find sd card uuid on ubuntu debian

280270
imperative	declarative
i m guessing the reason for excluding this feature of every-other-package-manager-ever is that nixos is declarative rather than imperative so the process it went through to get your system from one state to another should be irrelevant

280281
sudo	passwd
passwd being your sudo passwd

280289
xfce	kde
when i had a fuller installation kde + xfce select at login i had an option in application launcher menu in system tools the name of the file manager was in the system tools menu which automatically opened home of dom0

280295
cat	tee
you can t simply do that because the tee command overwrites the file making it shorter probably and eliminating the cat command s ability to read the data that was in the file

280295
cat	tee
if you could ensure that programs such as tee opened a new file and if the shell guaranteed that cat opened its copy first then you could copy from the old actually deleted file to the new

280295
cat	tee
you might suppose for instance that cat would start first and tee later when it is needed to capture data

280295
cat	tee
but the shell starts both and unless tee is waiting for input before cat starts the writes could fail since no one is waiting and those bytes have nowhere to go

280297
cpu	processors
cpu processors suite

280305
rpm	yum
you can install rpm s directly from yum

280316
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this regression is applied on all linux flavors sharing ubuntu repository like mint or elementary os

280335
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu don t support downgrading so you might encounter further problems by applying this piece of advice

in addition the at -and batch -mechanism is run as cron-jobs on some systemd rather than by a dedicated daemons of it s own

280681

both stdout and stderr are captured and emailed to the local user account when the job completes

280686
puts	gets
g gets the contents of the hold space and puts it in the pattern space and p prints the pattern space

281096
ubuntu	debian
as terdon suggested you are trying to use an ubuntu ppa on debian

281118

you need this because cron jobs don t have a natural terminal type since they don t naturally have a terminal

281128
bash	subshell
also note that if the last command in the subshell is an external command most shells not bash though will not fork an extra process so the total number of processes run will be the same as without the subshell environment

i want to know if shell 1 is better for a job than shell 2 with a test that i handle maybe with shell 3 for example ksh dash bash or zsh

281384
octal	decimal
be aware that when adding together numbers that have leading zeros you ll end up using octal arithmetic rather than decimal

281396
dpkg	apt
you can t solve this by making it pass different options to dpkg the problem is that the conflicts make apt s own job impossible

281396

i can even launch lightdm from rescue mode and then use it with keyboard and mouse

281519
spaces	delimiter
unfortunately and despite what its documentation claims uniq doesn t only use spaces and tab as a field delimiter but pretty much any non-alphanumeric character

281540
sudo	passwd
also ssh won t prompt for a passwd if there is no controlling terminal it gets an error read_passphrase can t open dev tty no such device or address - you can start a process with no controlling tty with setsid which you should ideally do when you start jenkins rather than doing it specifically for the ssh command this will also prevent sudo from prompting for a passwd etc

281540
stdout	stderr
note that if you run a process with setsid it will automatically run in the background since the shell can t work with job control with processes in different sessions so you need to be prepared for this by redirecting its stdout stderr to a log file and stdin to dev null

sudo	passwd
sudo -s bin bash should work too and depending on how sudo is configured you ll either need to know only your own passwd or no passwd

282152

many cron jobs etc depend on root s shell being the default root shell for that os and will break if you change it

282175
subnet	packets
the -a input -s adds a rule for any packets with the source subnet specified on the line

282194
bash	zsh
bash dash ksh zsh etc use the same matching rule for case patterns as it does for pathname expansion or filename globbing so your shell is interpreting those patterns as ranges and the ranges aren t even valid

282195
sudo	passwd
the -t creates a pseudo-tty so that sudo can ask for a passwd

282195
sudo	passwd
you will get prompted for the sudo passwd user target s passwd

hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
arzyfex s answer gives you the tools to view those files in different ways but reading a file as binary works for any file on a computer as does viewing it as octal or hex or indeed ascii it just might not make sense in each of those formats

282248
single-quotes	double-quotes
it uses rather than back-ticks single-quotes around literal strings the from and to addresses and the subject string double-quotes where variable interpolation is needed and uses a heredoc for the headers rather than multiple echo lines

here is an answer to supplement stephen kitt s nice answer above for ubuntu linux 16.04

282375
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
ubuntu debian users might want to install the dkms package to ensure that the virtualbox host kernel modules vboxdrv vboxnetflt and vboxnetadp are properly updated if the linux kernel versioning changes during the next apt-get upgrade

282397
disk	ram
this previous discussion covers the difference between per-process read write amounts and the system total read write amounts they cover different stuff since the per-process amounts include all i o whether to disk to cache to network etc. whereas the system total is between ram and disk including swap delayed cache writes etc.

282414
filesystems	ntfs
find a copy of windows and use that to copy the files to a windows native filesystems that linux can also read and is case sensitive ntfs

282467
ubuntu	linux
three days ago i tried installing the second of two ubuntu linux 16.04 versions side by side on the same lenovo thinkstation desktop using the procedure described in this url

282467
ubuntu	linux
but i lost the former user linux3 from the first ubuntu linux 16.04 instance by inadvertently deleting libc.so.6 in the old first instance

282467
ubuntu	linux
i lost the user linux3 from my ubuntu linux 16.04 instances because

282467
ubuntu	linux
i can no longer login after rebooting my ubuntu linux 16.04 instance even after i selected the partition s corresponding to the old ubuntu instance in grub2 because i mistakenly sudo deleted the soft link libc.so.6 and libc-2.23.so in the subfolder lib x86_64-linux-gnu

282467
ubuntu	linux
here is the error message when rebooting the ubuntu linux 16.04 instance halts prematurely

282467
ubuntu	linux
otherwise how might i do this using my side by side ubuntu linux 16.04 instance in another partition with username siblings

282475
children	parent
what children do in their environment has no affect on their parent

282482
folder	directory
i have a directory where there are multiple folder each of folder contains a .gz file

282521
ubuntu	centos
running centos so i don t have the sweet gksudo tool the lucky dogs with ubuntu have which does the xauth magic

282578
rpm	yum
depending on what extensions you have you likely will only have the rpm file s on the disk and a yum clean all will remove them along with the repository metadata which will get regenerated on next yum operation

282614
centos	linux
i want to create a directory for instance testing-data on centos 6.5 linux version and have read write execute to all the sub-folders and sub-sub-folders and files within them to everyone all users not to any specific group

282633
bash	zsh
but bash mksh and zsh only have dynamic scoping

282662
ubuntu	linux
reboot the good ubuntu linux 14.06 instance dev sdb6

282662
ubuntu	linux
reboot the formerly corrupted ubuntu linux 14.06 instance dev sda1

282662
ubuntu	linux
now both ubuntu linux 14.06 instances are fine

282663
folder	directory
whenever i try to access one of 3-4 files in a specific directory in the home partition the specific folder causing the issues is home path to broken folder the home partition will error and remount read-only

282668
ubuntu	freebsd
i ve gone over man sudo and man sudoers on an ubuntu 16.04 machine a freebsd 10.2 machine and a fedora 23 machine and i haven t found anything useful

282682
post	get
this is a cross post from askubuntu as i think here are more people to know how to get this working

282716
redhat	fedora
update-rc.d doesn t exist on redhat distros such as fedora centos etc

282736
https	tls1.2
tls1.2 is available for apache to add tls1.2 you just need to add in your https virtual host configuration

282762
debian	centos
i ve managed to get this script working fine on a centos 6.7 machine and am now trying to get it working properly on debian 7

282763
solaris	aix
this still goes for aix and solaris which are mainly used by bigger companies and organisations

282763
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
the older unix systems like aix and solaris are still available but i wonder how long it will take before ibm and oracle think it s cheaper to run everything on linux

282763
solaris	aix
commands are very similar but there are differences just as between aix and solaris i guess

282811
fish	bash
fish s command substitution is supposed to be the equivalent of bash s yet this simple example fails

282824
udp	tcp
the solution is to remove the restriction on established and related packets for tcp so that it applies to udp too

282828
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu 14.04 and newer debian versions the -1 is supported but on older versions or needing backwards compatibility the above limitation is accurate

282836
centos	linux
on centos linux switching to zsh causes autojump to give me this error

282842
ubuntu	centos
there s a variety of guest systems including ubuntu centos windows and os x

282848
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu linux 16.10 on an ubuntu thinkstation desktop

282848
ubuntu	linux
i used a bash script just now to restart and stop mono-service on our second ubuntu linux 16.04 desktop computer in the following manner

282864
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	aix	solaris	aix
using the special - like that is reasonably portable it works with aix hpux solaris linux and freebsd

282874
ubuntu	linux
what is the reason for the following discrepancy between ubuntu linux 16.10 system monitor cpu utilization and ps pcpu cpu utilization with respect to the individual firefox browser process

282939
bash	zsh
z is a very nice plugin for bash or zsh it s included in oh my zsh which keeps track of directories you cd to and allows you to quickly switch to directories using parts of their names based on how frequently you use them

282944
freebsd	linux
it works on gnu linux and freebsd

282952
ubuntu	linux
i discovered that ubuntu linux 16.10 system monitor s cpu utilization s figure for the firefox process is very sensitive to system monitor preferences

282960
stdout	stderr
this is because terminal devices are bidirectional and in fact the terminal would be connected to both stdin and stdout and stderr

282961
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
this should work at least in bash zsh csh and tcsh

282982
folder	dir
unles there is no dir in var log folder

282988
ubuntu	linux
i would like to make the ubuntu linux 16.10 system monitor cpu utilization measurement basically agree with the ps pcpu cpu utilization for an individual firefox browser process running on a lenovo thinkstation desktop with quad cores

282988
ubuntu	linux
the ubuntu linux 16.10 system monitor preferences are currently set at

283014
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
it may depend on which distribution you are using but in fedora and therefore in most or all fedora-derived distributions including redhat enterprise linux and centos the selinux-policy-targeted package includes a postinstall script with restorecon and fixfiles commands so it should not be necessary

283021
google-chrome	safari
wow64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 50.0.2661.94 safari 537.36

283029
setsid	sigaction
some programs notably daemons will use the mechanisms above automatically a program can install an alternate sighup handler using sigaction 2 or it could choose to join a new session setsid 2

283029
udp	tcp
mosh runs over udp so there is no tcp connection that risks getting reset

283057
folder	directory
related simpler quesiton set read and write permissions to folder and all its parent directory

283066
debian	centos
i m somewhat new to centos since i m mainly a debian kind of guy so i was unaware of var log secure

283074
put	get
but if you don t put the string in a variable first you get a completely different behaviour

283096
switching	screens
they also enable multiple shell sessions over the one connection ssh to your remote machine run screens and you can create destroy and switching between as many shell windows as you like

283096
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
linux distros freebsd mac os x solaris and more

283103
sudo	passwd
it boots and everything looks fine until i get asked for sudo passwd preparing to edit etc exports

283112
rpm	dnf	rpm	yum	dnf	yum
if you got a large update particularly if the kernel systemd dnf yum rpm were updated then reboot before contuining

283126
icmp	udp
only for icmp and udp

283132
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	debian
there are some examples of restart programs written in shell script supplied in the nosh-bundles package which is available for debian ubuntu and for freebsd pc-bsd dragonflybsd c

283132
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	debian
the nosh guide is available as a debian ubuntu package and a freebsd pc-bsd dragonflybsd c

283141
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	debian
the up-to-date nosh guide is available as a debian ubuntu package and a freebsd pc-bsd dragonflybsd c

283144
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu as most other linux distributions come with chromium instead which is the open source project that chrome is based on

283144
ubuntu	debian
because chrome isn t open and re-distributable it can include some things that aren t really free but typically aren t hard to get if you want them i ve read that in ubuntu i use debian you can install

283145
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
the google website will auto-detect you re operating system here gnu linux if not click on other platform and select linux if will give you two options an rpm and a deb package as you run ubuntu you will choose the 64 bit .deb for debian ubuntu package

283147
i2c	spi
you might be lucky enough to find an spi or i2c bus exposed somewhere on your motherboard to allow you to add it but they re usually wired directly into whatever they re being used for unless you re using a dev board or single-board computer with exposed gpio and other ports such as a raspberry pi

283147
i2c	spi
you can tear down your desktop pc try and find an unused compatible bus on the motherboard somewhere most likely some unused pins on a controller ic or a way to extend an internal i2c or spi bus or something you can tear out and replace and solder a usb otg or device controller chip onto it

283154
ubuntu	linux
booting from usb via efi works fine i tried arch linux 2016.05.01 kernel 4.5.1 and ubuntu 16.04 kernel 4.4.0-21

283154
ubuntu	linux
i had to pass the kernel options noapic in the arch linux case and in the ubuntu case â otherwise the screen stays blank and the kernel doesn t boot

283181
opensuse	linux
i need to know if there is a scsi tape drive connected to my opensuse linux server

283184
arp	dhcp
in ipv4 dhcp clients are supposed to check for duplicate addresses using arp or equivalent

283187
jobs	cron
so check using ps ax if you see a lot of duplicate processes maybe check your cron jobs or anything else that might be spinning up a bunch of extra shells

283195
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to figure out if it s possible to install and run a windows 8.1 app on linux currently using ubuntu 16.04 but not opposed to installing a different distro

283200
debian	linux
i am currently running debian 8 jessie as my linux distro and have been following this link to install hhvm the first two lines i have successfully carried out however when i try to do a sudo apt-get update i get this error

283203
ubuntu	linux
wine does a fine job to run individual windows programs on linux and you can find good instructions to use it in ubuntu s official page on wine

283203
ubuntu	linux
qemu provides a good computer emulator which allows to run a separate operating system over your current linux installation and is well documented on ubuntu s official qemu documentation

283227
width	height
the procedure requests max height and width from file names to generate labels that fits

283227
width	height
to get width + height for a text as integer one way is to do

283227
width	height
one to get max height and another to get max width

283286
stdout	stderr
the bash shell launched connects to the stdout stderr stdin of the

283286
stdout	stderr
process to terminate and isn t blocked on stdout stderr stdin

283286
stdout	stderr
ssh won t connect to the stdout stderr stdin of the bash shell or any

283310
for-loop	loops
if i run php queuefile.php in the terminal i know it will run with no problems already tested the code with a finite for-loop instead of the infinite while loops

283326

283328
folder	directory
add execute permission to group and others for your home directory so that your sudo account can access through it to the target folder

283343
chown	sudo
i have to sudo chown the .xauthority file back to my user after startup its ownership gets set to root

283379
stdout	stderr
you can add additional inputs and or outputs beyond stdin 0 stdout 1 and stderr 2 to a bash environment which is sometimes more convenient than constantly switching where you are redirecting output

283394
sysv	systemd
systemd is backward compatible with sysv init scripts

283395
openbsd	linux
i am thinking of something similar to openbsd s security 8 that could be run weekly or daily via a cronjob and make a simple report of changes but tailored for linux or portable across different unix-like systems

283441
mouse	keyboard
i recently purchased a used microsoft sculpt keyboard with mouse in order to use it with linux mint 17.3

283444
folder	directory
if your webserver document root permissions were setup like this with setgid bit on directory you could work with files and folder created by the webserver and because you have shared group ownership and assuming umask of 002 the webserver could function properly with full access to files and folder that were created by you ftp ed created etc

283450
lvm	btrfs
one alternative worth considering is to create the 4tb mirror using zfs or btrfs instead of lvm

283450
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
this will give you the benefits of an error-correcting copy-on-write filesystems with compression snapshots rollbacks easy sub-volume creation soft quotas and reservations rather than the hard pre-allocation of space that lvm gives you zfs btrfs send receive for backup to another zfs btrfs pool or server and more

283450
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
btw if you re using lvm to provide lv partitions to vms rather than or as well as mounted filesystems btrfs is not an option unless you re willing to switch to qcow2 or raw or other disk-image files

283455
lte	traffic
so 40 of http s traffic will go through lte 60 through cable and everything else through cable

283455
icmp	tcp
mwan3_hook set the mark 0xff00 to the connections still not marked from the inside not icmp type 8 tcp 80 or tcp 443

283475
folder	directory
when i navigate to the root directory i can browse its files but when i click back to the home folder it s empty

283484
spoofing	traffic
worth looking at are deflecting the traffic back to the originator - not as applicable as they are spoofing your own domain

283490
next	except
a typical output always shows the pts 14 as free and all others ports like 0 1 2 and so on became free at night and are allocated again in the next day except the port 14 i cannot examine more ports that can have the same behavior of pts 14 because there are about 600 ports being using daily and the analysis stopped at the port 14

283496
bash	subshell
the bash manual page states that the commands in a pipeline are already executed in a subshell so i m led to believe that | should already suffice

283519
debian	centos
the redhat and thus centos and friends at and also debian-derived vintages as rpm -qi at on redhat indicates a debian url and also derobert in comments above should support a -m option

283522
opensuse	linux	opensuse	mint
i have been using linux mint till a few days ago when i installed opensuse leap 42.1 instead

283551
opensuse	linux
again this exact same configuration has worked in the past on the same version of linux opensuse leap 42.1 on the same machine with the same hard drive

283556
dnf	yum
if you use yum or dnf on the cli then don t need these

283560
rpm	yum
if it supports rpm install curl rpm after downloading from any rpm repositories or setup yum

283572
icmp	tcp
rule with invalid state will drop all packets with invalid headers or checksums invalid tcp flags invalid icmp messages such as a port unreachable when we did not send anything to the host and out of sequence packets which can be caused by sequence prediction or other similar attacks

283576
bash	zsh
### works in zsh but not in bash

283580
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
van smoorenburg rc from linux operating systems is a portability nightmare and mewburn rc as used nowadays on freebsd and netbsd had barely just under 6 months been brought out for netbsd and didn t exist at all on other bsds when daemontools 0.76 came out in july 2001

283580
ubuntu	linux
whereas on the other hand etc inittab is a thing of the past and on operating systems such as ubuntu linux etc rc.local has actually been superseded thrice over mdash

283580
debian	linux
gerrit pape made systemd service unit files for daemontools for the daemontools-run package that xe maintains for debian linux in 2014

283585
folder	directory
the command above adds + read r and access directory x to anyone on the file folder s awe owner s main group g

283602
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	debian
there is no easy solution to upgrade to versioning 4.6.1 of the debian ubuntu packages

283613
daemon	cron
if on a debian 7 server wheezy running in a hosted vm and an up-to-date cron daemon there is a bug so cron stopped running without obvious reason

283617
ubuntu	debian
being debian ubuntu based it s not likely that the problem is due to rpath still possible

283619
ubuntu	linux
i have an openvpn server running on a linux ubuntu box

283626
trie	tree
or is there some tree within a dir that reduces the search a trie tree alphabetical order... that would reduce dramatically the number of inodes checked like log n instead of n 2

283629
freebsd	linux
i have a bash script which i need to convert from linux to freebsd but i m obviously too stupid to read the man page in a proper way

283635
ubuntu	linux
when we start in the mono-service mode on ubuntu linux 16.04 in the background we would like to create and store a log file at wherever the user wants

283642
min	max
how does this equation gives random numbers between max and min divisible by divisibleby

283643
stdout	stderr
specifically is not interpreted by the shell to mean attach stderr to stdout because there is no shell handling your command line

283643
stdout	stderr
redirect stdout and stderr yourself

283646
filesystems	fat
an embedded system with this fat lib that makes several operations in the fat filesystems add remove file dir append to file

283659
stdout	stderr
but you will get multiple lines per pty if the process has it open for multiple roles like stdin stdout and stderr

283722
debian-based	linux
i m using latest version of debian-based linux kali

283749
bonita	camunda
i m running camunda bpm in port 8080 so i want bonita to answer in port 8081 on the same host

283751
folder	directory
for example there can be archived script called desktop wtf delete.sh but it will be extracted into folder wtf not into current directory where i currently am

283760
ubuntu	debian
personally i m running debian on systems where i would expect ubuntu lts to look after me just as well

283773
ubuntu	freebsd
i ve done this before on an ubuntu box but this is the first time i ve tried it on freebsd

283801
tunnel	vpn
now i want to set up the same rules except use interface tun0-00 and forward all my traffic through my vpn tunnel

283802
vpn	wlan
and yes you need to set up policy routing to forward your wlan traffic not to default gateway that is most likely reachable through your ethernet interface but trough vpn interface

283813
ubuntu	linux
recently i ve decided to install linux ubuntu on the machine and intended to do that on the c drive

283822
folder	directory
assuming that cmp is an adequate utility and that both folder directory 1 2 to be compared are of the same structure ie same files folder and reside within the same root path - you can try something similar to

283852
filesystems	fat
it is supposed to be a fat filesystems image

283852
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems used by ubuntu and others are probably produced

283873
udp	tcp
unhide-tcp is a forensic tool that identifies tcp udp ports that are listening but are not listed in bin netstat through brute forcing of all tcp udp ports available

283903
pull	push
explained that the app gives root access in adb shell and allows access to system files and directories through adb push pull which exactly solved my problem

283904
rpm	yum
today we installed the following rpm s via yum on redhat version 5

283904
versioning	upgrade
secondly if an rpm was upgrade then how can i downgrade it to the previous versioning

283916
dpkg	apt
dpkg error processing archive var cache apt archives nginx_1.10.0-1 jessie_i386.deb --unpack trying to overwrite etc default nginx which is also in package nginx-common 1.6.2-5+deb8u1

283928
installation	upgrade
short of upgrading your mint installation the easiest way to upgrade to java 8 is as you found out to install oracle s jdk

283985
ubuntu	debian
in debian and ubuntu derivatives it is top-bottom

284005
width	height
error while opening encoder for output stream #0 2 - maybe incorrect parameters such as bit_rate rate width or height

284069
unix	bsd

icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
icmp is its own protocol remember and not covered by tcp or udp

284104
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
you upgrade an existing mysql installation without upgrading the database schemata to what versioning 5.7 expects

284104
versioning	upgrade
harald was talking about remi collet says to downgrade to the old versioning of mysql once more dump the entire database set to file upgrade once again and restore from the dump

284133
debian	linux
i think that s the root cause of my problem but looking at the cd that came with the mobo i saw there s a directory for linux drivers that contains a file saying note please update to the latest linux kernel for motherboard chipset and components support. this is what i expect because as i understand it linux should support the hardware using generic methods without special drivers required by windows although i don t know whether debian supports an asus h170m-plus - it is a relatively new mobo..

284186
put	get
in the file net mac80211 scan.c at line 214 in function ieee80211_scan_rx i see a bssid from the bss of my ap appear when ap has power and get put via ieee80211_rx_bss_put here

284249
ubuntu	linux
in grub choose advanced options ubuntu upstart linux kernel 4.22

284280
filesystems	ntfs
if you re using ntfs-3g to mount your ntfs filesystems the windows_names option will prevent files with problematic names from being created

284282
post	get
this is a shameless post after getting mad at not being able to get this working

284312
zsh	tcsh
i want to configure zsh to emulate the tcsh behavior

284314
ubuntu	linux
my system is ubuntu 16.04 lts gnu linux 4.4.0-22-generic x86_64

284316
bash	zsh
i ve tested this on bash and zsh

284334
tar	gunzip
after unzipping for example gunzip foo.tgz the file will be foo.tar and files can be removed with tar -f foo.tar --delete file|directory

284336
stdout	stderr
note that the error messages are on stderr while the book s filename is still on stdout

284336
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
xml2 is available pre-packaged for debian ubuntu and other debian-derivatives and probably most other linux distros too

284349
sudo	passwd
if you use this though the kernel discards all privileges from a program - so you can t use it to cheat passwd or sudo for example

284349
sudo	passwd
setting it globally would be a really bad idea as it would break sudo passwd and other privileged programs

284362
ubuntu	linux
as i m trying to install this on linux ubuntu i don t have homebrew

284417
for-loop	arrays
this is my first attempt to write a bash script and i m unable to read arrays outside for-loop

284417
for-loop	arrays
print both the arrays and elements count in each arrays outside for-loop

284445
filesystems	xfs
to shrink a filesystems not possible with xfs you follow the following procedure

284447
folder	directory
i have two home folder home masi and home masi_backup and i would like to find the differences between files of the two directory

284453
dpkg	runit
the post-installation maintainer script for runit you will find unpacked on your system from the package somewhere such as var lib dpkg info runit.postinst

284458
ubuntu	mint
i am on mint 17.3 rosa based on ubuntu trusty

284461
versioning	upgrade
upgradeable if a newer versioning is available and apt-get upgrade would install it

284481
sudo	passwd
one restricted user basically no permissions and no passwd who logs in automatically to the touchscreen and one fully configured user with a complex passwd sudo permission etc

284490
bash	zsh
with bash ksh or zsh that can be abbreviated to

284498
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
to give timothy some sudo privileges you need to edit the sudoers file add this entry to permit timothy to run any command as root without re-entering his passwd

284502
folder	dir
after it created the folder it needs to create a dir for every date it can find

284557
bash	zsh
the easiest tool here would be zsh like bash only better with its fancy globbing and the zmv function

284557
debian	linux
alternatively you can use prename the perl-based rename script available on debian and arch linux might need to be installed separately on other distributions

284563
spaces	delimiter
lastly i d then construct a target filename using array expansion to print four fields from field #0 delimiter by spaces then a period then the last field

284584
config	ini
both have good .ini file parsers - i ve used perl s config ini module several times when i ve needed to parse an ini file

284588
freebsd	linux
is external fragmentation an issue in freebsd due to unmovable kernel pages similar to what linux 1 2 faces

284595

note that sometimes when tilda hide and is show again it will not show the same layout of windows you saw last time not sure how to restore it

284604
gentoo	linux
i m running this on funtoo gentoo linux

284611
daemon	cron
we ve also installed incrond inotify cron daemon and it s running smooth

284617
disk	ram
... you will need to update your bootloader s configuration file to use the lts kernel and ram disk vmlinuz-linux-lts and initramfs-linux-lts.img

284660
jobs	cron
at least with debian you will probably want some way to distinguish from noise generated by cron jobs when cron changes to a specific user for the job

284676
ubuntu	debian
i have installed debian and ubuntu and almost everything works out of the box

284696
tunnel	vpn
i need to use a vpn provider to change my country but the vpn provider gives ppp0 does not provide split tunnel and does not give a public ip

284696
tunnel	vpn
second vpn slave is required to change local ip from finland to sweden but current vpn providers give only ppp0 no dynamic ip and no split tunnel

284714
ubuntu	linux
getting rid of self-resizing windows in ubuntu linux 12.04

284767
folder	directory
this will create the directory dos and inside it another directory c in your home folder

284770
switching	screens
inside a linux terminal and as well inside any of the terminal emulators i tried konsole xterm instead of switching to the insert mode the escape sequence is printed to the screens

284785
fish	bash
it s up to the applications fish bash etc

284788
daemons	launchd
one could write a proper init script study the existing scripts to see how to do this properly that would launchd your daemons

284788
daemons	systemd
an reboot cron job could start your daemons though systemd under rhel7 does offer better management features than a fire-and-forget from cron what happens if the daemons crashes

284808
srt	subtitle
ocr the subtitle into srt format with vobsub2srt

284817
ubuntu	debian
3 not entirely related solution is for ubuntu but i couldn t find gcc-5 in ftp server of debian yet

284823
bash	subshell
the issue you were suffering is bash like most shell interpreters outside ksh put all pipeline components in a subshell so the output variable is immediately lost after being set

284854
ubuntu	linux
i remember i can customise color and position and many other things for ps1 on ubuntu like below so i m wondering how can do similar thing for linux ubuntu log

284858
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
i just had the same problem on my debian ubuntu mint machine getting it to work with an nvidia gtx-960m

284885
redhat	fedora
and do repositories for centos and fedora suit for redhat

284885
centos	linux
reason of this question is that explicit query of rhel repositories in google leads to centos and fedora repositories but as far as i know problems with binary compatibility between same applications in different linux distributions may occur

284890
next	except
i know that will escape the next character will escape all characters except for and and finally will escape all characters except for

284933
fish	zsh
other shells t csh zsh fish rc es... don t have that problem

284955
dpkg	aptitude
i looked up at var log aptitude and the various gunzipped logs as well as the various dpkg logs but neither of them are aimed at end-users

284955
dpkg	aptitude
dpkg has a much better record but looks lot more worse than aptitude logs

284957
dpkg	apt
if you limit your direct use of dpkg as much as possible then the apt history will give a good idea of what was done when.

284985
jobs	cron
i am trying to port the code over to a new server hosted somewhere else and i want to know what cron jobs are running on the old box

284988
xfce	gnome
i think i have seen the same dialog in other desktops such as gnome or xfce

285009
bash	zsh
my main interest are zsh solutions but i m curious about bash solutions as well

285011
filesystems	btrfs
what is the purpose reasoning technical-reason why my opensuse tumbleweed system has so many folders of my filesystems wrapped not sure if that s the right word as sub volumes on btrfs

285011
filesystems	btrfs
i suspect that it has something to do with the fact that btrfs can revert failed system updates using its snapshots but i don t understand why not just create a tiny non-btrfs filesystems and mount it on var

285017
filesystems	btrfs
i believe that btrfs is now the preferred filesystems if you want to allocate your whole disc or most of it to a filesystems

285017
filesystems	xfs
the xfs filesystems is chosen for home directories only if you chose to separate it from root and i believe it has to do with how often the files in home directories change but i may be smoking something

285025
centos	linux
i have a linux machine centos 7 in which i frequently ssh into from multiple devices

285031
bash	zsh
similarly you can format numbers with leading zeros using printf in bash zsh etc

285032
freebsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
according to the docs setting device to default pulseaudio will be tried if detected and will fallback to alsa linux or oss freebsd openbsd

285047
pop-up	dialog
whenever i used ssh keys to log in to various servers i used to get a gui pop-up dialog asking me for the password for my key

285047
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up dialog also had an option i could tick off to unlock the key at user login

285054
freebsd	linux
the former buyer will pay me 400 and the latter one 650 but the latter one wants full compatibility with freebsd or if push comes to shove something like slackware or arch linux and a fast and strong wifi with bluetooth since he will be doing a lot of heavy internet usage from many different locations with no access to wired ethernet like wifi in restaurants and has a mobile phone which he needs to sync through bluetooth

285085
spaces	delimiter
-a is autosplit on the delimiter in -f or white spaces by default

285098
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
after installation of centos 7 i have upgrade kernel to 4.6.x that is latest stable versioning

285149
unix	bsd
this should work on most flavours of unix bsd and linux

285183
debian	mint
here s the dead simple manual override workaround that worked for me mint debian edition with cinnamon

285190
bash	zsh
that s a special form of brace-expansion introduced by zsh and copied with limitations and variations by ksh93 and bash

285193
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
note 2 most probably this is not a bug in virtualbox because other operating systems ubuntu and linux mint boot just fine in uefi mode

285207
ubuntu	debian
the default run levels for debian ubuntu are

285216
ubuntu	linux
i modified etc fstab after i initialized it on an ubuntu linux 16.04 system running on an lenovo thinkstation desktop

285216
ubuntu	linux
after it messed up my ubuntu linux 16.04 system causing it to go into emergency reboot status endlessly

285239
ubuntu	linux
yes it is okay to modify ubuntu linux 16.04 s etc fstab after one initializes it

285252
stdout	stderr
first you redirect the stdout descriptor 1 to a process substitution-generated pipe connected to a concurrently run tee process that has as its first argument and then you redirect the stderr descriptor 2 to the same place as where descriptor 1 now points the tee pipe

285252
stdout	stderr
all future stdout and stderr output go to the tee process which writes it to and to wherever filedescriptor 1 pointed to originally probably your terminal

285268
put	get
i put a dummy script in which printed the first parameter and i always get stop in the log file

285273
sudo	passwd
this has also made it so every time i want to sudo for the first time in a while i have to enter a verification code and my passwd

285298
dedicated	dnsmasq
if you have a dedicated server and want to configure your own local dns you can with two primary programs - dnsmasq and bind

285347
filesystems	xfs
with a filesystems such as ext4 or xfs

285348
ubuntu	debian
it seems to me it s in the repos for both debian and ubuntu since jessie and trusty

285348
ubuntu	debian
note that debian ubuntu call the architecture arm64

285394
freebsd	linux
when i try to copy directories from an ext4 on linux to a zfs on freebsd via ssh rsync immediately fails without copying anything

285413
cpu	processors
if only one core in a quad code processors is used the cpu load is 25

285413
cpu	processors
since apt-get is not multi threaded it will never use more than one processors which is 25 of all the cpu resources

285419
stdout	stderr
i have a custom service and have explicitly called for all stdout stderr to be sent to syslog in the config file however only some of the output appears in both syslog and the journal they are consistent

285441
ubuntu	linux
select ubuntu with linux 4.2.0-36-generic recovery mode

285475
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu linux 16.04 on an lenovo thinkstation desktop computer

285516
spaces	delimiter
is it possible using vim to know if a spaces is being used a delimiter vs a tab

285529
disk	ram
but i have lots of space available on the hard disk in ram and via swap

285553
versioning	upgrade
for example if the newer versioning of mariadb-server depends on a newer library versioning apt upgrade won t install the new library so it ll skip the upgrade of mariadb-server

285555
cinnamon	gnome
i just finished setting up a 150 zoom under cinnamon hope this will help you too because gnome is similar to cinnamon

285555
cinnamon	gnome
then in cinnamon or gnome in your case the best thing i could do is to use autostart feature and add xrandr script with zero timeout

285564
daemon	cron
check the documentation for your cron daemon

285569
ubuntu	linux
i m pretty new to linux i m using ubuntu and want to install torch

285572
postgresql	mysql
for anything more complicated than that you may want to look into using sqlite or even mysql or postgresql rather than a flat text file

285582
stdout	stderr
note entries in hostlist.txt that do not resolve are completely discarded - they do not appear on stdout or stderr

285582
freebsd	linux
tested on linux and freebsd

285588
folder	directory
this happens for all wording after 30+ years of using the word directory i now have to deal with people using the word folder having been confused with microsoft s new-speak

285598
lwp	libwww-perl
personally i write web robots in perl with libwww-perl aka lwp

285599
bash	zsh
preferably something that is beginner-level zsh as i m used to bash but i can copy-paste stuff if needed

285623
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to compile linux kernel 3.14 on ubuntu 14.04

285624
ubuntu	linux
yesterday upon asking what steps our architect and i should do next after a sandisk usb disconnect on an ubuntu linux 16.04 operating system installed from a live cd on a lenovo thinkstation quad-core desktop i was instructed by serge meuh and julie pelletier to implement the following steps

285628
int	double
this all looks fine especially as there are no data type definitions in bash so no need to worry about int double strings etc

285630
folder	directory
as the directory file contains the list of the files within it in such cases is it possible to to recover the files inside this folder or the files are lost

285640
hash	md5
release signed with a detached signature in release.gpg contains the hash md5 sha1 sha256 of all the package indices and installer hash

285640
hash	md5
the package indices binary-amd64 contain the hash md5 and sha256 of the packages

285651
solaris	aix
i m not sure if the solaris or aix versions of awk supports regexps as field separator

285678
apache	nginx
note i think nginx access logs are the same as apache access logs

285691
freebsd	solaris
i m mostly interested ufs on freebsd solaris and ext4 - zfs would be a plus but i m not going to hold out hope

285691
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	centos	centos	solaris
i am using solaris 10 freebsd 10.3 and centos 6.7 regularly

285691
freebsd	centos
the commands here are being run on a centos 6.7 vm but have been cross referenced with freebsd

285691
freebsd	linux
if possible i m interested in gaining an understanding from a posix viewpoint and favouring freebsd over linux if that isn t possible

285693
folder	directory
the following command-line loop will copy the top-level contents of every folder named folder in your current directory into a directory named new_directory

285731
ubuntu	linux
using linux ubuntu is it possible to get the pci configuration of the actual motherboard

285774
spaces	delimiter
my text file has no delimiter to specify separator just spaces how do i cut out column 2 to output file

285775
spaces	delimiter
you can still use single spaces as your delimiter you ll just have more columns

285778
stdout	stderr
this trick is needed because dialog by default outputs to stderr not stdout

285782
spaces	delimiter
in the example data you provided a single spaces delimiter puts the data you want in field 5

285785
whiptail	ncurses
the screenshot in the question looks like whiptail a functionally-reduced program imitating dialog using newt rather than ncurses

285798
folder	directory
you cannot have a file and folder with the same name because directory are just a special kind of file

285805
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
in linux mint ubuntu i can create cronjobs for each user individually

285809
folder	directory
and i want to copy these files mentioned in list to another directory with their parent folder tree

285809
folder	directory
now i have put this text file inside a directory and i want to copy files as listed in the text file from the parent folder of the current directory of text file

285809
folder	directory
now i know cp --parents can copy the file along with it s parent directory and re-create structure if necessary but how can i change directory just by passing .. to the cp command so that it picks up file from parent folder and not look for it in current folder

285813
filesystems	btrfs
i have a btrfs filesystems that i ve scrubbed a few times and found some errors

285824
folder	directory
i created a linux user using a script .also i want the newly created user to access only certain folder in the root directory.for that i changed the permission of root directory to 0750

285833
daemon	cron
several environment variables are set up automatically by the cron 8 daemon

285841
subnet	packets
when your script spots an arp who-has or arp reply packets extract the ip address pick a random ip in the same subnet that isn t already in the arp table and try using it

285841
subnet	packets
note network switches are sometimes configured to drop packets from unknown subnet

285844
integer	unsigned
16-bit unsigned integer

285849
sudo	passwd
i went through all the set up and as a test to see if i did it all right i went to install wine that should double check the internet connection as well as make sure my sudo passwd is working

285850
sudo	passwd
if you do know the root passwd instead of using sudo you can use su -

285861
spaces	delimiter
if for some reason you don t want to use awk and insist on using cut you can use sed to convert every instance of two or more spaces into a single tab cut s default delimiter before piping into cut

285876
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have been using ubuntu linux mint for quite a while

285876
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
ain t there any utility that could be installed on debian that would make adding a printer plug play just like it works on ubuntu mint

285894
debian	linux
on some linux distributions the info docs are often separate packages on debian cpio-doc so you ll need to install them as well as an info reader such as gnu info or pinfo

285919
ecdsa	rsa
rsa or ecdsa or ed25519

285952
google-chrome	firefox
but when i use firefox or google-chrome i get for example

285952
google-chrome	firefox
i always get the wrong urls in google-chrome and firefox but not with links or curl

286007
icmp	tcp
if you use tcp reset as the rejection mechanism -j reject --reject-with tcp-reset instead of the default icmp destination unreachable it will be largely identical to the situation where nothing was even listening on that address port combination as far as the outside world is concerned

286014
ubuntu	linux
when i start an ubuntu linux 16.04 process with usr lib 4.5 mono_service.exe audiorecorder.exe it returns right way

286018
debian	linux
i tested these command on linux debian in the terminal

286022
bash	subshell
whenever i open up my bash and login into a subshell i get the following error

286044
ubuntu	linux
i just reinstalled ubuntu linux 16.04 with a livecd and ran sudo apt-get install mono-complete

286052
filesystems	btrfs
regarding the nodatacow option ohad rodeh s paper titled btrfs the linux b-tree filesystems states

286053
stdout	stderr
one question remains open with terdon s emulator how can i redirect stdin stdout and stderr to dev null

286053
stdout	stderr
the way to redirect stdout and stderr is to exec mono-service . audiorecorder.exe ine the background

286071
folder	directory
this will miss binaries stored in directory not on the path in usr libexec or in sbin and usr sbin if you re not running as root but you can add the relevant folder to the -b option

286080
ubuntu	linux
i would like to find a ubuntu linux 16.04 systen command similar to strace to find out why my c++ program servicecontroller.exe which

286082
vim	gedit	gedit	nano
you can edit the file using a gui text editor like gedit or a cli editor such as vim or nano

286104
switching	screens
the flicker comes from a switching to from the alternate normal screens in the terminal and b from clearing the display

286104
switching	screens
you can eliminate the first part by choosing a terminal description lacking the control sequences used for switching between normal alternate screens

286112
postfix	dovecot
shutdown dovecot postfix

286112
postfix	dovecot
start dovecot postfix again

286112
postfix	dovecot
i think there could be a way to suspend dovecot delivery temporarily instead of stopping dovecot postfix etc

286122
debian	linux
on debian jessie 8.4 gnu linux i am experiencing a certificate validation inconsistency between iceweasel debian s derivative of firefox and curl in relation to the url

286139
next	except
s t t substitute any character except the tab character to the next tab the first tab with nothing

286140
debian	linux
i performed the following steps to create such a situation and poke around in the system and try out various commands using bach on debian jessie with a linux 3.16 kernel

286162
switching	screens
screens commands for switching between regions are actually focus up focus down focus right and focus left

286169
ubuntu	freebsd
i have two other boxen on the same network one ubuntu 14.04 with avahi 0.6.31 and one osx 10.4 with mdnsresponder both of which can resolve the freebsd box

286172
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
for example on debian ubuntu linux mint elementary os and other dpkg apt-based distributions

286176
bash	zsh
if you don t find bash s completion mechanism fully satisfactory try zsh which has a much fancier system including the possibility to complete based on parts of words and not just a prefix or on wildcard patterns to select completions in a menu etc

286188
disk	ram
tmpfs is a memory only filesystem much like the ram disk of other operating systems

286227
bash	zsh
use bc or awk or a shell with floating point support like ksh93 zsh or yash instead of bash

286231
sudo	passwd
the usual approach is to not configure root s passwd so that it is effectively unknown and to configure a non-root administrator for the machine using sudo

286252
vmware	virtualbox
you can try to run these under wine but you ll have more success converting your w10 setup to a vm virtualbox or vmware and run the programs under ubuntu in such a virtual machine

286284
tunnel	vpn
but i m afraid that you ll need a vpn service here to achieve that because of two hope ssh tunnel in your case

286285
centos	linux
this isn t like him - is providing an httpd-devel that violates the naming convention set forth by the fedora guidelines that in turn regulates enterprise linux packaging around centos as well

286290
stdout	stderr
the 2 1 part captures the stdout ping results and the stderr no ping because no host error into a file using the tee command

286305
children	parent
this metaphor is equivalent of the parent children and grandchildren

286324
centos	linux
so i use a centos linux 7.2.1511 server where i host a couple of things amongst them a minecraft server

286341
subtract	add
i am working on a script that asks user for two numbers then asks whether user wants to add or subtract

286350
bash	zsh
but if youâ re using bash or ksh zsh or yash

286356
pull	push
this has to be a push operation rather than a pull otherwise you re just shifting the problem from preseed to somewhere else

286380
ubuntu	debian
it is for debian and ubuntu etc and probably for others too

286413
folder	directory
keep in mind that this will affect all users on the system and you would want to create this directory in all users folder to avoid errors for those users

286423
daemons	systemd	openbsd	freebsd
as part of the systemd tmux daemons discussion on reddit i ve noticed that it s only the freebsd version of daemons libc library call that ignores sighup sigaction 2 but not openbsd or glibc misc daemon.c

286440
ubuntu	debian
but i was under the impression that the service command was on the way to deprecation so i am puzzled by the differences both between init.d and service and between the current releases of debian and ubuntu

286457
stdout	stderr
so it redirects stdout and stderr into the given file overriding the noclobber check

286475
g++	gcc
sudo apt-get install g++ and you can have as many versions of gcc as you want installed at the same time

286475
g++	gcc
the default compilers for hardy sudo apt-get install g++ g++-3.3 g++-3.4 g++-4.1 where g++ is the system compiler gcc g++ version 4.2.4

286487
centos	linux
it looks like your linux distro is red hat enterprise linux-based most likely centos if it is a hosted environment

286497
ubuntu	centos
i had ubuntu in my hard disk and after installing centos 6 on it i am not able to see ubuntu in the boot menu

286501
centos	linux
centos 6 doesn t include other linux os in the boot menu

286515
hash	md5
please check you md5 hash checksum iso before burn into cd or create bootable usb

286522
mouse	keyboard
no keyboard entry or mouse cursor movement

286523
disk	ram
what makes things faster is suspend instead of hibernate cause as you probably know ram access is a lot faster than disk access

286540
debian	linux
i m streaming using obs on windows quicksync pushing 20k bitrate to 2nd pc based on linux debian jessie 8.4.0 64bit via gigabit ethernet

286571
vt100	terminator
it uses vt100 escape sequences supported by terminator and screen to find the actual screen size and does the equivalent of

286600
rpm	yum
also when rpm yum installs this pkg on a platform it was not meant for rhel 6.6 in the example above the installation should continue for the rest of the pkgs to install

286613
stdout	stderr
can be read right-to-left as a moving the file descriptor 1 stdout to 3 2 stderr to 1 and then 3 originally stdout to 2

286613
stdout	stderr
io redirection - swapping stdout and stderr advanced

286640
bash	zsh
it supports autocompletion for bash and zsh

286646
stdout	stderr
one way to make your script work as you expect is to swap stdout with stderr in your command substitution

286658
ubuntu	debian
keybinding ctrl - s is enabled by default in debian ubuntu os x bun not in raspbian

286695
stdout	stderr
as i would like to grep specific data from this debug information i redirected stderr to stdout

286696
sudoers	visudo
i look up how to change the sudoers file using a command called visudo

286701
sudoers	visudo
note that while you could edit the sudoers file using visudo in a terminal as root what you probably actually want to do is add yourself to the wheel group

286711
bash	zsh
i have recently moved to zsh from bash on osx

286711
bash	zsh
the difference between zsh and bash i m getting is that

286739
bash	zsh
this function should work both in bash and zsh in the later you can remove last

286757
ubuntu	linux
i m searching for a ubuntu or other linux distribution vm with pre-installed maven jdk code-editor etc

286770
pthreads	fork
pthreads spec of asynchronous execution does not explicitly specify one way or another as far as i can see and section 2.1 certainly implies that expansion is a distinct operation and prior to actual fork exec of the command but testing by adonis replicated by me using bash 4.3.42 1 shows that bash takes the most efficient way if the wildcard expansion takes time then modifications executed by the following command can well influence that expansion

286787
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu the words file is provided by the wordlist package or its provider packages wbritish wamerican etc

286798
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
the unix systems aix hpux solaris make these features optional as do elvis and vim based on the settings exrc and modeline

286812
min	max
these lines use grep s -l option to output a list of files containing the wanted pattern max milan or min and the -z option to use nuls to separate the filenames so that it is safe to use with filenames with any valid characters

286826
dnf	yum
consider this simple function i am trying to add in my .aliases dnf is fedoras newest replacement of yum

286826
bash	zsh
it works well on bash but i get the following problem on zsh

286837
debian	linux
the device i have been using is a20-olinuxino lime board with debian gnu linux 7.6 wheezy image booted from nand

286855
sudo	passwd
the problem arises when sudo prompts for passwd and then nothing will happen actually

286863
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
for example on debian ubuntu linux gflags can be installed using the following command

286870
ubuntu	centos
i had centos installed in my system and after installing ubuntu the boot loader grub2 doesn t display centos entry

286870
ubuntu	centos
i tried sudo update-grub in ubuntu terminal but it doesn t show centos image

286870
ubuntu	centos
how should i add centos manually in the grub2 of ubuntu

286873
ubuntu	centos
boot repair is your tool unless you installed ubuntu to the same partition and overwrote centos

286881
bash	zsh
when i start a shell in my case bash and or zsh what lines do i need to add to .zshrc and or .bashrc to check to see if a program is already running and if the program is not already running start it

286908
stdout	stderr
or other numbers probably 1 for stdout 2 for stderr and 3 or more for syslog as it is implemented by opening a socket with connect and writing to it

286912
udp	tcp
to show udp ports as well as tcp ports omit the t switch netstat -pln ss -pln

286913
vimeo	flickr	youtube	vimeo
formats suitable for youtube flickr vimeo metacafe ipod xbox and

286913
youtube	vimeo
upload videos youtube and vimeo supported

286929
stdout	stderr
output the data to stdout and headers along with other verbose info goes to stderr

286932
xfs	btrfs
that s only supported on xfs btrfs ext4 and tmpfs

286935
debian	linux
follow these steps to install the virtualbox guest additions on your linux debian virtual machine

286939
folder	directory
for some context currently i am opening a directory in a python script and trying to execute a terminal command to get the paths to the files within the folder

286955
versioning	upgrade
one of the consequences is that you will be upgrade to new versioning of the backports that are already installed if when they become available

286958
stdout	stderr
redirecting stderr to file and duplicating stdout to both file and terminal is easy

286958
stdout	stderr
but what about redirecting stdout to file and duplicating stderr to both terminal and file

286958
stdout	stderr
is there a tee equivalent that will duplicate stderr instead of stdout

287010
perl	tcl
perl uses the notation tcl uses 1 if you use capturing parentheses

287021
jobs	cron
i am working on setting up cron jobs and i am new to this

287026
binutils	glibc
the complete list of dependencies for coreutils is bash binutils coreutils diffutils gcc gettext glibc grep make perl an sed

287050
unix	aix
old school unix systems aix hp-ux have no gawk

287051
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	aix	unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
there s one on linux a more restricted one on embedded linux one with completely different options on freebsd and osx and none on most other unix variants such as solaris aix and hp-ux

287078
unix	bsd
this is as you said a direct result of early unix bsd technically standards

287080
bash	zsh
again however the main use of those in terminals uses the variant ending with 007 ascii bel for xterm-style titles often used in bash zsh prompt-strings

287089
freebsd	linux
btw when you install bash on freebsd it prompts you to add the following to etc fstab not needed on linux because it s handled by udev instead

287106
tar	gunzip
though modern tar implementations know how to invoke unxz gunzip bzip2 by themselves so

287118
cpu	hyperthreading
if i have two physical cores and hyperthreading enabled is the cpu load computed against two cores or fours

287145
ubuntu	debian
what is the role of the var lib dpkg available file in ubuntu and debian machines

287152
ubuntu	debian
var lib dpkg available is the list of available packages in dpkg-based systems such as debian and ubuntu

287153
dpkg	apt
beyond the obvious a list of currently-available package versions used by the debian installers such as dselect dpkg and apt not much

287156
vim	emacs
or to break it down create a file and add the contents to the file using a text editor vim emacs or nano perhaps

287185
udp	tcp
trying to open the least amount of ports and restrict the open ports as much as possible anywhere in the stack by tcp udp source dest port....

287188
vlan	packets
for example i would like to avoid something like double nat for ping packets entering and leaving backup vlan

287193
sudo	passwd
is there a way to move the directory without using sudo i don t know the root s passwd but i know the other user s passwd

287206
sudo	passwd
sudo takes 20 seconds to start it doing something for 20 seconds then asks passwd

287224
width	height
the important part here is the width 480 and height 272 pixels

287269
openssl	gnutls
the values depend on whether your lftp was compiled using openssl or gnutls

287281
umask	chmod
chmod 1 obviously specifies the mode depending on its parameters and it ignores umask when who is specified or the mode is fully specified so chmod o+x ignores umask as does chmod 777 but chmod +w applies umask

287282
ubuntu	linux
alpine linux relatively new and little known distribution with strong emphasis on security is getting more popular - docker is moving its official images from ubuntu to alpine uses the openrc init system

287282
sysv	systemd
the linoxide team has created a systemd vs sysv init linux cheatsheet

287308
minix	linux
in any sense linux is based on unix the same should apply to minix

287324
wan	lan
since the box is the endpoint i assume i do not need internal addresses like 192.168.0.1 because there is no lan so my box s ip can just be the public facing wan ip address

287350
ubuntu	linux
i m running arch linux most of the help online seems ubuntu specific

287366
daemons	systemd
that s an nss module for sssd - systemd security services daemons which manages access to various remote authentication services

287444
bash	zsh
the structure is invalid in dash bash ksh and zsh

287444
bash	zsh
in the code added in the edit the dots are not valid in a variable name neither in dash bash or zsh and under very specific conditions in ksh

287448
gentoo	linux
example some files in usr or var will be copied over to ram during the boot process unless the livecd implemented an overlay filesystem like aufs or overlayfs with the former being used in the gentoo linux livecd which doesn t required copying directories from its squashfs image

287457
debian	mint
i have added the mint repository to a debian installation to have access to specific packages

287462
versioning	upgrade
as a bare minimum you should set up apt pinning to give that repo a low priority else you run the risk of random packages being upgrade to the versioning from that repo and that might break stuff

287482
folder	directory
i then opened my source folder that i created under my home directory -

287488
dnf	yum
for fedora 22 just replace yum localinstall with dnf install

287497

287511
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to install root v5.34 on linux ubuntu v12.04

287553
stdout	stderr
if you use the option -f the file is written after each write to stdout stderr

287589
freebsd	linux
i am not sure if freebsd s mailx program has this option i did not see it in their man page but on the gnu linux version of mailx you use -r

287592
gentoo	centos
i just tried it on gentoo and centos without any problem

287605
ubuntu	linux
using ubuntu linux 16.04 and g++ i was wondering if could obtain microsecond or millisecond granularity when i calculate the number of nanoseconds between unix epoch or windows epoch and an arbitrary datetime

287611
debian	linux
since kali linux is based on debian these instructions from this page should help

287668
centos	linux
i m running centos 7 but hoping there is a general linux way of doing this

287679
openbsd	centos
after verifying the centos install i then started an openbsd install on the same machine using the same usb stick as on the first openbsd install but on the second install it skipped the question on expecting to run x window system and went directly to the question on if i want the x window system to be started by xdm

287694
bash	zsh
i don t know of any way to archieve that the command is completely send to a script but in bash or in zsh you can add a hook usign the debug trap which is called before each command

287709
sudo	passwd
i want to be able to run the pm-suspend and pacman without sudo to ask me for a passwd for all users in the group sudo

287713
put	get
if i remove out_dir and put anything example test.mkv then the files get written out correctly but in the wrong location

287721
freebsd	linux
top does cpu and on freebsd at least it will also do disk i o if you pass it -m io i assume that there s an equivalent of some kind on linux but i don t remember it off the top of my head

287724
debian	linux
my current kernel version is 3.16.0-4-amd64 over a debian linux 8 o.s

how to clean stdout stderr color output

287779
debian	linux
if i am running an unsupported version of linux which is based on debian is there any way that i can still get the updates from debian systems as they are released

287791
ati	nvidia
unfortunately this wont work since the list will also contain information of packages i dont want to re- install kernel images which are already installed or driver for a nvidia card but target machine has a ati

287795
daemons	systemd
a service script fits into the way the other services on the systemd are designed providing a more less standard way of controlling the daemons

287816
voip	sip
this is a sip voip probe and nothing to do with smtp or email

287824
filesystems	fat
a basic check could be implemented on most filesystems using the dirty bit though on it s own that s not strong enough as fat filesystems mounted by current linux os s will tend to stay dirty once they ve been marked dirty due to a power failure

287832
sudoers	passwd
if you want to run apt-get as a normal user you will need to add a line to your etc sudoers file to allow you to execute specific commands with no passwd

287844
disk	ram
in chrome os since there is no initial ram disk the mapping and the root digest are provided on the kernel command line with the dm parameter

287844
disk	ram
on android i don t know if the dm-verity information is included in the boot parameters i suspect not but i know that a public key stored in the initial ram disk is used to verify the root digest of the system partition

287861
folder	directory
directory and the number of files and folder inside of it to the

287877
ubuntu	centos

287898
put	get
i m trying to automate a deb package builder for a git repository as part of which i want to get a bunch of commit comments since the last package release and put them into multiple comments in debian changelog for the new release

287938
folder	directory
above command will give your account ownership over the folder subdir if there s more directory owned by root under subdir you can check with ls -rl home manuel subdir you could add the recursive option -r to the earlier chown command like this chown -r manuel manuel home manuel subdir

287952
sysv	systemd
on debian-based systemd you ll find the sysv style banner in the sysvbanner package and the bsd-style one called printerbanner there in the bsdmainutils package

287952

288027
debian	linux
what are the differences between debian linux kernel and linux-libre in terms of freedom related issues

288027
debian	linux
i know the debian linux kernel can load non-free modules while in linux-libre they have been blacklisted

288037
xmonad	xmobar
i m experiencing a strange behaviour of xmobar right after i enter xmonad

288037
xmonad	xmobar
when i xmonad from .xinitrc i use xdm my xmobar appears but it is not either at the top or bottom of the window stack

288037
xmonad	xmobar	hide	show
after that mod + b works correctly for the remainder of the xmonad session it lowers raises hide show the xmobar

288037
xmonad	xmobar
i believe that i have misconfigured xmonad in some way not xmobar but that is just a guess

288052
installation	upgrade
note that update cds dvds are not meant to boot they just contain the packages needed to upgrade an existing installation

288053
debian	linux
according to debian guidelines less of the linux kernel code is considered not free software

288069
post	get
i have looked at previous post but cannot get this working

288082
for-loop	arrays
what i would like to do is use a for-loop to build up an arrays of substitutions and pass that arrays to tee something like this

288153
portrait	landscape
the most left monitor is portrait where the remaining screens are landscape

288153
portrait	landscape
dp1-1 is oriented landscape instead of portrait

288167
debian	linux
linux debian jessie 4.4 ti-variant

288174
debian	linux
both kernels are free software even as far as the free software foundation is concerned â the fsf considers the debian gnu linux distribution to be free software as long as no repositories are used beyond the main one

288185
width	height
will output the width a space then the height

288198
bash	zsh
i don t understand why zsh and bash ls show me lots of filename inside apostrophes but not all

288200
ubuntu	linux
this is in ubuntu linux running a bash script and the window is opened using gnome

288211
versioning	upgrade
to 23 there is an easy path to upgrade to the next versioning or so they say

288213
bash	zsh
you can use exec -a as found in bash ksh93 zsh mksh yash but not posix yet that is used to specify an to a command being executed

288230
unix	aix
is there a possibility to compress the contents of a directory in unix especially aix on the fly while still being able to read and write in the directory

288237
daemons	systemd
since this is a recently installed debian stable machine i think it s a systemd issue as i believe the standard login daemons is replaced by systemd-logind or similar cruft

288238
post	get
what i m trying to figure out and the reason for my post is how to stick that drbd master slave pair under the vminit group so that the xen virtual machines only get started on the primary drbd host

288241
dpkg	apt
since apt-get calls dpkg also apt-get apt actions get logged

288244
filesystems	btrfs
if you can choose the filesystems of the system then just use btrfs filesystems and enable compression for the required directories by using chattr

288260
width	height
resizing windows to a particular width and height instantly

288277
solaris	sunos
i m working on a sunos 5.11 solaris 11.3 machine

it looks like this is an incompatibility between hfs+ and linux as far as how the filesystems handle these special characters

288289
filesystems	hfs+
re file name encoding bug on hfs+ filesystems on linux

288336
ubuntu	linux
i have had archlinux for quite a while dual-booted alongside my windows 7 bootmenu is grub i would like to replace arch with ubuntu for now due to starting to develop games on linux but i have no idea on how to uninstall arch

zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
bash at t ksh yash tcsh and zsh give the expected results mksh and dash don t

288341
fish	zsh
with zsh pdksh and its derivative and fish s expansion doesn t include

288341
fish	zsh
except in fish t csh or zsh if any of the globbing patterns don t match anything ls will produce an error message

288341
bash	zsh
you can avoid this either by setting the nullglob option in bash or zsh at least or by redirecting stderr to dev null

288341
fish	bash
fish behaves like bash with nomatch except that when interactive a warning message will be issued for each glob that has no match

288346
dpkg	apt
if i download a debian .deb package because it is not available through apt i will usually try to install it using the command sudo dpkg -i package.deb

288358
gnu	groff
most of these simply hardcode their behavior such as gnu grep groff and the links links2 elinks textual web browsers while a few have what amounts to their own terminal database such as gnu ls but using different rules and behavior

288364
debian	linux
yesterday i connected to my developer vm debian linux via ssh

288370
ubuntu	linux
can i save files onto the usb without damaging the ubuntu installation or can t i use it for anything else than booting linux

288370
ubuntu	linux
and are the files even kept the next time i boot linux and are they accessible from within ubuntu

288371
titlebar	window
the appearance of the titlebar is controlled by the window manager

288377
hash	md5
i have checked an md5 hash between them

288418
udp	tcp
just checked the sources of bash 4.2 the proxy support for dev tcp and dev udp is not implemented

288425
daemons	systemd
rsyslogd is the rsyslog daemons an open source implementation of syslog and has replaced syslogd in newer systemd

288428
traceroute	packets
as the title suggests i d like to learn why traceroute sends three packets per hop by default

288431
debian	linux
i have a debian linux server with nginx configured for several sites etc nginx sites-enabled every site showing on its own domain

288435
ubuntu	centos
all the machines are running ubuntu 14.04 except for one that is running centos 7

288438
gentoo	ubuntu
to check this i installed figlet version 2.2.5 on ubuntu and compile the same version with emerge in gentoo

288438
gentoo	ubuntu
the little difference is really probably due to gcc version in ubuntu 4.8.4 in gentoo 4.9.3

288456
vim	emacs
something similar would be how emacs and vim have plugins that can extend their functionality

288466
versioning	upgrade
lts means that the packages will get minor upgrade to fix bugs and security problems when the standard support for the versioning has stopped

288498
chown	chmod
do ls -ld media user1 7f62b5e4-4fe7-43c2-b0d0-8dad6e5a2381 archive to see their current values and correct them accordingly with chmod and chown

288502
spaces	delimiter
-d at cut specifies delimiter which is a spaces in your case

288504
ubuntu	mint
i ve been going between windows mint and ubuntu on separate computers for about a month now and now i want to make my main computer xubuntu

288516
folder	directory
this time it said some lib file wasn t found so i opened each folder from the jdk folder i downloaded and copied all the files and not the folder from each folder onto the usr bin directory

288517
ssl	https
output ssl handshake error in https

288535
jobs	cron
if ever some output is generated because the script i m calling doesn t exist an email is sent to the default mail configured for cron jobs

288564
filesystems	fat
next step go to the menu select partition then new choose the needed filesystems ext4 fat 32... prees add and apply

288565
kde	gnome
this is done so that you get to read pdf files in evince on gnome and okular on kde

288580
stdout	stderr
newer ssh seem to bring back stdout and stderr from the remote host as two distinct streams

288580
stdout	stderr
to create a filter that combines both stdout and stderr you could do

288593
udp	tcp
i ve opened 80 443 53 tcp and udp and the ports for outlook

288598
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
xml2 is packaged for debian and ubuntu and probably other linux distros

288600
stdout	stderr
optionally redirect stdout and stderr to dev null

288614
hash	md5
with that you can easily generate stronger hash like md5 and sha-x

288626
debian	linux
debian 6.0 squeeze with linux kernel # uname -r 3.2.0-0.bpo.4-486

288662
folder	directory
so how would you use regex to check if a particular directory has any folder starting with a specific word

288670
mouse	keyboard
after some testing i found that my mouse and keyboard are recognized through the docking station however for some reason the dvi s are not

288670
ubuntu	debian
looking at the result of lsusb i noticed that displaylink maybe the manufacturer and driver so i did some googling and found that they support ubuntu but not debian

288684
sorting	grouping
then you could output each grouping of 3 lines as a single line starting with the total for sorting and put a line separator ex | so that you can split them up easily after the sort

288702
ubuntu	debian
os ubuntu 16.04 and debian 8.5

288704
bash	zsh
if you re using bash zsh or any posix shell then

288715
ubuntu	debian
the solution works with only a single package in debian while ubuntu requires also the second package

288720
centos	linux
for centos redhat entrprise linux 7

288720
centos	linux
for centos redhat entrprise linux 6

288721
centos	linux
i m relatively new to linux centos 7.2

288742
ubuntu	debian
i m using the default ubuntu and debian templates to create the containers and their networking is set up so as to use dhcp to ask for a ip from the the router

288753
hide	show
mozo can show hide and rename applications

288753
hide	show
alacarte show hide and rename edits are available in alacarte but are not applied to the main menu nor applied within alacarte s list of menu applications

288764
ubuntu	centos
remove unneeded timezone parameters such as default_time_zone from etc my.cnf this one for centos or etc mysql my.cnf for ubuntu based os

288792
ubuntu	debian
systems ubuntu 16.04 and debian 8.25

288798
init.d	pid
therefore if i do etc init.d flask-daemon stop it only kills the process which is related with the pid that was considered to be written into the file

288823
centos	linux
the python that ships with centos 7 comes in an rpm under normal situations it is best to leave that version installed and install a different newer version of python in a separate location otherwise strange issues can occur when system level applications that use python are run not all the time but it might be best since you are new to linux to avoid those issues

288824
versioning	upgrade
the obvious solution if you can t upgrade to a newer versioning of awk is to close the files after we use them

288832
ubuntu	linux
this is in ubuntu linux would like it to work smoothly for a bash script and they are gui windows

288859
bash	zsh
since most of us use bourne-like shells bash or zsh this is often preferable to which

288865
filesystems	fat
and it returns filesystems boot is not a fat efi system partition esp filesystems

288886
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
im trying double loops using arrays values like arrays names for-loop

288892
filesystems	xfs
for ext3 4 reiserfs and xfs filesystems respectively use

288895
unix	solaris	sysv	systemd
there is no connection between sysv and ips outside the fact solaris is derived from the systemd v release 4.0 unix branch but solaris 11 deprecated the systemd v packaging commands pkgadd pkgrm pkginfo ... to the new ips ones pkg install pkg uninstall pkg list pkg info ...

288934
bash	zsh
why does this fail with bash and work with zsh

288939
bash	zsh
when it comes to arrays mksh yash and zsh join on the first character of bash and ksh93 on space

288975
jobs	cron
i see that a number of people use the -v option in their cron jobs

288977
jobs	cron
usually cron sends the output of the jobs it runs to the relevant user

288977
jobs	cron
you can also redirect individual cron jobs output using shell redirection so would log standard output to somelog.log and standard error to errorlog.log you can of course add paths

288999
bash	zsh
in bash and ksh88 mksh yash dash zsh the local variable scoping is dynamic

289005
ubuntu	linux
trying to get kali linux rolling 2016.1 installed on an out-of-the-box brand new dell xps 13 developer edition meaning it came with ubuntu 14.04 lts installed on it

289005
ubuntu	debian
i ll try debian next if the ubuntu install doesn t crash and burn horribly

289005
ubuntu	debian
i m now convinced it s an issue with the drive path used in the kali and ubuntu and probably debian while we re at it installers instead of a physical issue

289009
apache	nginx
the second thing would be to install a reverse proxy using apache or nginx or something to forward requests for those hosts to the right service

289011
sudo	passwd
if you can sudo to root with no passwd this will not ask for a passwd at all since su - as root changes users without asking for a passwd

289011
sudo	passwd
asks sudo to switch to kshitiz directly which requires its own configuration if you don t want it to ask for a passwd

289028
xfce	gnome
after installing xfce to replace default gnome i now want to install the xfce-goodies package

289055
switching	screens
the and are escape sequences which tell xterm to optionally switching to and from the alternate screens

289055
switching	screens
entries used to switching between alternate screens on startup of

289086
folder	directory
when i touch a file or create a folder in that directory they inherit the correct perms and ownership

289093
dpkg	apt
when i run dpkg --configure install-info like apt seemingly does and fails i get just the same output

289105

after i sudo apt-get install mono-devel when i try to purge mono-devel on ubuntu linux 16.04 i get the following error message

289149
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	centos	debian	mint	centos	mint
how to determine which package contains the header file depends on the distribution for example dpkg -s usr include glib-2.0 glib.h on debian ubuntu mint â rpm -qf usr include glib-2.0 glib.h on rhel centos fedora â etc

289167
bash	zsh
i just switched from bash to zsh on my arch linux install and want to change my keybinding so that ctrl + arrow skips a word forward backward

289169
width	height
in this example the lines with width and height are the size in pixels

289178
disk	ram
i know about hardware which consists of cpu ram hard disk and so on

289183
sudo	passwd
on the other hand in os x bsd and linux we can easily become super user by issuing the appropriate command and sudo passwd in terminal

289196
solaris	aix
that was from testing hpux 11.11 11.23 and 11.31 other systems such as aix and solaris also have quirks like this

289211
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately the gui programs this problem normally affects google-chrome and firefox do not do a good job of leaving error messages behind

289221
openssl	botan	openssl	cryptlib	openssl	crypto++	botan	cryptlib	crypto++	botan	crypto++	cryptlib
the software includes botan cryptlib crypto++ and openssl

289225
config	ini
ps i ve already considered ini files but it s one dimensional i m more interested in the hierarchical nature of sysctl config

289235
debian	linux	solaris	bsd
but the scripts usually run on linux bsd and solaris and i m seeing it on debian 8 too

actually if you don t need to boot from the disk i d recommend not using a partitioning scheme at all and simply adding the whole disk to mdadm lvm or a zpool depending on whether you use lvm on top of mdadm or not or zfs

if the new versioning of gtk+ is backwards-compatible then the package name won t change but bugs excepted the runtime library will still allow mypackage to work â so installing theirprogram will force the gtk+ upgrade but mypackage shouldn t be affected

versioning	upgrade
or worse you find libsomething and upgrade it too but now your editor is broken because it needed the old versioning of libsomething

289744
versioning	upgrade
the dpkg-statoverride command is useful in this instance because it directs the package manager to use those ownership mode values for that file even if it gets replaced by a newer versioning via apt upgrade

you may be better off setting the root passwd to something unknown thus forcing people to always login as a non-root user and then using sudo to switch to root for those authorised to become root

289846
daemon	cron
the cron daemon takes crontabs from several files

289846
daemon	cron
the crontabs of individual users usually in var spool cron crontabs are not re-read automatically by the cron daemon

289846
daemon	cron
you should either edit them by using command crontab -e or restart the cron daemon after each change

289846

so in your case i suggest you first restart the cron daemon

289889
bash	zsh
i love the zsh autocompletion for navigating in files with commands like cd but some commands have weird autocompletion for example when i type snap ins bash autocompletes that to snap install but zsh cycles between snap desktop snap music and snap snap and then back to snap ins

289889
bash	zsh
other commands like apt ins complete to apt install just fine both in zsh and bash

is there any way that i can change the zsh autocompletion for commands to be more like bash

standard c programs and sometimes other programs using c stdio by default use line-buffering when stdout is an interactive device as defined by the implementation but full-buffering otherwise and pipe is usually not defined as interactive

instead you should use yum localinstall per section 13 of the yum and rpm tricks page of the centos wiki

stdout	stderr
commands started in a shell session will have stdout and stderr standard output and error connected to that session

290103

you re starting thunderbird manually by typing not by clicking an icon in a graphical user interface so its messages to stdout and stderr will arrive in your current shell session regardless of what you re currently doing

however when i try to install that rpm on a different system after enabling python 2.7 scl enable python27 bash then yum localinstall myrpm.rpm i receive an error stating

290232
stdout	stderr
from the character of the wine s output i conclude that it is some kind of error message therefore probably is redirected to stderr not stdout

290232
stdout	stderr
to overcome the problem you need to redirect wine s stderr to stdout by adding in front of the pipe |

udp	tcp
nc is the network cat program connecting unix pipe i o to tcp and udp sockets

290326
disk	ram
swap space is entirely unrelated to that task it is used to increase the virtual memory available to a system the kernel will swap out pages to a swap device when it needs more memory for something else - and of course using a fast disk like an ssd or a compresssed ram swap device like zram is better than using a slow disk

290326
disk	ram
btw linux already uses all available ram to cache disk - and automatically release ram from the cache when it is needed by a program

chown	sudo
you may change the ownership of these files and directories with chown masi masi masi masi should be replaced with your username and your default group name see your other files but you need to be root to do it so use sudo chown .

printf	strlen
printf host + strlen host s. d win- w_number

290942
sysv	systemd
this will augment the service description autogenerated by the sysv init compatibility layer of systemd as explained in man systemd.unit

290945
stdout	stderr
this is occurring because the output for v3.3.6 was going to stderr not stdout

290945
stdout	stderr
apparently prior to v3.4.0 the output from python --version is sent to stderr whereas in v3.4.0 and later this output is sent to stdout

290945
stdout	stderr
redirection of both stdout and stderr to the output file works just fine

290957
torque	slurm
as well as the batch queuing software like slurm or torque pbs mentioned by alexander batischev you probably also need mpi libraries or similar installed

290957
torque	slurm
alexander mentions that clusters work best with non-interactive software....that s true but for many apps there are graphical front-ends for creating viewing and editing the data creating and submitting the batch job files to the cluster using slurm or torque etc and viewing the results

290957
disk	ram
the batch script can specify all sorts of things to let the batch scheduler know what to do with it - how much ram or disk space it needs how many cpus or cpu cores and or what kind does it require 1 or more gpu nodes

in vim one can combine the following commands set smartcase + set ignorecase to make searching case-insensitive unless there is a capitalized letter in the search query in which case it is case-sensitive

291169
switching	screens	kde	gnome
interestingly enough not only does that menu show plasma and gnome it also shows gnome classic - something that obviously was already installed prior to groupinstalling kde that and kdm are the only two things manually installed on this system so far but wasn t selectable from the gdm login screens at all - so in the default fedora 23 workstation image gnome classic is installed but inaccessible until you switching login screens

291242
filesystems	ntfs
after unmounting the filesystems fsck identified it as ntfs

291242
filesystems	ntfs
my recommendation is to replace the ntfs filesystems with something native to a linux-based system such as ext4

291252
sudoers	visudo
and for the 2 i edited the etc sudoers file with the usr sbin visudo command and appended the following line

291467
sudoers	passwd
the result is the same as if you had logged in as root or executed the su command except that you don t need to know the root passwd but you do need to be in the sudoers file

291467
sudoers	passwd
in fact in organizations where someone else administers your computer for you it s quite common to not know the root passwd of your own computer â as long as you re in the sudoers file it doesn t matter

291473
filesystems	btrfs
the btrfs filesystems is not fully documented user-side with explanation of the output from its tools the wiki even says for now most of the information exists in people s heads.

291509
disk	ram
even then it s possible to have a useable system without such drivers if you have everything you need on an initial ram disk

291509
disk	ram
the bootloader is responsible for loading both the kernel binary and initial ram disk and then the bootloader tells the kernel where the initial ram disk is when it launches the kernel.

291509
disk	ram
of course if you run the kernel + initial ram disk on a different system some of the devices will not work and if your hard disk controller was one of them you won t be able to boot successfully

291509
disk	ram
the responsible executables and support files can be on the initial ram disk

291525
mouse	keyboard
i removed xorg conf.d directory and started x from the previous kernel and now i can get to the login screen but i cant use either my keyboard nor my mouse

291525

i m guessing it says that it cant find the appropriate drivers for keyboard mouse wifi ...etc

291525

pound is doing the http to https redirect and ssl encryption and then forwarding on to haproxy which has a rule set up for each site to forward to one of the backend servers running tomcat

291636
ssl	https
i m at a point where i ve got nginx running in a dev environment doing the https redirect and ssl and i have a couple of rules setup to proxy to a backend

291644
packets	multicast
the router don t seem to forward the multicast packets

291665
centos	linux
i m currently using a centos linux release 7.2.1511 core operating system on a dell machine

291717
redhat	fedora
it s tailored for fedora redhat users

291764
hide	show
currently i just open a terminal resize it so show only the resource bars an top info select always on top always on visible workspace and hide the menu bar

291784
fish	bash
i like fish shell but for some task it is handy to have bash like for virtualenvwrapper

291784
fish	bash
but i would like to have one that opens with fish and one with bash

291797
fish	bash
if your default shell is bash just have one pane run fish

291800
punctuation	words
or write your own that concatenates 4+ random 5+ letter words to get an easy to remember password at least 20 characters long - capitalise some words and insert random 1-3 digit numbers and or a punctuation symbol between each words to make the password even longer and increase the brute-force search space

291826
dpkg	apt
i am trying to do that to write a front-end to apt dpkg

291846
ubuntu	centos
this command is part of the package intel-gpu-tools apt-get install intel-gpu-tools under ubuntu and by the look of it the package under redhat centos is called exactly the same

291889
spaces	linefeed
you can replace the linefeed character with a spaces using the tr command

291937
daemons	systemd
but it s a bit odd that the daemons and systemd service files don t attempt to create the directories or print any error messages about it

291967
dnf	yum
if you re from the future fedora 23+ where yum is getting replaced with dnf you might find this bash script useful

291999
switching	screens
how can i get the login screens session icon to work so that i can switching to mate

292006
spaces	delimiter
the paste command joins the lines with a spaces character as delimiter

292009
ubuntu	debian
to install under debian ubuntu you should be able to use it will install many python packages in the process

292016
ubuntu	linux
i am wondering how to start up multiple n 8 mod-mono-server4 linux processes at ubuntu 16.04 reboot time

292017
bluetooth	usb	ethernet	wireless
in this particular case it happens to be just under the capacity of a 100mb ethernet wired link just faster than a vdsl download internet uplink slightly quicker than a 802.11 a g wireless link and somewhere in-between bluetooth v3.0 slower and usb 2.0 faster

292027
ubuntu	mint
mainly mint and ubuntu for now but availability of packages are quite important

292041
biopython	bioperl
they will point you to existing tools for doing this sort of thing or knowing bioinformaticians give you some quirky bioperl biopython script that will probably work more often than not

292067
spaces	delimiter
you got line numbers for each non-empty line by default preceeded by some spaces for padding and delimiter from the original line by a tab character

292067
put	get
as far as i know you can t get nl to put the line numbers to the right of the line but that s not a problem because we have a solution that will swap two columns of input

292069
bash	zsh
there are many other existing questions about this for bash but i haven t found anything explaining how to achieve this with zsh

292107
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu you can use an analogous apt-file search command

292107
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu debian the llvm project maintains an llvm apt repostiory

292131
folder	directory
i did a terrible mistake and deleted two folder from the usr lib directory on my debian

292131
dpkg	apt
so how can i completely remove a packages with all dependencies via dpkg or apt to solve the described situation from above

292146
bash	tcsh
this is on ubuntu 16.04 with bash 4.3.42 and tcsh 6.19

292146
stdout	stderr
if a open a virtual console not being used by x and run bash i see stdin stdout stderr and a dedicated file descriptor for the tty apparently

292149
dpkg	apt
if apt is borked sometimes it s possible to set things right manually with dpkg and the full path of the local cached package

292156
stdout	stderr
this is almost certainly something in your tcsh configuration .login .cshrc - look for anything that redirects stdin stdout stderr

292176
daemons	systemd
when troubleshooting problems with daemons you should always check the systemd logs

292184
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i noticed that ubuntu comes with emacs 24.5 and i m willing to install that operating system since i ve only been using linux mint for a day

292187
unix	bsd
that feature is part of a larger group of features called job control which was introduced in bsd unix as part of the c shell then later cloned in the korn shell which in turn was forked to become the posix shell

292189
bluetooth	usb
the bluetooth receiver i use is a usb dongle from csl-computer

292193
chown	chmod
for instance someone may have done a chmod or chown which broke the program

292241
debian	linux
i am relatively new to linux unix and i have a debian jessie 8 distribution installed in my laptop

292243
debian	linux
i am trying to run linux tails which is based on debian on a laptop lenovo 11.6 inch ideapad 100s from a live usb drive

292243
mouse	keyboard
however once i get past the boot menu the mouse and keyboard stop working

292243
mouse	keyboard
an external mouse keyboard on the second usb port work however

292243
mouse	keyboard
on close inspection i have concluded that internally the built-in mouse keyboard and wireless card are all connected via usb and that for whatever reason any usb devices attached when the laptop starts become inaccessible

292274
freebsd	linux
at work i do have corporate firewalls and then behind firewalls i do have several vpn technologies namely cisco freebsd pfsense and linux strongswan

292280
sudo	passwd
also i used to be able to put my passwd in for sudo once and it would expire after some time and then i would have to re-enter it again .â

292285
lan	localhost
connecting from lan localhost works perfectly

292304
daemons	systemd
this is fortunate since sshd is a systemd daemons and should not be dependent on a client session

292311
centos	linux
i have a problem with my linux centos server leakage of memory grows inactive memory so how to find the process consists with huge memory in inactive memory to kill

292318
ubuntu	linux
when i log in via ssh on a linux ubuntu server i notice that all the bash commands executed by other users on the server are saved in the command history

292325
versioning	upgrade
it turned out that some drivers or other were replaced with the wrong versioning when a silly user with sudo access made an careless package upgrade

292350
kde	gnome
please note that if you want desktop integration ability to configure touchpad via gnome control center or kde settings you need xf86-input-libinput

292367
folder	directory
i have a folder full of source files for an application the project uses git for version control and so there is a .git directory

292392
debian	centos
simply i have a server that will be debian centos serving up an nfs share to several physical servers that require access to this shared datastore

292426
ubuntu	mint	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	mint
this is a general procedure for building with source on debian-based distros like ubuntu and mint

292502
disk	ram
output of lsmod running with a slightly-modified configuration to support initial ram disk

292502
disk	ram
lspci on that same slightly-modified configuration and initial ram disk

292514
postfix	dovecot
we have tried to return to php5.6 disable cron disable postfix and dovecot stop our java app but nothing helped

292546
folder	directory
once you have ssh access verified on between the two machines you can sync the dir1 folder from earlier to a remote computer by using this syntax note that we want to transfer the actual directory in this case so we omit the trailing slash

292551
ubuntu	debian
if the resolvconf program is installed you should not edit the resolv.conf configuration file manually on debian or ubuntu based system as it will be dynamically changed by programs in the system

292553
min	max
is there any simple workaround for getting min max for the float numbers as explained above

292562
sudo	passwd
-edit for clarification i do want the user to be prompted for a passwd when trying to run sudo

292562
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
currently when the user is running sudo he is being prompted for a passwd and then he gets user is not in sudoers file....

292563
sudo	passwd
in order to use sudo and be prompted for a passwd you need to remove

292577
stdout	stderr
since the second loop is only running an echo statement to stdout there s no need to redirect stderr there

292582
debian	linux
i am using debian gnu linux but would be interested most for more general solutions for all gnus and the other unixes

292587
stdout	stderr
anyway the output is going to the console because that s where the init manager sends its output and unless redirected applications started by the init manager inherit stdout stderr

292587
daemons	systemd
assuming you have a syslog daemons running on your systemd i personally would change that script to something like

292587
stdout	stderr
this will send stdout output to syslog with the info level and stderr output to syslog with the err level

292599
ubuntu	debian
in debian derivatives including ubuntu this is dash

292599
debian	linux
on most linux distributions including debian derivates the default shell for users the default interactive shell is bash

292613
udp	tcp
try with netcat on udp as udp has no handshake maybe tcp with its requirements and frame differences is part of the issue

292617
stdout	stderr
it also works when writing to stderr instead of stdout

292672
strncmp	strlen
configurations shall run almost as fast as calling strlen + strncmp the same number of times

292676
debian-based	linux
to bootstrap a debian-based apt -based distribution you need to use a tool such as debootstrap which itself needs quite a number of programs to run although since your filesystem isn t empty but includes the basic linux tools it might already have everything needed

292691
stateless	stateful
supposedly nmap can distinguish stateful firewalls from stateless firewalls by using the -sa or ack scan but i m at a loss as to how one would discern that fact from the nmap output of an ack scan

292691
stateless	stateful
based off of that output how would one discern whether this was stateful or stateless

292691
stateless	stateful
if i can get the same output from a stateless firewall as i can from a stateful firewall then how am i supposed to tell from the nmap ack scan which firewall i m encountering

292692
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i added my public key from .ssh id_rsa.pub to the .ssh authorized_keys file on the server starting with ssh-rsa which worked quite well at least until the last ubuntu update even today from a linux mint machine - different key but also rsa

292692
ubuntu	mint
on the ubuntu i m using openssh_7.2p2 ubuntu-4ubuntu1 openssl 1.0.2g-fips 1 mar 2016 i don t know the ssh version from the mint machine

292711
stdout	stderr
is there something i can put in .bashrc or .profile that will record all stdin input and stdout stderr output to a timestamped file

292711
chown	chmod
i plan on creating additional functionality which will chown the file to root and chmod 600 so only root can read it

292718
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
to install debian or ubuntu on a system where you have a running linux kernel use debootstrap

292731
versioning	upgrade
as long as you have the correct drivers installed for your disks they should still be discovered even after an upgrade to a new versioning of fedora

292739
sudoers	passwd
using this method requires either you change the permission of the destination file in sys every boot either you can had the command to etc sudoers to require no passwd

292739
sudo	passwd
now you can call the command with sudo without you get prompted for passwd it for sure an hole in the security so take care of that

292741
bash	zsh
this seems to be somehow caused by something in my .zshrc since it does not happen if i start z shell with zsh -f and it doesn t happen in bash

292748
redhat	fedora
for distros not based on redhat or fedora the guide still works but might need slight tweaks for the filenames in etc pam.d

292749
width	height
i updated .config monitors.xml and looked for vga1 which is my tv and set up correct width and height 1408x792 and after a restart the configuration was applied successfully

292824
ubuntu	centos
i have created a virtual machine with a minimal centos 7 installation on my ubuntu 15.10 guest system

292846
stdout	stderr
causes stderr of a program to be written to the same file descriptor as stdout

292846
stdout	stderr
nc writes to stderr by default pipe will only get stdout hence grep will miss the data

292847
ubuntu	centos
i see this in bash 4.3.11 1 -release on ubuntu 14.04.4 lts in bash 4.3.42 1 -release on ubuntu 16.04 lts and in bash 4.2.46 1 -release on centos 7

292848
osx	yosemite
i run a macbook pro with yosemite osx

292881
stateless	stateful
let s consider what the behavior differences between a stateful and a stateless firewall would be

292891
debian	linux
i have my laptop with debian gnu linux

292912
folder	directory
however when i added another directory path to each file the script moved the first archive folder into the second archive folder

292924
ubuntu	debian
i found this answer to a duplicate question on serverfault titled yum equivalent of â œapt-get purge that provides the only method i ve seen that can do what does on ubuntu debian

292925
postfix	dovecot
you should look for tutorials on setting up an mta using postfix or sendmail and dovecot or other similar tools

292935
stdout	stderr
as satokatsura pointed out in their comment the hacky use of less is outputting to stderr while grep reads from stdout

292935
stdout	stderr
though it is a poor solution to the actual task of finding dead symlinks it can work by redirecting stderr to stdout

292984
stdout	stderr
ideally it would redirect the service s stdout stderr to its own stdout stderr

292996
nas	qnap
i have a qnap ts-251 nas with a pair of 4 gb drives set up as raid 1 running as a server mainly for backups

293023
sudo	passwd
this is on a system with no root passwd and only a single user pi with sudo privileges

293044
ecdsa	rsa
you can either track down on the server-side why it s only looking for ecdsa keys instead of rsa or you can resolve this from client side by providing an ecdsa key

293046
debian	linux
im actually new to all linux stuff before i used to have several vms where i used debian just to see what it actually is

293055
postgresql	mysql
also reading etc group itself is not a good idea because that file is just one of the possible sources of group data other sources may include ldap active directory winbind nis mysql postgresql berkeley db files extra group files from libnss-extrausers and many more

293097
umount	btrfs
i m using snapper with btrfs under ubuntu 16.04 and i m confused about the mount and umount parameters

293102
kde	gnome
when you run them once then it is fine -- the gnome kde is unloaded and you can startx again

293116
openbsd	linux
this claims to work with linux os x windows android openbsd etc

293116
mouse	keyboard
examples include keyboard and mouse

293117
ubuntu	linux
i m running arch linux with i3 window manager and i m wondering if there s a way to replicate ubuntu behavior about auto mounting internal partitions and usb

293144
wan	lan
if i understand the problem you want each machine to have wan access using eth0 and lan access using eth1

293172
lvm	umount
make sure that the root lvm is umount

293220
debian	linux
linux version 3.4.90+ root debian gcc version 4.7.1 debian 4.7.1-7

293237
ubuntu	debian
the same command mentioned above works as expected on a debian machine but not on the ubuntu machine

293279
mouse	keyboard
in copy mode mouse wheel used for scrolling like keyboard arrays do

293292
unix	solaris
however if there is no solution for this one then i would be interested in solutions for any unix including fringe variants plan 9 mac-os bsb solaris athena etc

293307
debconf	dpkg
from what i could find dpkg is still accessing this file with the debconf frontend and the service crashes when it tries to start another frontend the environmental variable debian_has_frontend is not passed to the service

293307
debconf	dpkg
i think i should force starting the daemon after the dpkg process has ended and debconf has already finished any ideas

293327
bash	zsh
if this varies from shell to shell i m most interested in zsh but also in bash

293329
daemons	systemd
if docker was installed through a package manager or install script for systemd you may need to adjust the mountflags daemons argument

293334
udp	tcp
the same openvpn process can t listen on udp and tcp sockets at the same time

293334
udp	tcp
one should listen on udp the other on tcp

293334
udp	tcp
these can t be bridged so if you want to share the ip space between tcp and udp clients you ll need to use a learn-address script like the one at however this specific script is vulnerable to a tmp symlink attack so remove the logging to tmp if you use it

293335
spaces	delimiter	put	get
so what i want to do is to have everything in the zone name zone name up to the vsan spaces in 1 field and then until the next occurrence of start of line with zone name put each string into its own field which i can then cut using delimiter to get what i want

293346
disk	ram
i was able to get it running by compiling my sata controller libata into my kernel which was originally being compiled as a module and which was why it would run fine with an initial ram disk

293351
cinnamon	gnome
how do i change to use gnome by default and get rid of cinnamon

293360
uniq	grep
grep error message logfiles | cut -d -f6- | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

293374
versioning	upgrade
however the agent requires an old versioning of the agent be installed before being upgrade to the new versioning of the agent

293374
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade versioning of the agent will work with rhel 7s new 3.x linux core but the base versioning of the agent will not

293380
debian	linux
linux debian version 5.0.8 is running on my iomega nas and it has a raid0 array of four 3tb disks that failed on the third disk

293392
stdout	stderr
so is there a simple shell way tool or command to help filtering stdout and stderr coming from the command and pipe them such that former stderr output is printed to stderr only if former stdout output is empty otherwise when stdout is not empty it just prints stdout

293436
unix	solaris
for example solaris 8 and 9 are unix 98 compliant susv2 on i386 and sparc but not on x86_64

293452
kde	gnome
although nfc support is built in to the linux kernel neither gnome nor kde have any support for it and the number of nfc enabled apps in my fedora 20 repository is princely zero

293454
debian	linux
how does sleep work on a linux debian box

293454
mouse	keyboard
i do not usually use the box with a keyboard and mouse

293470
tunnel	vpn
vpns such as openvpn when an ethernet frame is sent to the tap network interface the vpn process receives it and forwards it in a tunnel

293477
bash	zsh
this is a direct translation of the find-config algorithm in generic shell commands tested under bash ksh and zsh where i use a return code of 0 to mean success and 1 to mean null failure

293492
redhat	fedora
the vmware compatibility guide does not list fedora as a supported platform and making allowances for similar versions the redhat releases for which it cites support are generally several years old with the exception of workstation 10 and 11 which are supported for rhel6 and rhel7

293560
xfce	gnome
it originally came bundled with gnome 3 however i quickly changed to xfce due to preferences

293563
ubuntu	debian
also read through this bug report note i am using slackware not ubuntu or debian but all the suggested fixes seem really messy removing other functionalities and os-version specific

293564
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	unix	aix	solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
also in my personal completions i have to get them working across older versions of bash and for various unix s aix hp-ux solaris linux bsd and i ve found a lot of variety in what is supported

293583
daemons	launchd
if your postinst launchd a daemons make sure you tell debconf to stop at the end

293583
daemons	launchd
that is issue db_stop before launchd your daemons even if it does not use debconf itself

293585
stdout	stderr
by you are redirecting the stderr fd 2 to where stdout is fd 1 pointed at not to dev null and this is done first

293586
ubuntu	linux
on my ubuntu linux 16.04 lenovo desktop i am using monodevelop 5.10 with the xamarin asp.net plugin for development and production environments

mutt	thunderbird
btw i write all my email in mutt with vim - i wouldn t couldn t use anything else....even when i had to use icedove aka thunderbird at a_previous_job years ago to connect to their exchange server i had the external editor plugin installed so i could use gvim

293600
mouse	keyboard
fine with legacy uefi always was a problem - either my keyboard mouse wifi was not functioning properly power only when entering installer or installer was failing to load ui with messages in console

293612
stdout	stderr
related to 3. explain why does scp in example 2 print the password prompt even if stdout and stderr are both redirecred to dev null

293616
ubuntu	debian
this script requires the xml2 utility in package xml2 in debian and probably ubuntu too

293619
rpm	dnf
i ask this because of this i installed jdownloader it s a java-based download manager still from rpm still using sudo dnf install at the end of the installation it started the application automatically as i guess root user

293642
debian	linux
i am following that list of instructions verbatim except for the fact that i m trying to use grsecurity s test patch for the 4.5.7 kernel and i m running kali linux instead of straight debian

note - the link says centos but it s actually ubuntu in the post which is deban as is kali

293750
folder	directory
preserve date modified on directory folder with rsync

293757
folder	directory
if i do chrootdirectory mnt inbound an then specify forcecommand internal-sftp -d u i could make the folder be owned by the end-user since mnt inbound is now the new root directory that must be owned by the root account

293757
folder	directory
however users would be able to navigate to the parent folder and see the directory names of all other accounts

293759
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
both ubuntu trusty xenial and linux mint rosa sarah have just had a distribution update this might have caused the dependence problems

freebsd	solaris	freebsd	netbsd	solaris	bsd	solaris	netbsd	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
for example according to the scheme solaris - system v r4 - bsd 4.3 so can the bsd openbsd freebsd netbsd and the solaris run the same executable

293776
freebsd	linux
the kernel let s say a freebsd kernel can detect you are trying to run a linux binary and can translate between the linux kernel abi and the native kernel abi

293808
ubuntu	linux
i would like to change the default encoder for asp.net 4 running with ubuntu linux 16.04 operating system on a lenovo thinkstation desktop and apache server 2.0 and mod-mono-server4.exe

single-quotes	double-quotes
that almost-unreadable mess of single-quotes double-quotes slashes and backslashes transforms all s in the second field to

293821
versioning	upgrade
the fedora wiki directions for a dnf system upgrade say to update all packages normally with dnf upgrade --refresh before beginning the versioning upgrade per se

293821
versioning	upgrade
i can understand that you d want the latest versioning of key packages like the kernel dnf and the dnf system update plugin but do all packages really need to be up to date before beginning the versioning upgrade

293821
versioning	upgrade
do i actually need to upgrade all of my packages to the latest fedora 22 versioning over 3 gib to download if not for drpms just to have to download them all again from the fedora 24 repositories

293824
binutils	glibc
this upgrade process tested for some popular upgrade scenarios and can depends on core system components glibc binutils ...

293824
rpm	dnf	rpm	yum	dnf	yum
at least better to upgrade package management software rpm yum dnf and important components like binutils .

293826
g++	gcc
be aware that the command scl enable devtoolset-3 bash enables gcc g++ v4.9 in the current terminal session only

put	get
i was hoping to put this into .profile so that i automatically get put into tmux when i connect via ssh

293849
dpkg	apt
this is necessary due the way that apt and dpkg interact

293849
dpkg	apt
apt calls dpkg with the path of all the the packages and allows dpkg to do it s job but for such thing to happen the deb packages should be in the disk ie

293855
pop-up	dialog
the point of issuing the command as root is to skip the gui authentication dialog udisksctl otherwise pop-up

293855

ubuntu	debian
here is a tutorial for ubuntu but you can also use it for debian just change the image

293976
chmod	mkdir	chown	mkdir	chown	chmod
i could just mkdir it chown it and chmod it but in directory where i want to create it i have a directory with just the permissions and owner i need

294015
children	parent
the parent can interact with its children in an easier fashion than other processes can

294015
children	parent
moreover if certain precautions are not taken see man nohup for an example of such precaution the death of the parent process will cause the death of all its children processes

294049
mouse	keyboard
all users see the same desktop and share keyboard and mouse actions

294053
ssl	https
this time the ssl comes into play and the sharks can decrypt ssl but i haven t yet managed to build a suitable tshark command-line and started wondering if there aren t more specialized adapted tools for debugging pretty-printed caldav xml over https in a terminal

294063
switching	screens
things are mostly fine except twice today i ve been browsing the internet on chromium browser when suddenly and with no warning at all the system will switching to the login screens background with the clock but there s nothing i can use to log back in

294067
ubuntu	mint
these third party sources are often tied to the 17.x release of mint or the 15.04 release of ubuntu

294067
ubuntu	mint
it may take some time for third parties to release new repositories after a major upgrade of ubuntu or mint

294067
ubuntu	mint
even with the third party repositories commented out the software installed from them is for a different version of mint and ubuntu and could cause instability

294081
daemons	systemd
additionally the ntp daemons will calculate the drift of the systemd clock relative to an internet source and correct for it even if the internet connection is lost

294093
centos	linux
i d like to pay a monthly yearly fee for root access to an ip address of a linux centos vm in the cloud which i could play with

294141
ubuntu	linux
looking at computers i have nearby arch linux netbsd and ubuntu all offer uim packages through their default distribution channels which to me indicates some measure of acceptance in the community at large

294154
torque	slurm
you ll need to use a scheduler slurm or torque - both packaged for debian and most other distros

294159
int	chars
a format of 4i would give us an int i in four chars

294178
versioning	upgrade
i have a very old active os unfortunatly due to supplier issues i cannot upgrade to a newer versioning but i need to get interface bonding active

294178
opensuse	centos
i tried several other options that work perfectly on centos or ferdora all newer oses but not on this old opensuse 10.2 os

294192
buildroot	uclibc
should there be no working busybox with vi for your architecture you can try to compile it yourself preferably statically linked to uclibc using buildroot or crosstools-ng as a toolchain or like +gilles pointed out have a look at unpack it using ar vx

294197
ubuntu	linux
i have used linux for a number of years but usually on ubuntu and haven t ever had this issue before

294204
ubuntu	debian
i m using debian and ubuntu two different pcs

294216
lvm	btrfs
if you re not using lvm because you need to create partitions for vms partitions and most other block-devices are faster than .qcow2 or raw files for vms i recommend using btrfs instead of lvm

294216
lvm	btrfs
you could do an in-place conversion of migrate your directories to btrfs and then add half of sdb to btrfs as a raid-1 mirror and use the other half for extra storage also btrfs or for lvm

294216
lvm	btrfs
if you choose not to do the in-place conversion probably wise the procedure would be similar to the rsync etc method above except instead of creating lvm partitions for you create a btrfs volume for target and sub-volumes for target boot and target var

294216
ubuntu	debian
installing zfs on debian or ubuntu and several other distros is easy these days - the distros provide packages including spl-dkms and zfs-dkms to auto-build the modules for your kernels

294216
ubuntu	linux
as with btrfs it would be easier to backup your data and config files etc and rebuild the machine from scratch using a distro with good zfs support ubuntu is probably the best choice for zfs on linux at the moment

294216
lvm	btrfs	lvm	xfs	xfs	btrfs
the rest of sdb could be btrfs ext4 xfs or even lvm which is kind of pointless since you can make zvols with zfs

294244
dnf	yum
i know you re trying to use dnf for this but if yum is an option you could always do

294285
stdout	stderr
i usually do something like to say to send stderr to stdout

294308
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian this requires the postfix-pcre package to be installed

294320
stdout	stderr
identify the file-descriptor a number 0 is stdin 1 stdout 2 stderr other numbers for other files for the file that you are looking for

294326
dnf	yum
all major package management tools apt yum dnf etc. verify package signatures

294331
vim	emacs
â œquery replaceâ the emacs name for what vim calls a substitution with confirmation

294341
portrait	landscape	bash	zsh
is there a shell script bash or zsh would be acceptable that would move all landscape images into a directory and all portrait images into another directory

294342
width	height
this uses the fileinfo utility to get an image s width and height

294342
width	height
if the height is greater than the width the file is moved to the portraits directory

294367
ubuntu	linux
i d like to install cub linux but i have files that i want to keep on my ubuntu 14.04 installation

294372
bazaar	git
etckeeper is a collection of tools to let etc be stored in a git mercurial bazaar or darcs repository

294380
bash	zsh
i like to be pragmatic and since writing a zsh completion is outside my current skills i d just write a special purpose function using the select menu system from zsh and bash

294387
mouse	trackpad
this version of bluez also works with my bluetooth mouse and trackpad

294408
width	height
you could use imagemagick s identify with the fx special operator to compare height and width

294449
centos	linux
centos linux release 7.0.1406 core

294460
affinity	irq	cpu	irq	cpu	affinity
nevertheless you can adjust irq coalescing settings and irq cpu affinity to distribute processing to alter the number of hardirqs generated by the nic and processed by a particular cpu respectively

294500
debian	linux
i tried to install the new linux kernel 4.6.0 on my debian machine from backports but my machine won t boot with the new kernel

294522
debian	linux
linux 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt25-2 2016-04-08 x86_64 gnu linux

294539
ubuntu	mint
now that the ubuntu variants and mint have moved to systemd i found my old solutions based on the above to be less satisfactory

294539
post	get
this file was proposed in the second answer of this post but i was unable to get it to run until i added an install section

294543
switching	screens
hitting ctrl + alt + f2 does switching to a black screens with a cursor but there s no login prompt

294564
switching	screens
alt-f1 f2 f3 to switching screens

294580
daemons	systemd
looking inside etc init.d functions on an old centos systemd the daemons function effectively runs

294606
x11	konsole
these movement and selection key combinations work regardless whether the editor is run as a native x11 application or in text mode in an x11 terminal emulator running emacs with emacs -nw in a konsole or gnome terminal window

294636
bash	zsh
it s called process substitution and is a feature of bash zsh and ksh and possibly others i don t know

294664
ubuntu	linux
system linux ubuntu 16.04 64 bit

294685
ethernet	wireless
your airserv-ng machine will need one connection in monitor mode and a second adapter ethernet bluetooth or wireless doesn t matter for connecting to a network

294723
stdout	stderr
there are programs like dd which write their output data to stdout unless stated differently by parameters and there also is the standard error channel stderr which programs write to when an error occurs.

294742
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
i m only interested in icmp udp and tcp packets

294746
packets	multicast
when this target is set for a rule the linux kernel will multicast this packets through a netlink socket

294746
packets	multicast
one or more userspace processes may then subscribe to various multicast groups and receive the packets

294755
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r root root opt folder

294759
ubuntu	debian
apt-get is part of the debian or ubuntu etc package apt

294759
macports	homebrew
you could install elinks with macports or homebrew

294775
bash	zsh
use zsh best or bash second-best as a command line if you can

294780
pull	push
git updating commands - clone push pull - won t work unless i create back this damn repo p2 on bitbucket

294791
rpm	yum
however each upgrade took about a full day including doing a full drive image beforehand then following all the detailed upgrade procedures i ve read which include doing things like checking for rpm packages which are no longer maintained in the yum repositories and finding replacements verifying all packages searching for any configuration files which have had .rpmnew files created and merging in the changes etc

294807
kde	cinnamon
i thought i had messed up things had other problems not related to kde so i made a fresh install of the whole system installing only kde and cinnamon as environments

294810
integer	radix
the command below converts a decimal integer to radix 64

294816
nas	qnap
trying to auto mount two shares from my qnap nas onto my raspberry pi

294816
nas	qnap
qnap nas shares

294821
ubuntu	linux
system linux ubuntu 16.04 64 bit

294824
chown	sudo
sudo chown myuser myuser

294825
ubuntu	linux
i first tested linux ntfs on an ubuntu 12.04 and it s always worked for me

294842
octal	decimal
reading the man page for xterm i can see the -info windowid option which is explained as â given an x window identifier an integer which can be hexadecimal octal or decimal according to whether it begins with 0x 0 or neither xterm will reparent its top-level shell widget to that window

294845
ubuntu	debian
running a brand new ubuntu 16.04 and a debian 8 server

294856
ubuntu	linux
running on current ubuntu 16.04 although this is likely the same for any modern linux distro

294874
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
you should be able to configure lxml to find your own version of libxml2 and libxslt using the --auto-rpath install option

294875
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu linux 14.04 lts

294878
versioning	upgrade
the solution to your problem with ubuntu versioning 14.04 upgrade to 16.04

294888
sudo	passwd
i have tried using sudo and gksudo both have failed to prompt me to enter passwd i.e i am unable to escalate permissions through a background shell script

294891
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you can edit etc sudoers to configure sudo to allow execution of a script without a passwd

294892
mp4	h.264
vf â mp4 videos using h.264 need to have a dimensions that are divisible by 2

294901
bash	zsh
csh was a better interactive shell than others in the 1980s but it hasn t really evolved since the 1990s and has been overtaken by zsh and bash

294901
bash	zsh
bash is pre-installed on virtually all systems that have csh and many more and zsh is if not pre-installed then at least available as a package

294906
ubuntu	linux
thank you in advance linux ubuntu society

294934
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
depending on the project i can use oracle linux centos or ubuntu using the default most popular desktop

294934
vmware	virtualbox
similarly depending on the project i can use virtualbox or vmware fusion

294937
rpm	yum
when i am installing rpm by yum via red hat network as the following example down

294943
single-quotes	double-quotes
also it s a good idea to put single-quotes or double-quotes if you need to include a variable or command substitution around regular expressions to make sure the shell won t try to expand them as globs - if you had a filename rhaa in the current directory the shell would expand your argument to rhaa and that s all that your grep would see

294960
bash	subshell
this explicitly calls a new bash subshell and then runs the function in that subshell

294979
ubuntu	linux
system linux ubuntu 16.04 64 bit

295000
kde	gnome
personally i think that kde has no priority for debian but this minimalistic usability accident gnome 3 is always up to date

295009
width	height
the last part of the code will move files below a specified width and height to a folder

295016
folder	directory
if you have a file named list containing the following and you with to create a directory for each line name in file where the directory name is just the part after . folder

295016
folder	directory
if you wish to just rename the original folder directory keeping original content then you can do

295033
bash	zsh
in such a way to work with both bash and zsh

295033
bash	zsh
is there a way to loop over in zsh when it is a string and in a way compatible with bash

295033
bash	zsh
i know about zsh setopt shwordsplit to emulate bash but i can t set it ad hoc for the loop because it would not work in bash

295035
bash	zsh
in zsh this activates options that make it more compatible with ksh and bash including sh_word_split

295046
put	get
while you could probably get this to work by installing severe security holes the right way to achieve what you probably want is to put the command shutdown -r now in root s crontab

295063
rpm	dnf
also commandline suggests the package was installed from command line downloading the rpm and then doing dnf install whatever.rpm in the command line etc.

295093
filesystems	fat
fat filesystems can only support file-names of 8+3 characters

295098
filesystems	fat
this will force the partition to be mounted in legacy dos fat filesystems which uses the 8.3 filename convention see instead of vfat which uses long filenames

295128
stdout	stderr
if everything looks good try running mount.ecryptfs_private yourself and see what it tells you the ecryptfs-setup-private program could be hiding potentially useful stdout stderr info

295151
debian	linux
this is on debian jessie gnu linux using gnu bash

295155
ubuntu	freebsd
when running qemu monitor info usb returns no surprise the same entry for the network card both for ubuntu and freebsd

295171
opensuse	linux
all computers are linux opensuse for .1.0 24 rhel for .10.0 24

295236
ubuntu	debian
os debian 8.5 64 bit ubuntu 16.04 64 bit

295244
textmate	notepad++	textmate	kate
obtain professional php editor with code formatting for example phpeclipse php storm or nusphere or even notepad++ on linux it s kate and on macos it s textmate

295244
migrate	upgrade
you might need to upgrade php runtime to something with up to date patches or even migrate it to newer php7 and keep it up to date

295253
versioning	upgrade
when i try both install and upgrade it says procps is already the newest versioning

295253
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
if it matters i m on linux mint 17.3 rosa with ubuntu 14.04

295264
folder	directory
located in the same directory as the .txt file i have 300 folder and i want to copy only the folder whose names match those listed in the .txt file into a folder called new_folder

295277
bash	zsh
you can easily find tty-name and list of processes associated with just another bash or zsh but assuming you don t want just kill it until you re sure it s safe to do that how are you going to find corresponding screen tmux tab

295298
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
with this method there are two directory hierarchies and file protection commands such as chmod -r chown -r and chgrp -r to contend with in order to achieve a build with no errors and runs correctly with mod_mono_server4

295310
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu 14.04.2 lts gnu linux 3.13.0-48-generic x86_64 on amazon aws

295343
stdout	stderr
in linux we can redirect stdout and stderr or both of them to files

295343
stdout	stderr
redirect stdout and stderr to two files

295343
stdout	stderr
redirect both stdout and stderr to files

295348
stdout	stderr
so after writing to the files both stderr and stdout will be printed to stdout

295352
rpm	yum
if neither yum nor rpm are available you might also simply copy the less binary and dependencies if missing from your host

295353
ubuntu	linux
vsftpd hosted on ubuntu 14.04.2 lts gnu linux 3.13.0-48-generic x86_64 amazon aws

295385
sudoers	visudo
this was a light bug as you must allready be in sudoers to run visudo

295404
sudo	passwd
as another example programs like sudo and ssh will for security reasons read the passwd from the terminal directly you can t pipe them in

295450
cpu	affinity
it is safe to assume that this will happen by default however you can explicitly set the cpu affinity a bitmask of the set of cpus you want to use for a process with sched_setaffinity or for pthreads pthread_setaffinity_np

295452
email	dkim
so i then found this tutorial teaching me how to setup dkim and after that eamils won t send at all except for email to self or same host

295452
debian	linux
operating system debian linux 8.0 raspian

295454
put	get
does anyone know what i am doing wrong and if there is a way to put the root directory at the beginning of the external hard drive and get rid of the free space

295455
debian	linux
you have the linux audit system for that i don t know if it s installed by default on debian but you ca install it by

295467
cinnamon	gnome
apparently mate 17.3 uses mate terminal 1.12.0 while cinnamon 17.1 uses gnome terminal 3.6.2

295529
sudo	passwd
i went through lot of online forums and found i can configure it with sudo pppoeconf i did the same and configured with username and passwd left the other things as default

295533
put	get	post	put	post	get
access-control-allow-methods post put get options delete

295534
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
use awk or perl or sed or a for-loop around an arrays - anything to avoid using a while read loops

295556
bash	zsh
with bash zsh

295583
debian	linux
alright so i made an earlier attempt to install rhel 7.2 with automatic partitioning and it turned into a mess since i have 3 other operating systems installed windows + 2 debian based linux distros so this time i will try again with manual partitioning and i have a few questions.

295583
debian	linux
do i need to setup a separate boot partition for rhel or can it use the same boot partition as my debian based linux distros

295595
cifs	smb
i currently have a smb cifs network share which i have mounted under var inbound to receive files via sftp

295595
cifs	smb
the issue starts when var inbound is in fact a mount of my smb cifs network share

295595
chown	chmod
this all has to do with chown and chmod permission settings and basically i need to be able to perform the following

295595
cifs	smb
the above works perfectly with a linux filesystem but by design it would not work with a smb cifs fileshare -- which is why i am experiencing errors

295690
redhat	fedora
i use both debian and redhat fedora so it needs to work on both

295691
folder	directory
with directory option it copies each source file into destination folder with source s file name

295698
folder	directory
the first argument is the folder you want to copy and the second is the target directory

295699
udp	tcp
moving the syslog traffic from udp to tcp isn t an option here since the device vendor decided udp syslog was perfectly adequate

295713
gentoo	debian
on the debian gentoo wiki they posted a small program that might work also

295714
kerberos	ldap
i am trying to release a server using â â centos 6.8 + samba4 winbind - ldap + kerberos + nss

295749
switching	screens
with tmux you can even split the screens into panes switching between them and rearrange the portions with the mouse

295765
macports	homebrew
while you could install macports or homebrew and get a later version what osx has is ncurses 5.7.20081102

295779
voip	sip
however when the vpn is up my sip client twinkle can t register with my voip provider

295788
post	get
in that case post the exact error messages you get when trying to run some apt command

295788
dpkg	apt
once you re here the missing files are back on your system and dpkg as well as apt will work again

295798
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs takes filesystems mount point as an argument not a device path

295799
wan	lan
unreliable - 4mb router has 4 lan and 1 wan ports

295832
folder	directory
i tried adding a .ssh folder and authorized_keys file in the users home username directory as another post suggested to no avail

295877
width	height
note physical serial ports have the disadvantage of not communicating the width and height of the terminal

295884
geany	sublimetext
if i edit the file from a remote server via text editor geany sublimetext text..etc locally the file user and group will changed to the logged user

295908
udp	tcp
redirect all tcp udp traffic to tor so that any program trying to do anything gets forced to use the tor network

295908
ethernet	wireless
internet adsl router 1 192.168.1.1 wireless laptop wlan0 192.168.1.199 eth0 10.42.0.1 sharing to ethernet via networkmanager rounter 2 10.42.0.2 wireless laptop 10.42.0.2

295913
voip	sip
however if you want voip to run over the vpn then you don t need any rules at all on red0 that handle sip traffic

295926
vim	emacs
the only problem with the emacs solution is that i m actually a vim kind of guy

295944
rpm	yum
while doing an installation of an rpm using either rpm or yum is it possible to override the default user account that s typically defined in the rpm .spec file

295954
configure	libtool
the --with-libs parameter of the configure script is placed before the ldflags variable therefore libtool did not pick up my libcurl file but the one from the base system

295957
filesystems	ntfs
the alert you are getting and this is just my hunch here is because you mounted it as vfat in etc mtab then forced an overwrite of the filesystems using ntfs

296038
filesystems	fat
unlike fat the filesystems used by unix don t have a special size limit on the root directory but once the partition is full you won t be able to add more

296067
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
every distro i have used either asks debian ubuntu suse manjaro or has a way to disable it centos i think or requires you to do it manually arch

296096
ubuntu	linux
i have a 32bit ubuntu linux install on an hp stream 7 tablet

296096
ubuntu	linux
for the sake of long term support i would like to install 64bit ubuntu linux on this device

296100
stdout	stderr
i know about stdout and stderr

296106
stdout	stderr
will redirect stderr to a file literally called 1 and redirect stdout to file

296106
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to - ie the same filehandle as stdout

296106
stdout	stderr
the result is that both stderr and stdout will be redirected to file

296108
stdout	stderr
because the order of evaluation is from left to right we first get redirect stderr to wherever stdout is outputting so console output

296108
stdout	stderr
now we do redirect stdout to dev null and then redirect stderr to where stdout is pointing so dev null

296147
next	except
quotes all special characters except newline is a way to continue a long logical line onto the next physical line so that sequence is removed

296147
bash	zsh
that operator is also found with some variations in bash zsh mksh and freebsd sh

296147
translation	localization
ksh93 also has a quoting operator that works like ... except that the string is subject to localization could be configured so it translation to the language of the user

296147
spaces	delimiter
in single-byte character locales all blank according the the locale characters are considered as delimiter like spaces or tab

296185
beanstalk	amazon-web-services	centos	linux
i am running a docker container inside amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk running amazon s amazon linux which i believe is a centos derivative

296196
versioning	upgrade
i tried to select a newer versioning in aptitude for linux-image-amd64 but it did not upgrade other packages like linux-headers-amd64 which would likely result in broken system

296196
versioning	upgrade
is there a simple process that would allow be to upgrade every package that depends on my current kernel versioning

296241
debian	mint	debian	linux
i ve been following several guides one for raspbian and one for linux mint which should work on debian but still get the error no adapters found with blueman and it doesn t show up on hciconfig

296313
debian	linux
i have tried using the netcat installed on the linux debian machine i am trying to bind

296322
stdout	stderr
this writes both the stderr and stdout of all commands to both the log file and the tty

296322
stdout	stderr
unfortunately this makes the tty very noisy so i d rather have only stdout on the terminal and both stdout and stderr in the file in correct order so opening the file twice for append won t work

296338
stdout	stderr
this command redirects stderr to the history file with then tees stdout to the same file using

296340
cat	tee
tee can t directly output to a file descriptor but you can use process substitution with cat to solve it

296340
stdout	stderr
so stdout goes to the output through fd3 and both stdout and stderr go the log

296349
width	height
this flag uses the options -geometry widthxheight+xoff+yoff where width height xoff and yoff are numbers for specifying a preferred size and location for this application s main window.

296370
debian	linux
i know about this post linux debian screen brightness stuck on high on macbook air but the solution proposed there seems to have no effect at all

296376
stdout	stderr
you want to duplicate stdout and merge one of the copies with stderr

296376
stdout	stderr
to do this first redirect stderr to the log file then call tee to duplicate stdout to stderr

296376
stdout	stderr
this may result in data being out of order because the program may keep writing data to stderr going directly to the log file while tee is busy copying some previous stdout output to the log file

296378
asterisk	pbx
the final goal is to configure asterisk pbx system configured as intercom to use this channel when called asterisk will autoanswer and i want voice routed mixed on all 8 channels of the sound card

296383
bash	zsh
in ksh bash or zsh you can do this more concisely through process substitution

296392
bash	zsh
the answer they re probably looking for in a form usable by either csh or bash or zsh or ksh

296397
kde	cinnamon
i installed mint 17.2 kde after a time upgraded to 17.3 and after another time i installed cinnamon de and completely purged all packages related to kde

296421
stdout	stderr
excuse me for repeating this but the biggest problem with what you showed is how will the processor of the stdout and stderr streams know in advance the length of the future lines added to it in order to align them properly

296460
folder	directory
one possibility would be tree -l 1 -x which will only expand those folder which are on the same filesystem but this does not work in case all of these folder are empty empty file systems are mounted to the mountpoints and the legitimate directory are empty directory

296460
filesystems	btrfs
my real use case here is btrfs filesystems to be able to identify easily which directories are subvolumes and which are not.

296495
mouse	keyboard
apparently debian on macbook pro installs a mouse emulator on your mbp keyboard

296496

mouse	trackpad
i m trying to enable middle mouse button scrolling on my dell precision with 4 buttons on the trackpad and a trackpoint with 3 buttons thing

296514
mouse	trackpad
i was thinking that the buttons on the trackpad can be re associated to the mouse

296537
stdout	stderr
within the program these commands will then redirect stdout and stderr to dev null

296543
xfce	gnome
i m on xfce and have now cheched run gnome services on startup

296553
gentoo	linux
i am running gentoo linux with kernel 4.4.8-hardened-r1 qemu-kvm version 2.5.1 and 3227 mb of system-visible ram without considering ram taken by bios and my amd apu s graphics

296567
solaris	bsd
you are using non standard bsd options whether under linux or solaris

296568
affinity	processors
i ve set the processors affinity of the running iperf process to use only processors 0 1

296610
solaris	bsd
note you re using the bsd form of the ps command so on solaris make sure you re calling the right one

296616
udp	tcp
rpcinfo will try both tcp and udp connections to talk to the portmapper

296616
udp	tcp
indeed in a quick test i did tcp was attempted before udp

copy the whole sbin folder into the installed root directory

296669
sudo	passwd
on machine b create program that sudo will use to ask for passwd

296721
dpkg	apt
i understand that apt and dpkg has a system of marking packages where you can denote a preference regarding a package s install status

296741
gentoo	linux
lastly reorder the boot entry ibid so that gentoo usb was 1st 2nd other linux 3rd efi usb 4th efi network

296743
post	get
or does this post get deleted and the approved version posted as new

296767
migrate	upgrade
i was already planning to add this to the zvol+drbd+live-migration experiments as soon as i upgrade the main zpool on ganesh from 4x1tb raidz to 2x4tb mirrored and free up some more old disks so i ll be able to migrate vms back-and-forth between indra and kali or between surya and ganesh

296769
linefeed	delimiter
linefeed is the only recognised line delimiter not cr nor crlf

296772
versioning	upgrade
essentially this state means you do not want the system to upgrade the package in the given state even if there is a newer versioning

296775
openssl	libcrypto
openssl s libcrypto has several primitives to deal with signature verification

296775
gnupg	gpgme
gpgme is a library written by the author s of gnupg which allows many things among them signature verification

296795
bash	zsh
with zsh or recent versions of bash or ksh93 or yash -o braceexpand for a fixed text you can do things like

296830
rpm	yum
if yum update failed it may be due to the corruption in rpm database under var lib rpm location

296853
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am booting four operating systems windows 7 ubuntu kali linux and linux mint

296857
ubuntu	debian
the actual hosts debian and ubuntu have different hardware including different number of nic making it difficult to compare the configuration

296876
bash	zsh
note the feature needs support from your shell gnu bash at t ksh93 mksh zsh and posix sh from the upcoming version of the standard support it

296889
ubuntu	debian
indeed one of the differences was that the etc network interfaces of debian host contained bridge_stp on while on ubuntu there was no bridge_stp statement

296895
put	get
alternatively instead of rsync you can use tar to backup the remote vm s filesystems and put the tar.gz files somewhere you can get at from the live cd

296895
postgresql	mysql
note if you re running mysql or postgresql or anything that writes to db files or other non- plain-text files you ll want to shut down those services before the rsync

296904
cpu	hyperthreading
so basically if i would like to disable hyperthreading from the my linux os i should put 0 in cpu 24..47 online with

296910
perl	tcl
it is quite simple you can write script in perl or tcl

296915
ubuntu	linux
the problem never happen in ubuntu linux

296916
x86	64bit
instance if you are installing go version 1.2.1 for 64bit x86 on

296919
pulseaudio	dbus
they communicate over dbus and pulseaudio registers endpoints with bluez

296930
kde	kubuntu
after upgrading from kubuntu 14.04 lts to 16.04 lts konsole 15.12.3 with qt 5.5.1 under the kde framework 5.18.0 no longer recognizes ctrl + space

296972
readonly	temporary
i have an external hard disk with a zfs file system from another freebsd 10.2 system zroot02 that i want to temporary mount readonly so i can get some files off of it then disconnect it afterward

296974
sudo	passwd
for example a user using passwd to change his or her passwd pam is used around that for security and you don t type sudo passwd to change your passwd

296974
sudo	passwd
depending what your script needs to do you might be not even need sudo if you use pam properly and set ownership and suid guid of your script just like how usr bin passwd is

296977
readonly	temporary
this will look in dev for anything holding a zfs pool with the name tank import it temporary setting the pool property readonly to on which means that all user-initiated writes will be rejected and temporary setting its altroot property to mnt someplace

296987
centos	linux
it s configured for centos fedora epel and arch linux for now

296988
bash	zsh
i cannot find a way to make bash or zsh

296990
osx	yosemite
my operating system is mac osx yosemite and i am using terminal

296997
sudo	passwd
your machine will ask you for sudo passwd

297019
unix	aix	stdout	stderr
where is the location of stdin stdout stderr file descriptor in aix unix

297040
filesystems	ntfs
that would exclude directories and symlinks but also devices named pipes sockets and possibly others depending on the system though in the op s case of a backup of a ntfs filesystems those would be unlikely to be present

297052
jobs	cron
i also checked cron jobs none of them seems to affect any run level

297060
imagemagick	mogrify	width	height
i read using mogrify imagemagick to batch convert all my files with params and it seems my query path is very similar except the fact that all the pictures in my directory have same width and height

297062
stdout	stderr
conventionally file descriptors are initialized 0 1 2 for stdin stdout stderr respectively

297068
bash	zsh
variable assignments in bourne-like shells like bash ksh zsh ash dash yash are with no spaces around the sign

297068
fish	tcsh
csh and tcsh have yet another syntax and fish uses

297083
ubuntu	centos
what is the entity that makes wireshark gets installed under ubuntu with wireshark gui but it does not do that with centos

297094
sudo	passwd
the root user doesn t need to enter a passwd to switch to another so it s common to see solutions like sudo su user

297107
bash	zsh
is a korn shell construct also supported by bash and zsh but otherwise not a standard sh one and not supported by any other shell

297107
bash	zsh
scripts that use should invoke ksh bash or zsh explicitly

297109
sudo	passwd
and incidentally i might say that a setuid program will not always easily open a security breach since many systems have stuff like passwd su and sudo itself that are setuid yet are not considered relatively safe.

297115
width	height
this is a minimal version of the commands to give to resize to width 600 height 400 if greater than that setting the jpeg quality to 70 it is a percentage a smaller number makes for less bytes but less quality

297139
children	parent
since the wizard is the parent script and the children sub-scripts can edit or add config values when they are called is it acceptable for the wizard to re-source the persist file multiple times through the wizard s flow which is necessary since sourcing doesn t flow upwards

297149
ubuntu	linux
system linux ubuntu 16.04 64 bit

297155
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu fedora and possibly others hat tip random832 the group disk should be used

297186
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
btw you should read this article to understand chmod chown and chgrp commands

297192
cinnamon	gnome
normally the similar gdm is used but i want to be consistent with the cinnamon desktop i use instead of gnome desktop so i d also like to use mdm instead of gdm

297200
put	get
i installed slim with pkg install slim and put in etc rc.conf but the login screen i get is still the old one and i m still unable to login

297205
pbx	ivr
you need to create a trunk can be sip trunk or iax trunk between the two pbx and then you can reach the ivr of the other pbx by passing through the trunk here a quick example of how-to create a trunk and there is also an example of how-to reach a resource on the remote pbx

297213
apache	nginx
also i checked apache nginx and php5 logs and they don t show error whatsoever

297217
bash	zsh
that is the bourne shell and all its variants and ksh bash ash dash zsh yash

297233
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
in fact both debian ubuntu and rhel centos package the wireshark gui separately from the rest of the program files but they use different package names

297237
unix	bsd
this program comes from bsd and is available on most unix platforms sometimes packaged with other bsd tools and very often part of the most basic installation

297243
cvs	rcs
cvs cvs started out as an interface over rcs but with history files stored in a separate repository allowing multiple working copies

297254
ssl	https
sftp is actually built on top of ssh the secure shell protocol while ftp -over- ssl aka ftps is simply vanilla ftp over an encrypted transport-layer connection the same as https is http over an encrypted connection

297282
bash	zsh
this script needs bash or ksh or zsh or some other reasonably modern shell that understands process substitution

297282
bash	subshell
note how all the variables are quoted for safety even in the bash subshell using escaped quoted as well as using nul as the separator so the script won t break if pathnames and or filenames contain annoying but completely valid characters like spaces or newlines

297286
affinity	processors
suppose each thread s affinity is all the processors

297294
bash	zsh
you can either do away with xargs and do something like bash zsh syntax

297302
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	mint
i suggest downgrading the systemd versioning or other files see the history of your upgrade in var log apt history.log following is an example on ubuntu 16.04...i don t have a mint to look at

297303
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
or for case-sensitive sr_pdf path match and case-insensitive file match replace that -ipath line with

297367
kde	cinnamon
i recently purged kde from my linux mint 17.3 kde edition and installed cinnamon

297367
versioning	upgrade
i was able to upgrade it to versioning 18 sarah cinnamon

297367
kde	cinnamon
note that i changed kde edition to cinnamon here

297371
stdout	stderr
tell bash to merge stderr and stdout

297385
mtu	icmp
the icmp packet had a field mtu of next hop with a weird value 1450

297395
bash	zsh
bash ksh or zsh

297395
bash	subshell
the assignment doesn t stick because bash runs the while loop in a subshell rather than the current shell

297415
ansible	puppet
or puppet or chef â but ansible is well-suited for zero-infrastructure deploy scripts like this

297418
filesystems	btrfs
there are 8 wd red 4tb disks in a raid5 configuration using btrfs as filesystems data and metadata both are raid5

297425
ubuntu	linux
system linux ubuntu 16.04 64 bit

297428
ubuntu	linux
system linux ubuntu 16.04 64 bit

297474
stdout	stderr
if you want to do stderr as well as stdout

297539
mouse	keyboard
the host is the box where you run virtualbox at - so most probably the desktop system your display mouse and keyboard are connected to

297540
daemons	launchd
when i m launchd netstat i see no cups daemons listening to port 631

297549
folder	directory
message in folder directory foo cur with a 2 s extension to folder bar with my mailer i check that it is indeed in bar cur with the 2 s extension and run a synchronization the message appears as new again ie

297566
installation	upgrade
the boot sequencing method is decided during installation or upgrade

297566
versioning	upgrade
some packages being upgrade to newer versioning which may not use a script in etc init.d and the maintainer may have missed the code to remove the old script

297594
filesystems	btrfs
and for multiple-device filesystems like btrfs the loop ro doesn t either because it affects only one device not all of them

297697
sudo	passwd
sudo is newer and requires by default for you to enter your own passwd but can be configured to accept the passwd of the user group that you are switching to or no passwd at all

297734
xfce	gnome
i use gnome primarily but have installed xfce with plans to try it

297738
versioning	upgrade
situation i have upgrade two nvidia optimus laptops from linux mint 17.3 to versioning 18

297751
debian	mint	debian	linux
i run linux mint debian edition lmde2 debian 8.1

system linux ubuntu 16.04 64 bit

297789
ubuntu	centos
is there a way to deploy an application that you built on ubuntu on centos

297791
debian	linux
this would likely be system dependant i tested on debian jessie 8.5 linux 3.16.7-ckt25-2+deb8u3

297793
versioning	upgrade
situation i have upgrade two nvidia optimus laptops from linux mint 17.3 to versioning 18

297804
bash	zsh
in zsh you would use precmd instead of bash s prompt_command

297805
centos	linux
and unix linux servers often run all but untouched in production for a very long time so you might have a stable old system still running bash 3 such as a centos 5 box

297805
bash	zsh
to take associative arrays again bash zsh and ksh93 all have that feature but there are multiple implementation incompatibilities

297805
bash	zsh
your choice then is to only use bash or only use zsh or only use ksh93

297805
bash	zsh
there are solutions to this in post-posix shells â certainly in bash ksh93 and zsh at least â but that just brings you back to point 1 above

297808
ubuntu	centos
if you don t distribute an rpm package for centos and a deb package for ubuntu you do your users a disservice

297808
ubuntu	centos
you can run an application built for ubuntu on centos with more or less effort depending on library requirements but you can t deploy an application built for ubuntu on centos

297815
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
your client machine must support fuse which is the case of most modern unix variants including linux osx bsd and solaris

297817
gentoo	linux
i want to use my samsung 850 evo for gentoo linux

297817
disk	ram
second question gentoo s portage make many writting operations on disk how big ram disk temp fs should be

297832
debian	linux
debian and many other gnu linux distros use x11+gnu+linux

297832
mouse	keyboard
the x11 server handles the screen keyboard mouse your process is trying to connect to it so that it can display stuff

297832
mouse	keyboard
there is security between user process and x11 display server as it is possible to connect over a network â mouse keyboard screen here and program running on the computer over there.

297846
centos	linux
i am running a centos linux server which i connect to using putty ssh with x11 forwarding enabled and an x11 server xming running on the client machine.

297846
centos	linux
is this possible on centos linux and if so can you give any examples of how this works

297847
hash	salt
the client can then pick a random salt ïƒ an send hash ïˆ.ïƒ ïƒ where

297870
single-quotes	double-quotes
i d also suggest using single-quotes rather than double-quotes since the shell may expand what it think is variables and such when you use double-quotes

297886
switching	screens
normally less clears the screens which probably refers to switching back to the normal screens from the alternate screens when the terminal description has the appropriate escape sequence in the rmcup capability

297905
daemons	systemd
as yet another point of reference daemonize 1 and daemons 3 are things on some systemd and the former s man page says this

297931
disk	ram
regarding your ram disk question i don t really see why you should really need one but if you want to influence the maximum size of tmp you can do this

297935
debian	linux
ps - running debian gnu linux 8.5 | 4.5.0-0.bpo.1-amd64 | i3 4.8-2

297938
ssd	sata
the currently locked sata mode basically prevents linux from even seeing the ssd

297938
gentoo	ubuntu
i ve tried the latest versions of ubuntu and gentoo - both with the same result

297939
bash	zsh
i testing on bash and zsh

297948
daemons	systemd
as for what a daemons should do i suppose it depends on what init systemd one uses

297948
daemons	systemd
on linux with traditional systemd v init scripts the daemons has to go the background itself or with assistance from a helper

297948
daemons	systemd
on upstart and systemd it might be preferable if the daemons did not fork itself since the init systemd can do it

298016
ubuntu	debian
by the way you could be running ubuntu or some other downstream distribution rather than debian but it s likely there will be the same time difference

298021
daemons	launchd
the daemons should work sanely even if it isn t launchd from a daemon-launching framework

298021
daemons	launchd
a well-behaved daemons should have an option to not daemonize itself so that it can be launchd from a supervisor

298021
daemons	systemd
recent linux kernels make it easy to supervise daemons that double-fork but not every systemd runs a recent linux kernel and not every supervisor program assumes a recent linux kernel.

298046
bash	zsh
that is portable across several shells not only bash and zsh which have

298058
put	get
you can either - as has been suggested get bash to send its output somewhere else and then read the data from a separate process or you could put this modified version of your code in a file

298093
kde	gnome
i don t know if this was switching from gnome to kde or other window managers but it showed the independence of the window manager and the x server

298111
rsa	dsa
if the rsa and dsa keys are missing on the server fix them by

298121
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	for-loop	loops
you can do this with either a for-loop if your shell supports recursive globbing zsh ksh93 yash bash tcsh and fish as well but loops syntax is different there

298122
ubuntu	linux
i recently bought a new hp spectre x360 laptop and installed linux ubuntu 16.04 lts 64 bit for the first time

298154
folder	directory
i have a directory with folder sequentially numbered 1-1000 however i want to perform an action for some of the folder in this directory

298154
folder	directory
as it stands it will keep going through all the folder in that directory

298199
solaris	bsd
edit note that i intend to use it on at least various bsd s solaris and mac os x

298202
jobs	cron
i also tested the cron jobs with no sudo since the crontab file was edited as root

298202
jobs	cron
so with my cron jobs i would expect to get the python script running on every reboot and every hour but seems not

298202
jobs	cron
what could be wrong here and how can one debug what s going on silently on cron jobs

298202
jobs	cron
changed cron jobs but it continue to not run

298215
octal	hex
-b defaults to single bytes octal for od hex for xd

298218
folder	directory
i have a lot of .cr2 and .arw files mixed together in a directory structured by date 2016 has the folder 06 and 07 within it with a folder for each day in them

298229
arp	icmp
but the host system ignores incoming packets from eth0 at all regardless of those type arp icmp tcp...

298234
perl	tcl
zsh has a more useful more usual similar to tcl or perl way to declare associative arrays as a whole

298234
bash	zsh
note that bash associative arrays as opposed to ksh93 or zsh have a limitation in that the key cannot be the empty string not an issue here

298234
bash	zsh
associative arrays support was in ksh93 from the start 1993 added to zsh in 1998 3.1.5-pws-3 and bash in 2009 4.0

298237
ecdsa	rsa
only recently my ssh server has been sending me a ecdsa fingerprint instead of an rsa but i was wondering which algorithm should i choose if it even matters

298244
wan	lan
the network connection from the router vm to the wan router in my home lan is bridged i can ping to wan from the router

298244
wan	lan
the lan router can ping the wan router both its own interfaces and into the wan but not to the client .2.2

298244
wan	lan
the wan router can ping both lan router interfaces but not the client

298247
centos	linux
on a centos linux release 7.1.1503 linux kernel version 3.10.x vm i added the following lines to both etc security limits.conf and etc security limits.d 20-nproc.conf

298259
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to get a broadcom bluetooth adapter working on ubuntu linux

298268
stdout	stderr
here stderr is redirected to stdout so that we can pipe it to ssh

298273
lvm	xfs	filesystems	xfs
the root filesystems is a xfs on a lvm partition on my ssd the physical drive is dev sdc

298279
udp	tcp
answering the title netcat uses tcp by default but offers a udp mode with the -u flag

298279
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	netlink	sctp	tcp
socat can use a wide variety of protocols including tcp udp sctp and even netlink sockets on linux

298283
cpu	processors
bear in mind that you still cannot use binaries compiled with newer instructions on older cpu s even in compatibility modes for example you cannot use avx in a 32-bit binary on nehalem x86 processors

298290
binutils	glibc
you need to compile gcc glibc and binutils with these parameters and provide the kernel headers of the kernel at the target machine

298302
for-loop	loops
the for-loop with nullglob set on will only execute loops at all if the glob has an expansion and the unconditional break statement ensures that the gzip command will only be executed once

298304
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
note that in zsh without n like in pre-bourne shells csh or tcsh if the glob doesn t match the command is not run you d only do the above to avoid the resulting error message of no match found as opposed to gzip failing on the expanded glob in the case of bash or other bourne-like shells

298304
zsh	subshell
you can prevent your script from exiting in that case either by using a subshell or using zsh error catching mechanism or by setting the nonomatch to work like sh nullglob or noglob option of course though i wouldn t recommend that

298309
versioning	upgrade
i am using php versioning 5.4.45 and want to upgrade to php 5.5

298309
versioning	upgrade
i need to upgrade because typo3 needs at least php versioning 5.5

298309
versioning	upgrade
is there a way to only upgrade php to a higher versioning without having to upgrade other software like apache

298341
stdout	stderr
this gets both stdout and stderr

298346
debian	linux
i run linux debian 7

298353
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you should also check etc sudoers and see that which users have the ability to run commands with sudo privilege without needing root user s passwd

298369
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i am having a web-page with html5 tags which i am executing with standard browser like firefox google-chrome opera

298380
macports	homebrew
but if you re looking for a package manager i recommend you use either homebrew or macports

298382
ubuntu	debian
specifically i ve been using debian based distro s....mostly ubuntu

298400
min	max
rtt min avg max mdev 13.946 13.946 13.946 0.000 ms

min	max
rtt min avg max mdev 15.158 15.158 15.158 0.000 ms

298438
stdout	stderr
note that the status information is written to stderr not stdout so it won t interfere with pipes or redirection

298469
wan	vlan	wan	lan
i found solution for this if the router supports vlan then it is possible to convert lan ports to wan ports in openwrt

298493
bash	zsh
ksh bash and zsh have process substitution which allows passing the output of a command anywhere a program expects a file name

298511
ready	each
you can make upgrades follow releases automatically by writing stable instead of wheezy but this is not recommended because you ll get a whooping big upgrade each time a new stable release comes out whether you re ready or not

298527
stdout	stderr
i tried to redirect stderr and stdout into a file named grub_error like this

298528
stdout	stderr
you redirect stderr to stdout but you also need to redirect stdout itself

298531
kde	kubuntu
interestingly enough the issue seems to be on kubuntu but not on opensuse with kde and plasma 5

298538
ubuntu	linux
i m looking for an incremental backup tool to use on a running disk based linux system such as ubuntu or the like and a tool which is freeware

298538
filesystems	btrfs
there are methods that acronis and btrfs use to capture filesystems changes as it runs so as to emulate the effect of stopping the os while it is working

298548
bash	zsh
is there a way to make zsh behave in the same way as bash or is there another way to remove list the existing files with similar easeâ¹

298585

298625
bash	zsh
in both zsh and bash is not a globbing operator it s an expansion that occurs before globbing

298628

ansible	puppet
a widely used solution to this problem of how to maintain duplicate machines attacks the problem from a slightly different angle - use a provisioning tool such as ansible or puppet chef to script the set up of one machine as required then use the ansible scripts to clone a second or third or fourth... machine as needed

298760

is it possible to have rsync respect copy-on-write files from filesystems like btrfs

298762
filesystems	btrfs
i ve been trying some tests of syncing a 1gb file and a copy-on-write clone of this file so 1gb shared between them from one btrfs fs to another but rsync will send 2gb of data and when i do btrfs filesystems du on the received files there are 0 bytes shared

i d like to setup openvpn between a freebsd client and an arch linux server such that

299013
tunnel	vpn
in other words if i do something like curl --interface tun0 example.com on freebsd i want the request to example.com to be routed through openvpn but if i just do curl example.com i want that to ignore the vpn tunnel

299013

i can make arbitrary changes on both the freebsd and linux sides if that makes configuration easier

299021
switching	screens
let s say you lack both gnu screens and tmux and x11 and virtual consoles but want to switching between a login shell and another interactive shell

299077
jobs	cron
but somehow cron jobs are running 30 minutes earlier

299077
daemon	cron
that s why when i scheduled a job for some minutes in the future it didn t work because to the cron daemon that time had already passed

299077
daemon	cron
it s evident that the cron daemon is working with the old timezone while the rest of the server is working with the new timezone

299077

how can i fix the cron daemon s understanding of the new timezone

299087
bash	zsh
bash and zsh use the histfile all caps variable

299100
stdout	stderr
tput cols and tput lines query the size of the terminal from the terminal device driver not the terminal itself from the terminal device on its stdout and if stdout is not a terminal device like in the case of where it s then a pipe from stderr

299139
bash	zsh
some shells zsh bash ksh93 all added the feature suggested by oliver kiddle of zsh around the same time in 2005 after it was discussed among their developers have an alternative syntax to assign the first free fd above 10 instead which helps in this case

299156
debian	centos
they do on debian by default on the old centos i have handy the startup scripts only seem to prepend to path

299163

i understand scientific linux 6 uses python 2.6.6 for several critical utils including yum according to this article how to install python 27 on centos 6

299192

the issue i m facing is that i don t know how to run a python script as a service on my cent os server using conda virtualenv

299192

i checked further and found that even though i was getting icmp and dns resolution my tcp traffic was not working

299226
postfix	dovecot
after the script has reloaded these it tries to reload my services using the commands i would type myself into a shell i.e- service postfix reload and service dovecot reload

299231
bash	zsh
that works with all shells that support arrays ksh zsh bash yash though the part doesn t work in yash yet you d need to use a literal newline character there

299235

when using sudo su or simply the login screen from linux mint cinnamon or debian with cinnamon they all hang for a second when you enter an incorrect passwd

299276

filesystems	btrfs
to solve my problem i would like to create a filesystems at 1.5tb move data there create 1tb btrfs on luks filesystems at beginning of disk move data back expand btrfs

299339
filesystems	btrfs
i don t see why you would need to make a different filesystemâ¹ you shouldn t duplicate a btrfs filesystems on the same machine but moving one you won t ever access both at the same time is ok

299339
filesystems	btrfs
now create a partition for the luks volume create the luks volume cryptsetup luksformat and move the btrfs filesystems again onto the luks volume

299342

you can find equivalences between package management commands on major linux distributions arch linux rhel centos fedora debian ubuntu mint elementary â suse gentoo on the pacman rosetta

299351

if you need yum equivalents for older rhel centos check dnf vs yum

for-loop	arrays
note that the above for-loop may not print the arrays in an order

299367
kde	gnome
and has it any apps for xorg without kde gnome gtk dependencies to i can test it

299367
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
i don t need kde gnome xfce or some else de and windows also yeah i m noobie but i want learn xorg to better understand the graphical system in the linux where the x window system ends and the de begins

299375

alternatives with explicit looping allows for sub-intervals ksh93 bash or zsh syntax

299386
vim	emacs
you don t want to edit etc passwd with sed or with vim emacs and definitely not with sed -i

299386

this is a special command much like visudo that lets you edit the etc passwd while taking care of file-locking etc

299439
ubuntu	linux
the manpage at man7.org is dated 2015-12-28 part of release 4.07 of the linux man-pages project so it is not surprising you don t have it since your ubuntu was released 18 months earlier

299439
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu 15.10 and i have a manpage dated 2013-07-30 release 3.74 of the linux man-pages project

299439
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
that is earlier than the release of your ubuntu 14.04 so one might think it should have been in your release but i think you ll either have to trust the release engineers to provide you with consistent information or use a distribution that tries to be as cutting-edge up-to-date as possible i would investigate debian sid gentoo arch

299440
bash	tcsh
tcsh is organized differently from bash no surprise

299450
versioning	upgrade
initially i ran into several problems particularly a message about no headers for current kernal versioning but after doing a full apt-get update apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade i was able to apt-get install broadcom-sta-dkms which built a new initrm and successfully got my wireless working

299454
post	get
i tried following this post suggestion but didn t get far

299481
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine except that the f11 key is not pressed - i am left with firefox together with its google-chrome

299506
ubuntu	debian
see how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

299507
bash	zsh
of course this only works in zsh not in bash file managers scripts except zsh scripts where this command has run .

299514
rpm	yum
that s a good reason to stick to package managers such as yum or in the worst case to rpm but avoid installing from source

299519
kde	gnome
in unity de gnome and kde this script works flawlessly using . nvautofan.sh but this script presents an error if i call the same command in xfce4 using bash -x . nvautofan.sh for debugging

299533
ubuntu	linux
the linux version is ubuntu 14.04 and is running on amazon ec2 as medium instance with 4gb of memory

299537
xfce	gnome
it may well be that should be removed or that some other modification needs to be done for the script to run under both gnome and xfce

299546
debian	linux
i opend setting gui then go to user section to change that user to administrator in kali linux which base on debian

299580
jobs	cron
checking there are no cron jobs or other scheduled tasks that could be triggering it and it isn t happening aligned to a minute boundary anyway

299586

if you are serving it like that then you are obviously using a web server like apache or nginx

ubuntu	openbsd	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linuxmint	openbsd	freebsd
my redhat 9 openbsd 4.9 freebsd 10 macos x linuxmint 17.3 and ubuntu 14.04.4 all print ok when running this

299650
versioning	upgrade
to get wifi working you need to install the required firmware from backport the easy way or upgrade your current kernel versioning

299659
stdout	stderr
the other advantage compared to pipe-based approaches is that the command s stdout and stderr are still connected to tty devices so it doesn t affect the buffering

299682
ubuntu	debian
this works on debian 8 and ubuntu 14

299683
kde	gnome
i do not have a graphical interface like kde or gnome

299683
debian	linux
i m running debian and would like to have a utility similar to arch s linux netctl to manage my connections

299684
disk	ram
i m assuming that i ll need to do this in the ram disk image during early boot

299684
disk	ram
i m quite out of touch with systemd and boot order - i last got dirty with building ram disk in 2009

299708
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 16.04

299743
bash	zsh
with an array which requires ksh bash or zsh

299796

i think i destroyed something when i tried to move the firefox folder to the usr bin directory using the command

299816
disk	ram
there are 3 limiting factors cpu ram and disk i o

299869
debian	linux
i am having a question on gnu linux debian 8.5 with transmission-daemon service

299876
vmware	virtualbox
you should use a vmware s free vmware converter tool to convert the disks of your physical server to virtual disks create a virtual machine in virtualbox and add the existing virtual disks to it

299883
chown	sudo
sudo chown root dba start_database.sh

299883
sudo	passwd
so sudo will not stop for a passwd

299903
temp	tmp
if you try relocating the user firefox temp directory to tmp does that improve performance

299926
debian	linux
the last time i installed linux on an x86 i had an old fashioned bios and i would install windows then linux debian then grub on the mbr which would put the windows boot record on the windows partition

299937
subnet	packets	wan	subnet
my goal is to forward unicast udp wake-on-lan packets on port 9 of the wan to a subnet broadcast on 192.168.20.255

299937
multiplexing	broadcasting
maybe iptables isn t capable of multiplexing traffic as required in a unicast to broadcasting conversion

299937
wan	lan
my solution is to bind to the wan address that way traffic that gets broadcast on the lan no longer reaches the wan interface again

299944
ubuntu	debian
the exception for root in ubuntu is a debian-specific patch a patch applied by debian and inherited by its derivatives

299956
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint has software center just like ubuntu software center in ubuntu

299969

find all files and folder name a or b in the current directory

299969

fish	bash
if you execute bash the hack above will give you yet another fish shell instead

300007
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
in any case i don t recommend using ubuntu s software center on linux mint

300016
folder	directory
is it possible to create a txt that lists the folder in a directory and the date of creation or ctime of that folder

300052
ubuntu	debian
you could build on another distribution ubuntu 16.04 which has gcc 5 or debian testing or unstable which have both gcc 5 and 6

300060
bash	zsh
pushd popd a csh feature copied by bash and zsh are a way to manage a stack of remembered directories

300060
post	get
popd cannot be used to get the path of the previous directory and in general its output cannot be post processed see the or array of some shells though for accessing the elements of that directory stack

300070
postfix	dovecot
the documentation is there but you need a lot of google foo to find it and some experience with dovecot and postfix to make the connections

300070
postfix	dovecot
configure postfix to use dovecot sasl mechanism as provided in you link

300070
postfix	dovecot
install open-xchange-authentication-imap as sasl backend is on dovecot not postfix

300150
centos	linux
this is from a vps configuration running centos linux release 7.2.1511

300161
freebsd	linux
since freebsd man lacks the -k option and osx ascii.7 has no font-switching using f it s likely that you re referring to linux

301187
ssl	https
ssl is often provided as a module that needs to be loaded before you can enable https

301189
postgresql	mysql
i d recommend using mysql or postgresql instead

301189
postgresql	mysql
for this kind of task mysql s raw speed probably makes it a better choice - it s faster for simple things like this but postgresql is much faster for more complex tasks - in my experience postgresql is smart fast it can achieve massive speed improvements in complex tasks by working smart rather than working hard mysql is dumb fast it works hard without much capability to work smart

301189
postgresql	mysql
one possible optimisation is to careful choose the field sizes so that each record is an even divisor of your drive s block size taking into account mysql postgresql s per-record overhead

301193
folder	directory
i removed the lxpanel lxsession lxterminal lxsession-default-apps and openbox folder under .config directory

301195
rmdir	pwd
note the directory will remain after rmdir as it is the pwd at that point

301195
bash	zsh
there is an option to use for shells that support the variable oldpwd most bourne-like shells ksh bash zsh have

301196
jobs	cron
i don t think this changes the answer but this user might be used by cron for example as a way to run cron jobs with non-elevated privileges

301201
mp4	webm
it allows you to add a list of videos in mp4 and webm format and play them randomly

301205
dnf	yum
dnf is already there in fedora which is a test bed for rhel centos but why centos 7 is still using yum

301217
centos	linux
centos 7 corresponds to red hat enterprise linux 7 released in june 2014

301217
dnf	yum
dnf was made the replacement for yum in fedora 23 released in november 2015

301217
centos	linux
what is centos linux

301217
centos	linux
centos conforms fully with red hat inc s redistribution policies and aims to be functionally compatible with red hat enterprise linux

301243
switching	screens
in wkhtmltopdf we can select auto selecting available screens by -a switching so that kind of solves problem for me

301278
bash	zsh
with some shells ksh93 zsh bash mksh freebsd sh you can use

filesystems	btrfs
i m running debian jessie 8.5 rsync is at version 3.1.1 the source filesystems is formatted with btrfs version 3.17 and the external disk was encrypted with crypsetup 1.6.6

301343
crypt	salt
that character is part of the salt per the crypt 3 manual

301343
hash	salt
given that the length of the salt the string between the id and subsequent varies for the exhibited hash i m not exactly sure what picking a random character from that particular column for a few passwords illustrates

301351
debian	linux
the linux os that i want to install is a custom one based on debian and it doesn t include gparted so that i can change stuff with live cd

301369
debian	centos
those hashes are likely generated by a version of the shadow tool suite src package shadow in debian shadow-utils in centos

301369
hash	salt
salt must be distinct to prevent brute-force testing multiple password hash with a single calculation but should also be unpredictable to prevent or slow down targeted precomputation which could be used to shorten the time from getting the password hash to getting the actual passwords

301372
stdout	stderr
the warnings of find are being shown on the error stream stderr file descriptor 2 but with the pipe you are redirecting just the stdout file descriptor 1 and using grep on that as a result the messages are still being shown

301372
stdout	stderr
if you must use grep pass both stdout and stderr and then use your grep -v permission command

301394

google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome see how to easily install google-chrome and firefox on rhel 5.4 redhat

301439
bash	zsh
as stã phanechazelas pointed out using requires zsh or recent versions of bash yash or ksh93 and also means storing the whole range in memory possibly several times

301439
bash	zsh
ksh93 zsh bash wouldn t have the memory issue but would still be orders of magnitude slower than a dedicated tool or real programming language approach

301450
ubuntu	debian
the debian password safe package should rebuild fine in ubuntu 14.04 once a couple of fixes have been applied

301471
affinity	processors
you may assume that processors affinity for all user space processes is bitmasked to 0xffffffff

301474
ansible	puppet

301532
stdout	stderr
with autosys the system will catch stdout normal output and stderr error messages and put them into the job result data which you can then retrieve and review

301532
stdout	stderr
but normally you d just let autosys collect stdout stderr as normal -

301533
disk	ram
i strongly recommend enabling zswap on your server so that linux compresses swapped data first in ram and then when that s getting full in the swap partition on disk

301554
ubuntu	linux
recently i set up etc apache2 apache2.conf on ubuntu linux 16.04 so that an webuser can run 127.0.0.1 course login.aspx with any browser as long as we run 1 or more mod_mono_server4 server and 1 or more apache2 service instance

301554
ubuntu	linux
is it possible to run 127.0.0.1 login.aspx instead of 127.0.0.1 course login.aspx at the web browser if we run only one mod_mono_server4 and apache2 server instance on ubuntu linux 16.04

301554
ubuntu	linux
if that is correct how should i set this up with etc apache2 apache2.conf on ubuntu linux 16.04

301554
ubuntu	linux
and apache2 server instance on ubuntu linux 16.04

301563
fflush	gets
this is somewhat fragile because a single message that arrives right before the fflush and then gets deferred once for some technical reason tcp timeout etc would also get deleted without delivery

301565
disk	ram
it s a fairly cheap way to improve performance and responsiveness of a system and any unused ram will be used by the kernel to cache your disk

301587
opensuse	debian
project 7 debian family of systems deb file format opensuse 8

freebsd	linux	gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	linux
fedora 9 arch linux 10 slackware 11 freebsd 12 gentoo 13

301606
debian	centos
mkpasswd 1 might be a front-end to crypt 3 but it s not the same as running chpasswd 1 which is part of the shadow-utils package on centos and passwd on debian

301608
dpkg	apt
in those cases dpkg --audit dpkg --configure -a may give you more information than apt does

301618
stdout	stderr
i d like to be able to quickly open the output both stdout and stderr of the last 10 or so commands run in emacs

301626
gentoo	centos
i have a gentoo live cd guest running on a centos 7 host

301626
gentoo	centos
i am logged in remotely to the centos host trying to perform a remote install and am unable to ssh into the gentoo live cd because by default sshd is stopped

301668
folder	directory
my home username directory has the .ssh folder with the files known_hosts initialkey and initialkey.pub

301717
folder	directory
on this question or on this one for example you will get solutions on how to look for symlinks pointing to a given directory let s call it dir1 while i am interested to symbolic links possibly pointing to any file folder inside dir1

301724
chown	chmod
then i tried to use chmod and chown but is the same problem

301736
ubuntu	linux
recently i set up etc apache2 apache2.conf on ubuntu linux 16.04 so that an web browser user can run 127.0.0.1 login.aspx with any browser as long as we run one mod_mono_server4 server and 1 or more apache2 service instance

301747
ubuntu	debian
disclaimer i am aware that x-systemd.requires works on the latest arch and debian testing may not be there yet in ubuntu 16.04 although it is in the mount man page

301750
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox vmware hyper-v disk image types are all supported

301772
mouse	keyboard
open gnome-tweak-tool and go to the keyboard and mouse tab and disable middle-click-paste

301786
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
it wants to change it from linux mint 17.3 to ubuntu 14.04

301786
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
someone changed a package in the debian repo but forgot that the package is used by mint and debian as well as ubuntu

301786
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux maintainers have decided that mint and ubuntu are now so similar that they will no longer be distinguished

301817
ubuntu	linuxmint	ubuntu	debian	debian	linuxmint
on my linuxmint system and i would assume most ubuntu based systems and possibly debian based too there is a user owned tmpfs mounted automatically on run user 1000

301821
folder	directory
when i try to find all files directory that link to the tmp folder i try

301822
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux offers a tarball called a stage3 archive with only a base layout and tool chain which is basically what they use to build their livecd minimal cd not livedvd

301822
gentoo	linux
since gentoo linux is a meta distribution and it s source base you will be able to install any gui administrative utilities that you need it also supports every major de wm out there but if you want just a headless systems then the stage3 tarball will be enough and all you ll have to install to get a live system going is your bootloader and kernel

301822
gentoo	linux
linux from scratch is a bit like gentoo in terms of software that is compiled from source but the main difference is that lfs doesn t provide a package manager and forces you to manage all dependencies on your own great learning experience btw so if you just want a system that provides both the flexibility to tweak what features a package will be installed with through use of a package manager then go with gentoo otherwise use lfs or arch linux

301822
ubuntu	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux
arch linux is between gentoo and a binary distribution like ubuntu but with less bloat

301822
gentoo	linux
i say either gentoo or arch linux

301843
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
does one of the xfs btrfs or ext4 filesystems use less space

301843
xfs	btrfs
in other words will switching to btrfs or xfs make a partition fill up with inodes slower then with ext4

301853
ubuntu	debian
my application requires two packages aapt and zipalign which are present only in the recent debian â jessie and ubuntu â willy repositories so there would definitely be a problem installing my .deb on the older ones

301854
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs has dynamic inode allocation so there is no filling up like you have with the inode tables for ext4 the size for which is set at ext4 filesystems creation time

301854
filesystems	xfs
xfs is dynamic in a similar way but has a limit percentage of the filesystems that can be used for inodes so there whether you fill-up your inode allowance depends on the percentage set as well as the file count file sizes

301855
filesystems	btrfs
a maximum partition size of the btrfs filesystems is 16 exbibytes as well as maximum file size is 16 exbibytes too

301855
filesystems	xfs
the xfs is a high-performance 64-bit journaling filesystems

301855
filesystems	xfs
xfs supports maximum filesystems size of 8 exbibytes for the 64-bit filesystems

301855
filesystems	xfs
now the rhel 7.0 uses xfs as the default filesystems including support for using xfs for the boot partition

301855
xfs	btrfs
xfs vs btrfs

301855
xfs	btrfs
xfs doesn t have any raid while btrfs raid is not yet completely stable and is in its early days

301855
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
xfs is more and more mature than btrfs but we cannot deny that btrfs is powerful and a good-growing filesystems

301855
xfs	btrfs
for now xfs is my choice - specially since it s the default fs on rhel 7 - unless i really need btrfs

301863
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo
use the sudoers visudo or put a config to etc sudoers.d to provide privileges for the user to execute given commands without passwd seems to be the better way

301865
binutils	glibc
am i correct in thinking that the hosts tools i believe it s the compiler that s being built at this stage have to be used to compile glibc binutils etc

301867
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
i ve been using linux daily for years and am familiar with the concept of a command line interpreter bash sh tcsh zsh csh

301878
kde	gnome
however bash and friend are in cli and shell familly whereas gnome kde and all are in gui familly

301881
versioning	upgrade
additinal advantage is that on upgrade on jessie official packages will be pulled and overwrite your older extra pacakges unless you specifically depend on specific versioning or extra packages of course

301914
ubuntu	linux
my windows laptop uses a virtualboxed linux machine to connect to a remote machine both using ubuntu 14.04 lts

301929
centos	linux
because i can t find a linux package which plays nice with my blu-ray drive i use k3b to write an iso from files copied to the centos server

301929
filesystems	hfs+
what don t i understand about hfs+ filesystems k3b iso s and growisofs which makes my disk a coaster

301937
binutils	glibc	toolchain	binutils
the first time uses the toolchain of the host system to build a new toolchain gcc ld binutils glibc etc on the target system

301938
filesystems	btrfs
protip #3 use a checksumming filesystems like btrfs or zfs

301965
bash	zsh
many shells ksh bash zsh dash have a -ef operator to the test command also spelled that tests whether two files are the same

301982
sysv	systemd
how to find out if a systemd uses sysv upstart or systemd initsystem

301993
jobs	cron
i had become too much of an expert cron debugger over the years and knew that if i needed a solution to monitor my important jobs other people probably did too

301993
jobs	cron
cron uses the same system timezone for kicking-off jobs so i would try just resetting that

301993
daemon	cron
restart the cron daemon

302006
filesystems	hfs+
first you create an iso 9660 filesystems and try to mount it as hfs+

302033
filesystems	hfs+
i do not know much about the hfs+ filesystems on macos however i just made the experience that rescuing a 500gb internal hard drive connected via sata on a laptop running linux mint from a usb stick saving the rescue image and logfile on an exfat formatted usb hard drive was starting rather slowly 1-2mb sec but after around 250gb it was only crawling at 100kb sec

302064
stdout	stderr
if it exits the loop without finding an available file it prints a message to stderr prints nothing to stdout and returns with an unsuccessful return code return 1

302065
wordpress	joomla
in most cases there are just some infection caused by outdated or misconfigured cms like wordpress or joomla and some giving vps owner some recomendations to mitigate spam like updating cms running maldet etc. can help you

302071
ubuntu	linux
system linux ubuntu 16.04

302074
rpm	yum
you ve got a non-standard php install on your system - either back it out and replace with the centos distribution then install the php-snmp rpm or keep your existing php and yum install php56w-snmp note the w

302129
jobs	cron
also a 100 loaded system might tip over into disaster around when the daily or weekly or monthly cron jobs fire up fun fact the oom killer used to kill sshd usually at 04 00 am due to the cron dailies so leaving some spare capacity might be handy

302158
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
in the non-embedded linux world the primary method to distribute software is via a distribution ubuntu debian rhel fedora arch etc.

302158
ubuntu	linux
linux distributions rarely act as a signing authority for third-party vendors canonical does this with ubuntu partners but that covers very few vendors and i think all major distributions use the pgp web of trust rather than the tls public key infrastructure so it s up to the user to figure out whether they want to trust a key

302184
centos	linux
my usb drive is not automatically recognized after linux centos 7 boots but then after removing and insert the usb stick it is recognised

302227
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade the current kernel versioning at least to the 4.1

302230
ubuntu	linux
therefore i intend to install the linux operating system ubuntu once again

302241
folder	directory
and moved the home directory to the folder mentioned above

302288
unix	solaris
posixly and so unixly as well as unix conformance implies posix conformance you could use those posix sh functions beware that on solaris the posix unix sh is at at

302318
rpm	yum
trying to install an rpm with yum localinstall and i get

302327
ansible	puppet
yes yes i understand that ansible puppet chef can also help me achieve these results but i have specific reason for wanting to do this regardless

302331
debian	linux
my linux desktop machine is running kubuntu 16.04 desktop lts debian based linux

302332
bash	zsh
to do pattern matching you can use the ksh -style pattern-matching operator which bash and zsh also support

302336
single-quotes	double-quotes
the quotes are a bit funny because there s part of the code in single-quotes then the variable in double-quotes and then more code in single-quotes

302341
bonjour	avahi
you can try to install avahi which is the linux implementation of zeroconf known as bonjour in apple mac ios environments and set it to advertise your host as hostname .local

302366
udp	tcp
i have used udp and tcp

302372
sudoers	visudo
i ve also added user1 to sudoers using visudo

302404
hash	md5
reconstruct a similar machine with the same version of every lib and then scan the whole system calculating the hash of everything use sha1 or sha2 with md5 we can have collisions easily calculated we are paranoids remember that

302404
bash	zsh
you can download and change bash sh zsh or what shell your attacker is using to save logs even if the user unset the variable

302457
for-loop	loops
it s so far working but only if there is a single word or number sequence in the text file--i think because i m trying to use a for-loop and loops somehow results in white space being treated as line breaks

302465
daemons	systemd	sysv	systemd
it is designed to be backwards compatible with sysv init scripts and provides a number of features such as parallel startup of systemd services at boot time on-demand activation of daemons support for systemd state snapshots or dependency-based service control logic

302503
versioning	upgrade
but the package doesn t upgrade to the ppa versioning

302508
rpm	dnf
it is possible to download a package manually i do that quite often with rpm packages for fedora and install a package manually with the regular tools in my case dnf

302508
rpm	dnf
if the repo is directly available online which i don t see why not dnf understands when it is given a url to an rpm package

302525
sudo	passwd
this will prompt you for sudo passwd

302527
openssl	gnutls
normally in c or c++ to communicate through a ssl tls encrypted tcp socket you need to use whatever functions the ssl tls provider openssl gnutls etc gives you in order to perform reads writes for example bio_write bio_read etc

302561
sudoers	passwd
the root user is able to do anything including changing the root passwd and or editing the sudoers file to lock you out

302590
sysv	systemd
systemd is a systemd and service manager for linux compatible with sysv and lsb init scripts

302590
daemons	systemd
systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities uses socket and d-bus activation for starting services offers on-demand starting of daemons keeps track of processes using linux control groups supports snapshotting and restoring of the systemd state maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic

302590
redhat	fedora
red hat-based distributions are migrating to systemd it has been the default system and services manager in redhat 7 centos7 and fedora since the release of fedora 15

302591
irix	linux	solaris	irix
i have experimented with this a lot over the years under solaris irix and linux and to my knowledge this is the only solution to get altgr working - and it has worked well for me for more than 20 years

302610
jobs	cron
one problem with cron is that if there are more jobs that can reasonably be run at a certain time cron doesn t care it will happily spawn the jobs anyway resulting in poor performance for all of them

302618
ubuntu	linux
i run a dual-boot system and the linux distro is ubuntu 14.04

302638
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux

302641
ubuntu	mint
the two laptops that it did boot on were running windows one had vista the other had 10 but on mine i have ubuntu installed and before that i was running mint i don t know if that s the problem but it s the only thing i can think of right now

302661
vim	emacs
i m using vim so i want to get the output without the newline just like if i m using emacs

302670
apache	nginx
i need to write some kind of bash script that would check conf files of services commonly used as nginx apache mongodb cassandra ssh etc and search for patterns check if mongod.conf has authorization enabled line or check if ssh logging via keys is enabled also checking if every service is in it newest version disabling default users to be sure that the service is safe

302671
bash	zsh
note that it will work in zsh and bash shells not all of them but dash for example won t kill remaining backgrounded jobs in the first place

302678
disk	ram
and also that it doesn t run out of ram disk space etc

302690
bash	zsh
that s .bashrc for bash .kshrc for ksh .zshrc for zsh always in your home directory

302710
fish	zsh
that s a specific feature of zsh and now fish as well to let you clearly see unterminated lines in a command s output

302732
umask	chmod
so if manager has umask 0022 he will also have to chmod his dirs and files to 7 to give the group full access to them

302733
sysv	systemd
i remember systemd developers promising that old sysv scripts will just work as they did before but turns out it s not so easy.

302733
sysv	systemd
i ve started to look for information about how systemd is better than sysv and what can i do to simplify and empower everything

302733
daemons	systemd
like it s all systemd needs to monitor the daemons

302751
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
nor does -m tcp or -m udp or -m icmp

302758
folder	directory
in a shell script to copy lib folder in all subfolder inside my parent directory

302785
rpm	yum
this is a redhat build and yum and rpm are disabled

302812
bash	zsh
if you execute a new shell whether it s bash sh csh zsh ... that new shell will not inherit those aliases

302816
google-chrome	firefox
it is always advisable to increase your ram size as the time passes the applications like google-chrome firefox will accumulate more data per webpage

filesystems	fat
now i saw a clever way to defragment a fat filesystems

302971
centos	linux
i am running a vm on a linux host using qemu+kvm and libvirt the guest system is centos 7

302971
folder	dir
i wish to share a folder between the two such that host some dir becomes accessible as guest some other dir

302999
mouse	keyboard
we need to map keyboard and mouse to specific screen only as another screen is for video playback

302999
mouse	keyboard
is there a way to explicitly map keyboard and mouse input to a specific screen only

303010
bash	subshell
i want to execute bash in subshell and when user exits from subshell i want to execute some other commands like for saving logs to file

303011
bash	subshell
i guess it gets overwritten at the subshell bash startup.

303014
centos	linux
using nginx 1.8.1 on centos linux i am attempting to do the following

303024
vpn	lan
i use due to my raspberry smb pma plex etc ddns duckdns.org to reach my router outside of my lan i ve tried to configure vpn on the router but somehow i can t find the right configuration

303033
bash	zsh
note that bash associative arrays contrary to ksh93 or zsh have a bug limitation in that you can t have elements with an empty key

303033
bash	zsh
so if you have some files that won t work properly so even for that programmatic approach i would still go with zsh or ksh93 instead of bash

303035
udp	tcp
so you don t want to use all or tcp udp nor udp as dns can use both protocols in normal operation

303036
sysv	systemd
when you re not sure whether the service is implemented as systemd or sysv use service myapp1 start

303042
wan	lan
my idea is to use a linux machine as a router dhcp server in order to keep wan connectivity to each lan but also be able to ping from one lan to another

303042
wan	subnet	wan	lan
my problem is that only one lan can have access to both subnet and their wan and this depends on which wan gateway is configured on the linux machine

303042
wan	lan
what i need is a way to change the lan1 gateway to isp_g1 only for traffic that is meant for the wan and keep the linux machine as the lan1 gateway for all lan related traffic

303054
folder	directory
interestingly if i specify absolute paths in both places but with the wildcard intact to include all folder within the parent directory the loop runs only once as desired

303072
daemons	systemd
configuring and auditing linux systemd with audit daemons

303109
tunnel	vpn
the way that the vpn tunnel is setup currently is with split tunnel

303149
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have come to the depressing realisation that the official driver for my video card amd r9 208x is no longer supported for my os linux mint 18 based on ubuntu 16.04lts

303167
for-loop	loops
if you want a slightly faster shell loops then if you have the syntax and you want a fast shell loops you re in an advanced shell and you have the c-like for-loop too

303167
for-loop	loops
the optimized c for-loop is 56500 times faster than bash s loops the slowest shell loops and 6750 times faster than ksh s for-loop the fastest shell loops

303170
folder	dir
i tried setting dir to my top backup folder and using --recursive but it didn t find the files and it created a new file instead of a hard link

303178
kde	gnome
the daemon sharing settings from gnome to gtk+ kde applications

303184
put	get
for example the sshfs fuse filesystem uses sftp to get put files on a remote system and transparently let them appear as local files

303194
daemons	systemd
replace it with this line using the -l argument to specify the new minimum systemd load value daemons usr sbin atd -l 1.6

303207
zsh	tcsh
zsh copied that concept using a hook function instead of alias tcsh has no function

303214
ubuntu	debian
debian and hence probably ubuntu too has been known to ship a kernel with such a restriction of user_namespaces and there the way to enable it was is

303232
folder	directory
then search in any directory for a grub folder and or grubx64.efi file

303242
xmonad	xmobar
instead it is necessary to make xmonad call and configure xmobar manually through dynamiclog managehook layouthook and handleeventhook

303244
filesystems	ntfs
after reboot from windows to linux i try to mount ntfs filesystems and mount often fails with the message about unclean cache

303259
debian-based	ubuntu
i don t have ubuntu 16.04 lts nearby but on debian-based system etc init.d atd will usually say something like

303266
sudo	passwd
if you don t want to have to type the passwd of the admin account when you run sudo add nopasswd after the closing parenthesis

303269
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
define it in your shell interactive startup file .bashrc for bash .zshrc for zsh .config fish config.fish for fish

303269
bash	zsh
i don t recommend an initial underscore because that s what bash and zsh s completion systems use internally

303272
ubuntu	debian
kali only ships the esr release of ubuntu just like debian

303282
bash	zsh
i read in another post how this can be done with zsh how can i do it with bash

303290
children	parent
under most circumstances when the parent application is killed it cleans up all all of it s children then exits

303290
children	parent
my gut tells me that the issue is that the parent application isn t cleaning up it s children properly but unfortunately the parent process is a proprietary in house application that i m not able to change the implementation of so i m stuck trying to find a workaround

303302
ubuntu	debian
you are not supposed to control samba services this way on a debian ubuntu systemd operating system

303302
ubuntu	debian
there is no umbrella samba.target to do the original job of the old debian ubuntu samba van smoorenburg rc script

303302
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
so where you read debian ubuntu doco saying things like service samba action remember that that is not an available thing any more now that debian linux and ubuntu linux are systemd operating systems

303302
ubuntu	debian
so where you read generic systemd operating system doco about samba talking about nmb smb and samba services you must mentally perform the translation for debian ubuntu particularly for the latter name

303332
centos	linux
i am using linux centos but suddenly i couldn t run sudo command

303377
debian	centos
use debian centos or another stable userspace at least until you can instinctively spot such issues

303381
bluetooth	usb
is it possible to use a phone coupled through usb as bluetooth adapter in order to connect to an audio device

303398
bash	subshell
what happens is that bash runs the background command in a subshell

303401
bash	zsh
bash has a similar functionality to zsh s bindkey through bind but it does not have several vi modes like zsh

303403
bash	zsh
note with zsh instead of bash this could even be a bit simpler due its support of arrays

303406
ubuntu	centos
on ubuntu you can add the word text but that doesn t seem to work on centos 7

303432
filesystems	xfs
how comes that the filesystems is xfs whereas i asked it to be ext4

303446
tunnel	lan
if i run ssh -x server lxterminal i get a new terminal window open on my local desktop that i can then launch new applications on the server from similarly to the old xrsh application except using a secure tunnel so i don t have to be on the same trusted lan

303454
stdout	stderr
its output is sent to stdout and errors to stderr

303528
jobs	cron
since it seemed to be happening every two days i ve tried looking at the cron jobs but there are no cron jobs that match a schedule of every two days

303576
sudo	passwd
however if i boot with a live usb i can decrypt the volume with sudo cryptsetup luksopen dev sda6 encrypted and the same passwd

303605
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
it s present on solaris and freebsd but not on linux

303608
filesystems	xfs
it appears that you used to have an xfs filesystems in a partition starting at the same location as your current partition number 1

303608
filesystems	xfs
since you haven t written any content to the partition yet the old content is still there if the xfs filesystems was less than 6001gb and if there was really a filesystems there as opposed to a coincidence the beginning of a filesystems image file that happened to be located exactly at that position it s even still valid and can be mounted

303614
folder	directory
and i want to apply following command to the files not have -s in their names in all sub directory in thumbs folder

303638
bash	zsh
you could just as well forget this fact bash doesn t require you to know that the code for the eval builtin is contained in the file eval.c but to get help for zstyle it helps to know that zstyle is a builtin defined in the zsh zutil module and the documentation for the zsh zutil module can be accessed by running man zshmodules

303650
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
s with tcsh zsh or bash in emacs mode type alt+3 alt+2

303666
unix	bsd
i don t think i have ever really used this in several decades of using bsd unix

303673
ubuntu	linux
that way you can use a different linux distribution like fedora or ubuntu and run just these two inside an isolated environment in such a way that they cannot affect the rest of your system by enforcing non-standard versions of these tools

303679
bash	zsh
the posix sh or bash zsh ksh ... equivalent would be

303685
versioning	upgrade
the recommendation from centos is also to make sure the kernel is the newest available versioning which may in your case required an upgrade to the next stable major release of centos

gentoo	linux
i have a gentoo installation where i previously issued make mrproper inside usr src linux

303697
debian	linux
i am trying to enable apparmor for linux system debian 8

303699
debian	linux
i would like to know if the output of a red-hat based linux could be differently interpreted by a debian based linux

303718
spaces	delimiter
cut treats the lines as fields delimiter by a spaces character

303742
udp	tcp
it is configured to use its serial line as a tty accessible via minicom stty but i want to run ip over the serial line so that i can run multiple multiplexed sessions over the link via udp tcp or ssh

303753
folder	directory
with the above configuration when john logs into the vsftp server he will be placed in the test folder in his home directory

303761
freebsd	netbsd
you probably want -quit with gnu or freebsd find or -exit with netbsd find

303771
sudo	passwd
i have granted a group permission to run certain commands with no passwd via sudo

303774
short	base
this driver makes use of two power limit the short term power limit that allows higher power for short term thanks to inertia and the long term power limit the average power the processor dissipates when operating at base frequency with all cores active also known as tdp

303775
ubuntu	mint
as a last resort i went back into my old ubuntu partition and copied its firefox profile into the mint profile and loaded that profile into firefox

303776
sudo	passwd
so an alias for sudo for these folks would likely do the trick to prevent the passwd prompt

303784
sudo	passwd
one thing that worked for me sudo version 1.8.17p1 but satisfies only part of your problem is to set the number of passwd tries to 0

303784
sudo	passwd
this makes sudo exit with code 1 when any command requiring a passwd is tried

303799
daemons	systemd
it is the very idea of a systemd user to execute commands run progams daemons etc

303807
apache	nginx
to do this you need to have a firewall like iptables redirect all traffic to a webserver like nginx apache etc where the webserver responds with a 302 redirect to the url of your login page

303823
bash	zsh
so i wonder if i will have bash as the default shell with it s configuration in .bashrc and then i ll decide to run exec zsh - what file would i need to edit to specify the initialization steps for zsh specifically

303824
firefox	safari
however i am not able to access outside the centos virtual machine i am not able to access the website from my host yosemite web browsers like safari or firefox

303881
ubuntu	linux
i m on ubuntu 15.04 and today i ve been reading an article about linux security from this link

303904
rpm	yum
when i install a rpm using yum install or yum localinstall it can t install due to it can t find the dependencies although it can be found inside the packages folder

303911
rpm	yum
using your dvd as a yum repository on a rpm based linux

303928
ubuntu	centos
i am running centos 6 but the instructions i used to setup openvpn on my centos 6 machine were ubuntu instructions meant for ubuntu server

303928
ubuntu	centos
if someone could please tell me where i can disable enable tun0 or change its external ip address to something else is or how i can do this when i originally set it with the command openvpn --mktun --dev tun0 following ubuntu instructions on a centos 6 system i know that is a bad idea and probably why i am in this situation in the first place please let me know

303949
bash	zsh
note i am using zsh instead of bash if that makes any difference

303967
bash	zsh
with ksh bash or zsh

303967
bash	zsh
with bash or zsh

303985
google-chrome	firefox
when loading this page on browser i ve tried firefox and google-chrome there are exactly 15 images but when i try to download them with wget i get 60 images corresponding to pages 7-11

303995
debian	linux
i maintain a package that is built for debian redhat and suse linux distributions

304018
versioning	upgrade
in the versioning i m currently trying to upgrade 17.2 sources.list doesn t exist and official-package-repositories.list has the following warning in a comment on its first line

304053
cinnamon	gnome
days ago i was playing with gnome 3 and cinnamon and i decide after a few test to keep cinnamon and remove gnome

304069
ubuntu	mint
2 efi system partition esp is named in mint ubuntu installer as

304086
efi	multiboot
yet it is not a good idea to have several efi partitions in a multiboot system

304086
centos	mint
now you can place the kernel and initial ramfs of each install into their own directory on the efi partition one in mint and another on centos

304088
width	height
terminal emulators usually ask for window sizes which are multiples rows of the font height and columns of the font width

304088
width	height
when it opens a font it obtains the height and width of a character cell from that

304088
width	height
but the hard part is that if the window manager disagrees it will change that request possibly changing both the window s height and width

304108
bash	zsh
bash s feature added in 2.0 copied from ksh93 also available in zsh mksh and freebsd sh is quite powerful

304108
bash	zsh
the uhhhh one copied from zsh was only added in 4.2 so wouldn t work for you but with more recent versions of bash or zsh or ksh93 or mksh or freebsd sh and assuming the current locale uses the utf-8 charset you could also do

304168
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
and boot ubuntu or mint from it or your favourite distro of linux then you can chroot into your hard drive s linux partition and fix grub from there

304189
debian	linux
i now started a new stage1 safecopy run hope it will be a bit faster than before since i now run a debian linux directly from this notebook

304215
ubuntu	debian
we edit the file this would be the location on ubuntu and debian usr share pulseaudio alsa-mixer paths analog-output.conf.common and search for the following lines

304220
stdout	stderr
i am using a ssh command executor in java which runs the command and gets the output in stderr stdout and an integer exit value

304220
stdout	stderr
is there a way to get a response in the stderr or the stdout so that i can know whether the command was timed out or not

304225
ethernet	wireless
i want it to be able to sniff on a usb wireless adapter and send its data either via default wireless adapter or ethernet

304260
freebsd	centos
i am trying to configure a centos 7 running in virtualbox to send its audit logs to the host which is freebsd 10.3

304260
freebsd	centos
centos and freebsd are connected on a host-only network

304260
freebsd	centos
i can use nc 192.168.56.1 60 on centos to send data to freebsd

304262
rpm	dnf
i would like to run the dnf package manager fedora on debian as this tool allows to download and install rpm packages in an specified target dir

304266
disk	ram
the former version still makes use of an initial ram disk initrd while the new uses an initial ram fs initramfs

304266
disk	ram
in the former version in the ram disk it was even not configured in the init scripts neither in mdev configuration file

304292
rpm	yum
i fixed it myself by using yum command to install rpm package

304296
integer	unsigned
it clearly would have made significantly more sense to use an unsigned integer as time can t go backwards so having a negative value for time is well impossible

304304
sshd	sssd
however this assumes you aren t using sssd and only want ldap authentication for sshd and no other services

304321
debian	linux
just in case it matters uname-a linux kali 4.3.0-kali1-amd64 #1 smp debian 4.3.3-7kali2 2016-01-27 x86_64 gnu linux

304322
dpkg	apt
note that this file might be part of some old debian package find out which with dpkg -s etc apt sources.list.d blahblah.conf - in that case it is probably best to dpkg --purge that old iceweasel package

304324
mdadm	btrfs
that doesn t mean you cannot use a normal mdadm raid-1 over the two devices or equal size partitions thereof and put btrfs on top of that

304324
mdadm	btrfs
of course btrfs built-in raid assuming it gets it bugs straightened out has some advantages when doing a sync from one device to another because btrfs knows what part of a partition is being used and doesn t sync what is not used whereas mdadm has no clue about usage and syncs the whole partition

304342
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
i ve upgrade my bluez installation to versioning 5.41 on my ubuntu xenail box 16.04

304349
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu linux and hope for an answer using apt-get -able tools thereon

304367
sysv	systemd
as i am using armbian debian with sysv and not systemd also in etc inittab

304386
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading converts your cpu to 2 cores with around 70 the performance of single threading

304391
daemons	systemd
i am not using udev daemons on my systemd

304392
ansible	puppet
the new cloud way is to have all configuration handled by a configuration management system such as chef puppet or ansible

304399
dnf	yum
yum predecessor to dnf exists as package on debian

304399
dnf	yum
as yum is to 95 compatible with dnf i could achieve what i originally wanted without dnf which i still would prefer to avoid future problems

304421
versioning	upgrade
it turned out that our production machine running under centos didn t have any timeout command and we need to upgrade its core utilities current versioning is coreutils-5.97

304423
rpm	yum
when i use yum to installed rpm on my redhat machine

304423
rpm	yum
what the advantage of yum local repository vs direct download rpm from red-hat site by yum

304481
filesystems	xfs
the nosuid flag is not set on the mounted xfs filesystems on the sles machine

304490
debian	linux	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
i ve tried debian testing gentoo gparted live and arch linux live usbs - none of them detect my ssd only my hdd

304529
mouse	keyboard
is it possible to force the graphics card to either turn off or idle until i come back to the computer and move the mouse bang the keyboard

304581
redhat	fedora
fedora is bleeding edge redhat enterprise is stable

304581
redhat	fedora
what s the difference between fedora and redhat enterprise linux

304601
pkcs#11	openpgp
smartcards are increasingly being used for more secure authentication or for pkcs#11 and openpgp cryptography to use with full-disk-encryption fde or encrypted emails etc. within a unix linux environment smartcards are frequently used with applications such as gnupg gpg or device mapper luks dm-crypt file systems

304604
bash	zsh
you could use this code directly in your shell script i tested using zsh but i expect it would work for bash too

304618
sudo	passwd
if you can sudo on the remote without needing a passwd you can simply add to an ordinary rsync the option remote command eg

304624
filesystems	ntfs
a usb flash drive sandisk cruzer micro 4 gb of a friend of mine stopped working no partition table is left the only filesystems of partition should have been fat32 or ntfs

304636
udp	tcp
however i would expect the udp flow taking 7mpbs and the tcp adapting at 3mpbs after some ack timeouts

304636
udp	tcp
if i remove the sfq queue everything is as i expected tcp flow gets 3mpbs and udp 7mbps

304636
udp	tcp
if this is the normal behaviour i should expect that would mean that for any given path if there is a big tcp flow you can only use 50 for udp traffic if you do not want to have losses

304638
udp	tcp
i think you could write a small program with raw sockets using a udp or tcp then you can listen all the ports and you just have to filter the headers to know the ports

304642
freebsd	solaris
different oses solaris mac os x freebsd ...

304649
google-chrome	firefox
using the freshplayer wrapper one can use google-chrome s flash player on firefox and firefox based browsers

304651
pull	push
if like me you are using a git server to transfer files between the two computers git push and git pull

304657
octal	decimal

304677
debian	linux
i am new to debian linux and recently installed debian linux jessie

304711
freebsd	linux
on my system i am just running fluxbox 1.3.7 on freebsd 10.3 â but i ve seen that on linux too firefox has a much more narrow scrollbar than on windows which also behaves differently

304712
sudo	passwd
next you can use ssh instead of sudo to execute command without passwd prompt

304738
spaces	delimiter
if that s undesirable you could insert a spaces at the start of each file2 line and paste them without a delimiter

304779
filesystems	ntfs
however now 2 filesystems commonly used ntfs and ext4 both record file creation dates

304821
put	get
stick it in front put auth and recursor both in the back and use the functionality described at to get the axfrs to the auth server

304824
debian	linux
it seems you are not used to kali debian linux

304832
cifs	smb
it via nfs or smb cifs

304841
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
so if you upgrade from versioning 1.0 to 1.1 then the pre post install scripts are run from the 1.1 versioning of the rpm and the pre post uninstall scripts are run from the 1.0 versioning

304841
versioning	upgrade
now let s upgrade to versioning 1.1

304848
mouse	keyboard
when i boot my machine the keyboard and mouse are totally irresponsive

304848
mouse	keyboard
i then restart the machine often several times until it starts in a different state and the mouse and keyboard become responsive

304848
mouse	keyboard
i am clueless as to why my mouse and keyboard work only sometimes

304848
mouse	keyboard
my machine is a toshiba satellite c670 c670d laptop i am using the default in-built keyboard and synaptics mouse

304886
debian	centos
this happens with gnu awk on centos 7 and mawk on debian so this seems to be expected behaviour

304891
post	get
i m looking for a solution to redirect get post http requests on a server

304909
freebsd	linux
nevertheless this is a configuration which works so that i am able to receive linux audit logs with a netcat on freebsd

304909
freebsd	centos
now you just have to run nc -lk 60 on freebsd and service auditd restart on centos

304915
freebsd	linux
the guid is generally used by the bootloader to identify a disk type use windows freebsd coreos linux etc

304917
zsh	subshell
the zsh called within the subshell has access to the parent environment s variables as is evident by the presence of world however is tricked into reporting 1 and unfortunately with a value of 0 is of no help in this case

304917
zsh	subshell
perhaps it would help me if someone could explain how zsh deciphers the and why placing that code in a subshell obscures that detection

304924
fish	bash
shell bash fish

304924
fish	bash
i m trying to have gvim inherit the full path from bash and or fish when launching from from xfce-whisker-menu

304930
versioning	upgrade
upgrade is used to install the newest versioning of all packages currently installed

304930
versioning	upgrade
dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versioning of packages

304930
versioning	upgrade
doesn t upgrade already install new versioning of dependencies and tell somehow that the package must use this new dependencies

304930
versioning	upgrade
supposing that package a depends upon a file x inside a package b the dependency when upgrade installs a newer versioning of package b called package b-2 is this newly dependency used by package a or is it that a still uses package b until dist-upgrade is executed

304933
sudo	passwd
the way to do that is simply sudo passwd root and set an easily memorizable but tough passwd

304933
filesystems	xfs
i prefer ext4 and now xfs because they allow for online re-sizing of the filesystems

304934
daemon	cron
server a has a cron job that syncs the folder same path to server a s daemon alias

304934
daemon	cron
server b has a cron job that syncs the folder same path to server a s daemon alias

304974
freebsd	solaris
bwk-awk being the one maintained by brian kernighan the k in awk the behaviour is similar with awk implementations based on that like solaris nawk or freebsd awk

304987
ubuntu	centos
i also noticed it works this way in ubuntu 16.04 and centos 6 but in centos 7 neither command prints zzz

304991
ubuntu	centos
here the result was got from mac osx 10.11.6 virtual machines centos 7.2 - glibc 2.17 ubuntu 14.04 - glibc 2.19 which are run on openstack with ceph backend

305005
debian	linux
i have a microprocessor that runs the embedded linux version 3.16.0-rc3 armsdk debian gcc version 4.7.2 gcc

305009
xfce	cinnamon
there is also no selection box like windows and desktop environments like cinnamon mate and xfce have

305028
xen	openvz
the best way to limit resources is through vms xen kvm openvz but i don t think it s what you asked for

305087
integer	unsigned
the exit utility shall cause the shell to exit with the exit status specified by the unsigned decimal integer n

305101
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
for instance i was not able to find an official privacy policy for linux mint and i read ubuntu shares dash typed info with third-parties if not opt-out

305117
versioning	upgrade
do i need to install additional packages the ones not found for example in order to upgrade to a new versioning of wine

305125
centos	linux
on newer linux systems centos starting with 7.0 interfaces are usually named using something called systemd persistent device naming which assigns a name to the device based on the physical position in the system although that can fail in practice

305139
ubuntu	mint
mint uses ubuntu repositories

305139
ubuntu	mint
but moreover you cannot expect that the developers of a distro as big as mint ubuntu are aware of the privacy concerns of every package

305148
freebsd	solaris
i ve installed three os on my computer - linuxmint freebsd and solaris - and have partitioned my harddrive dev sda on linuxmint thus

305149
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
debian ubuntu and mint all track non-free software separately in debian it s in the non-free repository in ubuntu it s in the restricted and multiverse repositories

305235
put	get
now if i m trying to put the sentence in a function i cannot get it right

305259
spaces	delimiter
the sed just replaces spaces with commas so we have the same delimiter in both files

305271
ubuntu	mint
the newest version of mint is based on ubuntu 16.04 so you re not going to have much luck there

305286
bash	zsh
another problem you might be having is that this is a ksh93 feature also available in bash and zsh but not in pure posix shells

305343
sysv	systemd
the vm has debian 8 with backports repository booting with sysv instead of systemd and using lvm

305366
cpu	processors
this saves a lot of power both for the processors itself and for cooling devices compared with having the cpu at full speed all the time

305370
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
on debian and derivatives ubuntu mint â that command is called rename.ul

305394
ubuntu	linux
i need to monitor a shared folder in this specific case the host is windows and the guest is ubuntu linux for new files or a file that has changed

305416
bash	zsh
if using zsh ksh or bash you may want want to set the pipefail option to not lose the exit status of the command being monitored

305432

305445
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu it s probably

305450
bash	zsh
here s something which will work in either zsh or bash to achieve what you re after

305453
debian	linux
the linux ones typically had 4 or more disks and would contain a few distributions eg debian redhat slackware plus a lot of source code include xfree86 and so on

305458
folder	directory
i want to copy n1.sh to all folder in serradomel mt10 directory

305484
bash	zsh
in ksh93 bash or zsh you can also make it

305484
bash	zsh
in ksh93 that optimises out the exec of cat and the fork while with bash only the exec in zsh it makes no difference

305499
gentoo	linux
i installed gentoo linux then i wanted to support pc-bsd so i created a dedicated extended partition

305499
gentoo	linux
i can start a live gnu linux and use chroot to restore the grub gentoo and then use proper os

305511
sudo	passwd
if you are able to use sudo to run any command for example passwd to change the root passwd you definitely have root access

305526
folder	directory
i want to create a compressed tape archive of a folder in a directory we ll call it a that i have put model output into

305553
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems is ntfs

305558
filesystems	ntfs
kernel filesystems ntfs does not support writes

305579
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
if you aren t an experienced linux user use a more friendly distribution such as elementary os linux mint or ubuntu

305584
nginx	lighttpd
to elaborate what are the advantages of using a dedicated web server lighttpd or nginx and running programs swift python as directed by the web server

305585
xfce	gnome
not sure about gnome xfce specific options but xbindkeys can do this

305587
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
the advantage of terminating here is that front end services like apache or nginx or lighttpd are dedicated to handling rogue traffic to logging of bad requests to being more secure

305600
ubuntu	debian
one of the confusing things i ve come across repeatedly on debian and ubuntu systems is there appear to be two ways of running and managing services

305600
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	sysv	systemd
from what i understand so far many linux distributions these days including debian and ubuntu are moving away from the old sysv systemd five and embracing systemd

305600
sysv	systemd
if systemd has replaced sysv why is sysv service still there

305618
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
fdisk from util-linux 2.27.1 in linux mint 18 ubuntu 16.04 lts xenial xerus says

traceroute	packets
you can also use tracepath or traceroute to make sure the destination is reachable or not something on your network or outside firewall may have blocked such traffic like icmp packets

305704
ubuntu	linux
rather than booting up a rather heavy linux distro like ubuntu from a live cd i am wondering is there a very lightweight way of going about this perhaps i can install this lightweight distro to a usb and boot from it

305722
disk	ram
a disk cache can also be a specified portion of random access memory ram

305722
disk	ram
can disk cache reside on both ram hard disk both

look at the shells you might have available on your system such as bash zsh ksh and read through their man pages to see what features they offer

305948
ubuntu	centos
pretty new to centos 7 and most of my earlier experiences were with ubuntu

305948
centos	linux
i have just set up an application on centos 7 and i saw on their product website that to run the application as a linux service start at system startup this is the script that one needs to use

305948
ubuntu	linux
1 the above script is perhaps for ubuntu or another linux distro

305948
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu has update-rc.d and i guess i need to use chkconfig for this

305964
folder	directory
i m thinking to write a function that first searches sub folder in current directory than issue many find commands for each of them but i feel there should be an easier way.

305968
ubuntu	centos
to run something on startup on centos 7 fedora and recent versions of ubuntu you need to create a systemd unit

305981

chown	chmod
if you want file var example.txt readable by gm and writable by ftp you could set its owner to ftp chown ftp var example.txt and set its permissions to 644 chmod 644 var example.txt or chmod u+rw o+r var example.txt

305995
ubuntu	debian
i have a debian host and a ubuntu guest

306035
rpm	yum
yum should then be able to install the dependency when installing the fincore rpm

306043
debian	linux
how can i convert the microphone jack to output audio to headphones in kali linux or debian linux

306043
debian	linux
but i don t know how to do it in kali linux which is basically debian

306069
ubuntu	linux
do it as described in this article network bonding wlan eth on linux ubuntu

306074
debian	linux
i am using debian kali linux 2.0 64 bit and am trying to install xmms player

306084
cpu	processors
my old eeepc901 has intel atom cpu n270 1.60ghz x 2 processors

306095
debian	linux
but where are the implementations for linux and how do i use them on debian to build a fully meshed brouter

306101
wav	flac
typically you would use this to create the wav files which can then be converted to flac format as necessary

306115
bash	zsh
this is a new upgraded variation on test from ksh that bash and zsh also support

306115
bash	zsh
another ksh extension that bash and zsh also support

306122
folder	directory
so somehow the mere existence of the core directory usr local cellar zsh 5.2 share zsh functions causes the vcs_info_get_data_git function to be loaded from var folder kb ydt74z19765cv9vb86rwvcrr0000gn t zsh-5.2-fpath.zwc

306130
hindi	tamil	hindi	thai	hebrew	hindi	hebrew	tamil	hebrew	thai	tamil	thai
it supports many scripts including latin greek cyrillic hindi tamil chinese japanese korean thai arabic and hebrew

306141
spaces	delimiter
also braces being keywords need to be delimiter and found in command position hence the spaces after and the

306141
int	double
â double parentheses surround an arithmetic instruction that is a computation on int with a syntax resembling other programming languages

306141
bash	zsh
this only exists in ksh bash zsh not in plain sh

306141
bash	zsh
double brackets are an alternate form of conditional expressions in ksh bash zsh with a few additional features for example you can write to test if a file is a symbolic link to a regular file whereas single brackets require

306141
bash	zsh
test if the value of x which is assumed to be numeric is at least 2 in bash ksh zsh

306152
mouse	trackpad
the system settings pane has only two options under mouse trackpad which are not helpful

306157
lvm	umount
is there any option to resize the root partition without umount in lvm

306181
dropbox	imgur
other actions allow you to drop and send a file to your printer upload an image to imageshack or imgur or copy a file to your public dropbox account

306184
move	drag
move the mouse at the bottom edge press alt + middle mouse button and then drag it

306190
debian-based	linux
and if you really wanna learn linux learn about some of its most-famous distributions redhat derivatives slackware debian-based .

306190
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
or if you wanna go further it s not bad if you learn about some other unix-like operating systems including macos x freebsd netbsd and openbsd

306201
versioning	upgrade
1 upgrade your kernel versioning the easy way is by following the steps described by stephen kitt s answer to install the 4.6 kernel versioning

306227
openvpn	iptables
what you want to achieve is probably very possible with pptpd or openvpn and iptables however you might find tinc a better candidate for this use case

306230
put	get
however when i put that in a script i get this error

306247
ubuntu	debian
don t you use ubuntu ppas in debian distribution many launchpad ppas are not compatible with debian since the packages are built on ubuntu libraries

306281
width	height
â change height and width to 5 x5 and pdf format

306290
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
instead it is meant to build .deb packages on arch packages that then can be installed on debian mint ubuntu etc

306299
ubuntu	linux
i m very new to linux and am currently on a journey to setup an ubuntu server with a 1tb maindisk supported by 2x 2tb data disks in a raid1 array

306311
tunnel	vpn
vpn tunnel occurs from aws linux instance to on prem linux server

306318
bash	zsh
in bash ksh93 mksh zsh

306328
filesystems	xfs
i am using a xfs filesystems at work for storing image processing data

306349
bash	zsh
but the single step option similar to zsh syntax below shows an error message bad substitution in bash

306398
debian	linux
my only system atm is on debian testing so i need to be able to set up the encryption from linux

306425
folder	directory
i have a zsh glob command that removes anything but the newest 10 directory within a folder

306458
unix	solaris
here s a difficult ssh problem i can t figure out on solaris 11 although i think i m an experienced unix linux sysadmin

306460
bash	zsh
and yes i m sure that i m running zsh and not bash or something

306461
put	get
so when you use to write into a file when the file is opened it is truncated before sed can get put it s contents in it and hence the empty file is what i think correct me if i m wrong

306477
openvpn	iptables
i have a virtualbox vm configured to route all of its traffic through a vpn using an openvpn script and iptables but that should not be relevant for the purposes of this question

306477
tunnel	vpn
ifconfig in the vpn vm only shows eth0 the interface used for the internet connection adapter and tun0 which i assume is the vpn tunnel

306491
filesystems	ntfs
i think i can achieve this using a debugfs -like tool but since filesystems is ntfs it seems to not work i get bad magic number in superior-block while opening filesystems error

306539
debian	centos
the commands you are running would be for centos 7 or debian jessie or ther systemd based services

306575
folder	directory
i have a folder name sample which contains sample1 and sample2 sub directory in it

306583
solaris	sunos
i hope this is compatible with your solaris - i tested it under a sunos 5.10 with bash 4.3.26

306597
single-quotes	double-quotes
tcl - understanding the usage of braces one of the answers says that curly braces are analogous to the shell s single-quotes and double-quotes act like the shell s double-quotes but does not clarify that the latter act within tcl and using double-quotes will produce an invalid command name a-z error

306600
bash	zsh
usagerequest.csv is a ksh globbing operator it only works with ksh also with zsh -o kshglob or bash -o extglob but those shells don t come by default on solaris

306605
switching	screens	kde	gnome
now some desktop environments lock screens kde gnome unity at least allow fast user switching which is what you are looking for

306605
kde	gnome
they either talk to the running display manager and ask it to launch a new session like in kde or launch a new nested display manager like in gnome

306612
bash	zsh
never worked on zsh but below code works very well on bash

306625
spaces	delimiter
if you set awk to split the input on slash delimiter and then resplit on spaces delimiter you can pick out the correct fields

306643
width	height
when using a square font panoptica i would like that it prints with the same ratio same width than height

306668
gentoo	linux
i m relatively new to gentoo and am self-taught on linux and i couldn t find a tutorial on repo maintenance in the gentoo forums there is a developer s guide but it assumes a lot of knowledge

306683
g++	gcc
ensure gcc and g++ are installed

306724
centos	linux
i use arch linux as my primary os and i work on a web app built for centos

306731
debian	linux
i am using kali linux 2.0 debian 64 bit and i was having some problems with sound output i went to a certain website which advised me to execute the following

306732
debian	linux
all that said kali linux uses debian repositories from which you can get everything available on debian with simple apt-get no need for compilation

306734
sudo	passwd
to do that you can use sudo in place of su to allow the users to obtain root privileges with their own passwd as aspose to roots

306743
sudoers	visudo
you can use sudo to grant a single user passwordless access to a single command by adding the following to your sudoers file edit it with sudo visudo

306752
unix	solaris
printf is not supported by solaris unix environment

306770
filesystems	xfs
thanks to responses in the comments i was able to identify the problem as xfs filesystems related

306770
filesystems	xfs
the xfs filesystems seems to be using the first one terabyte of the disk to do so

306771
spaces	linefeed
however if a filename contains one of the ifs characters typically spaces tab and linefeed the filename will be split in pieces and then be incorrectly stored in the array

306785
bluetooth	usb
this package contains the binary firmware for usb wireless network and bluetooth cards supported by the ar5523 ath3k ath6kl_sdio ath6kl_usb ath9k_htc or ath10k drivers

306785
bluetooth	usb
this package contains the binary firmware for usb wireless network and bluetooth cards supported by the ar5523 ar9170 ath3k ath6kl_sdio ath6kl_usb or ath9k_htc drivers

306797
ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora
the lsb info is parsed by insserv on older ubuntu and debian systems and by chkconfig on older redhat and fedora systems and is now parsed by on systems using systemd

306809
mouse	keyboard
the tiocsti ioctl can inject characters into a terminal or see instead uinput on linux to generate keyboard or mouse

306814
ssl	https
if it is being served over ssl likely you may have to explicitly specify https before 127.0.0.1 9392 so your full url is

306815
ubuntu	linux
i am running linux kernel 4.4.0 with ubuntu 16.0.4 lts with alsa for sound

306827
ssd	sata
i did but even for a 10mb limit i was still having huge wait times to copy a simple 800mb file from a sata to a the ssd mirror leg

306827
ssd	sata
for now i just disabled the root os s sata mirror leg one was on the ssd the other on a sata

306827
ssd	sata
as i also have 5 simple files that i use as swap on the ssd and were being mirrored to the sata my os was too annoying to be used

306849
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
run a â œnormalâ distribution such as elementary os linux mint ubuntu etc

306851
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
there are no linux filesystems that are really useful on removable media but fat and ntfs have the downside of not really supporting symlinks and execute flags which is difficult for git repositories for example

306855
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
if you aren t familiar with the linux command line and with networking use a friendlier distribution such as elementary os linux mint or ubuntu

306855
ubuntu	centos
if you need additional drivers to support your hardware you ll have an easier time finding or building them for popular distributions such as ubuntu and fedora or rhel centos than for kali

306895
bash	zsh
your shell may not support this kind of syntax i tested on bash and zsh

306920
debian	linux
i am trying to install linux debian 8.5 dd ed it successfully to usb stick on sd card of zenbook ux303ua

306920
ubuntu	linux
os ubuntu 16.04 64 bit linux kernel 4.7

306923
daemons	systemd
so the best practice is to make a systemd daemons

306931
sysv	systemd
yocto can create images utilizing either systemd or sysv init

306944
bash	zsh
even if rarely documented most bourne-like shells bourne ksh bash zsh not ash nor yash also support

306944
bash	zsh
the bourne shell ksh and zsh but not bash also support

306944
bash	zsh
while bash ksh and zsh but not the bourne shell support

306944
bash	zsh
all bourne bash ksh zsh support

306944
bash	zsh
ksh93 bash zsh support

306950
folder	directory
the source server has a upload folder containing 140 000+ files no sub directory

306990
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i ve installed linux mint 18 on my machine but it has a radeon hd graphics card which is not supported by amd on systems based on ubuntu 16.04 according to some research i did

307008
ubuntu	debian
using bash on ubuntu debian jessie sid i m not sure why i can t do tab completion of a wildcard with a builtin command

307017
bash	zsh
or with zsh bash or ksh93 here for bash ymmv with other shells

307021
ubuntu	linux
disclaimer i am not an experienced linux user but this worked on a clean digitalocean ubuntu install

307062
lvm	mdadm
i remember synology used to assemble raid parts using mdadm not lvm directly it may have changed since

307064
jobs	cron
look at prevent duplicate cron jobs

307090
debian	linux
i created a boot usb drive with arch linux and sucessfully installed it but didn t like it as much as i thought i would so i then created a boot usb drive with debian

307090
debian	linux
i tried clearing the existing arch linux paritions from the disk by re-creating the arch linux boot usb and using the shell and parted to remove them but this didn t make it visible to the debian installer either

307103
sudoers	passwd
create a new group zfsgroup add the users that need access to this command to the group and add a sudoers entry like which will allow users in the zfsgroup to run zpool commands without a passwd prompt

307112
ubuntu	linux
i am porting an application from windows to linux specifically ubuntu 14.04

307114
unix	bsd
what we can do is transpose the columns to rows using the rs utility originating from bsd unix then just sort the rows thus effectively sorting the columns of the original data and then transpose again

307114
ubuntu	linux
i did this on ubuntu gnu linux and first had to sudo apt-get install rs

307148
daemons	systemd
i need to implement some kind of daemons that would check who logged in with ip address and when what commands did that person use and other basic stuff like differences in edited files that would help me to be sure what s going on in my systemd

307159
bash	zsh
the string replacement syntax is ksh93 bash zsh mksh-specific

307162
centos	linux
it would be for a centos rhel type linux

307172
debian	linux
i m using linux debian wheezy.i have problem to sync time date between my server pc and the ntp servers looks like pointing at itself not internet

307172
min	max
rtt min avg max mdev 332.398 333.454 335.464 1.263 ms

folder	dir
and when i delete the app folder it is also gone using the dir command

307181
debian	linux
bad skylake 6th generation inter cpu support in the linux kernel of debian 8.5 which is complicating the graphics the extension of the thread how smooth is upgrading linux kernel in debian 8.5

307203
kde	gnome
it seems that xorg is functional how can i check if i have installed desktop manager lxdm lightdm and desktop enviroment gnome kde lxde

307210
debian	linux
i would like to upgrade my linux kernel to 4.7 in debian 8.5 since it has significant better skylake 6th generation support than the current linux kernel

307211
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade as above running apt-get upgrade will automatically upgrade to later versioning of the kernel once they become available in the backports

307213
rpm	yum
i am trying to create a local repository and install rpm packages from there using yum install

307223
debian	linux
upgrade to linux kernel 4.6 with backports which has sufficient skylake support as described in the thread how smooth is upgrading linux kernel in debian 8.5

307233
chgrp	chmod
use chmod g+w to add that to each of those append folder name to the command just like with chgrp

307281
centos	linux
so i want to use centos 7 as my desktop and i also don t want to leave arch linux completely

307308
ubuntu	linux
i just tried with ubuntu 16 and vmware workstation and with the no-preserve-root option it erased the entire disk of my running linux system

307314
tizen	bada
i think that is also the case with tizen bada and many j2me operating systems

307316
versioning	upgrade
i m running debian 7 stable and because the old versioning available on wheezy can t send out btc i d like to upgrade to a newer versioning which is available in jessie-backports

307323
debian	linux
debian 8.5 with linux kernel 4.6

307326
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
if this is a new server installation you may want to consider switching to centos which is the community supported version of redhat enterprise linux or fedora server

307329
debian	linux
backported linux kernel 4.6 and skylake cpu support and firmware installed thread how smooth is upgrading linux kernel in debian 8.5

307334
centos	linux
it is centos linux release 7.2.1511 core

307365
ubuntu	debian
so i am running debian testing and i installed the command-not-found package because i just love that functionality in ubuntu

307369
freebsd	linux
in freebsd similar to linux a fat32 formatted external volume da0 is mounted by root with

307378
stdout	stderr
so how is it printed to terminal at all as it seems not printed via either stdout or stderr and how can i suppress that message

307379
spaces	delimiter
okay now the actual data is messy because it has field headings delimiter with multiple spaces and they contain spaces themselves

307409
opensuse	linux
for those who would like to know i am using opensuse leap 42.1 as my linux distribution and i run apache with prefork mpm

307450
filesystems	xfs
since version 3.15 the kernel tells you the version of xfs used in each filesystems as it mounts it

307450
filesystems	xfs
older kernels officially supported xfs version 4 filesystems but could mount version 5 filesystems since mid 2013

307463
tunnel	vpn
i assume you re trying to reach the vpn server at it s public address and expecting this connection goes through the tunnel

307463
tunnel	vpn
this won t happen your client needs to connect to your vpn server over the public network to establish and maintain the tunnel

307485
stdout	stderr
my usual preference is for debugging messages to go to stderr so as to avoid interrupting the flow of data to stdout but i have avoided that here because you said you were a beginner

307493
versioning	upgrade
this tuto explain how to upgrade your current versioning and how to restore your data and your software selection

307524
debian	linux
i am trying to build curl on a linux debian system

307533
daemons	launchd
the script does lots of initialization and finally launchd the mongo daemons

307561
mouse	keyboard
you can setup a raspberry pi without using a monitor keyboard mouse and even without a network connection using pibakery a blocks based setup tool that allows you to configure settings modify files and install software before you even write the sd card

307578
stdout	stderr
here are some one liners that grep the error message on stdout stderr and do do not stop the program as soon as the error message appears

307578
stdout	stderr
for all stdout and stderr will not be merged and can be redirected independently from each other as usual

307579
stdout	stderr
make a demo function baz that outputs foo to stdout and bar to stderr

307579
stdout	stderr
simple case run grep foo on stdout and grep bar on stderr

307630
ubuntu	debian
1 ubuntu s help of common keybindings which i would like to find too in debian fig

307630

show only desktop - in ubuntu ctrl + d but cannot find it in keybindings not in any icons and not in debian s search of fig

307637
unix	bsd
super key is an alternative name for the windows key when using linux unix or bsd operating systems or software that originated on these systems

307646
debian	linux
firmwares updated and or installed as described in the thread how smooth is upgrading linux kernel in debian 8.5

307648
ubuntu	centos
server is centos 7 client is ubuntu 16.04

307648
ubuntu	centos
i also tried using ubuntu as a server and centos 7 as client with no avail

307676
zsh	subshell
zsh forks a child process for the subshell then another process for cmd1

307676
zsh	subshell
but for cmd2 given that it s the last command in the subshell zsh optimises out the fork

307676
zsh	subshell
now the bug was that in that case zsh forgot that we were in a subshell and assumed that implicit exec was actually terminating the shell replacing it with cmd2 and was then decrementing as cmd2 s parent would not be zsh anymore

307676
bash	tcsh
that allowed to fix it and find related bugs in bash and tcsh

307677
ubuntu	debian
other differences in debian in comparison to ubuntu

307689
mouse	keyboard
you can easily setup a rpi without a hdmi connection or a usb keyboard or mouse

307694
ubuntu	debian
no hovering help menu in debian like in ubuntu unity

307694
hide	show
keyboard shortcuts navigation hide all normal windows where i set the keybinding super + d to show hide desktop

307695
daemons	systemd
instead of using update-rc.d to enable your daemons use the systemd native command equivalent

307706
post	get
i found dave_nosleepowl s post on kali linux forum very helpful to get this problem resolved

307733
debian	linux
if there s a single newline on linux you can use the rename command called rename.ul on debian and derivatives

307736
bash	zsh
to get a proper command line shell change your login shell to bash or zsh

307736
bash	zsh
if that machine has restrictions which prevent you from changing your login shell you can tell sh to execute bash or zsh when logging in

307757
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
windows can t read those linux can read almost all filesystems there are and definitely every common one including the windows ones ntfs and fat

307758
gedit	sublimetext
1 a setting in gedit or or sublimetext to correctly save it the file for unix

307763
hide	show
therefore i want to hide the grub menu and if possible will only show when i edit the grub file again no keymaps if possible

307805
freebsd	linux
one further warning be careful that freebsd has installed its boot manager because if the primary booting system is linux you may need to restore the boot loader with a freebsd live cd after deleting the ebr partition

307825
ubuntu	debian
however now the manual control of brightness do not work anymore so the solution which works in ubuntu does not work in debian

307825
ubuntu	debian
i have tried here both and in etc default grub unsuccessfully where the option without splash is the default setting in debian in contrast to ubuntu

307825
ubuntu	debian
there is no directory usr share xorg.conf.d in debian in contrast to ubuntu so possibly similar work flow does not work in debian

307878
put	get
because if someone gets my laptop they dont need to put a password or anything in to get access to my raspberry pi if i leave the rsa key blank

307886
ubuntu	opensuse
the following file etc systemd system hylafax-faxgetty-ttyacm0.service which works fine in ubuntu and opensuse

307894
bash	zsh
install bash-preexec - preexec and precmd functions for bash just like zsh

307911
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for akady

307916
google-chrome	firefox
there are a lot of features in a graphical browser firefox google-chrome etc... they will be used to identify the user

307943
rpm	yum
use the yum download-only extension to make sure you download a proper rpm package

307960
ubuntu	debian
thus on debian and derived distributions apart from ubuntu and its derivatives you simply get unknown

307969
gentoo	linux
let s suppose in gentoo linux i m emerging a lot of packages with parallel emerging enabled and one of them fails because compiling its source code takes a lot of ram so the compiler ran into an out-of-memory and got axed

307972
daemons	systemd
you should probably consider converting to a native systemd unit as your init script is fairly typical and you could for example entirely remove the stop code and let systemd s default mechanism work for you since you have a pidfile where it can check that the daemons is running and so knows how to kill it see man systemd.kill

307979
debian	linux
i have a linux debian voyage installed on a flash card

307990
redhat	fedora
as pointed out in the excellent book a practical guide to fedora and redhat enterprise linux 6th edition

308004
interpreted-language	compiled-language
you have to make a difference between programs that are compiled to machine code from a compiled-language like c and interpreted-language like bash

308012
bash	zsh
it may not match exactly that man page because is builtin to most shells and ksh bash zsh etc may implement slightly different functionality

308034
sysv	systemd
i had this working as a cronjob in sysv init but lost my example when i lost my systemd after upgrading to lvm

308038
ansible	puppet
use config management like ansible puppet or chef to manage the installed package set and configuration

308048
torque	slurm
ubuntu includes two job schedulers that implement the posix nqs-derived interface torque and slurm

308056
filesystems	fat
i ve noticed that when i mount a fat filesystems on linux all of the files have their executable permissions set

308056
filesystems	fat
there s almost no chance that you can or want to directly execute any program found on a fat filesystems and having the executable bit implicitly set for all files seems annoying to me

308056
filesystems	fat
i understand that fat and other filesystems as well have no mode bits and so the 777 mode i m seeing on files is just simulated by the filesystems driver under unix

308059
rsa	dsa
generate key rsa or dsa

308082
filesystems	fat
fat may not be a posix-style filesystems that doesn t mean that you shouldn t be allowed to store executables on it and run them directly from it

308082
filesystems	fat
in the past when v fat was still used as the main filesystems for other operating systems dos and windows and hard drives were smaller it wasn t unusual to store unix linux binaries on a fat filesystems

308093
fat	umount	filesystems	fat
please also note that fat is not a journaling filesystems and as such is quite sensitive to corruption if not properly umount

308122
jobs	cron
systemd gets arguably complex far quicker than the old approachs with init files and cron jobs

308132
switching	screens
projector screens switching - fn + f8 for some reason this combination acts as if the p key is pressed

308141
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
in the course of 2 years of using linux mint ubuntu kernel this is the third time i ve managed to kill the system have learnt something every time

308141
folder	directory

installation	upgrade
did you recently upgrade the kernel on this installation

308151
filesystems	btrfs
in addition to a proper backup system you can use the snapshotting ability of some filesystems like btrfs zfs or llvm to keep snapshots of your system you can recover in the case you do something like this again - but they are not full backup solutions just allow for quicker recovery in the case of some failures

308157
chown	chmod
if i ve understood the problem correctly what about if you chown root root file so that user root owns the file and then chmod 444 file to disable any writing to it

308169
pull	push
i need your help in configuring the server in a way that developers can use pull push commit through ssh via their public key but only for their own project

308169
pull	push
for instance is there a way to say whenever x user with the public key of x_id_rsa.pub or with the request of git mygitserver.com git ios trying to push or pull data should be jailed to ios

308187
sudo	passwd
you can configure sudo to not ask for a passwd

308187
sudo	passwd
note that you need to specify the full path to iw and that you still need to run using sudo but now you won t be prompted for your passwd

308190
ubuntu	centos
the centos server and ubuntu host machine both has gedit installed

308211
hindi	tamil
as can be seen by the mediainfo there are two audio tracks one hindi and the other tamil

308211
hindi	tamil
by default it will take the hindi track as that is the default but what if i want the tamil track

308242
stdout	stderr
every process on linux systems has one input stdin and two outputs stdout stderr by default

308242
stdout	stderr
terminals take input from the keyboard and send it to stdin of the shell that they run and take stdout and stderr from the process and print it to the screen

308242
stdout	stderr
it also links their stdout and stderr to its own which the terminal then prints to the screen

308242
stdout	stderr
the same thing happens when you run a command inside a script stdin stdout and stderr are linked to that of the parent process these eventually propagate up to the terminal

308242
stdout	stderr
well you can override the default attaching of stdin stdout and stderr to where ever you want including files or other processes

308245
kde	gnome
the instructions for this will depend on which desktop you prefer gnome kde etc

308267
hindi	tamil
so yeah will be hindi and will be tamil

308267
hindi	tamil
and should play tamil is available and if not available shall try to find a hindi track

308273

308275
opensuse	linux
both drives now use gpt and i need to use both windows and linux opensuse via dual boot

308275
filesystems	btrfs
sdb2 as my storage for my pictures videos linux software music isos and other files that i need to share between operating systems as well as to be stored under a more personally preferred filesystems format my most preferred is btrfs because of its features and potential as a linux standard replacement for ext4

308282
x86	64bit
trying to find the most portable way to determine the cpu architecture of a system be it 32bit x86 64bit or something else arm

308286
solaris	sunos
the reason why the comment said not to install on solaris is because sun had provided this utility starting with sunos in the 1980s

308286
sunos	aix
aix and hpux have no arch program and like other sunos features copied into linux this one also is not in posix

308312
debian	mint
you can install it on mint there s a debian package or run it from a livecd liveusb

308312
filesystems	ntfs
run tune2fs -l on ext2 ext3 ext4 filesystems ntfsinfo to probe ntfs filesystems etc

308323
sudoers	passwd
i ve got the following entry in etc sudoers to allow me to run any command after asking for my passwd

308323

i ve tried putting the following line in etc sudoers but it always asks for a passwd when i run it

308375
chown	chmod
i tried few chown and chmod tricks with applying the sticky bit without success

install centos as usually reboot into linux mint and run the following command

308423
bash	zsh
is used in bourne-style shells including bash is used in the c shell and zsh

308423
bash	zsh
your prompt definition determines whether this appears in bash in a prompt definition is replaced by # or in zsh # is replaced by # or

308441
ubuntu	linux
such shells include for instance bash the shell of the gnu operating system some of those systems above ubuntu fedora actually extend the gnu os while using linux as a kernel

308441
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
you could say that you use an operating system like debian ubuntu or fedora but not really linux

308441
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
learning linux could refer to learning as a programmer the internals or the interfaces of that core component of a android ubuntu debian fedora operating system that is linux and as it is written in c you d have to learn c beforehand

308447
filesystems	ntfs
create first partition for data storage with filesystems as ntfs because fat32 does not support individual file not more than 4gb

308467
single-quotes	backslash
we still need to quote the in with single-quotes or a backslash so that the shell doesn t try to expand it.

308474
stdout	stderr
i d like to display colored messages to stdout or stderr depending on what happens

308476
ubuntu	linux
suppose somebody downloaded a linux distro like ubuntu

308511
debian	linux
on kali linux this could be somewhere else or under a different filename haven t used or tried kali linux but it s based off of debian

308511
debian	linux
and since kali linux is based off from debian and uses stretch packages as it seems according to my findings then on a pc that s connected to the internet search for the missing firmware and download their packages off from .

308516
disk	ram
the server has plenty of spare ram and free disk space

308529
punctuation	words
2yw j p 2de - yank two words ignoring punctuation go down 1 line paste before the cursor and delete two words

308568
stdout	stderr
to get around this add an output redirect for stdout and or stderr as appropriate

308568
stdout	stderr
here redirects the output stdout to the file tmp yum-out and the makes error output stderr go to the same file

308592
folder	directory
however dpkg doesn t copy files from deb package to fs but it complains that such folder don t exist no such file or directory

308604
ubuntu	debian
debian and its derivatives including ubuntu as far as i know have a src group which is intended for this albeit historically in usr src which used to be owned by the src group by default and group writable â that s no longer the case for systems installed after 2010 though

308629
octal	decimal
true for awk is either a non-empty string or a non-zero number with numbers being decimal integer or floating point and with some awk implementations hexadecimal or octal are supported as well

308667
bluetooth	usb
i frequently change source of internet usb bluetooth tether different wifi s and manually start updates from time to time as other sources than wifi are usually from mobile internet that is both slow and expensive for updates

308687
dnf	yum
i combined the detailed instructions from the original blog post and the more up to date instructions from the man page using dnf instead of yum

308731
rpm	dnf	rpm	yum	redhat	fedora	dnf	yum	centos	linux
when using dnf and yum on rpm based linux distros rhel redhat fedora centos etc the utility will automatically wrap lines to make it more friendly for the user to read

308732
dnf	yum
in the case of our dnf yum output we know that the wrapped lines will begin with one or more instances of white-space followed by a colon followed by more white-space

308734
dnf	yum
yum and dnf write progress messages overstriking a line by using carriage returns

308734
dnf	yum
when i capture output from yum or dnf i do not try piping to grep that is guaranteed to produce poor results

308742
ubuntu	debian
lftp is packaged in debian ubuntu and several rpm-based distros

308751

this config file contains a pull directive and the push ed config from the server contains

308760
bash	zsh
forgot to say that i want to do this in both bash and zsh

308768
sudo	passwd
if i run sudo -s it will ask me for root passwd and after i enter the root passwd i will have a root shell

308775
bash	zsh
neither bash nor zsh has this functionality

308776
centos	linux
i m trying to run firefox in headless mode in a centos linux release 7.0.1406 core

308797
ubuntu	linux
theoretically this is a difficult question to answer completely and it starts with what is your definition of linux ubuntu vs

308835
terminate	timeout
roaima rightly points you at the timeout command and head actually terminate after it has read the desired number of lines so i would hope that with

308844
terminate	timeout
timeout --foreground otherwise we would see just terminate

308887
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
this code snippet assumes you are using tr from gnu coreutils not a stock tr which comes with legacy unix systems such as sun solaris aix or hp-ux

309014
freebsd	debian
after switching from debian stable to debian testing i have a problem to mount my freebsd root partition on my system

309034
children	parent
first no you can t push an assignment like the into another process since the variables are internal to the shell and while exported variables propagate downwards to children there s no method to propagate them upwards to the parent and ancestors of a process

309044
ubuntu	linux
suppose somebody downloaded a linux distro like ubuntu

309051
debian	linux
but then if one generally suspected debian one would not run debian gnu linux at all would one

309058
debian	linux
i downloaded the 64-bit linux binaries .tar.xz for version 6.5.0 of node.js and extracted them to opt on my debian linux machine

309062
daemons	systemd
when you connect to a remote systemd using ssh a terminal emulator putty and run a foreground process something that stays opened not a daemons that runs in the background in that terminal that process will terminate once you disconnect from your ssh session

309066
theano	lasagne
i installed lasagne and theano with pip

309066
theano	lasagne
the contents of 2.7 has lasagne and theano but 3.5 only has easy_install.py

309066
theano	lasagne
the following snippet used to halt at the import theano statement but since reinstalling theano it now halts at the import lasagne statement

309083
udp	tcp
this would include tcp udp any other transport-layer protocols raw sockets and any others i may not be aware of

309089
udp	tcp
in most environments you would only expect to see tcp udp raw and packet sockets all of which are supported by ss

309089

309097
stdout	stderr
the first tee within the main process substitution sends stdout stderr to terminal and also to the nested process substitution the tee inside that saves the content in file tmp box-setup.log and the pipe is used to send the output to logger s stdin too

309103

onc rpc open network computing remote procedure call classically known as sun rpc is a network protocol layer for remote procedure calls on top of udp or tcp

309104

onc rpc also known as sun rpc is a family of networking protocols for remote procedure calls over udp and tcp

309110
freebsd	linux
it would be better to use an isolated environment that provides root privilege isolation such freebsd jails linux containers or docker

309120
stdout	stderr
it would be possible to use some file-descriptor cloning to give tee the original script s stdout rather than stderr

309122

ssd	sata
fyi it can be a problem installing linux mint 17.3 on newer post-2009 sata hdd that r 250gb or above in capacity or on ssd bc of newer hdd technology partitions not properly aligned with the disk

309147
ssd	sata
if u get this error message during install of linux mint 17.3 on an external usb hdd ssd u need to first use gparted which is included in the live dvd or usb-stick to realign the modern sata hard disk ie unmount the hdd ssd usually is dev sdb or dev sdc delete the whole old partition n create the 1st new partition meant for the or root partition eg 20gb in size with 1 mib the default value at the beginning of this space n 0 mib at the end of this space ensure mib alignment box is checked do not select cylinder set it as primary partition n format to fat32 file system quicker process ie no need to use ext 4 yet

309147
disk	ram
if u hv less than 4gb of ram u can also create a new 3rd partition for swap area eg set as 2gb in size for virtual memory ram on the hard disk .

309147
ssd	sata
seems the linux installer does not realign modern sata hdd ssd when u create a new partition table for the root home n swap partitions during the install process

can the files within such kind of folder directory be manipulated via both the os

309216
bash	tcsh
csh and tcsh doesn t support functions like bash but you can do it

309217
ubuntu	debian	debian-based	ubuntu
debian-based systems such as ubuntu use the debian alternatives system to determine which applications are linked in usr bin and other shared system directories

309219
debian	linux
the idea would be to contribute such a modification to linux distributions starting to package the btattach command like debian since right now many recent devices simply don t have bluetooth working out-of-the-box

309238

309522
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu detected that i had another linux installed so it added antergos to its grub menu

309544
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu also handle it by putting security updates in a separate repo

309549
bash	zsh
with zsh note that globignore is bash-specific neither bash nor zsh are installed by default on freebsd but both are available

309594

zsh bash and ksh93u+ and above can make use of temporary named pipes named pipes added in sysiii i believe where dev fd n are not available

309620
zsh	subshell	bash	zsh	bash	subshell
the is to work around the fact that in bash contrary to zsh or at t ksh in cmd | read vars the read command is run in a subshell

309620

alternatively with recent versions of bash you can use shopt -s lastpipe to have bash behave like zsh or ksh in this instance

just in case i have linux ubuntu 14.04 installed and a more or less standard .vimrc

309958

yum or more strictly rpm depends on the config inside the rpm to decide that a file is a configuration file a file marked with config noreplace will be saved as .rpmnew when an updated file happens to be in the newer rpm

309958
rpm	yum
download the rpm not update with you and repackage it with config noreplace for etc rc.d init.d sendmail and then install with yum

309958
rpm	yum
this will make yum never updated the sendmail package but it will still list it with yum check-update so you will know a new sendmail rpm is available

there are a number of web post suggesting that this can be done but but i could not find a single post telling me how to get this to really work

310713
bash	zsh
if you can not use ksh bash or zsh then backquote the regex

310753
rsa	aes
as far as i know rsa like every asymmetric encryption needs a high entropy to generate a matching private public key pair in contrast to for example aes because symmetric encryption really uses each bit entropy directly for encryption

310772
children	parent
you can send sigchld to its parent to let it know that one of its children has terminated request it to collect child s exit status

311406
stdout	stderr
now normally programs send normal output to the standard out stream stdout file handle #1 and error messages to the standard error stream stderr file handle #2

311406
stdout	stderr
it s a little more complicated under the covers send stderr to stdout

311406
stdout	stderr
in the second case we redirect stderr to stdout and so it is captured and stored in the variable

311415
packets	pcap
note this will only display the packets details you cannot use this to capture full packets dump in pcap format

311417
ubuntu	centos
i tried this out on both centos 6.7 and on ubuntu 12.04 with the same results

i installed debian jessie 8 with gnome and xfce desktop environment but when the operating system boots it goes straight into the xfce environment

311479
xfce	gnome
i thought it would load into the first option which is gnome and then if you wanted to go into xfce you would have to type a command in terminal that allows you to switch into xfce

311579
postfix	dovecot
postfix uses sasl for authentication and can have either the cyrus sasl library or dovecot as backends

311579

is there a way to do this in bash or zsh or perhaps directly in the terminal emulator

312005
ubuntu	linux
i had to reinstall windows in ahci mode instead of raid this is a dell xps 13 with an ssd drive i then shrunk about 100gigs to make room for linux ubuntu alongside windows and installed ubuntu from a flash drive

312007
filesystems	btrfs
i have a two-disk btrfs filesystems with the data and metadata both in raid1 via the btrfs feature not mdraid

312008
disk	ram
i personally suggest a persistent one just in case something goes wrong but if you re living dangerously and have sufficient ram a ram disk would work

312008
filesystems	btrfs	umount	btrfs
next you need to umount the btrfs filesystems if it was mounted and lock stop the dm-crypt device

312008
filesystems	btrfs
then go ahead and mount the btrfs filesystems again

312008
filesystems	btrfs
when the replace is done confirm the bad device has been dropped out of the filesystems btrfs fi show mount path and then you can lock close the failing drive and then remove the snapshot dmsetup remove sdj_divert

312048
ubuntu	linux
what is the most light weight linux system that is tailored for embedded devices i stumbled upon archlinux and ubuntu core snappy but did not get to find a clear answer to difference between two can anyone help with this

312051
ubuntu	linux
there are many differences between ubuntu and arch linux

312051
ubuntu	debian
with ubuntu core you get a ready-made distribution based on debian aimed towards embedded devices

312051
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu core is indeed tailored towards embedded systems whereas with arch linux you will have to do the tailoring yourself

312061
stdout	stderr
the last part redirects stderr to stdout in this case log.txt

312131
daemons	systemd
i donâ t know how to enable the polkit daemons service in openrc in systemd the service itâ s named polkit

312150
bash	zsh
the difference between bash and zsh that matters here is in the way run2 calls run specifically the effect of leaving unquoted

312150
bash	zsh
thus run2 a b c calls run with the argument a b in zsh the argument is passed unchanged but calls run with the two arguments a and b in bash split into whitespace-delimited pieces

312157
centos	linux
i run windows 10 on my host machine and through vmware recently installed a centos version of linux and installed an apache server

312166
kerberos	ldap
i don t know what the default setup is on centos it might be more complex to allow ldap authentication kerberos home directory automount etc

312195

filesystems	fat
they lack understanding of how things work in this case fat filesystems but they find one single way to make it work using rufus or other software that would fix their mess on-the-fly

312218
freebsd	linux
i was wondering if you could do a chroot from freebsd to gnu linux because i know that freebsd also has a compatibility layer for executable gnu linux

312228
free	malloc
these functions return the time by writing to variables in the process s address space which you d probably have to allocate by calling something like malloc and that may not work if your breakpoint stopped the program in the middle of a call to another malloc or free

312237
persistent	transient
companies building large storage systems write use redundancy over drives rewrite bad sectors and write algorithms to guess whether the fault was transient or persistent

312247
freebsd	linux
if you install linux abi support on freebsd you can simply execute a linux binary and it looks like a linux environment for this application with the exception that user homes are still available

312247

312248
dpkg	apt
i ve tried to install gdk gnome3 on it but since it doesn t have apt or dpkg i m stuck here

312250
dpkg	apt
if a distribution doesn t use the apt dpkg format for its packages and repositories installing the tool itself wouldn t help you much

312250
rpm	dnf	rpm	yum	dnf	yum
if â œcorelinuxâ is an rpm based distribution you could look for tools like dnf and or yum which normally are the corresponding tools on rpm based distributions

312258
jobs	cron
there is no way to set a global default shell for cron jobs

312286
dpkg	apt
installed but not configured is not tracked by apt only by dpkg

312290
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	rhel	suse
generally speaking each distribution only supports one low-level package manager dpkg with the deb package format on debian ubuntu mint â rpm with the rpm package format on fedora rhel suse â etc

312290
dnf	yum
for the most part each distribution has a single high-level package manager framework apt on debian dnf on newer fedora rhel yum on older fedora rhel etc. although occasionally you get a choice there

312290
ubuntu	debian
they re for debian ubuntu on top of debian ubuntu but once you ve installed schroot and debootstrap the setup is the same

312296
bash	zsh
in bash ksh or zsh you can use the conditional operator to compare two strings posix sh only has numeric comparisons

312298
folder	directory
i might want to reorganize home by moving files or folder to other directory without causing duplicate files or folder on the backup after i rerun grsync

switching	screens
switching monitors while on splash screens or grub2 also suggested here and here on my laptop i can switching monitors by pressing fn + f5 but i was not able to switching monitors before the operating system loaded

312341
pull	push
i could use which is a bandwidth monitoring tool but if hg itself could give details of the bandwidth it is using either during pull or push would be nice

312392
ubuntu	linux
whenever the machine linux 4.4.0-38-generic ubuntu 16.04 suspends to ram my western digital 2tb portable usb 3.0 hard drive model wdbu6y0020bbk will spin up and continue spinning indefinitely

312479
daemons	systemd
according to the systemd wikipedia page there are no non-linux operating systemd that run systemd although the systemdbsd project worked on porting some of the daemons to freebsd

312486
put	get
the algorithm to get the out put from the input is

312487
bash	zsh
keep in mind that in zsh unlike ksh bash array indices start at 1

suppose that systemd launchd the daemons foo which then launchd three other daemons bar1 bar2 and bar3

312491
daemons	systemd
i ve written a test daemons to test systemd s behavior

312491
children	parent
when i run sudo systemctl start mother_daemon.target after sudo systemctl daemon-reload i can see the parent daemon and the five children daemons

312491
children	parent
killing one of the children has no effect on the parent but killing the parent and thus triggering a restart does restart the children

312523
jobs	cron
you could crontab -e to edit your personal list of cron jobs and add the line

312569

i accidentally copied the folder in my music directory to the parent michal directory

312589
stdout	stderr
â is it in a file â if nothing is explicitly mentioned to stdout or stderr

centos	linux
now i am deploying project on centos linux server

312714

312736
versioning	upgrade
you can still pin a versioning though so you can control what and how you upgrade which is a nice option to have

312745
ubuntu	centos
while a certain level of increase 2 to 4 times is reported on centos and ubuntu -- which is as expected in run is expected due to my shared library s work the above

312753
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i would like to upgrade to the most current versioning which is linux mint 18 which is based on new ubuntu 16.04 lts

312753

i moved away from ubuntu to debian and having a problem with my find now for searching tex files for the word masi

312787

312834
chown	chmod
i set chown -r stack stack root and chmod 777 root but still cannot create a subfolder

312881
filesystems	fat
has to be a fat filesystems image with the necessary programs

312898
xfce	gnome
the de starts fine and at a certain point i still don t know what causes this the xfce desktop is transparently overlapped by the gnome one

312912
stdout	stderr
will tell you what the process stdin stdout and stderr file descriptors point to and the mode they were opened as like w ap for write-only with append as if a redirection was used in a posix shell

312933
stdout	stderr
this is because your function is printing to stdout not stderr try

312933
stdout	stderr
or redirect both stderr and stdout

312936
filtering	grouping
you need to grouping the filtering

312947
centos	linux
centos here but i don t think that matters because this should be a core linux question methinks

312947
centos	linux
while trying to install run apache kafka a java executable on a centos box i thought of a question that applies to linux in general

312957
stdout	stderr
also i m outputting the not found message on stderr instead of stdout and reporting the failure to find the file in the exit status

312979
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon
i think i ve installed gnome xfce or cinnamon when i was deciding between desktop environments and window managers a while ago

313021
apache	nginx
most services kafka redis nginx etc installed using a package manager yum apt etc install helper scripts to facilitate the control of those services and create unique service users associated with those services apache redis nginx etc. nearly all of these helper scripts are executed as root initially and then drop privileges to a service user assigned to that service

313028
stdout	stderr
while ssh provides for two separate output streams for stdout and stderr it only feeds one input stream stdin

313035
wpa	dhcp
i changed my rc.conf file here is what i added ifconfig_wlan0 wpa dhcp

313047
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
linux debian ubuntu have trouble if you have graphics card esp

313050
vmware	virtualbox
if your hosting provider gives you ssh access to a vm virtualbox vmware xen whatever then it s highly unlikely you will be able to see the physical hardware your system lives on

313069
versioning	upgrade
rather than rolling your own install etckeeper which automatically commits modification in your chosen versioning control system on package upgrade

313069
bazaar	git
when you make changes commit them git commit or hg commit or bazaar commit or darcs record with an explicit log message to remember why you did it

313073
spaces	delimiter
since your delimiter will always be a spaces dash spaces sequence - you can do this

313089
folder	directory
i have a very large folder the directory is about 1.7â t in size and contains a decent amount of files

313131
comm	grep
i have tried this but doesn t work ps -eo euser ruser suser fuser f comm label | grep processname

313146
csplit	grep
a combination of grep and csplit could do the job by a grep ping all non-commeneted lines plus the preceeding info one and b splitting the output based on the info comment line

313155
freebsd	linux
you are trying to map linux ps options and field name to freebsd ps options and keywords this is one of the main obvious differences between a linux-like system and a bsd-style one

313159
ubuntu	debian
build your openssh with the patch from debian ubuntu

313187
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
failing with an error is the most sensible thing to do and is what zsh and fish csh tcsh bash -o failglob and the original unix shell does

313205
folder	directory
if you really want the first file in directory order and assuming all folder names start with folder_ all entries starting with folder_ are directory and all entries stating with i

313237
rpm	yum
i would choose all vmware-tools- package in this directory and better choose the last repository vmware for vmware_esx55 and install it the dependancy will be find by yum with a yum localinstall if rpm or by yum install vmware-tools- if you have add the new depot

313250
sudoers	visudo
i highly recommend using the visudo command to edit your sudoers file in the future to prevent having to go through this again as visudo does a syntax check on the file before saving it

313251
put	get
also must put the rule into the correct place for it to get the

313252
sudoers	passwd
if you know the root passwd and it is set you can use su to became root and edit etc sudoers

313268
folder	directory
basically what i need to do is put all the mp4 s from the -888 folder in one new directory all the mp4 s from the -777 folder in another new directory and so on

313268
folder	directory
i tried pulling all the mp4 s for all the directory thinking then i could split them out from there into a single folder with the following command

313268
folder	directory
this did pull all the mp4 out of my stacks of folder but instead of putting them in the videos directory that i had created it instead merged them all in a single file called videos

313287
versioning	upgrade
do not upgrade your gcc versioning

313307
rar	zip
several extensions are used depending on the archive format mainly .cbr for rar archives and .cbz for zip archives

313337
stdout	stderr
when you redirect stdout or stderr to write to a file the shell will first truncate the file to prepare it for writing

313344
stdout	stderr
i understand that this checks to see if atleast 3 file descriptors are open presumably for stdin stdout and stderr by checking if the newly allocated file descriptor is above or same as 3

313409
versioning	upgrade
on which i have to apply some special archive in order to upgrade them to the latest development versioning of our product

313420
chgrp	chmod
the first command then applies the chgrp and then a chmod to reinstate the setuid bit that has been knocked off

313420
chgrp	chmod
in any case you don t want to call chgrp or chmod on symlinks as that would affect their targets instead hence the

313425
chown	chgrp
the clearing of the setuid setgid bit at least on linux on non-directories is done by the kernel upon the chown system call done by chgrp not by chgrp itself

313427
chown	chgrp
clearing suid and sgid bits on chgrp or chown is perfectly reasonable

313427
chown	chgrp
addendum on the claim that chgrp or chown should only clear sgid or suid resp.

313427
chown	chgrp
by chown ing or chgrp ing you change the security setting for an executable and this is sufficient reason to clear any privilege elevating attributes

313429
ubuntu	linux
i have heard it said before that ubuntu has the best hardware support of any linux distro but i m confused how that could be the case

313441
gentoo	ubuntu
however if we compare gentoo - the distro known for compiling almost everything from source code and doing things from scratch with ubuntu - the distro which s noob-friendly we will see that if you want to get your standard laptop configuration webcam microphone speakers and optimus dual graphics card setup you need to do much more on gentoo side - you need to find proper drivers to compile compile them and set up configuration so that x recognizes both cards

313441
gentoo	ubuntu
ubuntu is plug-and-play gentoo requires some handwork

313470
unix	bsd
default unix or bsd columns

313474
gentoo	centos
i know gentoo centos suse redhat .

313474
versioning	upgrade
what i needed is to know the list of available versioning of a package that i want to upgrade not just the latest versioning

313474
versioning	upgrade
this is useful for instance when i know the latest versioning at the time of the upgrade of a package is buggy and i want to try the previous one if it also happens to be an upgrade of the currently installed versioning on my system

313498
ubuntu	linux
i have a dynamic wordpress website with multiple plugins installed over an aws ec2 t2.micro instance with a linux ubuntu 16.04

313502
spaces	linefeed
my distro s tab completion don t even get this right so we ll just wildcard this example mountpoint with carriage returns and linefeed and runs of spaces

313526
versioning	upgrade
please note that packages in arch linux do not usually specifiy versioning bounds on their dependencies because partial upgrade are unsupported so installing older versioning of some packages is not a good idea

313558
ubuntu	debian
both wall and write on debian and ubuntu use setgid set-group-id privilege to the tty group to allow those programs to write into the terminals of other users

313590
kde	gnome
so usually when you run a graphical session like kde or gnome such an agent is in fact running

313590
kde	gnome
as to why kde would behave differently from gnome is not clear

313633
vpn	lan	tunnel	vpn	tunnel	wan	tunnel	lan	wan	subnet	wan	lan
what you are referring to as the wan network is still local so cannot be accessed through the vpn tunnel but is a distinct subnet from your lan segment

313641
chown	passwd
i am using fedora 24 and i think the apache user is called apache well at least there is an apache user in the file passwd the folder where i wanted to run cgi files is with permission 777 and has changed the user to apache with chown but still gives 403 error

313683
sorting	grouping
is there a better way of sorting and grouping domains and subdomains together

313692
pull	push
note on push pull iselect starts with a list in which nothing is selected

313712
stdout	stderr
i have activated a daemon s debugging facility which causes the daemon to print debugging info to stdout and or stderr

313712
stdout	stderr
how can i persuade start-stop-daemon 8 as invoked by lib lsb init-functions to redirect the daemon s stdout and stderr to my debugging log file root log

313712
stdout	stderr
at any rate how shall i redirect the daemon s stdout and stderr

313712
daemons	systemd
lsb evidently delegates the management of the daemons to systemd

313725
versioning	upgrade
in trying to fix various compiler and dependency issues i ll admit i was flailing around running random commands from the internet- problems started after i attempted to upgrade libboost and then attempted to revert it to the previous versioning i ve apparently managed to completely hose the apt-get system

313728
pulseaudio	dbus
it is also wise to reboot to recreate session authority dbus and pulseaudio cookies most installations of lxde will be using those

313733
hash	md5
here are some of the characters as reported by getfattr -n user.cksm.md5 the first line is just to aid in counting the characters which ought to number 32 for an md5 hash

313737
min	max
the min max values are used to build the output filename and all the files are written there in order

313744
folder	directory
my goal is to delete a thumbnail folder that exists in each of these directory ie delete this folder html car_images inventory 16128 thumbnails and also delete html car_images inventory 16115 thumbnails

313756
sysv	systemd
systemd already logs the standard outputs errors of services that are auto-generated by the sysv service generator as this one is

313756
sysv	systemd
the sysv service generator has made an exim4.service somewhere under run systemd that invokes your etc init.d exim4 as the service

313772
daemons	systemd
the linux watchdog daemons should be used for systemd reset jobs though it can also run a repair binary on persistent errors that could be used to fix or restart a process

313772
daemons	systemd
generally speaking to monitor daemons processes and restart them you should use the init upstart systemd supported methods as already answered and keep the watchdog operation for the most serious only a reboot is likely to fix things situations

313787
sudo	passwd
if i mount the partitions via nautilus the encrypted one prompts me for my passwd which i enter then sudo lsblk returns

313800
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m running linux mint 17.3 ubuntu 14.04

313802
versioning	upgrade
otherwise you have to upgrade vmware to a more recent versioning that was compiled with gcc-6.1.1 or you have to find gcc-5.4.0 for kali from other sources

313807
erlang	elixir
i therefore purged that erlang install sudo apt-get purge esl-erlang and went to the erlang installation web page which also has a tab for elixir

313809
filesystems	btrfs
to put it succintly ext4 is a filesystems where as btrfs is a filesystems integrated with a volume manager

313809
filesystems	btrfs
and home are btrfs subvolumes on the same btrfs filesystems

313809
filesystems	btrfs
there s only one partition with a btrfs filesystems

313810
firefox	safari
edit it seems to work on some web browsers but firefox on mac still redirect me to the http site while firefox on windows safari redirect me to https ._

313817
switching	screens
however i now sometimes open the vm on a monitor which has lower resolution than my laptop and i d like to change the dpi on the fly when switching between using the laptop screens and the monitor

313857
temp	tmp
it is causing sqlite errors due to sqlite not being able to write a temp file to tmp which is very disruptive

313858
debian	linux
i m a relative linux newby just trying to move my computing from windows 10 to debian

313867
google-chrome	firefox
it is available on google-chrome and firefox and it s open source

313921
next	except
there s no way to transfer the current count from one command to the next except by storing it somewhere in a file which would be very slow

313938
chown	chmod
now all of these commands lead to segfault ls rm mv less chown chmod .

313952
width	height
i have many figures of width x height 550-570 x 465-486 at the southwest logically set there by matlab s movegui function

313952
width	height
meuh s command shows those figure dimensions width x height their hex codes and titles where i would like to move windows of size 560 x 475 for width x height respectively to workspace 2

313965
postfix	dovecot
i have set up a mailserver using postfix dovecot as my sasl and rainloop as my webclient

313973
hide	show
last but not least do not underestimate the possibility in modern source code editors to show or to hide selectively separate routines code folding

313974
linefeed	delimiter
your syntax error near unexpected token fi cannot be explained with the code you posted unless both then and else are followed by invisible characters like a cr character as when files come from microsoft os where the line delimiter is crlf instead of just linefeed

313984
spaces	delimiter
i ve got a number of .dat files variable with 2 pieces of information in them each a weight and a height spaces delimiter like the following where first_last is a name

314001
folder	directory
for example dolphin is showing forever the loading folder bar for home root or any other local directory

314022
freebsd	linux
for instance with the ps from procps on linux it will output pid tty time cmd columns where cmd is the process name not command args while on freebsd it outputs pid tt stat time command with command being the args

314022
bash	zsh
or using ksh93 bash zsh or yash none of which are posix commands that is a shell with builtin regular expression matching

314023
fish	zsh	redhat	fedora
redhat fedora centos install autojump-zsh for zsh autojump-fish for fish etc.

314028
daemons	systemd
the daemons is stopped leaving the halt to complete and the systemd shuts down as it normally does in a few seconds

314069
bash	zsh
if we limit to bourne like shells the ones that support arrays in chronological order are ksh bash zsh and yash

314076
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
they seem to be caused by libnvidia-glcore and libnvidia-eglcore forcing them through apt dpkg aptitude doesn t seem to work

314077
debian	linux
i have a debian jessie linux system with an internal rtc clock which the user can adjust or change

314092
ubuntu	debian
if not to make it the default usually already the case on debian and derivative like ubuntu

314107
width	height
you can use a small awk script to filter out the required window ids using the width and height in space-separated columns 5 and 6

314110
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
just follow the instructions for debian and ubuntu which should also work with mint

314110
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu users can now use my personal ppa to download and install the network-manager-sstp and sstp-client project via launchpad

314127
daemons	systemd
by the way are you aware that ntpd can handle being disconnected from its upstream time servers and that having the daemons running over a long period of time can help minimise the drift inherent in most systemd clocks

314166
folder	directory
mount cifs directory to the folder where the backups are stored

314179
rpm	yum
i don t have connection to the internet so i can t use yum only rpm

314200
bash	zsh
... ksh extended glob operator for negation so in ksh zsh -o kshglob or bash -o extglob

314257
jobs	cron
the goal is that we have root access and the ability to install and run software changing cron jobs and so on

314269
xargs	zcat
xargs zcat |

314269
xargs	zcat
xargs zcat |

314272
stdout	stderr
i have a long running process which is writing status information to stdout and logging debug information to stderr

314272
stdout	stderr
i would like to pipe the stderr output to logger so that anything written to stderr actually ends up going to syslog while at the same time being able to read the process stdout

314275
stdout	stderr
the idea being that the outer stdout is duplicated onto file descriptor fd 3 and restored for cmd onto stdout while cmd s file descriptor 2 stderr itself goes to the pipe to logger

314299
int	chars
introduces a chars class not an int interval

314304
solaris	aix
is sssd supported on aix and solaris

314310
solaris	aix
sssd is not included with either solaris or aix

314310
solaris	aix
solaris and aix have their own way of handling authentication

314314
ubuntu	debian
in this case you need to configure the x server via the xorg.conf file see here for locations on ubuntu on my debian system i put it into etc x11 xorg.conf which is the traditional location

314314
kde	gnome
the display manager for the gnome desktop is called gdm the display manager for kde is called kdm

314332
filesystems	fat
i need to construct in code suitable for scripting make automation a disk image two partitions a fat filesystems and an ext4 filesystems for uefi syslinux usb linux booting os installer which will never change in production of a size that holds exactly or very close to a set of files of arbitrary size

314332
filesystems	fat
in other words given a set of built files i need to know how to generate fat and ext4 filesystems images and the disk image that is partitioned to hold them that have sizes computed to result in as close to zero space free as reasonable to have

314332
filesystems	fat
i m creating the files using dd to allocate the disk image parted dd to allocation the fat filesystems mkfs.vfat dd for the ext4 mkfs.ext4 kpartx to map the partitions dd to write the fat partition dd to write the ext4 partition and finally dd to write the disk image to a usb for booting on actual hardware

314332
filesystems	fat
ext4 filesystems can be shrunk and i see fat filesystems can be shrunk

314335
mouse	keyboard
i don t need physical keyboard or mouse support at all

314373
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
system linux mint 18 base ubuntu 16.04

314402
debian	linux
i have debian gnu linux 7 without gui

314405
ubuntu	debian
blacklisting it depends on the distribution you use on debian and probably ubuntu too make a file in etc modprobe.d that contains the line

314428
ubuntu	linux
i have a host linux 16.04 ubuntu machine inside this i have a couple of containers

314444
int	chars
for some reason newer versions of mutt 1.7 showed that problem prefix the date string with chars 14 and 32 which keep atoi from converting the string to an int

314446
xfce	cinnamon
fouad reports that he has the same issue under xfce but not under cinnamon

314496
ubuntu	debian
for the interface name part you should check this file if it s there on ubuntu i have it on debian

314528
redhat	fedora
i have found that the system crontab etc crontab in many redhat el fedora based distributions contains the line

314538
jobs	cron
the of cron jobs likely emulates that so that random possibly long-running jobs are not needlessly in a directory in urgent need of un- or re-mounting

314554
debian	linux
this is on linux debian 4.9.2-10

314556
bash	zsh
on the other hand more feature rich shells like ksh bash zsh allow sig prefix in front of the signal name

314564
bash	shellcheck
you can check common errors in bash scripts with shellcheck which works online but is also available as an offline program

314566
bash	subshell
i just ran across the following bash construct i understand this is called compound-list and that those three cat commands are executed in a subshell environment what i do not get is how the pipes fit in there and more generally how it works

314603
debian	centos
every time i am configuring a debian or centos machine with a static ip address i forget about that behavior of not taking in account my ipv4 configuration

314603
debian	linux
linux deb-router 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.81-2 x86_64 gnu linux

314607
google-chrome	firefox
i have searched for people in similar situations but mostly found out about people who could not make google-chrome go fullscreen but for whom firefox would

314607
google-chrome	firefox
in my case i can only get fullscreen to work in google-chrome and not in firefox

314607
google-chrome	firefox
what i mean is that when i press f11 google-chrome covers correctly xmobar above but firefox not

314631
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
answer in other shell zsh fish etc is welcome since bash doesn t speed up my workflow lately

314634
multiplying	division
we take the range 0..n which represents the span of the entire data list and multiplying this range by 5 then divide using truncating integer division by 100

314644
spaces	delimiter
the file is spaces delimiter

314690
folder	directory
in this directory is a counter-strike game server that requires the permissions of the folder and all the files in it to be user1 rwe read write execute

314710
min	max
it is possible and very straightforward to traverse and perform some database-like operations on a single csv text file column sums averages min max subsets etc but not on two files with some connection between them

314740
bash	subshell
and i can t even learn the version of bash bash --version command creates a subshell

314755
ubuntu	linux
this question can be generalized to ubuntu or any other linux distro

314777
freebsd	solaris
supporting gnu or solaris 11 sleep arguments one or more durations so would also work with traditional implementations that support only one decimal integer number like on freebsd but not with those accepting more complex arguments like iso-8601 durations

314786
ubuntu	debian
there s a related change to the ubuntu package and to the upstream debian package

314786
ubuntu	debian
hat tip to steeldriver for finding the debian ubuntu changelogs

314788
jobs	cron
we organize cron jobs by storing them in etc cron.d

314788
jobs	cron
what command lets you see all the cron jobs that are scheduled to run

314791
jobs	cron
which is not advisable to use as it s meant for distribution cron jobs

314797
filesystems	xfs
unfortunately it hit an xfs data structure so you ve lost some filesystems metadata

314797
filesystems	btrfs
some filesystems btrfs with duplicate mode can keep two copies of their metadata or your data also protecting against bad sectors

314812
bluetooth	usb
your usb bluetooth radio is not burning 5 watts

314871
filesystems	xfs
only if i enter 18mb 18432 i get the 16mb which is the minimum size for using the xfs filesystems

314873
cinnamon	gnome
they don t say how to replace completely gnome by cinnamon

314873
cinnamon	gnome
how to replace completely gnome by cinnamon

314888
kde	kubuntu
kubuntu mint kde are obviously very similar so i m not sure if it was a worthwhile test

314888
ubuntu	debian
both were kde both were using sddm and both were based on ubuntu debian

314912
udp	tcp
tcp + udp

314912
udp	tcp
this correctly log tcp and udp first packet

314924
cinnamon	gnome
i think is a strange bug in cinnamon or gnome keyboard settings

314940
lvm	btrfs
there are situations where btrfs should be run on lvm

314952
chown	chmod
i want change the ownership chown and permissions chmod with the following rules

315053
chgrp	mkdir	chgrp	chdir	chgrp	chmod	chmod	chdir	chmod	mkdir	put	get	chown	mkdir	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod	chown	chdir	mkdir	chdir
sftp will abort if any of the following commands fail get put reget rename ln rm mkdir chdir ls lchdir chmod chown chgrp lpwd df symlink and lmkdir

315064
mouse	keyboard
plus i did the same for event streams with and which are physical mouse and keyboard

315118
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
this means that backported packages are never considered for automatic installation nor are they valid candidates for upgrade from stable versioning

315118
versioning	upgrade
but once you have installed a backported versioning of a package you will get backported upgrade for that package automatically

315137
opensuse	linux
this happens on linux 4.6.7-1-manjaro but does not on opensuse leap 42.1

315163
debian	linux
so before even trying to patch the linux kernel i would like to prepare a simple way to reproduce the issue as the original report is done within a minimal setup during debian installation process

315167
bash	zsh
or with zsh or bash

315168
spaces	delimiter
finally - cut -f2 -d - getting the second field spaces delimiter

315183
inherited	properties
hdd was chosen in your configuration because this is the base mountpoint where your pool has been mounted and zfs uses inherited for propagating certain properties

315191
filesystems	btrfs
some filesystems types such as btrfs and zfs have a built-in snapshot ability

315196
pulseaudio	dbus
the application uses dbus to communicate with the pulseaudio server

315201
daemons	systemd
a keep-up daemons like monit or runsv can watch the systemd and ensure that your syslogd service is running

315244
xfce	kde
this happens no matter what display manager i use i ve tried several or what session type i try my usual is xfce but i ve tried lxde kde and others

315247
kate	kde
i am trying to run kde 5 in a vnc session and although i get application windows like konsole kate etc the shell i need for the start menus taskbar desktop background etc is not present

315272
debian	linux
as our web hosting technician recovered our linux debian squeeze system i ve lost man exetubable

315283
cpu	irq
nic drivers create an interrupt receive queue per cpu receive side scaling and hence you see 2 irq s

315334
post	get
the use of a post instead of just a get url makes the browser ask the user to confirm the post if they just do a refresh

315335
jobs	cron
look at your system s cron jobs systemd timers and the setup of packagekit gnome software etc

315335
debian	linux
i know i have some debian systems which generate no internet trafic but that s not something specific to debian â it should be possible to set any linux system up that way

315341
ubuntu	debian
on debian or ubuntu systems this is admin

315341
sudoers	visudo
you may want to review the man pages for sudo sudoers and visudo

315368
bash	zsh
bash zsh ksh93 only trick

315370
unixodbc	iodbc
is there any conflict with having unixodbc and iodbc installed at the same time

315414
bash	zsh
my environment is man 2.6.3 centos 7.2 3.10.0-327.13.1.el7.x86_64 bash 4.2.46 1 or zsh 5.0.2

315435
freebsd	centos
freebsd s manpage repository tells me centos 7 s man does support -h

315451
ubuntu	centos
but that is in ubuntu not centos

315462
bash	zsh
the emacs mode equivalent and that could be used to repeat more than a single character echo 0 ctrl+w alt+1 alt+6 ctrl+y works in zsh but not in bash

315462
zsh	tcsh
all those will also work with zsh and tcsh where that comes from

315467
int	double
when i finished and tried to compile again i got hundreds of errors saying mono is not recognizing microsoft common target file types like object int double etc

315470
udp	tcp
although some of the aforementioned toolkits can be used to build udp servers in similar fashion to how one can use them to build tcp servers c.f

315483
ansible	puppet
you can also manage your server with tools like puppet or chef or ansible

315530
x86	64bit
there are different tars for 32-bit and 64bit x86 cpu architectures

315555
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
os linux mint 18 sarah 64bit ubuntu 16.04 lts

315564
wan	lan
iperf is an excellent client-server tool for monitoring bandwidth network utilization across connections whether it be lan or wan

315568
bash	zsh
if you observe different behavior with ls in bash and in zsh it s because you have an alias or function called ls in one of the shells but not in the other

315568
bash	zsh
the behavior you re observing in zsh corresponds to what ls does so you must be calling it with additional options in bash

315580
kde	gnome
i want to change default desktop environment from gnome to kde

315588
ubuntu	linux
i have slight linux knowledge but since i can t actually get into ubuntu to run any commands i don t know what to do at this point

315611
bash	zsh
one likely cause for the seeming difference in the output of ls -l between zsh and bash is the use of tab -completion with auto_remove_slash enabled in zsh which is the default

315611
bash	zsh
when typing ls -l symb tab both zsh and bash will complete this to ls -l symboliclink note the at the end

315637
debian	linux
to solve this issue my first attempt was create a third linux machine with debian

315643
filesystems	xfs
we expect the following local filesystems to work as they are tested often ext2 ext3 jfs reiserfs xfs

315643
filesystems	ntfs
these local filesystems may work or may have a few minor-ish issues iso9660 ntfs reiser4 udf

315643
filesystems	fat
any filesystems based on fat or not having the ability to provide permanent inode numbers will have trouble with nfs versions 2 and 3 see question c4

315735
mouse	keyboard
these correspond to disk i o events keyboard and mouse events and interrupt irq events

315741
children	parent
otherwise some ps text-fu is necessary to only signal the parent process not its children

315757
folder	directory
i am looking for direction to create some sort of if then statement that can run through the entire parent directory through each of the client folder and perform this action

315799
folder	directory
is there some way to set up the folder directory so shh can access authorized_keys postfix mail can access files it requires the system can access config files but without all and sundry walking the system

315865
post	get
there are several answers which to post processing to get the needed information

315897
apache	nginx
i have done these using apache but unable to do it for nginx

315924
google-chrome	firefox
yes especially if you compile big application firefox google-chrome or kde by yourself or if a heavily used library libc openssl or libpng has been updated since all depending ports need to update

315939
bash	zsh
with gnu sed and a shell like zsh or bash with shopt -s globstar

315940
debian	linux
on a desktop debian jessie gnu linux install the file etc resolvconf update-libc.d avahi-daemon contains

315957
rpm	yum
to list all is imo not directly possible with rpm but in yum case untested

315970
screens	hdpi
with x i am settings my secondary non hdpi screens to scaled with xrandr --output edp-1 --auto --output dp-1-8 --auto --panning 3840x2400+3840+0 --scale 2x2 --right-of edp-1

315972
linefeed	delimiter
to clarify the linefeed aka n or newline character is the line delimiter it s not the line separator

316001
integer	fractions
but that would remove the fractions part instead of giving you the nearest integer and that wouldn t work for values of float like 1.2e9 or .12 for instance....

316002
puts	gets
however the file that gets written from the puts line only contains the following

316011
folder	directory
files folder and directory permission changes

316017
filesystems	btrfs
if you need snapshots for a data-only filesystems i strongly suggest you look at zfs or maybe btrfs

316021
debian	linux
debian 9 stretch will be released with linux 4.9

316036
single-quotes	backslash
escape the dollar sign with a backslash or use single-quotes to prevent the expansion

316055
ubuntu	debian
i ve run this on debian and ubuntu with kernels ranging from 3.16 - 4.7

316057
bash	subshell
but you can make a terminal description with the actual screen size and use that in a subshell which bash would use in the case where the system cannot supply a proper screensize

316086
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have experienced this problem on elementary os loki which is based on ubuntu 16.04 lts and i traced back a partial solution to ubuntu 11.04 so i think this is definitely a sort of persistent ubuntu issue and as we know linux mint is very closely related to ubuntu

316093
tunnel	packets
routing to return packets through the tunnel

316093
subnet	packets
it seems that they are something called policy based routing - when a packets comes from the vpn subnet it will route it back through the vpn gateway by changing it s routing table to vpn

316108
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
at that point i thought the others were broken because of a quirk in the ubuntu debian base until i stumbled across this blog post and realized that opensuse was using kde v5.8

316108
ubuntu	debian
at that point i went on a mission to find an ubuntu or debian based distro that shipped with kde 5.8 and that s when i found kde neon

316120
bash	subshell
if you re using a subshell and you get timestamps in your host shell that should be there automatically but for the bash -c version or a script you ll need to set it

316121
folder	directory
regardless whether you are several folder levels above or below the commands cd and cd do the same thing and do not differ - it will send you back to your home directory

316125
filesystems	fat
it seems that your backup target is probably a fat filesystems

316140
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
questions specific to the debian jessie official distribution stable testing or unstable and its derivatives mint jessie ubuntu jessie kali jessie etc but use also the distribution tag

316141
kde	gnome
if you choose minimal components which don t pull in gnome or kde you get a fairly minimal graphical system

316152
unix	solaris
the feature set of netstat on this build seems to be limited compared to later solaris versions and other unix operating systems

316155
zsh	tcsh
in tcsh or zsh alt+ctrl+_ in emacs mode copy-prev-word widget inserts the last word so

316155
zsh	tcsh
to have alt+ctrl+_ do both the copy snarf and paste yank like in tcsh zsh

316165
jobs	cron
the fhs allows for things like the conventional setup of cron jobs that regularly purge tmp of old files

316168
sysv	systemd
it s also not in the correct form that is prescribed for old van smoorenburg rc scripts by debian policy hence the sysv rather than lsb that systemd has prefixed to its description

316193
hex	binary
i am trying to convert a hex line to binary in bash but the output includes a backslash

316205
debian	linux
i ve installed strongswan on a raspberry pi with rasbian debian gnu linux 7.11 wheezy linux 4.1.19-v7+ armv7l

316238
ubuntu	debian
i m using mac os sierra btw but i m sure the same answer will apply to the ubuntu and debian remotes i have set up

316256
centos	linux
select linux virtual machine centos 7 1511

316279
minix	linux
the linux world has a collection of clones and reimplementations as did minix before it

316300
ubuntu	debian
as an alternative to the bsd style arguments shown in the other answers one can use at least using procps shipped by debian and ubuntu

316314
for-loop	loops
i constructed a bash for-loop that loops through all the data values but it s rather inefficient and i m sure there s better ways of doing this

316376
versioning	upgrade
an upgrade to openbox versioning 3.6.1-3 should resolve this issue

316422
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
currently two filesystems i might like to cache with ssd to avoid disks spin ups are ext4 on lvm and btrfs

316432
sudo	passwd
we can set up a key for the ipa user and they can shell in without a passwd using the key but i m not sure how to then allow the ipa user to sudo the program as root

316432
sudo	passwd
i ve tried to find solutions and there are quite a few basic how to s on how to set up ipa access and how to allow a local user to sudo with no passwd but i can t find the info that i need

316433
folder	directory
how do i go about compressing a folder tar1 and sending that compressed folder to a different directory lets say called tar2

316450
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
when i developed a simple benchmarking usb stick for evaluating linux cluster nodes i examined the minimal debian and centos systems you can install to find out the details op is asking except that i was not looking for a minimal system but a small lightweight system that can run the same binaries as are run on the final cluster itself

316457
traceroute	nmap
i figure there has to be some way to pipe that argument or something to the nmap traceroute command but i have no idea how to do this

316459
traceroute	nmap
that way nmap will exclusively show a host and make a traceroute if the host reply the icmp request ping

316471
google-chrome	firefox
i mainly use firefox for my browsing needs but at some point i ran into not being able to watch videos on twitter and found that google-chrome could play them except that i couldn t hear anything

316471
google-chrome	firefox
some investigation showed that it was due to the fact that these were html5 videos and neither firefox nor google-chrome would produce sound on html5 videos as tested on youtube for example while flash on both worked fine

316481
versioning	upgrade
add the jessie backports to your sources.list and you can upgrade to r versioning 3.3.1 at least with just apt

316505
ubuntu	debian
as a more general solution for debian packages including ubuntu you can find the configure options in the debian rules file that link takes you directly to the version used in 14.04

316512
freebsd	linux
i think i can t achieve this with freebsd so i will stay on linux

316522
tail	nohup
exec . script.sh nohup tail log

316553
debian	centos	apache	nginx
here is a proper guide on how to install most recent version of mod_pagespeed module for apache or nginx on rhel centos and debian based systems

316559
punctuation	words
this returns all words minus any spaces or punctuation with one words per line

316564
bash	zsh
here i d use zsh instead of bash that has a dedicated operator for that

316564
bash	zsh
edit a working solution for bash and other posix shells would be to separate the tilde and other expansions like in zsh and use eval with a here-document for the other expansions part like

316583
postfix	dovecot
i am trying to setup postfix with virtual domain forward to dovecot lmtp

316594
uniq	grep
cat text.txt | tr n | grep -v words |word2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nk1

316594
uniq	grep
cat file.txt|tr n | grep -v -w an |a |is | sort| uniq -c| sort -nk1|tail

316600
debian	mint	debian	linux
distro linux mint 18 tried also on debian 8.6 with the same result

316602
put	get
i ve tried a few times but there were really 2 outcomes suse hijacked the bootprocess anyway or left my pc unbootable installed xubuntu over suse to get it to boot again then put windows back into the mbr left xubuntu unbootable but hey windows booted again

316616
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
checking recent freebsd netbsd and openbsd none produce this behavior

316616
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
linux and unix aix hpux solaris likewise do not

316629
ubuntu	debian
i have a headless debian server headless in the sense that i just installed the standard debian jessie package uninstalled gnome and installed xdm on a dell xps 420 on which i am running xdm as the minimal x setup according to the hashcat webpage s instructions on configuring an ubuntu server

316630
filesystems	xfs
an xfs filesystems to write

316689
mouse	keyboard
so this works using a trackball button instead of keyboard shortcut because the driver only sees events from the mouse not from the keyboard and will convert movement into wheel events and not rotation

316689
mouse	keyboard
you will need to combine the drivers for the keyboard and the mouse so wheel emulation can be triggered by keypresses

316692
freebsd	debian
i want to install freebsd alongside my debian arch and kali installs but i m having problem creating a bootable usb

316722
folder	directory
i tried a little experiment where i created 2 folder dir1 and dir2 inside my desktop directory such that dir1 is parent of dir2

316735
mouse	keyboard
i realised i had a few minutes left to catch the train so i disconnected the mouse keyboard and monitor from my laptop shove it in the bag and ran

316735
mouse	keyboard
i checked the syslog and the last events are the mouse keyboard disconnection

316735
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m using linux mint 17.2 ubuntu 14.04 derivative

316744
sysv	systemd
i was a bit surprised as i am using sysv and have systemd pinned to -1

316765
ubuntu	debian
is it for instance in all of the debian derivatives or at least the ubuntu ones

316765
redhat	fedora
how about the redhat fedora centos ecosystem

316768
fish	bash	inherited	properties
posix shells like bash and fish make the path of the current working directory a process properties inherited by children and preserved across execution of commands in the special variable in posix shells

316788
ubuntu	linux
my problem is that when i run the same on alpine linux which uses busybox then the exit status is 0 after timeout had to kill the command but when i use the timeout command from the busybox package in ubuntu it exits with 143

316843
vte	ncurses
depending on how old vte may depend upon a bundled termcap file which was read via ncurses from 2008 or before

316843
vte	ncurses
applications which use vte are unaffected by this they use ncurses with terminfo some applications use the termcap interface of ncurses which uses terminfo underneath

316862
vim	emacs
if the user has decided they actually prefer one editor over another they ll know enough to replace it with vim emacs etc themselves

316881
centos	linux
i am trying to connect mysql db with xampp in linux centos

316907
chown	mount
i have another linux device which mount the samba shared drive and i would execute from this second device a chown on a folder but i don t have the permission

316912
gnu	groff
other hard-coded applications offhand which may not work properly include gnu grep and groff

316941
zsh	eshell	bash	zsh
eshell is not a replacement for system shells such as bash or zsh

316944
filesystems	btrfs
so yes btrfs is the default filesystems for root

316951
rar	zip
there are many archive formats tar tar.gz tar.bz2 zip rar tar.xz and more

316954
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
newer filesystems like btrfs xfs and zfs with less orthodox formats are likely to do things differently and i don t know much about the filesystems used on say bsd systems

316973
g++	gcc
if i want to switch whole toolchain gcc g++ gfortran ... i have to do it tool by tool

316975
bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
so to answer your question safely we d need to know if your intention includes posix portability or if you are interested in a particular implementation such as bash dash tcsh etc

316986
wan	lan
and i add capture on the wan interface and on the lan interface and i found

316988
debian	linux
i run debian on my lokal nas zyxcel nsa 325 and want to install a printer epson stylus sx 125 i not advanced in linux and use my nas only as a samba storage

317022
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	sunos	freebsd	netbsd	sunos	bsd	sunos	netbsd	solaris	bsd	solaris	sunos	solaris	netbsd	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	sunos	openbsd	netbsd
linux distributions solaris since sunos 4 and solaris 2.1 netbsd 4.0 and later freebsd 7.0 and later dragonfly bsd and openbsd 5.5 and later tmp is usually a tmpfs a ram-based filesystem

317028
disk	ram
linux just caches the stuff on your disk by default and puts what it caches in the used section of ram

317029
freebsd	linux
if i search for this error message online all i can find are answers on freebsd mailing lists forums saying don t worry it s a linux specific error we freebsders don t need to worry about it

317073
folder	directory
so i was messing around with permissions on a linux box and was trying to change permissions so a user couldnt access any folder other than what is in their home directory

317073
folder	directory
i did sudo chmod 0750 home guest and it stopped them from accessing the other folder in home but not the root directory

317076
folder	directory
you have to copy in the root directory of the flash drive the folder pmagic that is inside multiboot pmagic 20xx_xx_xx and hopefully yumi will find the .sqfs file

317091
bash	zsh
works for bash and zsh

317110
folder	directory
to use it install node and run the node.js file using the command nodejs main.js put the index.html and style.css files in a sub directory relative to the folder with node.js called public without the quotes

317137
zsh	tcsh
if you see a at the end of a filename in the output of ls actually of ls -f but ls is sometimes aliased to ls -f or the ls-f builtin in tcsh or of zsh or tcsh completions that s something completely different

317137
zsh	tcsh
zsh and tcsh do the same when listing file name completions

317138
folder	directory
i would like to recursively update the date modified field of a directory and all its subdirectories so that every folder has the same date modified timestamp as the most recently modified file that is contained within the tree

317161
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
it requires an ext4 xfs or btrfs filesystems or tmpfs

317166
fgets	fread
then just use fread fgets or any -type read function you want to read from the file stream

317176
ssl	https
this morning when i introduced a new ssl certificate for the second site and altered the virtualhost configuration accordingly listen on port 443 instead point it to the cert files etc. instead of serving the second site as expected it served the original https site instead

317186
ubuntu	opensuse
i had first ubuntu with plasma desktop installed by the lab worked ok except with second screen and docking station which i decided to replace by opensuse leap 42.1 with plasma too

317186
mouse	keyboard
nevertheless after 3 to 15 min maximum the desktop would ranomly freeze the mouse would stutter twice then everything would freeze no mouse or keyboard control had to reset with power button

317203
wav	flac	mp3	flac	mp3	wav
the best i could have would be the mp3 embedded in wav or whatever lossless compression such as flac

317272
ubuntu	debian
since debian 9 and ubuntu 16.04 this file does not exist

317278
versioning	upgrade
i have kali linux kernel versioning 4.3 and prefer not to upgrade to 4.6

317307
xfce	gnome
i m using xfce on arch linux and i have gnome installed too

317344
openbsd	netbsd
netbsd and openbsd of course went off into other tangents

317378
copying	overwrite
i m copying files from a git repository into a virtualhost folder although none of the following commands do overwrite existing files

317378
copying	overwrite
edit quick test copying files from the webdir to the repo does overwrite files so apparently something www-data

317383
subshell	ifs
where removes the leading dot if it exists and join all the remaining positional parameters with the value of the first character of ifs which was set to be | for the execution of the subshell

317394
tunnel	vpn
this should forward anything coming from the private network eth0 into the vpn tunnel tun0 correct

317394
vpn	traceroute
in the tests i ve done traceroute ping etc. with the nat table alone i can see my outbound internet connection stops at the raspberry pi when i disconnect the vpn

317427
tunnel	packets
summarizing just a tunnel background theory all the ipv6 packets are put into ipv4 packets and send through the tunnel and when go out this ipv4 header is removed and deliver to the system

317427
tunnel	packets
each tun interface has attached a handmade program to put remove the headers i need gtp before write read the packets to from tunnel if4a with fd00 fea 2001 1 address and if4b with fd00 fea 2002 1 address

317455
tunnel	vpn
naturally the vpn tunnel is not working

317475
ubuntu	linux
i have tried both x32 and x64 for ubuntu and linux os and i always get the same result

317538
debian	linux
linux debian correctly reads the partition layout at boot time so some of the sectors on the drive are still good - the problem is that partition autodetect also reads some of the bad sectors so i wind up unable to get at the good sectors

317553
switching	screens
those save restore the cursor position before after switching to from the alternate screens

317553
switching	screens
configuring putty 4.6.4 disabling switching to the alternate screens

317563
stdout	stderr
to write stderr to screen and write both stderr and stdout to a file -- and have the lines for stderr and stdout come out in the same sequence they would if both were written to the screen

317563
stdout	stderr
in simple terms write each to its own file do some background-process magic to mark each line in each file with the exact time the line was produced and then tail --follow the stderr file to the screen but to see both stderr and stdout together -- in sequence -- sort the two files with exact-time markings on each line together

317563
stdout	stderr
in the end to see the results from both stdout and stderr in the sequence you would expect run this

317563
stdout	stderr
the only reason the sequence is at least very close to what it would have been had both stdout and stderr simply gone to the screen is every single line is marked with a timestamp down to the millisecond

317565
sudo	passwd
if i remove sudo from the command i m prompted to enter a passwd

317565
bash	subshell
for these two reasons using subshell and delay in sh over bash i decided sh is not suitable solution

317565
bash	subshell
so since i m using a subshell i need to use bash

317585
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	minix	freebsd	aix	minix	aix	solaris	minix	solaris	aix
i ve checked the online man pages for solaris hp-ux aix freebsd sco openserver sco unixware minix 2 ultrix 2.11bsd and os x

317592
width	height
dump screen width and height cursor position and all the character-attribute pairs

317592
freebsd	debian
if you are not satisfied with it try mkitalic from freebsd or bdfslant from debian

317617
bash	zsh
or with zsh ksh93 or bash

317652
jobs	cron
previous attempts included cron jobs failed due to lack of stdin or stdout

317653
ubuntu	debian
plain standard sh doesn t support and neither does dash which is used as sh on debian and ubuntu

317678
put	get
since that means your zip command doesn t have any input files it doesn t have anything to put into the output zip file so you get

317690
openbsd	solaris	openbsd	linux
the server a is solaris machine and server b is suse linux with openbsd sshd

317701
debian	linux
context linux 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u5 2015-10-09 x86_64 gnu linux

317703
spaces	delimiter
for xargs words are blank delimiter whether it s all blanks or only spaces and tab depends on the xargs implementation though xargs also recognises and as quoting operators that can be used to escape those blanks or each other

317706
folder	directory
one of folder in my directory is an volume folder mounted from another machine this one was shutdown

317713
stdout	stderr
since nohup only springs into action when it detects that stdout stderr are connected to a terminal and does nothing when the output goes to a pipe and ssh s way of launching it looks like it s being piped you get the behaviour you re seeing

317740
ubuntu	centos
1 i often run ubuntu and centos vms on a machine who graphic card does not play nicely with virtualbox s 3d acceleration bug in the drivers

317754
versioning	upgrade
apt-get upgrade install newest versioning for only current installed packages but only when no package must be removed or a new one be installed

317765
stdout	stderr
takes stdout and stderr and redirects it to null

317767
stdout	stderr
this writes the command to stderr and the standard output to stdout

317850
debian	linux
debian gnu linux

317880
vpn	traceroute
doing a traceroute confirms requests going out to 8.8.8.8 is over the vpn and by configuration dhcp implied the client will default to the pi for its dns which in turn uses this configuration

317899
cpu	affinity
on linux the system call to set the cpu affinity for a process is sched_setaffinity

317899
cpu	affinity
if you want to dedicate one cpu to that single process only and prevent other processes from running on that cpu you d need to set their affinity too

317899
affinity	processors
you d need to set the processors affinity of init very early in the boot process to make sure it gets inherited to all processes on the system

317904
stdout	stderr
by running this command i execute okular in the background redirect stdout and stderr to dev null and disown it from bash

komodo	atom-editor
i quite like vi atom-editor and komodo edit but i am opened to something new too

317916
rpm	yum
firstly it s important to understand how yum and rpm work together

317916
rpm	yum
yum is a higher-level program which installs an rpm package and its dependencies

317916
rpm	yum
if you have a package url you can run rpm -i but if you don t have the dependencies of the package installed you will need to install them either one by one with rpm -i painful or with yum and a configured repository

317916
ubuntu	debian
debian packages do not have their gpg signatures checked and the official packages from both the ubuntu and debian project repositories are not gpg signed

317916
rpm	yum
as far a rpm and yum gpg signatures

317916
rpm	yum
i wrote two extensive blog posts about gpg and yum rpm as well as gpg and apt

317933
ubuntu	debian
it should be available on all debian derivatives including ubuntu

317954
ubuntu	centos
it used to run fine for years but recent updates on both centos 7 and ubuntu to his client pcs now make this impossible

317960
folder	directory
packages don t track the files that packaged software creates in a user s home directory so it s perfectly normal that neither dpkg-query nor dpkg-deb know about that particular folder

317967
debian-based	opensuse
my trackpad has worked fine without configuration on debian-based distros and opensuse tumbleweed however on arch it becomes absolute each corner of the trackpad directly corresponds to a corner of the screen so i can t really click on things unless i keep my finger in exactly the same spot

317991
centos	linux
check if centos has the patched kernel if not decide between taking the risks of compiling linux yourself or hope that no one gets to execute arbitrary code on your system and actually uses that exploit to do something

318037
umask	chmod
using umask 0022 before making the copy you will get all new files with -rw-r--r-- permissions by default but files can be made executable only invoking directly chmod +x on them

318042
execl	fork
this indicates that the man page for fork is in section 2 and the man page for execl is in section 3

318048
put	get
basically this is a guarantee provided by git the data you put in is the data you get out

318048
pull	push
you just do git status to see if you have to pull push commit changes to keep up with the origin

318061
sysv	systemd
using the old sysv systemd lpsched etc.. how to see the print

318098
debian	linux

libcurl	nghttp2
i am trying to compile libcurl with nghttp2 on my centos server

318155
gentoo	ubuntu
sure there are differences between a ubuntu and a lfs or a completely self compiled gentoo

318155

318192
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
where can i find the nmcli features that i had with ubuntu on linux mint

318203
unix	bsd
there is a standard unix utility at least for the 4.3 bsd we re running that

318204
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
why does nmcli on linux mint 17 differ from nmcli on recent ubuntu versions

318204
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
because linux mint 17 use the nmcli 0.9.8.8 version and ubuntu 16.04 and linux mint 18 use the 1.2.2 version

318204
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
where can i find the nmcli features that i had with ubuntu on linux mint

318225
centos	linux
auto login to linux console in centos 6

318235
sudo	passwd
if you have sudo set up then it doesn t care about the root passwd and you can still use it

318254
put	get
if connection.zone is blank interfaces get put in the zone specified as default

318258
folder	directory
obviously when you access steam games from a folder games need to be able to update when they become available which means that directory needs to have read-write permissions to do so otherwise it ll return no error or in this case content file locked which means the game cannot run because permissions have been changed by windows

318258
folder	directory
is there some kind of hidden flag or file i can apply to folder directory

318320
virtualbox	parallels
virtualbox or parallels

with zsh but not bash you can use null as well

318506
spaces	delimiter
the file in its current version is spaces delimiter

318507

you have put the glob token in wrong place put if before as you are using ## or # to get rid of the portion from left

318573
bash	zsh
i just stumbled over a script with works in bash but not in zsh

318573
bash	zsh
and is there a version that works in zsh and bash

318588
debian	linux
i m new to debian and linux in general so don t really know my options or how involved each might be

318606
put	get
there are only three files allowed in a plugin tarball a bash script as backend a html file as frontend and a validation.json file for input validation from frontend so please don t ask why i don t just put the deb packages into the tarball -- they get ignored

318630
spaces	delimiter
the cut command is simply using spaces as a delimiter -d and selecting which fields -f to leave

318669
int	chars
if you don t want to use the sort command you can convert each chars to int and have an if statement to verify the last chars is less than the next.

318712
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i prefer to use arch linux on my desktop as they do never have a version for operating systems like ubuntu debian etc so never have to bother about eol

318712

i prefer to have a os like debian ubuntu because i can configure unattendedupgrades

318712

bash	subshell
if there are no intermediate files being created i would suggest adding a bash or other shell prefix to force it to be run in a subshell

318794
debian	linux
i m trying to install linux debian on a laptop bought second hand a lenovo thinkpad t440p it had a hd with windows installed and everything worked fine including all usb port

318824
mouse	keyboard
we also tried doing the mouse movements with shift and other keyboard combinations without positive results

318827
division	modulo
to understand the value of the modulo division remainder you may play around with this awk snippet

318834
stdout	stderr
it only closes stdin stdout stderr changing work directory to root etc

318838
udp	tcp
further requirement is that reliability is the most important thing that s why i m looking for tcp ip and not udp

318848
post	get
the characters get also displayed on some web forms too which makes it very difficult for me to post even this

318863
centos	linux
i m using a centos linux distribution

318881
chown	mount
boot into resucue mode mount your server disk in mnt then chown stuff back to root...

318889
ubuntu	debian
i run a docker container that contains a lightweight debian and an app on a ubuntu remote-server

318889
ubuntu	debian
do i have to setup https just for the ubuntu remote-server or do i also need to adjust the debian running inside the container

318906
centos	linux
hey new to linux here and i just got centos 7.2 up and running on my pc

318911
lvm	mdadm
ok so this has been fun to diagnose but i ve learned a bit about lvm and brushed up on my mdadm so overall not a bad day

318911
lvm	mdadm
what i m trying to accomplish is migrate 2 external enclosures with multiple 2 devices mdadm raid1 mirros setup underneath of a giant lvm

318914

although this was my fault and dumb i am not a fan of lvm + mdadm + external enclosures

318922
ubuntu	centos
how do i get with basic portable eg generally preinstalled in ubuntu centos etc eg grep sed or tr command to just the raw text with the subtitle timing removed and all in one line no newlines

318929
debian	linux
some distributions like arch linux and debian unstable or testing have â œrolling releasesâ upgrades come in small pieces a few packages at a time and there are upgrades pretty much every day

318929
installation	upgrade
either way your installation will reach end of life if you don t upgrade it

318986
bash	zsh
you d need to use the ksh extended glob operators a subset of which is available in bash with shopt -s extglob and with zsh with set -o kshglob to get the equivalent of regular expressions though with a different syntax for the equivalent of here

319007
debian	linux
when i plugged it on my debian linux i found that it mounted on both dev sdb1 and dev sdb2

319008
backslash	double-quotes
double-quotes on the format string to keep the backslash intact to the remote

319018
folder	directory
it will mount the image in a newly created folder inside the same directory as the image and that folder will be deleted when the unmount option is selected for the iso

319042
ubuntu	debian
if you re keen to stick with the debian family but flexible about ubuntu proxmox looks like a popular option

319042
redhat	fedora
my impression is that the virtualization tools in the fedora redhat centos family are pretty strong

319064
comm	grep
apart from the comm and diff solution you could use grep for this

319067
centos	linux
i have a linux appliance running on centos and i would need it to go through our proxy for crl lookups

319068
fflush	gets
your echo t input is ignored most probably because svn fflush the stream before asking the user for input so the string provided by echo gets discarded

319093
versioning	upgrade
or you can decide that you specifically want to install xen-linux-system-3.2.0-4-amd64 by using sudo apt-get install xen-linux-system-3.2.0-4-amd64 in which case you will only have this one versioning of the kernel installed and won t ever upgrade to a new versioning of the kernel though you might upgrade to a new versioning of the package

319121
jobs	cron
looks to be off by a second but that shouldn t make my cron jobs run a full hour off schedule right

319126
stdout	stderr
probably the easiest thing to do if you don t mind merging stdout and stderr is to run with the -x flag which makes bash print each command as it is executed with a prefix like +++ where the number of characters comes from the nesting level

319154
for-loop	arrays
skip the for-loop and copy all files in a single command this way the glob creates an arrays and the shell can expand the elements in the arrays in the way shown above

319168
cpu	affinity
process and thread scheduling has grown quite complex over the years because there are more and more factors to take into account cpu affinity cache affinity interrupt handling power envelopes.

319210
debian	linux
using windows disk manager i created 200gb partition for my debian linux because i want to have dual os in my laptop

319219
versioning	upgrade
if you are using a vps or dedicated server the hosting company should be able to provide you directions on how to upgrade the php versioning or they may even be able to upgrade it for you

319264
chown	chmod
you can do that en masse using chown and chmod or restore them from backups using getfacl and setfacl thanks to sato katsura for the reminder

319299
bash	zsh
bash ksh93 and zsh have a dedicated operator for extended regexp matching

319310
ubuntu	mint
sarah is a mint code-name not an ubuntu code-name so it makes no sense to try to use a sarah repository hosted by canonical

319323
bash	subshell
from bash 1 each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process in a subshell

319380
dnf	yum

mouse	keyboard
no mouse or keyboard

319411
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard work fine we quit the application and since the touchscreen has been used at least once already we can now reopen the app and everything works fine

319411
mouse	keyboard
because the finished product will require the computer to boot directly into the application and the standard user will not have access to either mouse or keyboard i was hoping someone who knew more about linux input devices could point me a way to either script a touch event from a startup script or had some better solution for the problem that we are having

319413
disk	ram
cpu ram network or disk i o

319430
switching	screens
by convention those may have the escape sequences for switching to from the alternate screens

319430
switching	screens
in xterm you can enable disable the switching to from the alternate screens

319440
versioning	upgrade
during the upgrade the slightly newer versioning requires the host to match the server definition in the config file

without further ado here are my cron jobs

319459
jobs	cron
also i changed my system clock to be eastern time does that mean the cron jobs will run using the eastern time zone

319467
jobs	cron
your cron jobs are not written correctly

319504
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i m batch processing a folder of image to a uniform width with graphicsmagick though i assume the same would apply to imagemagick

319505
jobs	cron
application servers also need to have regular scrubbing and maintenance specially when it comes to logs grooming log rotation configured or cron jobs cleaning it up

319525
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
please tell me what is the best somewhat lightweight linux distro can be installed in virtualbox and has a similar package selection to opensuse or ubuntu

319530
ubuntu	linux
i have been using a windows 10 arch linux and ubuntu triple boot for the last year without any problems

319544
filesystems	ntfs
at some point you shrank the ntfs filesystems represented here as dev sda5 so that you had space to install linux

319544
filesystems	ntfs
that ntfs filesystems has not been shrunk correctly and its superblock equivalent still considers the full 440gb is available to it

319562
versioning	upgrade
so whenever you feel that you need to upgrade the system-wide versioning of pip or any of the python modules but don t want to interfere with the files managed by the package manager you should do the following

319585
freebsd	linux
i have recently decided to install freebsd on my desktop but i still have several computers running gnu linux and i would like to share disk partitions between the two oss in particular

319585
freebsd	linux
the computer using freebsd will also have a gnu linux distribution installed and i would like to have a shared partition that can be read written by both freebsd and gnu linux

319585
freebsd	linux
by reading various documentation and online forums i understood that ext2 is the only solution right now ufs write-support in linux is still experimental freebsd has limited support for ext3 and supports ext4 and reiserfs read-only

319593
perl	tcl
as an aside note that some languages tcl php have an exec that is not at all like the shell or perl exec or the c exec 3 functions so if you re using or familiar with those languages beware this difference

319593
perl	tcl
the tcl and php versions are more akin to the c system 3 or perl system function or typing the commands into a shell in that the original process is still around afterwards.

319596
xfce	gnome
gnome disks does not have an xfce equivalent it can be used for a number of tasks so if it doesn t require too many other packages then you might well want to keep it installed

319601

319685
icmp	tcp
that is true for all packets except icmp ping reply or tcp ack packets

i found and read the nvidia and nvidia optimus archlinux wiki because yes manjaro is archlinux based

320649
libcurl	httr
httr depends on the openssl and libcurl package

320653
stdout	stderr
echo two lines to stderr and tee stderr to a file grep the tee and pipe back out to stdout

320671
bash	zsh
i m horrible at zsh bash scripting and could use some help with this

320673
stdout	stderr
this redirects stderr into stdout then sends stdout to dev null

320675
put	get
so this file seems to be a good thing where you might change the hibernation system but the man file is confusing and i don t get what i have to put in there

320681
udp	tcp
somehow iptraf is telling me that i am getting traffic via port 443 in udp instead of tcp

320685
filesystems	btrfs
i m trying to install different linux distributions inside a single btrfs filesystems using a subvolume for each in order to avoid wasting free space using different partitions

320695
bash	zsh
this code goes in your shell startup script .zshrc for zsh .bashrc for bash in bash you also need the wrappers to call chpwd on a directory change

320702
fish	zsh
it seems that zsh sets it without sigwinch likewise fish

320746
rpm	yum
my understanding is that yum and rpm puts and remove files

320760
stdout	stderr
only redirects standard out stdout but when whatis cannot find information about a file it writes that to a different stream stderr

320760
stdout	stderr
you can redirect both stdout and stderr like or you could redirect stderr to stdout by doing

320804
sudoers	visudo
the file etc sudoers should always be changed by the visudo -command which opens the content of the actual file in a temporary file and does some checks before saving the changes

320833
put	get
i want to put a header to file but i get the first comma in the output

320835
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i had a dual-boot system of ubuntu 14.04 and linux mint 18

320835
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
from grub i used to be able to choose ubuntu or linux mint 18 on sda2

320851
openvpn	iptables
i am using iptables to nat the openvpn connection tun0 and forward packets from eth0 to it

320852
ubuntu	linux
which is odd because its on the other ubuntu 10 server which i setup as well with the same configs but thats linux

320902
post	get
the way it seems to me running a shell over ssh is like using a web app where every single button is a link or form submit button mosh is the same app with some caching and a differential compression scheme and what i m proposing would be like a modern webapp with javascript manipulating the display and ajax calls to get post data when needed

320989
stdout	stderr
finally the suppresses the output of ls redirected both stdout and stderr dev null gets rid of it

321024
stdout	stderr
you really can t change a running process s redirected stdout and or stderr to a new file see note below that s one reason using redirected stdout or stderr as log files for long-running processes is a bad idea.

321024
stdout	stderr
the child process has no idea of what the name of it s stdout and or stderr are - and the output file might not even be a file in the first place

321024
stdout	stderr
ok it can be possible to change the stdout stderr streams for a running process - but it s something that has to be - again - designed into the process

321028
versioning	upgrade
warning use of this tool is currently broken as several system-critical packages are of a higher versioning number in centos 6.7 than they are in centos 7 so those do not get upgrade correctly

321042
versioning	upgrade
for newer hardware the first step should be to upgrade all components kernel for drm driver packages for x to the newest versioning

321057
folder	directory
all parent folder of these directory have 755 permissions and are owned by root

321078
stdout	stderr
however sudo doesn t pass the handle on to the process it runs for security reasons by default it closes all file handles except stdin stdout and stderr so the program that eventually runs doesn t have the file handle corresponding to dev fd 63 and it errors out

321124
vpn	lan
lan vpn is 172.16.21.0 24

321124
vpn	lan
that is if the vpn gateway server or the devices connected to its lan try to ping the client does not have any answers

ubuntu	linux
i m using linux 4.8.1 on ubuntu 16.04

321135
debian	linux
i recently installed linux debian on my lark ultimate 7i win tablet that was originally running windows but windows was so much laggy on this device

321146
bash	zsh
how can i customize zsh in order it behaves as bash in this respect

321157
ubuntu	debian
does anyone know of equivalent instructions for debian and or ubuntu

321160
sudo	passwd
i thought including the above command the one with â œnopasswdâ would prevent getting prompted for a passwd but after i reboot my system and login as my â œrailsâ user note iâ m still getting asked for a passwd when running sudo â

321165
installation	upgrade
to upgrade a civicrm installation but this question doesn t really apply to civicrm specifically

321193
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu 16.04 within a windows subsystem for linux wsl shell on windows 10

321198
lvm	btrfs
i m using btrfs without any lvm and no separate boot partition so your cryptomount and prefix parameters may differ somewhat from mine

321207
mp3	wav
to find and remove artist directories and their contents recursively which do not directly contain directories or files titled either wav or mp3 case sensitive try the following

321237
atom-editor	gedit
for example sudo vi or sudo gedit works but sudo atom-editor returns an error

321237
sudoers	visudo
visudo -f etc sudoers returns permission denied

321241
folder	directory
this guy suggested removing the .cinnamon folder from the user directory

321245
centos	linux
how can i use tom tom navigator in a windows 7 installed in an vmware workstation 10.0.3 in a linux centos 7 kernel 3.10.0-327.36.3.el7.x86_64 host

321247
zsh	subshell
as an optimisation zsh will not fork an extra process for arbitrary_pipeline it will execute it in the same process as the one that runs that subshell started in background

321248
mouse	keyboard
with the additional requirement that you want to do all this from a without touching b the problem with running an x server on b and connecting to it with an application on a is that this x server only will use input devices keyboard mouse connected to b

321275
disk	ram
the parameters of this vm are 4 cpu 6gb ram and 50 gb disk with raw debian 8.6

321275
jobs	cron
i have tested and deleted all jobs from cron

321306
bash	zsh
on linux and with shells that use a deleted temporary files for here documents like bash zsh and some implementations of ksh you can do

321312
x11	konsole
konsole for instance does x11 selection as an afterthought

321315
jobs	cron
i ve also checked that cron runs as ubuntu and not root which seems to be the case since i edited the cron jobs being logged in as ubuntu

321367
tunnel	lan
i feel like i need to tunnel through the second lan somehow

321390
ubuntu	debian	debian-based	ubuntu
there are hundreds of different debian-based distros including those based on ubuntu which is in itself based on debian and checking whether the name field in etc os-release or the distributor id in the output of lsb_release -a matches any of the hundreds of known debian-based distributions would take forever

321404
folder	directory
change the directory to the extracted folder cd arc-dark-suite

321423
clang	llvm
i installed the llvm clang and emscripten packages and they re all up-to-date with what s in the repos

321423
clang	llvm
just to be safe i had apt-purged emscripten llvm and clang before starting the source build and i would hope that 3.4 is the minimum version not the only supported version because the latest build is 3.9 i believe and the docs didn t say to take any special consideration

321423
clang	llvm
it s bizarre to me that the emscripten apt-package doesn t pull in the properly-compiled clang llvm as a dependency so am i maybe doing the invocation wrong

321423
disk	ram
system is a virtualbox vm with extensions installed running linux mint 18 sarah cinnamon as a 32-bit machine with 2 cpu cores 4gb ram 512mb video memory and 50gb virtual disk image

321455
ubuntu	debian
faced a similar problem after switching from ubuntu to debian jessie.

321476
folder	directory
here is the expected result a move of the directory tree where each file is a moved to the sub folder

321478
sudo	passwd
when i use firewall-cmd which correctly needs root privileges to execute i get prompted in a window so not in the terminal as with sudo to give my passwd when i try to autocomplete an option write --perm and hit tab

321478
sudo	passwd
and this happens every time i use autocompletion even if i already entered my passwd before and or ran a command with sudo which is configured to not prompt me a second time for a certain time

321484
versioning	upgrade
now when i want to upgrade my kernel to a newer versioning it says that xorg needs to be removed

321494
ubuntu	linux
this is my first time trying linux so i don t know really anything and could use some help with using exfat sd cards on ubuntu 16.04

321502
solaris	aix
for named pipes we ve seen that some systems aix solaris hp ux at least make the amount of data in the pipe buffer available in stat s st_size

321502
freebsd	linux
some like linux or freebsd don t

321529
unix	solaris
it s not included by default in solaris unix either

321529
stdout	stderr
redirect stdout and stderr accordingly

321561
disk	ram
ram cpu and disk space information

321566
daemons	systemd
you can check the installed daemons through the systemd features to analyse the systemd state

321598
comm	grep
is there any way to do this using grep or comm or something similar

321671
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
my question is this if one were to do install cinnamon over ubuntu does cinnamon work the same as it does in a native linux mint installation

321693
folder	dir	folder	directory
i generated the toolchain in a specific directory then copied it to another folder on my home dir

321695
centos	linux
in enterprise linux el - rhel centos et al create a named routing table as mentioned above

321700
stdout	stderr
the previous command s stdout and stderr will still go to your terminal though

321745
ubuntu	centos
i have also found out that there is a package called secure-delete which seems to work fine on ubuntu but when i try to install it using sudo yum install secure-delete i get the following message no package secure-delete available which makes me think that the package is not available for centos 7

321746
debian	linux
they are running on debian based linux

321757
bash	zsh
with zsh or bash another way to loop over the output of find -print0 is with

321757
bash	zsh
find gnu find at least does that by opening the directories using openat with the right o_nofollow flags where supported and keeping a file descriptor open for each directory zsh bash ksh don t do that

321757
bash	zsh
those like bash or zsh where the multi-byte support has been progressively added

321768
daemon	cron
my linux server has files etc rc2.d s03cron etc rc3.d s03cron etc rc4.d s03cron etc rc5.d s03cron which should start the cron daemon 4 times

321771
solaris	sunos
in some init systems â old solaris or sunos i think although it s been way too long â the runlevels are cumulative in the way you are expecting

321799
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
running debian gnu linux - ubuntu

321807
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
taking that you must use md5 and your input files are said to have hash collisions equal md5 sums for binary-different files one trick you can employ is to use a random salt a short random string when hashing them to make the colliding checksums vary again

321807
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
this will compute an md5 hash for an each file in files adding a randomly generated 128 byte salt in the mix resulting in an output like that

321830
inherited	properties
in theory the pool itself is also writable but it is recommended to not do this because of easier management properties inherited

321830
inherited	properties
create as many file systems as you like and use inherited to manage them easily properties like smb or nfs share can be inherited the same way as quotas or general acl settings

321831
spaces	delimiter
however i am looking for a spaces delimiter value like this

321868
ethernet	wireless
interfaces are now prefixed with en wired ethernet wl wireless wlan or ww wwan followed by an automatically generated identifier creating an entry such as enp0s25

321870

321877
g++	gcc
the minor wrinkle nghttp uses both gcc and g++ so you ned to tune both cflags and cxxflags

321957
stdout	stderr
the command may sends output to both stdout and stderr but not to a file

321957
stdout	stderr
i want to get at least one of stdout or stderr

321958
stdout	stderr
your stdout and stderr is lost forever

321997
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
i have never had this problem in the past with debian or ubuntu but it is occuring on every computer i ve installed mint on so far

322010
uniq	grep
the initial sort and uniq are unnecessary if file1 was prepared as indicated one letter per line but i gratuitously added them to get closer to the use grep sort and uniq requirement

322012
opensuse	linux
the question s is - how these certificates got there my opensuse leap 42.1 installation is from 2016 i didn t have any linux on my machine back in 2014 are they a security risk and how to get rid of them

322025
percentile	max

on ubuntu linux it points to bin dash the debian almquist shell

322040

now if i run the above template it will create different folder according to hostname under var log test but i need to create 2 different folder abcd and xyz and relative hostname will go under specific directory and create subfolder

322043
filesystems	fat
but those tools are only usable on a mtd with ubifs and i m running on a more classical filesystems fat for u-boot ext4 for linux

322070
super	implements
the soft limit s value s is actually implements in use you can increase the limit upto the relevant hard limit s value s assuming you are not super user or do not have cap_sys_resource capability

322077
folder	directory
now i am using this command on remote ssh terminal where i am already inside the home user public_html directory path so from the result set of the above command how can i trim the starting folder upto which i am already inside

322087
debian	linux
in debian arch linux forums they suggested to add more x-systemd options to the fstab

322091
filesystems	fat
the current fw_env.config file has an example of how to read the environment from a file on fat or any other filesystems really as well as from being written directly to the sectors on sd etc
