777	fstab
i prefer to use the manual mount instead of auto mounting but i was wondering if it is possible to create an fstab entry to allow 777 permissions on this mounted directory

322374
bash	zsh
that would be equivalent to what zsh bash for their

322395
folder	directory
if needed subdirectories can be refreshed by pressing r and files folder can be deleted by pressing d both of which update stats for all parent directory

322405
solaris	aix
i m working at a company that uses three different unices linux solaris and aix all with the same home directories etc

322406
disk	ram
other examples of things that use swap include hibernating the system suspend to disk the swap partition will be used as an overflow for things that won t fit in ram which of course will be slower but means your system can keep running rather than having to crash or kill processes seemingly at random

322424
ubuntu	linux
a simpler way to do this on ubuntu based systems is remove unwanted linux kernel headers and images

322441
filesystems	ntfs
convert your filesystems to ntfs or ext4 e.t.c

322502
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
what i suspect is that you have an unclean filesystem and you have different file system types when you set up debian vs ubuntu and opensuse

322504
screens	tablet
another interesting fact when i flip the screens to tablet mode i can the same message in dmesg so it seems the bios is sending the same event as pressing the fn f6

you could try using at to schedule your jobs instead of cron

322650
jobs	cron
cron is good for scheduling jobs that run at regular pre-determined intervals but at is better for scheduling jobs that happen irregularly and or at irregular intervals

322656
pthreads	fork
so how is one supposed to share unnamed pthreads semaphores between processes safely without relying on other ways to synchronize or fork the other processes only after initializing the semaphore

322669
versioning	upgrade	dnf	yum
var cache yum may be leftover from a previous versioning of fedora prior to the upgrade from yum to dnf and you can almost certainly remove the files in that directory safely

bash	zsh
it doesn t seem to be possible in bash but it is in zsh

323309
hash	md5
it s just when we use passwd 1 that it is always hash with md5

323309
hash	md5
we have tried removing the md5 hash on the pam_unix.so line

323309
hash	md5
i have made small bits of headway but even using authconfig and changing the hash to sha512 instead of md5 doesn t work

323309
hash	md5
the format of the hash changes but when encode it in base64 it s md5 again

with bash zsh ksh you could also use paste to paste 3 streams consisting of the expansion of the variables where the have been escaped

323368
uptime	reboot
maybe this file will be a problem on the next reboot i don t try to reboot yet my uptime is precious

323383

323426
bash	zsh	awk	ksh
assumes the gnu implementation of grep and awk and a shell with support for process substitution like ksh zsh or bash

323432
disk	ram
if the file would be compressed first on ram then sent to disk no fragmentation would occur or at least it can be avoided

323471
lvm	btrfs
i have btrfs installed on top of lvm

323471
lvm	btrfs
it seems opensuse formats btrfs on top of dm-1 and dm-2 which probably map to lvm volumes

323515
vim	emacs
i ve tried a few console applications like vim mg emacs nano and joe as a git editor and none of them seem to have any problems with being invoked indirectly like this i don t know the actual term for starting an editor as a subprocess and then giving it control

323515
bash	zsh
i ve tried running git commit and and such under bash and zsh and both exhibit the same behavior

post	put
does actually post the home directory for the username put in or does it just put the current user s home directory

323778
folder	directory
i want to move all the files but not the folder inside a folder to another directory

323849
zsh	subshell
you can do away with the head -c1g and shave off a few seconds by setting a limit on the file size limit filesize 1024m with zsh or with most other shells including zsh instead in a subshell

323875
ubuntu	linux
i m using gnu bash version 4.3.46 1 -release x86_64-pc-linux-gnu from the popular ubuntu distribution of linux

323913

stdout	stderr
it abuses stderr to print the results because it uses stdout to capture the recursive totals from any subdirectories

324112
rpm	dnf
i did dnf install tor but rpm -ql tor and shows that tor doesn t include vidalia and neither does any repo i have currently installed

324167

filesystems	btrfs
after assembling into dev md0 the raid is further partitioned with a single partition dev md0p1 spanning the entire multi-disk which then holds the btrfs filesystems

324338
min	max
if your min and max values are stored in variables you can pass them in with -v in awk like so

324353
ubuntu	linux
another option is to install different linux flavor which uses gnome 3 desktop environment like fedora if you are not specific about ubuntu

ubuntu	debian
i tried to install both debian and ubuntu last versions as virtual machines but i couldn t use neither because of an issue with my intel pentium g4400

324418
ubuntu	debian
the fact is that debian gives a white error screen with something like something has gone wrong etc while ubuntu apparently loads the gui but has several bugs

folder	directory
and after you chould check ownerships and modes for that folder and fix it accoridngly your home directory and .ssh must not have group and others write permissions

324492
internationalization	translation
this means than besides coreutils you also need the gnu dependencies gettext for text internationalization and gnu iconv because coreutils does not accept the way aix iconv implemented a number of translation

gtk	vte
unfortunately the latest tarball release 0.98 as of writing this still uses gtk version 2 and its corresponding vte version 0.28 which does not support rewrapping

kde	gnome
currently lo seems to be integrating with gnome by default but i was wondering if there is a way to force it to use kde integration

324514
ubuntu	debian
but programs you compile from source and make install will more often end up in usr local bin usr local lib etc and you may have problems with that since the user-installed path in debian ubuntu is usr and not usr local

324520
memcpy	memset
also note that writing to memory that s not already hot in cache usually triggers a read-for-ownership to maintain cache coherency which can be avoided with non-temporal stores or with x86 s rep movsb optimized memcpy and memset in microcode which avoids rfo since andy glew s implementation of it in p6 pentium pro

multiplying	subtract	multiplying	division	multiplying	modulo	division	subtract	division	modulo
gcc s asm output is equivalent to an extra multiplying and subtract on top of the division using a modular multiplicative inverse. also the lowest bit of xorshift128+ is not as high quality so dividing to take entropy from high bits is better for quality as well as speed than modulo to take entropy from low bits

324520
clang	icc
compile with gcc clang or icc or hopefully any other compiler that understands the gnu c dialect of c99 and intel s intrinsics

324520
division	modulo
gnu c vector extensions are highly convenient to get the compiler to generate the magic numbers for division modulo using modular multiplicative inverses and occasional __attribute__ s are useful

324831
filesystems	ntfs
it creates a sparse copy of an ntfs filesystems

324831
filesystems	ntfs
it will do a better job than dd and it will do it faster because it knows what parts of the ntfs filesystems are safe to ignore

324858
punctuation	words
the translated words with punctuation in place are then joined into a single line through the nested command and echoed

i know how they work in bash cshell and tcsh

324916
kde	cinnamon
i have just simulated the clean installation of linux mint kde 17.2 in a vm and installed cinnamon using this command

324931
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 16.04 linux version 4.4.0-47-generic gcc version 5.4.0

324976
rpm	yum	versioning	upgrade
i also tried to upgrade both yum and rpm to the latest versioning of the package hoping that the dependencies would move to the new versioning but i just get a failed dependencies error

324983
packets	multicast
3 you could write a program to join a multicast group such that the ethernet card would listen for packets with the multicast address you were interested in

325021
pop-up	dialog
when i want to sign something on the remote machine the pinentry dialog pop-up locally and asks for the password which is the way it should work

325021
openbsd	linux
the remote site is either a linux machine with the same version of gnupg or an openbsd machine with gnupg version 2.1.15 no difference

325024
folder	directory
this tells that the server will search in the file called authorized_keys of each user home directory into .ssh folder for the public keys authorized for the login of this user

325038
imagemagick	mogrify
mogrify part of imagemagick differs from convert in that it modifies the original file

325120
ubuntu	debian
in debian or ubuntu package manager

325129
mouse	keyboard
xset dpms force off and don t touch the keyboard or mouse right after that

325135
rpm	yum
removing rpm and re-installing it doesn t work either as it says i try and remove yum and that s protected

325135
rpm	yum
so i assume yum is using rpm

325147
bash	zsh
with zsh or bash you can also do

325148
sudoers	passwd
on b create a sudoers entry for it to run rsync without a passwd eg

325148
sudo	passwd
on a test root can ssh to b without passwd and sudo to rsync

325160
bash	tcsh
you don t seem to have bash on your freebsd distro the default shell on freebsd appears to be tcsh

325164
ubuntu	debian
the ircd-hybrid package in debian jessie and possibly ubuntu doesn t contain the opme module

325202
ubuntu	linux
i work as a sysadmin in a large company and have to maintain several windows and linux ubuntu 16.04 vms

325202
bash	zsh
since i want to use zsh instead of bash on the linux vms i have to change my default shell

325205
bash	zsh
then every time you log in with bash you start zsh automatically

325212
bash	zsh
obviously from the she-bang that script is intended to be run by bash not sh even though the syntax looks more like zsh syntax because of the unquoted variables

325212
bash	zsh
you ll want to run it with bash or zsh

325212
bash	zsh
that comes from ksh and is supported by bash and zsh as well

325213
x86	64bit
as pointed out in ilkkachu s answer shifting takes the offset modulo 64 on 64bit x86 cpus whether using rcl or shl which explains the behaviour you re seeing

325229
filesystems	fat
efi knows how to access fat and fat32 filesystems

325243
stdout	fflush
the behavior you re seeing is because when writing to stdout when stdout is not an interactive device such as a tty or pty the printf family of functions fflush the buffer less frequently

325243
stdout	fflush
if you just cat timedelay.py | ssh -tt user host python python will have a pty and it will fflush the buffer more frequently but you will have other issues for instance your script will get printed to stdout due to the way that pty allocation works with ssh.

325251
daemons	systemd
red hat version-7 introduced the chronyd daemons for systemd clock management

325273
post	get
i ve tried to do this with node.js and could not get it to respond here s my old stackoverflow post responding to a interactive command via child process which has received no attention

325308
backslash	double-quotes
as the backslash inside double-quotes see double-quotes

325347
jobs	cron
all cron jobs are run in non-interactive shells there is no terminal attachment

325369
tunnel	packets
the other nice thing is that it works with tcp rather than against it so you get correct performance across the connection - regular ssh tunnel tend to get poor scaling because there s no packets loss

325377
exif	xmp
exiv2 is a program to read and write exif iptc xmp metadata and image comments and can read many vendor makernote tags

325377
exif	xmp
verts between exif tags xmp properties and iptc datasets

325388
sudo	passwd
for instance i am interesting requiring not 1 but 3 different passwd to be entered consecutively to run a sudo task

325390
debian	linux
however one peculiar problem is that after installation the grub menu does not show my_linux but debian gnu linux

325391
centos	linux
centos linux release 7.2.1511 core

325407
ubuntu	debian
ideally it should run on debian or ubuntu so postfix seems to be the best fit

325408
bluetooth	usb
i am trying to replace the kernel btusb driver with the bluetopia usb bt driver ss1btusb driver source and build files from codeaurora because i am trying to learn more about the bluetopia bluetooth stack implementation and this is the first step to being able to do that

325408
bluetooth	usb
usb info on the bluetooth usb dongle.

325416
postfix	dovecot
i have a mail system from postfix dovecot amavis spamassin on a debian jessie 8.5

325416
postfix	dovecot
postfix pipe 3015 2c4a1a05de to relay dovecot

325416
postfix	dovecot
dovecot service nov 24 14 40 44 mail postfix qmgr 21146 2c4a1a05de

325431
x86	64bit
if i remember correctly x86 processors only use the bottom six bits of the shift value in 64bit mode so the behaviour may be directly from the machine language

325471
sudo	passwd
sudouser will be given passwordless sudo rights middleman exists for the one and only purpose of adding a passwd barrier

325471
sudoers	visudo
we ll grant passwordless sudo commands via adding a line to etc sudoers with visudo

325570
sudo	passwd
sudo attempt with correct option it got root login but this time it didn t ask for passwd

325570
sudo	passwd
he she can get the root privileges without even knowing the sudo passwd by simply issuing sudo -i within 15 minutes cached passwd time

325574
sudo	passwd
when running a command preceded with sudo by default it will ask your passwd

325578
subshell	ifs
if it is ok to change ifs and to change the positional parameters you can also avoid the subshell call

325587
debian	linux
i just bought an ultra wide 3440x1440p monitor by lg and tried to use it with my linux debian 8

325587
kde	gnome
fun fact while it perfectly works as long as gnome is used as desktop environment it instantly crashes after logging in kde plasma no more output signal .

325676
icmp	udp
after a couple of tests i ve learned that proxychains can t handle nmap s syn scans and neither does it support udp or icmp so i ve restricted my nmap scan

325677
sudo	passwd
the sudo command remembers for a while that i entered my passwd so that i don t need to re-enter it every time

325677
sudo	passwd
could someone who gained access to my account before the sudo passwd re-entry timeout somehow use sudo without entering a passwd

325693
sudo	passwd
sudo remembers the passwd per terminal session

325693
sudo	passwd
but if you are afraid of any issues you can simply configure sudo not to cache the passwd

325702
rpm	yum
starting with aix 7.2 which i do not have access to right now has rpm version 4 and yum is also included to help with rpm dependency hell

325712
versioning	upgrade
so now i see 2 options upgrade kali to 4.8 or search out headers for this old versioning

325735
installation	upgrade
edit if the previous windows installation was upgrade from 8 to 10 - then you might have problems with the recovery partition

325751
debian	linux
it s not in debian gnu linux but it s quite easy to build packages and the commands to do so are documented

325754
udp	tcp
vnc server is running and tcp udp connection has been enabled only to ports of web server ssh game server

325755
uniq	grep
zcat vcf.gz | grep -o -p . . | uniq

325770
debian	linux
this is a problem with linux and debian not grsecurity

325771
sudo	passwd
if i do sudo -u postgres psql postgres i am asked for a passwd but if i do i am not

325776
lvm	mdadm
i m looking for a tool that will scan my gui-less server and create an easy to digest rough overview of all the block devices and their relationship disk partitions mdadm devices lvm pvs lvs etc in some rich visual format html pdf svg png...

325784
bluetooth	usb
the default kernel btusb driver is a lot more permissive about the usb bluetooth devices it recognises perhaps it just knows that all csr devices are bluetooth dongles

325793
ubuntu	linux
i ve run the x virtual framebuffer server on ubuntu linux which i d like to access its screen via vnc

325803
bluetooth	usb
here is an example of dmesg when a dedicated usb bluetooth dongle is plugged

325812
mouse	keyboard
that is keyboard and mouse can not be used until a password is typed on the keyboard but the contents of the display isn t hidden

325813
solaris	sunos
when i ssh to my my remote server a solaris machine running sunos 5.9 with c-shell as default login shell i have the following issues

325832
debian	linux

325846
folder	directory
but when i m in a folder which contains a folder named gulp it changes the directory cd into this folder instead of executing the command

325894
centos	linux
on an amazon linux rhel + centos fusion os server this is actually an ec2 instance within a emr cluster 4.5.0 ami if that helps we can see â

325894
daemons	systemd
different daemons or services on this host are using either upstart or systemd

325898
ubuntu	debian
i didn t do too much myself however the problem was that with my ethernet connection i didn t have any internet connection on any unix os granted i only tested debian and ubuntu although on two separate machines however it did work on windows 10

325904
sudo	passwd
they can plant a backdoor on your account and in the worst case for the attacker snipe your passwd and piggyback on your sudo access the next time you use sudo

325917
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade my fedora 24 to versioning 25

325924
daemons	systemd
different daemons or services on this host are using either upstart or systemd

325929
ubuntu	linux	xfce	kde
i remember switching between ttys on ubuntu linux and being able to switch back and forth between an active x session unity kde xfce and a terminal on another numbered tty thing virtual console

325932
cpu	hyperthreading
as i have a hyperthreading capable cpu i wonder is it a bad idea to assign more virtual cpu cores than number of physical cpu cores as the following warning suggests

325938
sudo	passwd
it s not that sudo doesn t ask for passwd

325958
switching	screens
in this one i have a detached running screens i attach it but i can t switching its tabs

325959

preparation in both cases i waited after boot until the cpu ram disk drive are at stable near zero-point hits

325962
mouse	keyboard
i have an arm-based computer nanopi m1 that has 3 usb ports that all work good with other devices like mouse keyboard wireless dongle

326004
ecdsa	rsa
note the solution for this is to add at least one of the rsa ecdsa or the ed25519 based pki pairs

326021
ubuntu	debian
the issue is not specific to debian and its derivatives such as ubuntu but debian happens to be more careful about licensing than some other organizations

326023
udp	tcp
it is also possible to ask systemd to open a socket whether tcp udp or unix af and then start a service when a connection is received

326036
postfix	dovecot
in postfix and dovecot i am only able to connect to ports 25 smtp 110 pop3 and 143 imap others such as 465 smtps 587 smtp tls 993 imaps and 995 pop3s i am unable to connect with mail clients used roundcubemail and mail app

326093
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
my linux server is running systemd rhel centos debian ubuntu...

326094
debian	centos
use the command script which is provided by the package bsdutils in debian or util-linux in centos

326118
centos	linux
i have 2 linux centos 7 machines a samba server and a postfix server

326182
put	get
to put this in a complicated but more accurate way i want to get the text that begins at the beginning of some word specified by an index and ends at the end of another word specified by another index

326191
mouse	keyboard
is there a anything available that can mirror keyboard and mouse inputs to multiple windows

326195
multiplying	subtract
a simple rule would be subtract 1 and multiplying by 2

326225
google-chrome	firefox
it mostly works except that the touchscreen only works well in chromium google-chrome and not with other applications like the terminal firefox thunderbird etc etc

326225
google-chrome	firefox
so what i need to know to decide if i want to start over with rhel is if i install rhel will touchscreen work with firefox and or other apps like it does in windows or will i be even worse off since the only app where it currently works fine chromium google-chrome will not run on that os

326230
centos	linux
i m new on linux and i want to install antergos and centos in a single machine

326242
folder	directory
and then iterates through an unsorted folder pulling all types of that file to newly created desktop directory

326242
gif	png
its working great to a point but the issue i have is how to get the remaining file types .wav png midi and a whole plethora of other types in that unsorted folder automatically moved to a new miscellaneous folder that needs to be created when the original argument of jpg gif docx above is executed

326252
bash	zsh
both bash and zsh support reading a file into an array i m used to the bash s way and am appalled by the zsh s behaviour zsh starts the array from index 1

326255
opensuse	mint
i tried manjaro freya mint and opensuse and it didnâ t work i guess the problem is the kernel version openmandrive use 4.6.5

326256
init.d	pid
in etc init.d hue pid directory is correctly set via pidfile variable.

326317
ubuntu	linux
do ubuntu linux apps work on kali linux

326317
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux and i want to know if apps that can be installed on ubuntu can also be installed on kali

326319
ubuntu	linux
as for running ubuntu apps in kali this is also documented here in the kali linux documentation

326337
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
the kali linux distribution is based on debian testing some of its packages are imported from debian unstable and experimental latest versions by installing some packages from ubuntu 14.04 repository you will get a dependencies problem s and you can break your system

326337
ubuntu	linux
you can install some kali linux tools on ubuntu without problem

326337
ubuntu	linux
i suggest to use ubuntu it is the best linux distro for beginners

326354

i would have put this in a comment but i couldn t get the code formatted at all

326430

i would like that so that sudo always uses my gnupg agent and passwd store

326440
dnf	yum
running but still has a large dnf yum apt repository so i can install

i am trying to upgrade install docker-engine on centos7.i had previously installed docker versioning 1.10

326462
ubuntu	debian
i m a noob to debian with a little ubuntu experience and i am trying to use a usb connected device a used wlan adapter that i got without any docs or cd

326490

to get the script to run at a pre-defined time put your code into an executable scipt and load it into a cronjob

326572
collabnet	svn
today morning i was trying to start collabnet svn with the home svn csvn bin csvn start command

326579
ubuntu	linux

326585
cpu	affinity
cpu is via the cpu affinity syscalls

326585
ubuntu	debian
add in debian ubuntu in the file etc default grub to the option grub_cmdline_linux

326585
cpu	affinity
taskset - retrieve or set a processesâ s cpu affinity

326585
cpu	affinity
taskset is used to set or retrieve the cpu affinity of a running pro

326585
cpu	affinity
cess given its pid or to launch a new command with a given cpu affinity

326585
cpu	affinity
cpu affinity is a scheduler property that bonds a process to a

326585
cpu	affinity
given cpu affinity and the process will not run on any other cpus

326585
cpu	affinity
note that the linux scheduler also supports natural cpu affinity the

326585
cpu	affinity
therefore forcing a specific cpu affinity is useful only in certain applications

326634
ubuntu	mint	cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon
after many hours of research and learning more about disk formatting i discovered the disk manager in gnome which i was able to run in ubuntu xfce mint cinnamon and korora xfce from the application menu or text search

326646
versioning	upgrade
since versioning 1 2012 is no longer in stable jessie upgrade to unstable sid which is currently versioning 1 2016.2.22ar.1-3 as mentioned in the bug report linked to by skilowatt

326652
width	height
it is because some programs cannot have any window width or height

326673
pull	push
you can add git remotes push pull etc

326677
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
depending on the age of your distribution ubuntu debian centos would have them pre-installed

326684
bgp	ospf
the usual kind of software daemon that has the job of controlling and maintaining your routing table probably doesn t support it either because it runs standards-based routing protocols like ospf and bgp to learn the correct routes to install from neighbouring routers not ping something remote and set default route accordingly if successful but it might have such a feature.

326688
filesystems	btrfs
lxc container root filesystems on btrfs

326688
filesystems	btrfs
works fine when running in the container when in a folder that exists in the base btrfs filesystems

326727
chown	chmod
i can create edit rename and delete files dirs but cannot chmod chown them as my account nor root

326782
ubuntu	centos
as for the other group i don t see it neither in my fresh centos 7 installation nor in my ubuntu 14 so i m guessing the document you read refers to the other portion of the discrectionary access control bits the last octal digit you can edit with chmod or a group created and used by some application...so asking for the reason for its existence is like asking why the group www-data created by nginx exists it just depends on what the application that created the group wants to do with it

326804
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
on debian linux and debian freebsd the design is for the x server and the kernel virtual terminals to share one set of configuration information

326804
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
so on debian linux and debian freebsd you need to ensure that your xkbmodel xkblayout xkbvariant xkboptions variables are properly set in etc default keyboard

326814
disk	ram
i was under the assumption that when my app accessed data in the virtual address space linux would work out which page the address sits in and if it s not already in ram trigger a page fault to have the page pulled from disk

326816
dpkg	apt
apt-show-versions parses the dpkg status file and the files in var apt lists

centos	linux
i am using linux centos 7.2 version

the cyanogenmod wiki has instructions for using fastboot and adb to install cyanogenmod

326842
mouse	keyboard
i have a logitech t400 mouse which has a button that generates a keycode super_l like a keyboard

326842
mouse	keyboard
xev results of presses from a keyboard and mouse button are exactly same see below

326847
freebsd	linux
on linux or freebsd i can trust command line tools to report the right system information

326869
filesystems	btrfs
i think you will find the answer to your question researching the btrfs filesystems

326869
filesystems	btrfs
in evaluating any possible performance increase using the btrfs filesystems i found none only increased complexity

326869
filesystems	xfs
in my opinion the only filesystems that are good reliable and simple for the root partition are ext3 ext4 and xfs

326913
stdout	stderr
first please refer to how to redirect stdout and stderr to a file and display stderr to console

326913
stdout	stderr
i collect lots of both stdout and stderr together in the logfile with a quiet terminal

326929
ubuntu	centos
usually i use ubuntu so am a centos newbie

326934
jobs	cron
cron jobs

326934
jobs	cron
yes i do have cron jobs that run every minute so i thought this could be the issue

326934
jobs	cron
i also manually changed all the cron jobs to run once an hour to see if they stop they did not and yet continued

326942
google-chrome	firefox
but when i select and share a particular window application the share works fine.the os which i am using is fedora 24.the feature to share entire desktop doesn t work in google-chrome and mozilla firefox

what are you guys doing in your organization for rpm yum repos

326956
debian	linux
problem with virtualbox 5.x running on gnu linux debian 9.x host

326957
ubuntu	debian
replace debian with your system s id ubuntu

326960
rpm	yum
regardless of which option you choose there are some important things you should be aware of when building a yum rpm package repository a createrepo bug and gpg signing rpm packages and repositories

327003
cpu	processors
this method will make a series of spikes on the cpu graph and will stop the processors from overheating because you re not giving it enough time for that by pausing processes

327005
switching	screens
how can i get the boot screens to select or switching between operating systems

327012
stdout	stderr
how does this work in a normal stdin stdout stderr program how does the program distinguish between the first and the second inputfile

327022
chown	chmod
the other day i had to run a chown -r and a chmod -r on a folder containing over 100 000 files

327035
debian	linux
i m trying to compile php 5.2.x in debian gnu linux

327081
ubuntu	linux
i have a similar question to the one posted here ethernet to usb adapter is not initialized as ttyusb or ttyacm device where i am trying to connect a geomagic touch device which is connected to a linux machine ubuntu 14.04.2 trusty via an ethernet-usb adapter

327091
folder	directory
i have an interactive script which sorts and processes a variety of filetypes from an unsorted folder into newly created directory

327188
ubuntu	mint
it appears that baud rate 250000 is not supported under ubuntu mint

327203
manjaro	archlinux
at that point all i had to do was to repopulate the key signatures using the command pacman-key --populate archlinux manjaro i thought that was the end of it but apparently i also had to use a script called pacli-simple available here

327217
ubuntu	debian
while in debian or ubuntu you won t get as clean of an answer

327220
disk	ram
so if the source disk is faster than the destination disk and you re copying more data than you have free ram the copy operation will eat up all available ram or at least whatever the dirty page limit is which could be more than the available ram and cause starvation as the dirty pages cannot be swapped out and clean pages get used and marked dirty as they are freed

327223
udp	tcp
i want at least a tool like nethogs that can output into files nethogs captures only tcp connexions a similar tool that targets both tcp and udp would be great

327275
mouse	keyboard
ps airdroid does not require root access to your phone you can use your pc keyboard and mouse and is still available in google play

327279
bluetooth	usb
i know a project called master control which did exactly that a program would read events from local dev input sources and resend those events either via bluetooth hid profile or via usb using gadgetfs

327279
joystick	keyboard	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
this could effectively emulate either bt or usb mouse keyboard or joystick

327308
width	height
only the width and height are affected and the shift and ctrl keys do not affect the window

327324
folder	directory
however i want the trusted programs to be able to access my home folder normally and files written by them outside the encrypted directory to be available to any application

327332
bash	zsh
note that bash and zsh later adopted some of those ksh extended operators though not the one but they addressed the posix compliance bourne compatibility differently they make those extended globs available in all contexts but only when a specific option is enabled kshglob in zsh extglob in bash

327334
centos	linuxmint
i am on linuxmint have tried centos too and have been trying to use the printenv command for a environment variable which may or may not exist

327343

dpkg	apt
i ran apt-get --reinstall install linux-image-3.16.0-4-amd64 linux-headers-3.16.0-4-amd64 the same with dpkg -i and the cached package in var cache apt archives both commands completed successfully but my boot remains empty

327393
stdout	stderr
my little secret for when i need to capture both stdout and stderr is to use nohup

327393
stdout	stderr
and of course redirection such as 2 1 to combine stdout and stderr is also possible

327395
ubuntu	mint
if the wifi works on both windows and ubuntu then it is in all likeliness a mint problem

in your case you need to choose either you want to use g mic in which case you should use debian instead of kali linux or you want to use kali linux in which case you should give up g mic

centos	linux
i had a xen server centos 5 base that was running a set of linux vm s

327433
udp	tcp
interestingly enough as a complementary alternative approach the strategy used by redsocks for handling udp dns requests is giving an invalid answer to any udp dns request via dnstc to force the operation of dns via tcp and thus facilitate the proxying of dns via tor

sudo	passwd
to run the script without need for a passwd type this command and type the line with sudo into the file

327495
sudo	passwd
put into the terminal for allowing access to the command as sudo without the passwd remember anything giving root without security like a passwd is inherently insecure

327495
sudo	passwd
now you can type the below command without the need for a passwd providing you are part of the group sudo

327499
sudo	passwd
well yeah if you try to put su or sudo on the initramfs you will need to add a lot of configuration files etc passwd etc groups etc shadow and so forth

327509
daemons	systemd
init is a daemons process that continues running until the systemd is shut down

327509
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
if the process is flagged for launchd the way - traditionally - that they would have been started is that the init systemd would execute a shell script corresponding to the daemons in etc init.d

327509
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
also - i believe - newer init systemd launchd daemons themselves and use their own so called unit files to define config directives rather than invoke a shell script

327514
mouse	keyboard
for example hidclient allows you to use a linux pc as a bluetooth keyboard and mouse for another device

327550

i would advice against playing with iptables directly if you re not ready to learn the basics of networking tcp icmp udp sctp... ip linux s netfilter and how to do proper firewalling first

327550
icmp	dhcp
it will take care of not shooting in your feet by not blocking needing types of icmp dhcp broadcast multicast traffic and handle both ipv4 and ipv6 as needed

327585
freebsd	linux
for getting details of network transactions you have got a implementation of a netflow generator for freebsd or linux

however using snapshots i recommend zfs or btrfs as those are much faster than lvm in combination with a way to compare and pull differences you perhaps can figure out what s correct and what not

327779
freebsd	linux
actually the base64 format for the group password besides being used in linux freebsd ipsec configurations and apple provisioning files is also used in cisco vpn client files

debian	linux
today in december 2016 i consider current debian linux 8 having and just installed then dumped it. as having drifted sufficently far away from the 20th century philosopy of unix imho after it dumped the sysv init and broke all my cutomized boot scrips and overwrote my custom config files

327873
solaris	sunos
for instance sunos 4 did that and solaris continues to provide it

327875
unix	solaris
in so far as unix thus far my investigation has led me to lumios and solaris --still free if you are a developer or a tinkerer rather than a business and solaris as the closest to system v r4 but able to take full advantage of modern hardware

327875
openbsd	freebsd
if you are happy with a bsd based version then i would vote for openbsd or opendarwin rather than freebsd because of the enhanced security

327878
ubuntu	debian
i too have had this problem on ubuntu and i solved by installing an old debian package for wget patched with all security updates necessary ie wget 1.13.4-3 + deb7u3 and then i blocked the installation of updates for wget up as the ubuntu version will not be fixed using sudo apt-mark hold packagename

327881

versioning	upgrade
make sure to first find out the exact versioning of vte your terminator is using which in case of terminator versioning 1.0 will probably be vte-0.28.2 and start off from that versioning or upgrade to terminator 1.90 and go for vte-0.fourty-whatever

ubuntu	debian
as long as it s open source isn t horribly buggy and is actively maintained it s eligible for being in ubuntu at least in the â œuniverseâ repository which redistributes most debian packages

328023
versioning	upgrade
running apt-get upgrade or one of the xxx -upgrade variants upgrade installed packages to the latest eligible versioning according to the local copy of the package lists

328023
ubuntu	debian
if you absolutely wanted the latest version you could look for a ppa a source of extra packages that is not maintained by ubuntu quality varies or try the latest version from debian unstable or recompile the upstream source â â but once again most people don t need that

328027
centos	linux
i do all of my coding and development on linux primarily centos or lubuntu so i ve come across the immensely useful

on a default installation the cron jobs get logged to

328153
jobs	cron
you can see just cron jobs in that logfile by running

328164
rmdir	mkdir
ignoring the fact that bash has a huge number of not-strictly-necessary features why didn t things like expr test mkdir rmdir etc

328164
rmdir	mkdir
things like mkdir and rmdir whose implementation is almost literally a single call to a libc function would seem to be obvious candidates for inclusion

328190
jobs	cron
the error message c queue max run limit reached means that you have reached the limit of concurrent cron jobs

328190
jobs	cron
i believe that the default setting for cron on aix is 50 concurrent jobs so you really need to investigate why you have 50 jobs running at the same time

328190
jobs	cron
these two lines should give you the list of jobs running under cron and from there you should be able to investigate the root cause of the issue

328190
jobs	cron
if you really need to increase the number of concurrent jobs you can find the configuration setting in var adm cron queuedefs

328190

328682
freebsd	linux
many projects contain source code that only gets compiled if you explicitly say that you re compiling for freebsd or linux

328703

so if you have a wireless card and an ethernet card you ll have two mac addresses

328704
openbsd	ifconfig
openbsd s ifconfig doesn t have this

328705

vim	emacs
beside vim emacs and joe editors here are some others terminal tty x-terminal emulator editors that can show at least two files at the same time

329671
spaces	delimiter
you can also use the join command to do this but i don t know how to get it to combine the fields - they remain spaces delimiter so an additional stage of processing is required

329689
switching	screens
now in order to switching from one to another i always detach the current and re-attach the one i want to switching to which works fine but it would be great if my active screens could be imported to an attached session so that i can simply switching between screens with a n a p

ubuntu	linuxmint
did you try it using ubuntu 16.04 linuxmint thru livedvd

329833
chown	chmod
or there is a different way like setting a setuid on chmod chown then any one can run the chmod chown as a root but that will be horrible

329879
hash	md5
this indicates that it is an md5 hash

329879
hash	salt
after that is the hash password which was hash using the salt - in this case puhl00ks5uy3cmvaic0 g0

329879
hash	salt
now you can use openssl to hash the given password using the same salt like so

329879
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
enter the given password when prompted the openssl command should compute the md5 hash using the salt provided and it should be exactly the same as the above from the shadow file

basically i don t know what s the best practice to upgrade a package whose apt versioning is not update-to-date enough

329936
rar	zip
p7zip by the way is a compression utility that does rar zip and more through a command line interface

329975
next	except
gparted showed me like 35 errors before it showed that the disk was completely unallocated except the unallocated text had a caution symbol next to it

329986
filesystems	hfs+
one has been formatted with an hfs+ non-journaled filesystems and 800gb of files written with rsync

329986
disk	ram
constrained resources the debian system has 6.5gb of free ram and 2.4 gb free disk space which seems adequate to me

329987
switching	screens
i ve just installed compiz reloaded on my xfce rig and have mapped the corners and clicks on top of screens for window switching compiz plugins like scale

330080
put	get
you can put in and get out individual files as you like

330097
libxml2	libxslt
i have the following packages installed via pacman python-lxml libxml2 libxslt

330114
bash	zsh
while some other shells like at t ksh bash yash or zsh have settings to alter the behaviour of their echo builtin the behaviour of the gnu echo command can also be affected by the environment it s currently not the case for dash

330127
debian	linux
os linux kernel 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.16.36-1+deb8u2 2016-10-19 x86_64

330146
ubuntu	linux
on linux 3.13.0 ubuntu trusty

330146
temp	tmp
it s suppose to use a certain directory for temp storage and it s informed of that directory via setting the env variable tmp

330154
ubuntu	debian
for debian it installs various packages with apt with logic that basically tries to detect what the right package names are for different versions of debian ubuntu and add some backport repositories

330155
bash	zsh
for bonus points uninstall oh-my-zsh and enjoy zsh as it was intended a powerful and flexible alternative to bash not a bloated ratmangle.

330174
openbsd	linux
the openssh server contains code that tries to imitate on linux what it can do with the bsd c library on openbsd

330177
bash	zsh
another option is to use zsh instead of bash which can redirect to multiple files

330185
ubuntu	linux
i have a windows 10 linux ubuntu pc layout over 2 hdd s as below

330185
ubuntu	linux
once all running ok i then hope to reinstall ubuntu linux with the linux data partition on an hdd

330201
installation	upgrade
you might be able to boot to that partition and install the laptop s original os to the ssd and then upgrade that win7 installation to win10 assuming it doesn t keep track of keys or use some other method to prevent multiple copies being made illegally

330208
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
the easiest way to sort files by their modification time is to run zsh as opposed to other less powerful shells such as bash ksh or fish

330211
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
apt the package management tool used on mint and debian ubuntu elementary os and others has a mechanism for marking packages as â œautomatically installedâ as a dependency of another package or â œmanually installedâ

330216
filesystems	ntfs
so as long as you mount your windows ntfs partition somewhere under linux you can tell your linux av to scan the files in it for malware or just let it do it s default thing where it scans all possible filesystems

330219
ubuntu	debian
most likely privoxy is a user on your system if you installed the privoxy package in debian or ubuntu

330235

330242
bash	zsh
in ksh bash zsh yash

330249
bash	zsh
it dues to your shell which probably bash zsh or csh

330249
bash	zsh
this feature is original from csh and copied later by bash and zsh

330249
bash	zsh
in bash zsh history expansion is enabled by default in interactive session and will be performed inside double quotes

330300
rpm	yum
4 install that package rpm -i --nodeps var cache yum x86_64 7 base packages openssh-6.6.1p1-31.el7.x86_64.rpm

330353
daemons	launchd
is there some way to launchd a single daemons for all the settings and then stop it afterwards or something

330377
solaris	aix
on a number of systems like solaris aix or hp ux but not linux the number of bytes in the pipe if instantiated would show in the size field of ls -l on the pipe

330402
folder	directory
when i call the link from the terminal while inside of its containing directory the link works and correctly moves my terminal to the folder

330415
sudo	passwd
run it with sudo is not an option i dont want to have to type the passwd just for that.

330415
stdout	stderr
i could filter the output too stdout and stderr but i want to know if find have some appropriate option way trick for dealing with that

330434
folder	directory	temp	tmp
if the folder tmp exists and is working has write permissions but the temp folder is pointed to other directory like var tmp you can try to set the temp folder to point to tmp using

330440
udp	tcp
the ports required for galera mariadb to function properly are tcp ports 4444 4567 and 4568 and udp port 4567

330460
sudo	passwd
it sounds like the issue is that you re backgrounding the entire sudo process and it s unable to prompt you for the passwd

330460
sudo	passwd
sudo run something else and give it the passwd followed by your command depending on your sudo configuration or

330460
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
configure sudo via visudo to allow your user group to run sudo commands without a passwd

330481
folder	directory
i have two folder desktop and .rstudio-desktop in my home directory

330492
interpreted-language	compiled-language
interpreted-language are typically simpler to write and to adapt being less strict than compiled-language and don t require compiling which makes them easier to distribute

330559
interpreted-language	compiled-language
java python and many other modern languages are actually such blends they try to get you some of the portability and or quick-development benefits of the interpreted-language and some of the speed of compiled-language

330599
rpm	yum
this shows that rpm -qa also includes package listings for the public keys that are trusted to sign packages while the yum command omits these packages

330690
sudo	passwd
i m working on a script that runs a command as sudo and echoes a line of text only if my sudo privileges have timed out so only if running a command with sudo would require my user not root to type its passwd again

330691
vim	emacs
i find using emacs easier than vim

330696
sudo	passwd
if a passwd is required for the command to run sudo will display an error message and exit

330709
ubuntu	linux
i also set up one ubuntu linux production server to back up to idrive in addition to dlt s yes old school old habits die hard and the hardware is super cheap now

330726
sudo	passwd
edit in the last case sudo dodo works without passwd

330730
sysv	systemd
because systemd came later it has a mechanism to run old sysv init scripts for forward compatibility

330730
sysv	systemd
i don t think sysv has a way to read systemd service files

330731
bash	zsh
if you are using bash or zsh or ksh93 you can just do

330753
filesystems	xfs
both servers are running centos 7.2 on a xfs filesystems

330759
sudo	passwd
if the command requires superuser passwd you should first sudo su - and crontab -e as root

330776
bash	zsh
apparently tcp connections can be used as file descriptors on linux from with in bash zsh

330783
min	max
they translate to set brightness to max and set brightness to min

330794
stdout	stderr
either use the csh syntax to redirect both stdout and stderr would be

330809
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
how do i compile transmission-gtk torrent client from source on linux mint 18 or generally ubuntu 16.04 based systems

330810
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
in this compilation procedure let it be clear that it is written for today s current version 2.92 and for ubuntu 16.04 based systems as is linux mint 18

330819
sudo	passwd
however i assume you don t have password-less sudo and or you may not have the passwd for user2

330822
centos	linux
to install x window software on linux server at least centos rhel environments others are probably similar you can check for the following

330840
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu

330841
mouse	joystick
joystick over tcp or mouse rs232 port framebuffer dev soundcard dev disks etc

330844
cpu	processors
to display which cpu processors the current shell is running on at this instance

330863
ubuntu	linux
i want to use an existing ubuntu machine with a public ip to allow a user to ssh into it and then use it to ssh remotedesktop ftp into another linux machine with a private ip but within the 1st machine s network

330869
ubuntu	debian
i do not know what distro you are on but i would create a script in bin and call it chromium for debian or chromium-browser for ubuntu

330924
hex	binary
which treats the input file s as binary no translation for linefeeds or encodings see perlrun then loops over the input file s not printing incrementing a counter for all matches of the given hex or whatever form see perlre

330931
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
where i ve used as the bash ansi-quoting originally a ksh93 feature now supported by zsh bash mksh freebsd sh version of fish s xef and used grep -o .

330954
bash	zsh
if you are in ksh ksh93 or mksh not ksh88 nor pdksh zsh yash or bash then

330954
bash	zsh
if you are in bash or zsh then exec -l path to ksh is shorter and has the same effect.

330984
octal	hex
of course translating hex to octal will work on almost any shell

331001
ubuntu	centos
i rsynced a large file from remote centos to local ubuntu with

331001
ubuntu	centos	hash	md5
out of curiosity i computed md5 hash on centos and ubuntu and these are different

331001
hash	md5
the recipient splits its copy of the file into chunks and computes two checksums for each chunk the md5 hash and a weaker but easier to compute rolling checksum

331001
hash	md5
if they re the same the sender uses the more computationally expensive md5 hash to verify the chunks are the same

331003
stdout	stderr
i know it s possible to redirect stderr and stdout to a file via and there s also tee 1 which allows one to copy its input to both the screen and a file

331003
stdout	stderr
is there a tool to redirect stderr and stdout to a file and append timestamps to it for logging purposes

331010
ubuntu	centos
means that the file has selinux context as every file on centos and no files on ubuntu which might confuse md5sum in some way

331012
gentoo	linux
btw both computers run gentoo linux

331048
ubuntu	centos
to install it for example on centos or ubuntu

331062
cpu	processors
you should enable the processors microcode firmware for intel cpus to improve the functioning of the cpu

331073
debian	linux
linux 4.5.0-1-amd64 #1 smp debian 4.5.1-1 2016-04-14 x86_64 gnu linux

331088
debian	linux
the linux distribution is debian stable jessie

331090
google-chrome	firefox
this application uses flash and is disabled in firefox and google-chrome by default

331098
ubuntu	linux
is it possible to take some kind of dump of a directory on a linux ubuntu server that i can later use to compare against for new modified files

331130
redhat	fedora
the interface configuration files under etc sysconfig network-scripts read by nm are fedora redhat specific but the configuration key is not - on other distributions nm just reads the interface configurations from different locations configuration files

331172
centos	linux
i need to expand the partition on a linux centos 7.3 hyper-v gen 2 virtual machine

331174
chown	chgrp
ideally the file would be chown chgrp but that s not really the question i m asking

331185
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu libpoppler-glib-dev fedora poppler-glib-devel

331216
versioning	upgrade
upon trying to upgrade the kernel versioning to something above 4.1 from debian backport i am met with the following message

331239
switching	screens
in order to switching from a guest to the host we must move the mouse along the top edge of guest screens

331248
sudo	passwd
executes sync and pm-suspend-hybrid without passwd nor sudo

331260
put	get
if i could get one good software to process the text part of the notes and another to process the equation part of the notes i d be able to put them all together already

331275
snmp	mib
steve is right - mib is not needed in case that handling of snmp communication is done by the system you write and you are ok with numeric oids

331276
folder	directory
above copies all the files in the directory that were created after 17 december 2016 20 10 00 to the folder 1 day before today

331282
centos	linux
i have a setup consisting of 3 linux centos machines

331298
stdout	stderr
unlike ordinary redirection the command will still see stdout and stderr connected to a pts device so commands which use different formatting for file output and terminal output will still be producing all the terminal formatting sequences

331330
freebsd	linux
admittedly i don t even use linux but freebsd

331330
freebsd	linux
in freebsd i think this can be skipped for linux

331345
versioning	upgrade
the solution is to upgrade the current versioning of your package to the versioning that will be installed for the other architecture

331438
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if you do this at the very least make sure that sudo if you use sudo is configured to only run the commands that absolutely need to be run and make sure that your page is not accessible to just anybody -- lock it behind a passwd in apache for example and be especially wary if it s on the internet proper rather than behind a corporate firewall but even then -- don t trust the firewall to make it safe. also make sure that untrusted other people can t add php or cgi programs on this host because they ll be able to use that line in etc sudoers as well

331445
sudo	passwd
the lxterminal is used by both root and users users will be asked for the sudo passwd

331468
mp3	flac
i found this script a few days ago to convert all flac files in the current directory into the mp3 format

331468
mp3	flac
i think it replaces the ending flac with mp3 for the current filename

331472
mp3	flac
as you guessed it replaces the ending flac if any in value with mp3

331473
mp3	flac
so it s replacing the extension flac with the extension mp3 in your example to provide ffmpeg with the output filename

331488
mouse	keyboard
the phrase display is usually used to refer to a collection of monitors that share a common set of input devices keyboard mouse tablet etc.

331499
homebrew	yum	redhat	fedora	centos	linux
most common package managers used on linux are binary package managers and amazon linux like redhat centos and fedora use a package manager called yum in contrast with homebrew discussed above which is called a source package manager because its packages are source code that is downloaded and installed

331499
dnf	yum
easy to follow instructions to set up the repository you can find here please note that you use the dnf command instead of yum which i mentioned - don t worry about it - dnf is just the new version of yum

331502
mouse	keyboard
and the mouse and keyboard are shared between them

331502
mouse	keyboard
if you want several people logged into one machine each with their own display mouse and keyboard -- then yes they ll generally each have their own x server

331502
mouse	keyboard
this probably isn t what you re after but you can also have multiple computers with their monitors next to each other and share one mouse and keyboard between then having them work like a multiple monitor setup

331502
mouse	keyboard
it s been a long time since i looked at that -- looks like it s now a commercial product and not free boo but they did remove the massive security hole in that you can now secure your mouse and keyboard yay

331516
width	height
by adding -stats you get easy access to the width and height of the window

331523
ubuntu	debian
what do i have to select to get basically a debian server like a ubuntu server with a local console

331531
ubuntu	debian
i m using vagrant 1.8.1 on ubuntu 16.04 hosting debian jessie

331559
daemons	launchd
i launchd redis as daemons

331570
folder	directory	put	get
so there are 2 additional directory phone_memory and external_memory - internal mem and sd card so after i put correct folder in -c switch i get following successfull result

331610
min	max
and this will return 60 for example that should be the max number of events min

331611
stdout	stderr
personally i tend to write them to stderr so i can redirect stdout and get only the program s actual output

331611
stdout	stderr
when to use redirection to stderr in shell scripts the accepted answer suggests what i tend to do keep the program s final output on stdout and anything else to stderr

331611
stdout	stderr
should the usage message go to stderr or stdout

331614
sudo	passwd
this would of course require that i input my sudo passwd every time i launch something as a restricted users

331616
kerberos	ldap
samba 4 got commercial version to support ad authentication.what i knew ad autherntication required ldap and kerberos authentication when using samba for ad authentication

331627
freebsd	linux
this is to do with the freebsd drivers for virtio they are simply not up to the task to run as fast as linux drivers

331644
ubuntu	linux
from what i understand you want let s say for example call script.sh and make it run script.sh arg1 so you can do that with alias its like grep in linux actually when you call it in ubuntu you calling grep --color auto

331655
vim	emacs
similarly and to verify that this is not strictly an issue with vim if i type sudo emacs foo.txt and press enter then type alt-x type getenv and press enter then type home and press enter it will still return root

331657
disk	ram
additionally this folder may be mounted as temporary filesystem stored in ram rather than on disk meaning that its capacity may be too small to hold your backup files

331665
daemons	systemd
i will move my router daemons to bird or my dns systemd to freebsd as that for me it is not an acceptable solution

331669
rpm	dnf
this was surprising because the keystore used by dnf is actually rpm

331669
versioning	upgrade
however doing an online update with packagekit is not documented as a reliable way to upgrade between fedora versioning

331694
freebsd	debian	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	debian
one uses pierre-yves ritschard s or cameron t norman s code for preference because it does not exclude the possibility of having this mechanism on ubuntubsd debian freebsd actual freebsd trueos openbsd and so forth

331707
disk	ram
however you can also ask it to measure other things such as ram and disk usage

331774
ubuntu	linux
i m porting a script from ubuntu to alpine linux 3.4 docker image

331807
sudo	passwd
the problem was a backgrounded sudo -g asking for the passwd on the terminal even though the current account has no passwd

331807
sudo	passwd
the non-determinism was due to sudo eventually allowing the command the next time you pressed enter on the terminal and not asking for a passwd again for some time

331814
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
it looks like your btrfs filesystems are stored on lvm logical volumes

331823
versioning	upgrade
i m not sure why you re getting this error since there may be many possible reasons but if you re using a hypervisor host - such as esxi - and your oses are working fine after the boot and you re only getting this error whilst the boot time you need to update your hypervisor host since it does not fully support the newly upgrade kernel versioning

331845
freebsd	debian
note if you re using debian or freebsd check out this installation help

331849
vim	emacs
by using a simple version control system like rcs which is readily available for vim and emacs you get the dual advantage of having a history of your changes and the checkout system should by default remove the current file and recreate it with the correct modes

331853
ubuntu	centos
for instance ubuntu ships with apparmor enabled by default and rhel centos ship with a few selinux rule sets that you can choose from with the least restrictive one of the set being enabled by default

331882
powerpc	i386
i have an i7 6700 processor and i have no idea how to find out what architecture it is amd64 arm64 armel armhf i386 mips mipsel powerpc ppc64el or s390x in order to choose a matching debian build

331900
ssl	https
but http https and ssl traffic is not accepted anymore

331937
debian	linux
i m trying to set up a linux system debian 8.5 kernel 3.16.36-1+deb8u2 64-bit using systemd-networkd to configure the network interface

331958
openbsd	linux
secure foss alternative to skype on linux openbsd

331979
firefox	safari
this time round it does give a timeout error in safari but while opening it up in firefox i have got back the error ssl_error_rx_record_too_long

331987
cpu	processors
the ghost ntp server that is causing the issue is running on the bmc processors on the system and not the main cpu

331992
unix	bsd
i often see within a tutorial article unix options in some commands bsd options in some commands gun options in some commands and a mix of two or more options in some commands

332003
stdout	stderr
so you need to redirect both stdout and stderr to somefile

332005
bash	zsh
is there a way to test whether a shell function exists that will work both for bash and zsh

332011
disk	ram
the basic idea is that you program the realtimeclock chip as a wake source for n seconds in the future and then suspend either to ram or disk or even switch the system off

332012
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to connect over serial cable from ubuntu 12.04 to an embedded linux device for which uname -a returns

332047
bash	zsh
the above should work in ksh where it comes from zsh and bash

332049
bash	zsh	gentoo	debian
what works doesn t directly depend on the distro gentoo debian rhel etc. or the shell zsh ksh bash - it depends on which terminal emulator is used and its settings konsole terminator urxvt lx-terminal etc

332051
width	height
the image width is set to 640 pixels and height to 480

332074
ubuntu	linux
i am running linux lite 3.2 64bit which is based on ubuntu 16.04

332089
spaces	delimiter
additionally the example includes a spaces after the delimiter

332090
pull	push
i also pull from and push to github repos from time to time

332099
switching	screens
to switching from one screens window to another

332105
kde	gnome
default file managers of both gnome and kde desktop environtment can easily access windows shared resources using samba protocol

332123
folder	directory
how can i gzip and copy files to another folder keeping its directory structure with one command in linux

332132
bash	subshell
how do i import the results of a subshell command into an array in bash 3

332138
versioning	upgrade
if at all possible barring any incompatibilities with mission-critical services programs the simplest answer may be to just upgrade konsole and or kde to a newer versioning

332151
tunnel	vpn
both vps-a and vps-b have net.ipv4.ip_forward enabled and there is a vpn tunnel between those two virtual machines

332158
folder	directory
assuming you re in the root folder where are all directory for compression in your case you can use find along with xargs command

332159
rpm	yum
i got an embedded device with rpm on no yum

332227
ubuntu	linux
to access the videos on my samsung gear 360 from a linux ubuntu desktop

332239
folder	directory
when you backup the correct directory tree i suspect you ll find your missing documents folder

332252
udp	tcp
on centos 7 i am trying to open connections to some services in my localhost using both http and direct tcp udp web server db etc but i keep getting connection refused on ports that are not 8080 or 80 .

332269
spaces	delimiter
-d specifies the delimiter in this case a spaces character

332286
mouse	keyboard
x2x allows the keyboard mouse on one x display to be used to control another x display

332286
mouse	keyboard
both work via creation of an invisible 1px wide or high window on a screen border and as soon as you touch the border with the mouse your pointer gets frozen and hidden on the original screen and your input keyboard and mouse gets sent to the remote x11 or vnc screen

332289
rpm	yum
with info for an installed package as you say jdk is this will work even if there isn t a yum metadata cache because it will get the info from the rpm database

332292
put	get
put in a script called myopti and you can use myopti echo hello | cat and get the cleanup

332311
put	get
how to get tag-order style to put the _message output at the end

332319
ubuntu	linux
i am using an ubuntu linux system

332346
screens	tablet
when i use the tablet for writing with a pen i would like to be able to use touch to scroll but in order to avoid palm rejection issues i would hope to only have a small area of a screens say a rectangle on the left side that is responsive to touch input

332349
unix	bsd
most people use either the bsd or unix variety of flags

332349
solaris	bsd
having worked on both solaris and bsd type systems i have a bad habit of using both or even mixing them up together at times

332349
unix	bsd
i would recommend you stick to unix or bsd keep to one for your day to day stuff and learn about the output format -o and sort k output formats

332353
jobs	cron
use separate key which is not encrypted for cron jobs becuase you still don t have a reasonable and secure way how to provide passphrase in cron job

332362
freebsd	linux
coming from more of a linux background i looked into freebsd and i have read most of the freebsd handbook which is good and provides lots of insights also about security chapter 13

332362
debian	linux
as stated before i am used to way of some linux distros debian more specifically where a mechanism or tool called secure apt is used where the original trust root is via a public key debian archive automatic signing key which gpg signs a cascade of hash lists that eventyually cover all files in packages

332362
gentoo	linux
i have checked that package signing via a web of trust wot approach from some other linux distro arch linux is as young as 2012 see while for gentoo similar seems to exist yet i cannot tell when it was introduced

332369
bash	zsh
alternatively you could use ksh bash zsh s here

332369
bash	zsh
even though macos sh is based on bash nowadays it would be better to switch to bash zsh or ksh implementations other than mksh whose arithmetic use 32bits as is not a sh feature so may not work in future version of macos if they decide to switch to a different shell

332406
filesystems	btrfs
i m using btrfs as filesystems so any uncontrolled outage is quite dangerous

332441
freebsd	debian
freebsd trueos ports are not source packages in the debian sense but are rather automated ways of obtaining and building source packages that are published by someone else

332441
freebsd	debian
debian has moved towards how freebsd works over the years and doesn t work like that wiki page says any more

332499
icmp	tcp
as icmp does not use ports ping expects only and ip address but wget established a tcp connection and downloads a file

332507
vim	emacs
just like emacs users remap capslock to ctrl some vim users me included remap capslock to esc

332509
filesystems	xfs
for the xfs filesystems an inode data structure is divided into 3 parts

332566
ubuntu	linux
since i started chrubuntu back in december of 2010 it s always been necessary to utilize the chrome os linux kernel with ubuntu in order to solve some compatibility issues with the chromebook architecture

332567
switching	screens
but when i download something from firefox then click on open containing folder in the firefox download menu the entire screens becomes unresponsive until i switching to text console and kill firefox

i would like to try to boot a full linux distro now ubuntu

332585
ubuntu	linux
since i started chrubuntu back in december of 2010 it s always been necessary to utilize the chrome os linux kernel with ubuntu in order to solve some compatibility issues with the chromebook architecture

332588
filesystems	xfs
for some types of filesystems xfs it s not possible to shrink them

332605
freebsd	linux
if you are not using linux or freebsd or possibly macos

332605
freebsd	linux
alternatively if you are using linux or freebsd you may be able to use inotify or kevent directly from node.js with some sort of extension plugin module without spawning a process

332618
bash	tcsh
note that csh tcsh are not shells compatible with the bourne shell which is part of posix whilst bash is

332638
centos	linux
i am using centos 7 and fairly new to linux

332678
versioning	upgrade
i am still using linux fedora 20 and it is well past the time when i should upgrade to the latest versioning

332685
rpm	yum	dpkg	apt
the list of all installed packages which i can generate with dpkg and apt so i am expecting you can do the same with yum or rpm

332692
bash	subshell
as steeldriver wrote in a comment in modern versions of bash you can write like this to avoid the subshell

332696
mouse	keyboard
when plugging it in again no add event is logged - no matter what device i plug in keyboard mouse bluetooth dongle ...

332700
bash	zsh
but i want to open applications which run in the terminal in a new terminal for alsamixer vim bash zsh it should look like

332735
stdout	stderr
dec 26 14 43 50 debian smartd 523 test of to email email.com produced unexpected output 101 bytes to stdout stderr

332741
daemons	systemd
the vm lacking systemd is running the ntp daemons

332745
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
by default debian ubuntu mint has a user with administrative accesses namely used to shutdown mysql called debian-sys-maint

332764
freebsd	linux
and since i doubt that there is a way to make freebsd behave like linux what would be the best practices to install custom-build software and files accessible for all users

332769
bash	zsh
for example both bash and zsh are provided optionally and must be added on after a bare installation and so they live there

332798
versioning	upgrade
systemd versioning is 232-7 the os is a late 2016 raspbian debian 7 based with some packages including sytemd partially upgrade to debian stretch 8

332799
bash	zsh
since zsh and bash are packages and are not in base they go to usr local

332809
ubuntu	debian
what i found is nss-passwords which seems to be written in ocaml and c so iâ m not sure it works every where but itâ s at least easily installable in debian based distros like ubuntu

332821
ubuntu	mint
i ve tried it on multiple computers with different oses ubuntu mint etc but all exhibit the same problem

332823
switching	screens
for example when it turns mouse reporting on when you switching to a help screens and back off when you switching away again

332831
kde	gnome
i ve just installed kde s kolourpaint in my debian 8 though i m using gnome it s working very well -- and it s the most similar to windows paint i ve found up to now

332870
versioning	upgrade
to install the linux-headers you should upgrade your kernel versioning

332873
redhat	fedora
rpm fusion provides software that the fedora project or redhat doesn t want to ship

332873
redhat	fedora
that software is provided as precompiled rpms for all current fedora versions and redhat enterprise linux 5 and 6

332873
rpm	yum
you can use the rpm fusion repositories with tools like yum and packagekit

332873
redhat	fedora
fedora is effectively bound by the same legal restrictions as redhat as a us company is bound by

332896
bash	zsh
with ksh93 bash zsh mksh or yash

332896
bash	zsh
and to get the first element in zsh or yash or just in zsh or in ksh or bash

332901
stdout	stderr
by default stdout and stderr of a systemd unit are sent to syslog

332903
ubuntu	centos
on my centos 7 system which comes with a slightly older version of xterm 295 vs 322 on ubuntu the cursor color inverts properly

332903
bash	tcsh
in bash tcsh the cursor seems to work fine

332904
icmp	tcp
your tcp packets should take the same path there and back whereas icmp packets are more forgiving

332914
centos	linux
i have setup a centos linux server

332917
installation	upgrade
home directories and local installation under usr local should not be touched and the rest of the system should be managed by the upgrade

332932
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout 1 and then redirect stdout to a file

332948
stdout	stderr
command execution program started consume memory stdout stderr to shell

332949
folder	directory
what i m basically looking for is the functionality of usbmount that works for ata devices and doesn t clutter up the media directory with unused folder in short

332973
jobs	cron
the documentation isn t suggesting anything to me other than the fact that most people do not alter the default settings for these cron jobs hence the jobs usually run at their default times

332989
ubuntu	centos
on centos release 5.11 final i m using adduser --create-home baz but somewhat prefer the way ubuntu asks extraneous questions about contact information

332989
asterisk	elastix
this is on elastix 2.5 asterisk running on centos.

332994
sudoers	visudo
should i just go ahead an manually edit sudoers with visudo

333047
ffmpeg	libav
as ubuntu ship libav instead of ffmpeg

333111
filesystems	ntfs
linux is going to give you better options and probably support and stability for accessing a ntfs filesystems since the user base would be more likely to want to access a ntfs filesystems

333111
filesystems	ntfs
i haven t tried opening a ntfs filesystems under solaris 11 yet to copy it over to zfs but i d reco trying to install and use the vendor supplied pkgs over the ones mentioned by maverick

333145
throttling	throttle
you can use to throttle the file transfer speed which based on comments below actually specifically seems to work by throttling the read speed of the data which is precisely what you re looking for

333189
stdout	stderr
of course as usual 0 is stdin 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

333198
stdout	stderr
i would like to save the stderr stream of a command into a log file but i also want to display the whole output stdout + stderr on the screen

333198
stdout	stderr
i only found the solution to display stdout + stderr to the console and redirect both streams to a file as well

333204
stdout	stderr
this sends the stderr of foo to the same place as the current stdout which is the pipe then sends the stdout to fd 3 the original output

333208
switching	screens
you are also able to view it inside a screens when you switching to one that you ll first need to create

333217
kde	gnome
i ve switched to multiple desktop environments and window managers like fluxbox icewm awesome kde plasma and gnome

333305
bash	subshell
note that when you invode script.sh in this way bash . script.sh you ask your current shell to invoke a bash subshell that will execute script.sh and exit

333305
bash	subshell
only that bash subshell will be echoing pwd then cd-ing to the directory the echoing the new pwd

333381
gentoo	linux
i would like to get a list of all the live version 9999 packages on my gentoo linux system

333384
children	parent
probably there is a parent process which kills child processes and forks new children

333417
vim	atom-editor
in vim we can use the zs atom-editor to say really begin the match right here

333445
rpm	dnf
then i tried to install the rpm using dnf but i was getting this message

333457
folder	directory
note that accessing a file also involves folder permissions throughout the directory tree

333506
post	get
if i run sudo . vboxadd setup descripted in the post the log-file get the following message

333530
bash	zsh
this is possible at least on debian with bash completion is it possible with zsh

333557
bash	subshell
the problem here is basically that nohup can t execute grouped commands the concept of subshell is exclusive to bash you can t execute one with nohup so you could put your code in the opt myscript.sh file

333612
folder	directory
if you install namepackage.tar.bz2 or any other extension of tar when being in the folder home name downloads meaning installing through terminal in that directory can you delete the folder namepackage that was created in the installation

333613
mouse	keyboard
sometimes the x server locks up after freezing or whatever s going on in there because vlc music loops at the current packet then for 1 second the pointer becomes invisible the keyboard mouse won t work and i get a screen that looks like this

333625
bash	zsh
this is for bash and zsh

333629
sudo	passwd
if you have your sudo passwd then try the following this is on ubuntu 14.04lts

333634
filesystems	fat
i resized a fat filesystems

333637
filesystems	fat
in the case of a windows 10 recovery drive for uefi this could be worked around simply by creating a smaller fat filesystems and copying the files into it

333653
versioning	upgrade
after you upgrade to a new kernel versioning you need to re-install the virtualbox modules and any other out-of-tree modules such as closed-source video drivers

333729
client-side	server-side
if you have no explicit setting the default value according to man 5 ssh_config client-side and man 5 sshd_config server-side is

333776
debian	linux

so i cannot provide any estimate of the schedule when the bugs of matlab will be fixed in debian linux

333834
ubuntu	debian
you mentioned dhcpclient.conf was on ubuntu debian

333836
bluetooth	usb
regardless my solution was to get an external usb bluetooth adaptor after which things work swimmingly

333845
ubuntu	debian
found this for ubuntu but don t really want to install it without knowing compatibility or if there s a better option for debian

333864
debian	linux
you need to boot linux debian from cd dvd usb and chroot you linux partitions

333864
ubuntu	debian
here is a link howto for ubuntu which should work for debian too

333875
freebsd	netbsd
according to this detailed post by stã phane chazelas -quit is supported in gnu s and freebsd s find and in netbsd as -exit .

333910
spaces	linefeed
they go mainly unused on unices and linux in favour of characters like spaces tab linefeed and colon

333913
ubuntu	debian
googled but could only find ways to do this in ubuntu in ways not applicable to debian

333929
stdout	stderr
you keep your stdin stdout and stderr

333930
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	centos	debian	mint	redhat	fedora	centos	mint
i would install and use virtualbox and install debian mint ubuntu centos fedora or if your school has the cheap free licenses for it redhat workstation

333933
folder	directory
now go to the librealsense folder and run scripts patch-uvcvideo-fc23.sh do not run the script while inside the scripts folder go to the previous directory

333949
folder	directory
however the directory i m symlinking to is in my dropbox folder which i ve excluded

333953
unix	bsd
notice too that the -j flag to bsd make does require an argument and that this flag is non-standard the unix posix standard doesn t mention it

333967
google-chrome	firefox
i have multiple browsers on my system firefox google-chrome and chromium

333967
google-chrome	firefox
for example assume i have firefox google-chrome and chromium and i click a link in a pdf file and chromium is already open

333981
kde	gnome
once by the rtkit-daemon and the other times by gnome kde autostart or an other app

334009
x86	64bit
on a modern 64bit x86 linux how is the mapping between virtual and physical pages set up kernel side

334022
emacs	sublimetext
it might be ok to co-opt this distinction for local graphical editor sublimetext or gvim vs a terminal window editor vi or emacs but there s likely a mountain of legacy reasons why that probably won t work as hoped

334027
gentoo	linux
you can reference the gentoo linux install documentation to get an idea of how to set up a chroot

334036
bash	zsh
this is usually already done for bash in debian but maybe not in zsh

334048
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to obtain the index of the arrays i m iterating within a for-loop

334068
bluetooth	usb
the interesting thing is that this keyboard acts as a normal apple wired keyboard when i connect it with the lightning cable to the computer in which i assume is due to the bluetooth radio not being used and resorting to usb hardware drivers perhaps it s registered with a different usb device id than the original apple aluminium keyboard i didn t verify

334095
unix	bsd
you can t even take a driver from oses that are superficially similar such as the bsd systems and just import it into another unix system without some delicate coding

334112
hide	show
you can show them and hide them very quickly just by clicking on their little icon in the panel and choose hide all show all

334173
daemons	systemd
that means is the core file collection for systemd daemons disabled by default

334185
solaris	bsd
linux seems to be the only unix-like os recently i ve verified this on solaris bsd and mac os x that does not behave this way and i really miss this as a good visual confirmation of the interrupt of a program in the console or xterm

334196
debian	linux
i m on debian gnu linux 8 jessie and trying to install packages with aptitude in a bash script from a shell variable

334214
ansible	puppet
generally sysadmins with a mixed install base would use a cross-platform configuration management orchestration system like puppet chef or ansible to manage updates

334228
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu 16.04 lts xenial xerus linux kernel 4.4.0-57-generic

334229
filesystems	btrfs
add the new drive to the filesystems with btrfs device add dev sdd mountpoint then remove the missing drive with btrfs dev del missing mountpoint remounting the filesystems may be required before btrfs dev del missing will work

334233
rpm	dnf
i searched for perl json backportpp using good old google to find that for mageia at least perl-json provides this requirement source ftp www.rpmfind.net linux rpm mageia cauldron i586 media core release perl-json-2.900.0-5.mga6.noarch.html so i ran sudo dnf install -y perl-json if relevant i am operating on fedora 25 only to find that perl-json was already installed.

334274
ubuntu	linux
i am a complete linux newbie running ubuntu 14.04 lts on an acer chromebook 14

334342
dnf	yum
the basic advice is to upgrade with yum to at least fedora 21 and then dnf system-upgrade from there

334342
dnf	yum
you may have better results doing yum dnf based upgrades all the way to f23 before doing dnf system-upgrade â or even going all the way to f25 that way

334345
kerberos	ldap
sssd looks up the user in the ldap directory then contacts the kerberos kdc for authentication and to aquire tickets

334345
kerberos	ldap
for example you can configure sssd to do authentication directly with ldap or authenticate via kerberos

334345
daemons	systemd
the sssd daemons does not actually do much that cannot be done with a systemd that has been assembled by hand but has the advantage that it handles everything in a centralised place

334348
bluetooth	usb
disclaimer i ve only done all this for usb but i suppose it will apply in the same or a similar way to bluetooth

334354
folder	directory
solves the issue with empty ftp directory after mount --bind a folder into var ftp on selinux

334356
debian	linux
i m using the rubber program in python from lauchpad to process a latex document thru pdflatex called by rubber -d on debian sid linux the document is some h2020 european r d proposal

334373
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
my laptop has 3 windows 7 and 2 linux distributions ubuntu mint

334373

versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
i am using gitlab versioning 7.10.4 and i am trying to upgrade the installation

334570
debian	linux
tuto installing debian gnu linux from a unix linux system

334591
rsa	dsa
for example according to some recommendations rsa and dsa keys should be at least 3072 bits

334597
put	get
if i put the lines in the opposite order i get the identification changed warning

334621
stdout	stderr
apart my script s silly message there s nothing useful that would let to distinguish what is stderr or stdout

334623
kde	gnome
i can t even log on into kde and gnome but i can log on into i3 lxde and dwm

334649
hash	md5
can we compute hash function sha1 and md5 for an empty directory or for directory itself in linux

334698
hide	show
when automatically show and hide the panel is checked there is still a small sliver of the app bar that show

334741
rsa	dsa
i have figured out that the problem is that dsa key is stored in known_hosts but there is no rsa key yet

334758
rsa	dsa
the key in your known_hosts is dsa and the server sends rsa they differ and it is wrong

334777
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint

334788
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
32gb partition is partition with filesystems ntfs or fat but not mounted

334812
filesystems	ntfs
it s an ssd after all--it is designed to cope with usual filesystems such as ntfs which uses 4 kib allocation units

334813
centos	linux
currently i m installing putty on a centos 6 box then copying the binary usr bin puttygen on to the amazon linux box

334845
ubuntu	mint
your version of mint is based on ubuntu 16.04 so you should use the sources for that as documented on the repository s main page

334877
rpm	yum
basically you re grepping for the package names from the above output of yum in the output of that rpm command

334879
put	get
in the shell script the application this is what i do to get at the username more or less i ve put it in a shell function

334901
folder	directory
there s a large number of distributed file systems you can use to allow the servers to access each other s directory folder

334914
filesystems	btrfs
when making a btrfs filesystems across multiple devices the default is to use raid0 for data and raid1 for metadata

334914
filesystems	btrfs
to confirm what raid level is being used on an existing filesystems you can use the btrfs utility

334921
for-loop	arrays
in second case we put lines into arrays and use for-loop for printing them when input is read

on my apache server i need to create new user accounts that would only access a specific folder but when i try to change their root directory in ssh the server refuses to do it

335084
debian	mint	debian	linux
linux mint being based on debian probably has the stat overrides feature

335115
next	except
if a backslash means escape the next character whether it s a brace another backslash or anything except end-of-line then you can skip that next character like this

335131

or you can add a host entry to etc hosts which is another source for the debian ubuntu scripts.

335153
centos	linux
joyent provides pre-built pkgsrc packages for linux rhel oracle linux centos and scientific linux but requires these to be installed with sudo

335165
mouse	keyboard
i m running debian on a dedicated htpc without a keyboard or mouse attached

335165
udp	tcp
most users will use lirc and an ir receiver to control the system but my remote control is advanced and can send direct tcp udp commands to my network

335165
mouse	keyboard	udp	tcp
is there a way to emulate a keyboard and mouse on the system and accept commands from a tcp udp server

335167
sudo	passwd
command that you probably want is sudo which allows you to run commands from root account but authenticates with your passwd

335177
bash	subshell
this opens a bash in a subshell which switches to your mount point and then does nothing forever

335189
ubuntu	linux
i have a problem which is reproducible on linux ubuntu vms 14.04 lts created in azure

335191
mouse	keyboard
i actually do the full windows install via a passed through mouse keyboard and the monitor on the radeon card

335194
daemons	launchd
however the gnome keyring daemons is automatically launchd at login and disabling it did no good

335247
debian	mint	debian	linux
i have two linux distributions installed on my pc linux mint and debian both having separate boot partitions and both are installed on luks encrypted volumes

335247
debian	mint
debian was installed first then i installed mint

335247
debian	mint
debian was not detected by grub at mint installation

335247
debian	mint
running update-grub on mint also does not detect debian

335271
dpkg	apt
the only bug in bellow solution is that it is based on recent versions of apt dpkg that are available in debian testing 8.6 and might not be available in other systems

335292
vpn	ssid
i m trying to add a third ssid to my openwrt router which only connects users to an openconnect vpn network

335312
folder	directory
there are 4 folder in my current working directory

335356
freebsd	linux
in freebsd what is the correct way to find hard disk drives by some criteria like size or model name ok here dev disk by-id would help if one had it as usually in linux

335365
mouse	keyboard
you could generate some entropy keyboard mouse is best failing that network and disk large finds counting etc are next.

335384
debian	mint
that s why from debian mint was not detected and visa versa

335384
debian	mint
for instance if you choose debian then promise to yourself to never run update-grub from mint

335384
debian	mint
for instance if you choose debian to manage grub2 then you ll need to manually add the menu entries for mint

335384
gentoo	linux
take a look at the grub2 documentation for gentoo linux

335408
symlink	dotfiles
i would like to symlink my emacs init.el into a dotfiles repo - located at documents dotfiles

335413
jobs	cron
var spool might also contain user configuration and data such as cron jobs and unopened mail messages

335428
int	chars
lines beginning with aradu followed by a literal . followed by any uppercase chars followed by any int two times

335452
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if your sudoers configuration is more sane allowing nopasswd access to only a specific list of commands that are expected to be run as batch jobs or otherwise frequently enough to make nopasswd arguably prudent then attempting to sudo other commands will still balk without a passwd

335489
bash	tcsh
whatever software this is it is kind enough to offer two different files one for users of sh -like shells like bash and ksh and one for users of csh -like shells like csh and tcsh

335504
put	get
but to put it in a table i separated the string using the char and get an array like this

335516
cinnamon	gnome
de like gnome and cinnamon as turns out does screen auto rotate based on the data provided by iio-sensor-proxy in dbus

335516
cinnamon	gnome
ps gnome gives the option to completely disable auto screen rotation i m not sure if cinnamon has this option too

335519
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
sudo chmod chown as necessary

335531
bash	subshell
it seems to me like all forms of capturing stdout to a variable require a subshell in bash and using a sub shell will not allow me the ability to change a value by reference in the caller s context

335532
ubuntu	centos	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	centos
i personally prefer managing my configuration manually so i opt for systems such as centos and gentoo but i know some advanced users who still prefer ubuntu so it s a personal choice

driver file has been installed into lib modules 3.10.0-514.el7.x86_64 kernel drivers net wireless 8192eu.ko then i reboot with uefi security mode turned off the driver seems loaded by system but the device is recognized as ethernet i can t specify my wifi password to connect.

335549
apache	nginx
i have a server - s1 - using apache as its webserver and another server -s2 - running nginx as its webserver

335549
apache	nginx
so newly added files in the nginx server s2 has owner and group of apache

335549
apache	nginx
i ve had no problem with serving files everything is working fine but is it a security issue that i m reading apache files using nginx

335549
apache	nginx
update 1 the user set for nginx in the configuration file is nginx not apache

335551
bash	subshell
for bash you could go with the stack_pop in the beginning of my post and then have a stack_top_print that just prints the top element of the stack to stdout without removing it which it can t because it would most likely be running in a subshell

335572
udp	tcp
i tried different combinations of tcp udp cipers sndbuf rcvbuf tun-mtu mssfix comp-lzo compress lz4-v2 no compress different tap drivers windows 7 64 ubuntu with no luck

335585
stdout	stderr
from this i understand that in zsh redirects both stdout and stderr to dev null

335636
bash	subshell
subshell commands must be execute automatically within bash scripts

335636
bash	subshell
it runs automatically then executing the subshell within the bash but it requires human interaction i want to execute it automatically within my bash script

335649
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
you say linux but surely it will be a particular flavour of linux like debian ubuntu red hat etc

335649
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
check what the package installer for your flavour of linux is called apt is available on debian ubuntu systems

335665
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu etc

335665
udp	tcp
update2 op says tcp and udp is a requirement

335665
udp	tcp
a bit older but does tcp and udp

335676
cpu	processors
i am on a dell inspiron 11 3000 series with an intel celeron n3050 processors using integrated intel hd graphics braswell .the cpu architecture is 64-bit x86_64

335679
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
you could run it with sudo after having run visudo to add which will stop sudo from prompting your user for passwd

335688
freebsd	linux
note that this does not work with usr compat linux proc on freebsd

335692
temp	tmp
you need to make some space available on the old drive by deleting files from somewhere - the tmp directory and other temp space var tmp var spool would be the first place i would look to clean up

335702
sudo	passwd
and also configure your user so that they aren t prompted for a root passwd every time you sudo

335738
filesystems	xfs
i love xfs_copy s ability to clone an xfs filesystems from disk to disk

335758
versioning	upgrade
typically this would occur on upgrade to a new versioning of ubuntu 16.04 - 16.10

335774
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
as my old ubuntu lts 12.04 runs out of maintenance this year i ve setup a fresh system using linux mint 18.1 cinnamon

335787
debian	linux
system debian gnu linux 8 jessie 64-bit

335809
disk	ram
however i am not sure if proc pid io includes i o that was expected to be done on ram but went to the disk because of paging and swapping

335814
debian	linux
i am new to linux i installed debian

335816
google-chrome	firefox
when i receive a link in an email it opens with google-chrome but i want links to open with firefox

335823
udp	tcp
i want to apply 2 different filters on them 1 mbps b w for udp and 7 mbps b w for tcp

335829
mouse	keyboard
at this moment system is going unusable it is very slow and i even can not move mouse and press keys on keyboard despite on that cpu load is about 5-10

335854
spaces	delimiter
the -d -f 2 bit says use spaces as the field delimiter and give me the second field

335887
bash	zsh
this appears to be only bash zsh did not have this quirk

335984
udp	tcp
ssh over udp isn t used this still leaves a service definition for ssh over tcp

335984
udp	tcp
http and https over udp aren t used leaving http and https over tcp

335988
heredoc	herestring
for already running assuming the command is a program and thus runs as a child process under the shell running the script or part thereof and the script didn t give it a heredoc or herestring for input or it has read or at least buffered that input you can stop after the process finishes by

335989
openvpn	iptables
the best choice is to do that in every service configuration and set every service to listen for specific ip not any ip but you can do that in iptables so you can drop any packet that have destination ipb and the port is not openvpn port or only allow destination ipb and port openvpn but you here you will lose the ability to use the port with ipa

335993
centos	linux
you might be aware that centos linux distribution is a platform derived from the sources of red hat enterprise linux rhel

336019
daemons	systemd
a more extreme workaround is to use the options above to limit the resource consumption by the systemd journal while also forwarding the logs on to another logging daemons which has a filtering feature

336037
ubuntu	linux
i have usb disk attached to my linux box ubuntu 14.04

336052
centos	linux
but i want this test to only return true if and only if the platform is scientific linux so even the similar platforms centos and red hat enterprise linux fail to return a true from this test

336083
debian	linux
sorry for the lack of information on here i m fairly new to using debian and linux in general so i m not sure what else i can put to show more info about this

336090
installation	upgrade
in general the gist of it involves booting the installation media for the release you d like to upgrade to and selecting u pgrade from the menu

336126
vmware	virtualbox
this is similar to what is used with hypervisors like vmware virtualbox oracle vm and others when they do virtual machines live migration teleportation

336135
debian	linux
i m trying to properly install virtualbox guest additions to a guest linux debian virtual machine

336153
kde	gnome
if you re using kde newer versions will have a way to change how kde handles gtk applications system settings - application style - gnome application style gtk

336234
folder	directory
i have a nightly backup that creates a new folder each night and saves a copy of each of the files in the directory selected

336256
bash	zsh
with zsh you can do in place of but bash has no equivalent

336261
bash	zsh
note i am doing this in bash not zsh

336268
spaces	delimiter
nothing apart from newline is treated as a delimiter so spaces and other special characters are fine

336272
bash	zsh
so a leading hyphen in produces a login shell but bash does not execute etc profile when invoked in this way which is inconsistent with the behaviour of its -l option and also with other shells such as zsh or dash

336300
put	get
the only trick i could suggest you is to put back your system data touch the file then get back in the future

336302
filesystems	btrfs
linux does not provide a kernel api for accessing the file creation times even on filesystems supporting them ext4 btrfs and jfs perhaps it will be impelemented in the future

336308
linefeed	delimiter
what i need is a routine that will count the number of delimiter on a line and if it is below a specified threshold to then delete the linefeed at the end of the record

336308
linefeed	delimiter
so for example we know that a record is 29 columns and should have 28 pipe delimiter | when we get the data because of the erroneous linefeed we get two records one with for example 10 fields and 9 delimiter and a second with 19 fields and 18 delimiter

336308
linefeed	delimiter
again looking for a woutine to count the delimiter and remove the linefeed if the number of delimiter falls below specified threshold

336349
bash	zsh
the construct is a bash extension also available in at least ksh and zsh and is called here-string and it will pass the string on standard input to the command

336411
ubuntu	linux
how can i achieve this in linux ubuntu

336452
freebsd	linux	x86	64bit
it isn t even merely due to being compiled for the wrong architecture trying to run a 64bit x86 binary on a 32-bit system or vice versa or for the wrong operating system trying to run a freebsd executable on linux the kernel does not recognize the file as being in an executable format at all

336474
bash	zsh
what is this zsh feature and is there a way to let rm behave like in bash

336500
ansible	puppet
i would suggest as well to look into options like puppet chef ansible etc.

336504
folder	directory
on server bb i want to check if the given folder is empty or not if not empty it should remove all files directory

336506
folder	directory
it is extracting files in the zip folder but my destination directory created ends with m

336513
apache	nginx
how in the first place nginx is able to access files created by apache

336513
apache	nginx
there could be that the user id and group id of apache on s1 matches that of user id and group id of nginx on s2

336513
apache	nginx
if nginx and apache are running with privileged ports you may want to be extremely careful

336513
apache	nginx
any identified privilege escalation or root exploit vulnerabilities of your running versions of nginx apache could allow a hacker to gain access to your server

336513
apache	nginx
if one of nginx apache is holding very sensitive data you are providing a way to get to that via the other server

336513
apache	nginx
while the external world might not know that nginx process is sharing the same folders as apache anyone having local shell access to s1 or s2 can eventually make use of vulnerabilities to gain access to the other server

336517
folder	directory
mh traditionally uses a single directory per folder while maildir as you discovered uses three subdirectories

336522
ubuntu	linux
i m having a hard time getting a 4tb external usb drive to work on both linux ubuntu 14.04 as well as on my mac osx

336525
bash	zsh
all modern bourne style shell interpreters like bash ksh dash and zsh to name a few implement the test utility internally as a builtin so when you use them the right manual page to refer to might be the one of the shell not the test one

336541
debian	linux
i ve recently been getting into linux debian - gnome shell and am currently having trouble with my wifi

336546
bash	zsh
unlike bash zsh by default reports an error in case a filename generation pattern has no matches

336547
ubuntu	linux
on linux or in my particular case ubuntu 16.04 it is in usr bin

336547
bash	zsh
this feature also used by other shells such as bash and zsh

336571
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
how to install daemontools on ubuntu or debian from source answers cover centos

336600
ubuntu	mint
i got it to install in ubuntu 16.04 lts mint 18 by doing the following with elevated permissions sudo su root etc.

336607
debian	mint
please see the answer here it s about debian but should apply to mint as well

336609
stdout	stderr
the â not easy to explainâ behaviour is that normally all output to stdout stderr ends up being recorded in the terminal-emulators backbuffer so i can scroll back while not so normally to me in the case of using less or nano output is displayed by the terminal-emulator yet upon exiting the programs the content magically disappears

336635
switching	screens
they are designed with the knowledge that part of switching to cursor addressing mode is switching to the alternate screens buffer and part of switching to scrolling mode is switching to the primary screens buffer

336635
switching	screens
this is particularly noticable with unicode rxvt on some platforms where the termcap terminfo sequences for switching to cursor addressing mode do not implicitly clear the alternate screens buffer

336635
switching	screens
with xterm one can switching to displaying the alternate screens buffer from the gui menu of the terminal emulator and see the content still there

336635
switching	screens
note the differences in what extra actions are implied by each on top of switching to from the alternate screens buffer

336642
kde	kubuntu
i don t bother with all the fancy looks on dekstop if it can came in one package that similar to kde kubuntu but lightweight

336645
daemons	systemd	sysv	systemd
it is designed to be backwards compatible with sysv init scripts and provides a number of features such as parallel startup of systemd services at boot time on-demand activation of daemons support for systemd state snapshots or dependency-based service control logic

336645
daemons	systemd
type forking is used for daemons that make the fork systemd call

336650
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
many other popular linux distributions are based on debian including ubuntu linux mint and raspbian

336671
cpu	processors
st - time in spent on involuntary waits by virtual cpu while hypervisor is servicing another processors stolen from a virtual machine

336685
bash	zsh
recent versions of bash also support associative arrays using a syntax looking more like that of ksh93 than of zsh

336691
ubuntu	mint
i am running mint 18 i had the same problem on ubuntu 14.04 - so i assume this is a general ubuntu problem where my internet connection goes out intermittently

336711
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
sounds about right ms-windows can only read fat and ntfs filesystems the usb will no-longer be one of those two

336716
ubuntu	debian
debian testing has 2.48 which should be compatible with the ubuntu version

336724
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
there are systems that must keep running for a long time without rebooting but where people want to run newer software usually in a chroot from the main critically important never upgrade installation so libc tends not to require a very recent kernel versioning

336724
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 16.04 comes with glibc 2.23 which accepts linux kernels as old as 2.6.32

336726
folder	directory
someone moved our api folder to a random directory

336783
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your wine versioning or downgrade your python versioning

336807
dpkg	apt
thus on systems that use apt package management - in my particular case ubuntu 16.04 - there is the file var lib dpkg info tar.md5sums which stores the md5 sums of all files that came from tar during installation

336807
tar	md5sum
so you could write a simple if-statement that checks whether the output of md5sum bin tar matches what is in that file

336837
jobs	cron
shame that in this and other pages listed in google results on how ot deal with hung cron jobs that noone ever mentions pstree

336886
minimum	max
where 1 max roughly a value of 1200 and -1 minimum roughly a value of -1200

336901
daemons	systemd
for this example i do know that the ssh daemons is running since i can ssh to the systemd

336931
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i thought it has something to do with linux mint and tried installing ubuntu 16.04 which is the base for linux mint and still had the same heat issues

336969
cpu	affinity
in recent versions of taskset there is also an -a option which sets or retrieves the cpu affinity of all the tasks threads for a given pid

336983
stdout	stderr
in particular the question i m concerned with right now is whether to use stdout or stderr when the user called the program with illegal arguments

336989
stdout	stderr
on stderr so that redirecting stdout won t stop you from interacting with the shell in a meaningful way

336989
stdout	stderr
doing this on stderr is preferable since it could otherwise be read by whatever was reading on stdout but we don t do that with ls anyway do we

336994
ubuntu	debian
i have recently switched from ubuntu 12.04 to debian 8 as support for 12.04 is about to run out

337014
stdout	stderr
see related question for more info do progress reports logging information belong on stderr or stdout

337017
ubuntu	debian
if it worked in ubuntu but not in debian it was probably enabled by some non-free firmware package

337017
debian	linux
this is often the reason that hardware like wifi cards don t work in debian but do work in other linux distributions

337024
debian	centos
solutions for either debian or centos systems are appreciated

337040
kde	gnome
i used gnome not kde

337041
daemons	systemd
i hope you don t need anything provided by a standard linux installation mount points other than daemons remote access serial console etc because you won t have any of this of course since your systemd didn t start at all

337083
debian	linux
i was just wondering why does not work on my system debian jessie x86_64 gnu linux 3.16.0-4-amd64

337133
tunnel	vpn
the pc is set to default gateway 192.168.1.2 and all traffic on the pc is correctly routed through the vpn tunnel

337150
folder	directory
i want to have a folder in my host os windows 10 and put my project files in it so it should automatically move to var www directory of my ubuntu vm

337152
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i ve installed linux mint windows pre-installed the only way i can boot to grub is if i go to bios change the boot order from linux to windows the boot order seems to reset the boot order from ubuntu to windows loader every time i boot to windows the only way for me to boot to grub is this way but even when i boot to linux in cannot access the hdd files

337166
sudo	passwd
install sox and setup sudo such that sudo tcpdump requires no passwd

337179
openbsd	netbsd
my best bet is that this was either openbsd or netbsd but i cannot remember when or where i saw this

337187
debian	linux
the current release debian gnu linux 8.6.0 can boot on i386 and amd64

337187
powerpc	i386
for example debian 4 had one cd for i386 amd64 and powerpc and another for alpha hppa and itanium

337199
cpu	processors
processors intelâ coreâ i7-6820hq cpu 2.70ghz ã 8

337238
spaces	delimiter
paste -d -s myfile takes each line of myfile and pastes it serially on a single line separated by the delimiter a spaces

337258
chown	sudo
if you want to require sudo use to delete it you need to make the directory and perhaps all the files inside it be owned by root with chown

337270
sudo	passwd
for example if i type sudo synaptic and enter a wrong passwd i get 3 tries to get it right

337270
sudo	passwd
i want sudo to only give me 1 try and exit with error code 1 if the passwd is incorrect

337312
daemons	systemd
also if this is a service daemons and if your unix systemd has a way of querying it for information whether it s up and running or not then that is the proper way of checking on it

337312
openbsd	linux
on linux you have systemctl systemctl is-active --quiet varnish will return 0 if it s running 3 otherwise on openbsd you have rcctl etc

337320
x86	64bit
you are trying to install an x86 64bit version on to a 32bit system

337329
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to access my onedrive for business storage from the linux console specifically a headless ubuntu 16.04 server

337335
fish	zsh
modern shells like zsh or fish work around that be detecting when the output of the last command doesn t end in newline and give you a visual indication then

337335
stdout	stderr
generally when stdout is a terminal device stderr is as well

337347
putty	winscp
to do what you want there s a much simpler way use winscp on your laptop to connect to the remote cluster it works similarly to putty then upload the files you want -- in your case files from c users name desktop afu in your laptop to svm on the remote cluster

337355
jobs	cron
cron jobs aren t really suited to managing desktop applications

337362
ubuntu	linux
i m setting up a linux server running ubuntu to store a mysql database

337422
filesystems	btrfs
i have 2x3tb disks creating raid0 btrfs filesystems

337454
ubuntu	linux
i experience that my ubuntu linux requires a restart every now and then and also that it needs restart more often than in the old days maybe it s because it updates more

337462
openbsd	netbsd
on netbsd it s -exit and on openbsd it does not exist

337463
mouse	keyboard
additionally i have another usb keyboard mouse pair that work fine in linux

337475
ubuntu	centos
when i use centos or ubuntu i just type gp to run gnuplot

337478
bash	zsh
if you absolutely need use instead which is feature of many bourne-like shells including bash ksh zsh

337483
bash	zsh
it s .bashrc if you use bash or .zshrc if you use zsh

337500
stdout	stderr
though worst case it could be defined as io on the tty stdin stdout stderr

337503
post	put
edit3 i thought that question in bold was clearly marked but some people failed to read and started marking this whole post as put on hold as unclear what you re asking

337506
sudo	passwd
edit i am trying to add a sudo user with no permission to su command and sudo user have passwd less access to root using sudo -i

337512
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems is tried for fat32 and also ntfs

337561
dnf	yum
if it is fedora you should install tic by dnf install -y ncurses or yum install -y ncurses on earlier fedora distros

337563
ati	nvidia
i have a ati radeon 2400 xt and a nvidia gtx 580 in my debian computer

337584
pop-up	dialog
with quick switch windows the pop-up dialog appears at the top right of the editor i am able to select another editor its tab is moved to front but i cannot type in the window

337584
pop-up	dialog
with next editor a pop-up dialog appears roughly in the middle of the screen but it does not work if the mouse is not just by accident inside the menu

337597
ubuntu	debian
using ubuntu 16.04 but would like it to work in modern debian stable or later as well

337601
sudoers	passwd
if your account isn t included in the sudoers file first type su type your passwd and afterwards type apt-get install scrot

337626
openbsd	freebsd
on most system usr local should be a safe area for you to install things into although this is also used by package managers on some systems freebsd and openbsd for example since they regard software installed from ports packages as local software

337626
ubuntu	openbsd
the link goes to openbsd s version but it s also available on at least ubuntu amongst the linuxes

337646
sorting	grouping
i got a mailbox-file mboxrd created by getmail and i d like to process it by sorting mail from various grouping of senders and move them to separate mailbox-files i guess 3-5 for now

337651
versioning	upgrade
they typically work with security updates as those don t change any internal interface especially data structure formats but not to upgrade between kernel versioning

337655
kde	kubuntu
kubuntu 16.04 plasma 5.8.5 kde framework 5.28.0 qt 5.6.1

337661
disk	ram
as i understand hibernation works by saving the ram to swap disk so theoretically all the command has to do is copy the ram to swap

337663
chown	chmod
the problem is it requires root and even if i chown or chmod it the permissions reset after reboot

337671
chown	chmod
the practical impact of that is that running chown chmod etc

337680
post	get
i ll discuss the script in a later post when i get it working

337686
ubuntu	debian
i can do it on an ubuntu or debian vps in case that makes a difference

337709
ubuntu	mint
i am not sure about which ubuntu version mint 18 corresponds too but if you have a standard setup and the problem persists you can file a bug report on launchpad

337724
postfix	dovecot
it runs postfix with dovecot

337726
debian	linux
to create a debian bootable usb from linux machine you can use the command dd or the command cp as recommended on the official website

337740
xfce	gnome
i m now on fedora 25 gnome used to be on manjaro xfce and what i miss the most about it is the gui linux switcher so informative and easy to use

337741
spaces	delimiter
this doesn t quite work here though since the column utility will treat any number of spaces or tabs as column delimiter

337750
ubuntu	debian
note some shells such as dash debian almquist shell default bin sh on ubuntu implement here-doc redirection with pipes internally thus may not be seekable

337754
rpm	yum
i have updated yum repository for httpd only x86_64 with updated httpd rpm

337800
bash	zsh
i m primarily interested in the case of zsh which is my everyday shell but at work i often need to write bash scripts so i d be curious about the answer to this question for bash as well.

337814
ubuntu	linux
in the context of a big c++ code-base i was assigned the task to provide some automatic mechanisms to configure a remote linux server running ubuntu 14.04 server edition in multiple different ways

337821
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
if the point is that you would like to use an array-like syntax in zsh you can use is an array that refers to the positional parameters like in csh tcsh fish

337824
debian	linux
gnu linux debian jessie 8.7

337825
sudo	passwd
the way this usually works is that you do something like access the network manager settings and it asks you for your user passwd to allow you to sudo to change those settings

337825
sudo	passwd
if your user passwd does not work here you might have to set up sudo to allow your user to run commands as the super user root

337825
sudoers	visudo
here you will need to consult the man page for visudo and make an entry in the sudoers file for your user

337840
mdadm	btrfs	xfs	btrfs	xfs	mdadm
some mdadm magic or would changing from ext4 to btrfs or xfs help me out

debian	linux
i am designing a system that includes a linux debian based control computer

337864
ubuntu	linuxmint	ubuntu	mint
if you wish to install the amdgpu-pro driver on mint you have to make a small edit on the installation script for it to recognize mintâ open the install script that you download from the site and in line 47 replace ubuntu with linuxmint like so

337892
debian	centos
in debian systems you can add scripts to etc initramfs-tools scripts but as far as i can tell there s no equivalent in centos

337942
folder	directory
what if we want to remove both folder and files under path to directory folder

337959
bazaar	git
currently makepkg supports the bazaar git subversion and mercurial version control systems

337998
centos	linux
i am new to linux and learning to work with my centos server right now

338010
daemons	systemd
i have deployed a couple of daemons on ubuntu boxes and wrapped them as systemd services

338010
ubuntu	debian
now it turns out that the default configuration on ubuntu i guess same on debian is to make journald forward all events to run systemd journal syslog see etc systemd journald.conf #forwardtosyslog yes and have rsyslog pull data from there with the imuxsock module see etc rsyslog.conf

338033
openbsd	freebsd
this was written from scratch and there is even a c omparison with the freebsd code and how openbsd drivers are simpler and yet powerfull

for additional information slack chat only comes already compiled in .deb for ubuntu not debian and .rpm

338057
rpm	yum
try yum instead of rpm

338059
kde	gnome
i would need at some point a graphical interface - kde gnome

338081
bash	tcsh
so as the title suggests i m trying to convert from a tcsh to bash

338107
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
to add to the above answers you can also do in csh tcsh ksh bash zsh fish yash -o brace-expand

338113
jobs	cron
i m trying to move away from running cron-scheduled jobs with root so the thought process is to create a system account with no login dev null home sbin nologin shell to run each cron job we need ran

338157
disk	ram
linux case this kernel optionally extracts and executes an initial ram disk image initrd such as generated by dracut 8 which looks for the root file

338157
disk	ram
in the first boot-up phase the kernel starts up and mounts an initial root filesystem from the contents of dev initrd ram disk initialized by the

338162
bash	zsh
in both zsh and bash ksh like you can always do

338162
bash	zsh
in both bash and zsh

338180
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
means block all communication protocols tcp udp icmp etc from source 10.2.10.163

338202
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
some filesystems such as zfs and btrfs can do it as can volume types such as lvm

338203
gentoo	linux
due to something probably user error causing my arch install to not boot i finished making the switch to gentoo linux i had a partition on my hdd i was using as a staging area

338211
int	chars
it makes a correspondence between int values in the range 0â 127 and a bunch of chars not all of them printable

338212
disk	ram
such device types include any filesystem on common types of partitions on common types of disk anything vaguely scsi-like including ata usb etc. as well as ram disk and nfs mounts

338212
disk	ram
replacement is what happens with an initrd which is a particular kind of ram disk

338213
fontconfig	freetype
since most applications used xft and therefore freetype and the freetype library is using calls from the fontconfig library the use of these fonts become ubiquitous

338216
filesystems	btrfs
this is useful to store the verbatim btrfs snapshots at arbitrary filesystems

338248
centos	linux
i am aware of centos fedora scientific linux and oracle linux but my question is strictly for the purposes of practicing for the rhcsa exam - which one is the best match for rhel 7 when considering the following tasks

338250
centos	linux
as mentioned in the previous question centos is your best choice since it is derived from the sources of red hat enterprise linux rhel

338268
google-chrome	firefox
for instance firefox and google-chrome are notoriously impervious to this

338268
udp	tcp
i completely forgot that games would most likely use udp while the trick above only works for tcp connections

338269
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i am trying to install linux mint ubuntu based and parrot os debian based on two separate ssds

338288
ubuntu	debian
but i only use it with debian and ubuntu

338318
mktime	strftime
however if you just want to change the date format of a column you can do that natively using the internal mktime and strftime functions

338321
centos	linux
the epel extra packages for enterprise linux repository is easily added to redhat and centos servers

338333
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse don t work at all not even caps lock or ctrl + alt + fn

338334
ubuntu	mint
i have had no luck in getting the microphone to work on it using ubuntu 16.04 latest mint latest antergos

338366
put	get
i put the --exclude and --remove-files options to different places but always get the following error message

338383
dnf	yum
if you look in the various dnf and yum repo config files you should find several explicit metadata expiry times eg

338436
ubuntu	linux
but now when i boot the pc the line to boot kali says ubuntu instead of kali linux

338448
debian	linux
it might be installed on other debian based systems but there might be dependencies issues and this solution needs to work fine out of the box and also on other linux distros

338454
ubuntu	mint
also worth avoiding anything that s used by an automounter such as media on mint ubuntu or using the listed directory trees for something other than their intended purpose

338475
gentoo	linux
i would study the arch linux qemu wiki the gentoo linux qemu wiki and the

338486
disk	ram
personally i trust my ecc ram more than my disk and i am convinced that zfs with its end-to-end checksums reduces problem probability by orders of magnitude

vim	emacs	vim	gedit	emacs	gedit
to view edit use vim or emacs or gedit at your own option

338536

open the csv file in your favorite text editor such as gedit kate mousepad etc

338558
ubuntu	linux
i want kali linux default screen recorder on my ubuntu but don t know the name since i do not have the kali linux

338564
openbsd	freebsd
some of the bsd variants are openbsd freebsd mac os x

338564
solaris	aix
some of the system v variants are aix hp-ux solaris

338579
ubuntu	centos
this solved the gui problem for the ubuntu guest but not centos

338585
folder	directory
per-user groups lets you have both privacy in your home directory as well as easy collaboration in shared folder

338612
disk	ram
i have a server with 256gb of ram and i want to create a ram disk with let s say a 224gb size

338612
disk	ram
tmpfs is a more recent ram file system - you can specify a size limit in tmpfs which will give a â disk fullâ error when the limit is reached

338618
tunnel	packets
although the host knows a route to 10.44.55.55 and can ping it and although packets can be seen by tcpdump on the host they do not then pass through the tunnel to the destination as do packets issued by the same command on the host

338624
subnet	ip-address
the remote sends the ping-reply using your ip-address on the remote subnet and it has to make its way all the way back home

338624
tunnel	packets
see that the packets are delivered to and through the tunnel and that they make it all the way there and back

338624
traceroute	packets
if traceroute starts printing rows of asterisks it probably means that there is no reverse routing at that particular hop. the packets makes it there but can t get home from there.

338632
traceroute	ip-address
traceroute is your friend. furthermore traffic originating on a box that s running an openvpn client will be perceived as having an ip-address doled out by openvpn for that purpose usually 10.8.0.x so this address-range must be correctly routed everywhere ... as well

338650
x86	64bit
yet i cannot clearly see the reason why system calls in linux 32-bit x86 kernels have numbers that are not kept the same in the similar architecture linux 64bit x86_64

338660
icmp	tcp
since at least 0.75 mtr can use tcp syn rather than icmp packets with so you ll get stats for the same tcp ports as your normal traffic

338667
stdout	stderr
an answer i gave to a question and the comments to it had me read the posix conformance section of the base definitions to figure out whether dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr were actually needed for conformance to the posix standard

338667
stdout	stderr
these are features not required by posix.1-2008 and may include but are not limited to ... additional character special files with special properties for example dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr

338667
stdout	stderr
is there a posix system unix or a unix-like environment of some description alive today that does not implement dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr as files in the filesystem

338701
ubuntu	debian
after looking through many forums both here and in the ubuntu debian communities i still cannot connect to wireless

338737
bash	zsh
as others have demonstrated it is possible in one line using awk sed perl zsh or bash depends on your tolerance for long lines and readability

338746
mouse	keyboard
and do try to get hold of a proper sun keyboard and mouse

338746
mouse	keyboard
the type 6 keyboard and mouse are the best i ve ever worked with

338746
openbsd	netbsd
the openbsd installation instructions like those for netbsd contains all the information you need to get openbsd up and running on your machine

338761
toolchain	binutils
it appears that the avr toolchain was the default and reinstalling binutils fixed up the problem

338769
hash	salt
if there was no salt any block of data would always result in the same block hash

338769
hash	salt
the salt makes it easy to not worry about that by enabling all the block hash to change on every update by changing the salt on each update

338769
hash	salt
as the hash tree generated for use by dm-verity is not trusted and generated on device all that the device needs to generate it is the salt and the data

338775
daemons	systemd
is there a service daemons systemd i am not aware about

338784
folder	directory
to make it more clear suppose my script is placed in the directory home pi a which has sub directory - folder temp document directory are unknown to me it is just an example

338784
folder	directory
the directory home pi a folder has a .txt file and home pi temp has also have a .txt file so on.

338907
folder	directory
in order to get to the file home user567 folder textfile.txt the system will need to have directory entry x access on each of the directory in the path home home user567 and home user567 folder

338917
daemons	systemd
when you connect to a systemd using ssh the daemons on the target systemd spawns a new sshd process or even two one running as root the other as the target user

338917
daemons	systemd
etc init ssh.conf on systemd using the upstart init daemons

338925
rhel	suse
but after maintaining scientific linux an rhel variant and suse servers over the past 15 years i really want something like rpmconf 8

338989
stdout	stderr
the reason is very simple at the time of constructing a translated string it is not yet known where that string will appear stdout stderr a log file graphical interface sent through wire etc... maybe even more of these at the same time

338991
folder	directory
whereas in my case i was copying directory from terms folder to terms_code

338993
spaces	delimiter
ifs is the field separator that s used to split a variable expansion into words so this tells it to use as the delimiter instead of spaces

339011
put	get
i now have sysrcd or system rescue cd on the server and i m attempting to get my old files back to put them on a new server and reload the sysrcd server back to ubuntu

339018
debian	linux
so i just installed debian linux on my pc no errors during installation grub works fine

339032
ubuntu	debian
p.s link is for ubuntu but work for debian kali.

339050
kerberos	ldap
for large networks this is best done with a distributed authentication mechanism such as nis kerberos or ldap

339060
debian	linux
i am looking for something simple to backup bare metal restore a small linux debian jessie server

339065
sudo	passwd
also requires the non-wheel member that is allowed to sudo -u otheruser to assume the identity of otheruser where otheruser is a wheel-member to know the passwd of otheruser before becoming root

339065
sudo	passwd
so in a setup where sudo is used with the first configuration not for gaining root access but for just switching between different user identities possibly to be able to carry out specific tasks in some situations a user that is not originally part of the wheel group can not gain superuser rights without knowing the personal passwd of a wheel group member whose identity he is allowed to assume

339110
bash	subshell
bash performs the expansion by executing command in a subshell

339110
bash	zsh
this holds true for all bourne-like shells sh ksh zsh bash etc. and zsh is also able to capture data with embedded nul characters in this way

339141
debian	linux
i am running debian gnu linux 4.9.0-1-amd64 sid

339151
versioning	upgrade
the linux versioning does not currently automatically update so you will need to repeat these steps to upgrade to future releases

339161
sudo	passwd
this allows user1 to run all executables under scripts dir as user2 without entering their passwd using a command like sudo -u user2 scripts dir script

339161
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
user1 can accomplish that by running something like sudo -iu user2 scripts dir script which simulates a login shell but with the above sudoers entry this doesn t work and they re prompted to enter their passwd

339219
rpm	dnf
i ran just now dnf update and after it completed it took about 20 minutes running rpm -q libnl3 gives libnl3-3.2.29-2.fc25.x86_64 which is what you want

339219
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
regarding libnl-3-dev and libnl-genl-3-dev these are ubuntu debian packages not fedora centos packages

339236
spaces	delimiter
-- -f considers a single spaces as the delimiter

339249
daemons	systemd
second message smartd the daemons which monitors the self-monitoring analysis and reporting technology smart systemd built into most ata sata and scsi sas hard drives and solid-state drives is reporting that your hard disk dev sdb has 77 sectors pending reallocation

339254
emacs	aquamacs
is there any way to open emacs on new window without using aquamacs

339262
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade that or install one of the specific versioning such as libapache2-mod-php7.1

339267
sudoers	visudo
usually sudo depends on the vi package to edit the sudoers file visudo but it seems like for fedora it s vim minimal

339284
ubuntu	debian
note you might not be able to access the compile time config options with the the debian or ubuntu packaged version of php as the package maintainers had - in the past not sure if it still applies - made changes which suppress the printing of the compile time configurations using php-config see

339284
daemons	systemd
the cli sapi - which you get when you run php -v will likely be placed somewhere like bin php or usr bin php and the cgi sapi will be started as a daemons as part of the webserving subsystem at boot via an init script or systemd

339301
openbsd	linux
for linux systems which apparently use a different implementation of this utility from what i m using on openbsd you may want to use

339318
unix	aix
at least on aix - where everything - even directories follows the unix adiom everything is a file some are special.

339324
dnf	yum
checking if the package was in yum which is dnf now was they key

339362
debian	linux
uname -a linux version 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.16.39-1 2016-12-30

339364
bash	zsh
in shells that support here strings including bash zsh and ksh93 you can use

339373
stdout	stderr
however it can t get anything from stdin and it s output to stdout and stderr will be neglect

339384
ubuntu	debian
i m trying to install debian on a laptop on which i previously had ubuntu with everything working fine

339396
installation	upgrade
in 2016 i upgrade that installation to 16.04

339416
versioning	upgrade	put	get
now if the apt upgrade command is put into an executable bourne shell script along with other commands eg apt-file update apt update before the apt upgrade and the apt upgrade processs invokes dialog to get user input keep old modified config versioning replace config with new versioning etc then keyboard input is ignored -- characters echo on terminal but are not seen by the dialog process

339416
dpkg	apt
the only thing that can be done is to go to another x terminal kill the apt process remove a lock file run dpkg --configure -a run apt-get -f upgrade etc

339416
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
this problem is common to debian ubuntu and linux mint

339509
daemons	systemd
the problem is that the driver is a daemons that i have to start every time i boot the systemd

339509
daemons	launchd
to solve this i have made a udev rule to detect a touch screen and launchd the daemons but for some reason never gets to run the daemons

339520
bash	zsh
this is the first time i m seeing something that s more difficult to achieve in zsh than in bash

339565
stdout	stderr
why do some linux utility programs send output for normal operation to stderr instead of stdout

339640
debian	linux
i m using raspbian linux for raspberry using debian

339645
sudo	passwd
your interactive session is connected to a tty that some programs like sudo and ssh expect when prompting for passwd

339673
sudo	passwd
as thrig mentioned - sudo is probably asking for passwd and bash -x will give additional info of what is executed and what is the output

339675
kde	gnome
gnome kde systemd uswsusp upower laptop-mode-tools hibernate policykit-1

339677
ubuntu	debian	x86	64bit
edit also for some reason likely senility the guy who helped me replace ubuntu on this system with debian which i do like much better installed the x86 debian when i have the x86_64 intel core i7 processor which i 64bit

339699
chown	chmod
but can t seem to resolve it using chmod or chown on the relevant directories and the script itself

339699
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux currently using ubuntu 16.04 and have tried googling on this problem for the past couple of days to no avail any help would be greatly appreciated

339728
rss	feed
i have written this little python script to listen to the bbc rss top stories feed on my raspberry pi

339748
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
in my tests on linux freebsd and solaris a single read only ever yields one single line even if the user has entered more by the time read is called

339768
hash	md5
the issue is that although we can manage to identify with a md5 hash which binary is installed in the box we cannot determine which version is currently being executed

339768
hash	md5
is there a common way to determine which version of a binary is currently running based on for example the md5 hash of the binary

339769
sudo	passwd
i suspect that this could actually be the result of user1 calling sudo su root and inputting their own passwd

339770
post	get
a few weeks ago i managed to get this working between this serverfault post and this digital ocean blog post

339792
hash	md5
once you know which binary file is opened when the process was started you can md5 that file and get your hash of the actual binary loaded when it was run

339803
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
this script should edit sudoers to make passwd optional when any user in the sudo group uses sudo

339803
sudo	passwd
however something seems to have gone wrong and users still require a passwd to use sudo - long story short this effectively means no one has sudo as all users are created with --disabled-password

339826
hex	binary
convert the 256-bit binary value to its hex ascii representation and append the filename to create a check file that sha256sum will like

339826
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
od - octal binary hex dump of file

339829
rar	zip
i am trying to disable the attachment scan in my smarthost because i have a lot of people getting false positives when they try to send attachments with .exe or .exe inside of a zip or rar file

339856
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	opensuse	linux	opensuse	centos	centos	linux
i am newbie to linux and found that there are lots of distributions such as arch linux centos manjaro mageia fedora opensuse ubuntu based on linux kernel

339859
ubuntu	linux
edit i found out this worked from a new ubuntu 14.01 to an elder scientific linux box - but not the other way round

339876
ubuntu	linux
the difficult part is to change it on linux i use ubuntu and the way i did it was

339876
put	get
install gksu to get administrator permissions just put this command sudo apt-get install gksu

339877
cat	tee
when tee is used the contents written to the file will print in the terminal so cat seemed redundant

339906
ubuntu	debian
you can check this video providing installation instructions for your specific laptop model those are based on ubuntu but should be largely the same on debian

339949
folder	directory
to execute from different directory in ls we need to add the folder name as argument

339961
gentoo	debian
system rescue cd is based on gentoo not a debian derivative so there s no need for aptitude etc

339975
ubuntu	linux
how can i install linux ubuntu such that my local storage would only serve as grub boot iscsi initiator mounting one specific volume on the target no pxe involved

339982
sudo	passwd
does anyone know why solaris requires the old root passwd when changing the passwd as root or with sudo

339986
ubuntu	mint
the easiest way with deb ubuntu mint would be to just open gufw as sudo and watch the log after typing sudo systemctl restart ssh

340015
folder	directory
move the folder images to the newly created directory

340017
sudoers	visudo
edit the etc sudoers file sudo visudo

340018
pull	push
if you can read the file on the source machine as a regular user rather than root consider a pull scp rather than a push one

340044
cpu	affinity
the linux kernel has two system calls dealing with cpu affinity sched_setaffinity and sched_getaffinity

340044
affinity	processors
the affinity mask is binary and is entered as a hexadecimal number you can specify what cpus to utilize by using the full table for a quad-core processors below

340069
spaces	delimiter
if we use tr command along with squeeze option -s flag to convert all multiple consecutive spaces to a single spaces and then perform cut operation with spaces as delimiter â we can access the required column carrying the numbers

340072
bash	subshell
the code inside the is run in a subshell environment in the case of bash and shells other than ksh93 it s even run in a different shell process

340080
bash	zsh
if you are using sed in combination with bash or zsh you can just use a small meta-program like that

340082
ubuntu	centos
edit i have since tried this locally on ubuntu 16.10 as well as the original centos 7 machine and have the same results

340088
tunnel	vpn
so anytime when i talk to a aws instance my communication flows through a vpn tunnel and is encrypted by that tunnel

340088
gentoo	linux
i did that before in some gentoo linux distributions and it was easy enough to setup rsh to communicate through openvpn tunneled private ip addresses

340096
ubuntu	linux
i would like to dive deep into under linux more and have been playing with a nice tool strace version 4.11 on ubuntu 16.04 lts and i am curious as to why call like the following

340104
sudo	passwd
the result however is that the passwd doesn t work with commands such as sudo -i as the user or su myuser from another account

340126
ubuntu	linux
i develop a system x86_64 based that runs linux ubuntu 14.04.3 and has several pieces of custom built hardware connected

340140
free	malloc
so except gpio pins manipulation there will not be any system calls like printing output to console file opening malloc free etc.

340151
sorting	filtering
then if needed you can still pipe this output through any other filtering you might need like sorting etc.

340222
width	height
i can set the resolution by doing v4l2-ctl --device dev video0 --set-fmt-video width 1280 height 720

340251
kde	gnome
but to actually use it newer versions you need to do so on kde plasma as it s more stable there than in gnome at least until the devs fix this bug

340270
addition	multiplication
operation a process in which a number quantity expression etc. is altered or manipulated according to formal rules such as those of addition multiplication and differentiation

340285
centos	linux
centos 6 and probably most linux distros includes a man page section 1p for posix specifications

340291
stdout	stderr
is there a posix system unix or a unix-like environment of some description alive today that does not implement dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr as files in the filesystem

340298
openbsd	linux
on a linux server i m using they are writable by root but on my openbsd machine they re not

340298
freebsd	netbsd
the freebsd project seems to have used the exact same file as netbsd since at least 1994 and with a later commit adds a hint in the commit message that the old files were from the 4.4bsd release of the berkeley software distribution

340299
rpm	yum
i tried rpm -qa | grep php yum list | grep php and it looks like there is no phpmailer installed

340326
mp3	flac
i have a receiver that support internet radio streams and search for a simple way to stream mp3 and flac files to this receiver

340326
mp3	flac
should stream shuffled mp3 and flac files

340360
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to authenticate linux accounts ubuntu 16.04 via http with pecl-pam but the issue that i run into is that www-data has to be in shadow group in order to authenticate against etc shadow

340395
bash	zsh
witout dev fd new enough versions of zsh bash and ksh93 will used named pipes. it s left those open when invoking join so when join opens those it ll read from the two sort s

340430
mouse	keyboard
i have a little over 20 individual event files but only one keyboard and mouse

340433
traceroute	packets
what this does is to iterate down a traceroute listing and compare the packets speed to the current host with the packets speed of the previous host

340448
mouse	keyboard
there are other sources of input besides the mouse and keyboard

340449
mouse	keyboard
contrary to the assumption that one keyboard plus on mouse would give 2 devices even the simplest keyboard and simplest mouse would still give 6 of them

340449
mouse	keyboard
because xorg will create a test input keyboard and a test input mouse both virtual during its startup

340449
mouse	trackpad
for example i can move my mouse through my usb mouse or through my trackpad and an application does not need to know the difference

340449
mouse	keyboard
in other words for an application there really is only one keyboard and only one mouse

340449
mouse	keyboard
where the input devices correspond to serial ports notably in this case they do instead of keyboard or mouse

340454
dmz	was
and then the reverse suppose a request from some public ip was sent to this same server on 8082 and as it entered the dmz of this server the port would then change to 8081

340479
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
i tried gnome kde lxde xfce desktop environments but no difference

340492
ethernet	wireless
but linux does not see any kind of wireless interface only ethernet

340538
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i ve installed mysql 5.7.16-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 ubuntu and using rvm have installed the same mysql gems that i have in my old linux mint 13 install which i still have up and running on a seperate partition on the same computer

340559
xfce	gnome
xdg-open is just a shell script that detects desktop environment and call the corresponding program gvfs-open for gnome exo-open for xfce mate-open etc.

340560
debian	linux
if i boot with debian s official kernel linux debian 4.9.0-1-amd64 #1 smp debian 4.9.2-2 2017-01-12 x86_64 gnu linux and send the shutdown signal option everything works fine

e.g. if you have 100gib available ram and you disk writes with a speed of about 100mib the above settings would result a maximal amount of 5gib dirty cache and that may take about 50 seconds to write

340585
ubuntu	mint
at least this is how it works on mint and ubuntu which kali is based on.

340597
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your kernel versioning

340605
centos	linux
note i tested this on a centos linux so the code is not fully portable but the idea should be implementable on any nix machine

340630
put	get
you can also put these commands in your .screenrc to attach the devices automatically when you start screen or you could bind a keystroke to this command to get a shortcut

340643
mouse	keyboard
every tool i saw works specifically for mouse keyboard keys

340658
lvm	umount
the problem is that when umount the volume i have to also use the terminal to deactivate the lvm volume group vg before i remove the loop device and eject the encrypted storage

340664
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
my system linux mint 18 based on ubuntu 16.04 lts kde plasma 5.8.5

340679
super	implements
bear in mind unix dates to days when disk space was super expensive though according to stevens in apue chapter 4 symlinks were implements in bsd4.2 1983 to replace various limitations of hardlinks

340693
wan	lan
so here s my question doesn t wan â lan mean the traffic from wan to lan

340722
centos	linux
created virtual machine as red hat linux and installed centos 7 on it

340725
dnf	yum
it is represented for yum or dnf in the fedora-rawhide.repo file in the repository path

340730
bonjour	avahi
this nicely works without any avahi zeroconf bonjour stuff and therefore also supports windows and android right away

340740
sudo	passwd
i see the following if i try make my account passwd protected and run android studio without sudo

340768
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
to allow a user aaronkilik in the example below to run all commands using sudo without a passwd open the sudoers file .

340774
kde	cinnamon
different desktop environment test - cinnamon and kde - both freeze

340774
mouse	keyboard
the freezing occurs also on windows 10 - during installation if i leave laptop for a few minutes without touching mouse or keyboard and after installation without system updates

340782
ubuntu	debian
i could use ubuntu live to chroot into the system instead of debian rescue mode and finish the installation steps apart from actually setting the root for grub

340785
wan	lan
your lan and wan need separate 64s

340785
wan	lan
you ll need for example 2a01 4f8 162 xxxx 64 on the wan and 2a01 4f8 162 yyyy 64 on the lan with routing set up correctly so that the lan addresses are routed through your firewall

340803
wan	lan
the wan zone wan- lan in your example is about traffic from wan to lan for forward established connections from lan to wan for output and from wan to lan all other packets for input

340809
vlan	packets
you do not necessarily need to tag the packets on the openwrt router or use a vlan at all

340829
filesystems	ntfs
watching random videos on youtube it appears exfat is faster then ntfs in most cases which would make me believe it would be a good candidate for a filesystems

340833
sysv	systemd
single to boot to single-user mode on sysv init systemd

340846
folder	directory
and copied from armv8-a folder to lib directory of chrooted debian

340872
debian	linux
if i were to install and run debian linux from an sd card or microsd card would this be less reliable than running from a regular hdd a 2.5 western digital blue

340887
for-loop	arrays
knowing that data in op s example is always two lines after the species name we can load the species names in species.txt into arrays and then use for-loop to read a line twice and print it out

340893
unix	solaris
this is the way it s done on linux solaris and several other unix variants

340894
filesystems	fat
the posixovl filesystems allows storing files on a fat filesystems with extra metadata stored in additional files to implement things that fat doesn t provide file names containing characters that fat forbids or that are too long additional metadata such as permissions and ownership other file types such as symbolic links and devices etc

340907
bash	zsh
a solution that works since bash 2.04 and recent zsh lksh mksh

340961
ubuntu	debian
the lvm partitions is detected by default by at least fedora debian and ubuntu installers and grub worked out of the box

340969
subnet	vlan
the two are connected by a switch and belong to the same subnet and same vlan

340984
mouse	keyboard
if your hand s already on the mouse this is easier than switching back to the keyboard to press alt+f4 for a quick window close

340986
dnf	yum
the link is about ubuntu but the psad tool is available in the rhel repository and can be installed using yum or dnf

340997
post	get
this is probably a bit misleading in this case so let s get the posix definition which is also quoted in a post from that thread

341008
versioning	upgrade
on the other hand i ve also recently apt-get upgrade d myself with a new versioning of the linux kernel whatever the distribution provides not custom-built

341013
bash	zsh
bash in posix mode and ksh93 and zsh will all abort a script if an assignment fails

341015
debian	linux
i m running debian gnu linux stretch and have kernel 4.9

341018
debian	linux
i am running debian gnu linux 8 jessie 64-bit with 3.16.0-4-amd64 kernel on a dell inspiron 15 and i can t enable the integrated webcam

341088
debian	linux
for example readelf -a bin sleep on x86_64 on debian linux shows the following sections in that segment

341089
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
you can call the crypt function from a perl or python script to calculate the hash don t forget to select a hash function a random salt and a good iteration count

341103
hash	md5
files are first stored in a pool directory tree based on their md5 hash

341106
debian	linux
i expect to be able to start the vm have it boot from the image and then start the debian linux installation process in the virtual machine

341109
debian	linux
this is not related to debian linux network install

341116
versioning	upgrade
we upgrade several computers from linux mint 17.3 to versioning 18 and later recently to 18.1

341153
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 16.04 linux 4.4.0-59-generic btrfs-progs v4.4

341179
mouse	trackpad
i was wondering if there is a feature in linux like osx shake to locate cursor which temporarily makes the user s mouse or trackpad cursor much larger when shaken back and forth making it easier to locate if the user loses track of it

341194
google-chrome	firefox
firefox display a server error and google-chrome claimes dns_probe_finish_no_internet

341229
debian	linux
the programs included with the debian gnu linux system are free software

341229
debian	linux
debian gnu linux comes with absolutely no warranty to the extent

341263
ssd	sata
single ext4 rootfs on a sata ssd

341301
tar	gunzip
depending on what method of compression and archive format the author of an archive file chose i need to use one of the tar unzip gunzip xz or 7z commands and there are probably others i haven t encountered or that i have encountered but i can t think of right now each with a slightly different command-line syntax

341330
pull	push
this allows me to quickly test changes without having to git-commit push pull build etc

341342
snmp	mib
i have snmp installed on ubuntu is it possible with snmpget command query the network range for multiple oids and retrieve mib values

341351
debian	linux
i am unable to change graphics card on kali linux 4.6.0 debian 4.6.4-1kali1 2016-07-21 x86_64 gnu linux with gnome

341360
filesystems	btrfs
that s going to depend on the filesystems type but ext4 btrfs and the like have resizing tools

341369
width	height
a block here is a just a rectangle with a fixed width height

341391
ubuntu	debian
i m coming from ubuntu so i d like to know if this is a problem concerning debian the qubes os template for debian or a misconfiguration or missing components factor that i can easily solve continuing use debian inside qubes os

341421
filesystems	fat
in particular when transferring to from fat filesystems

341422
filesystems	xfs
map the files on the filesystems ext4 or xfs to addresses on the lv

341445
solaris	bsd
mosh is free software available for gnu linux bsd macos solaris android chrome and ios

341449
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
also the mint trademark is owned by the linux foundation ubuntu by a non-profit

341473
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs
if the 420gb file is stored on a filesystems with sparse file and punch hole support ext4 xfs but not ntfs it would be possible to read a file and free the read blocks using fallocate --punch-hole

341501
folder	directory
creating a dev folder in the chroot users home directory and then creating a rsyslog config file etc rsyslog.d sftplogging.conf with the entry

341547
hid	keyboard
now i have a magnetic card reader which quite successfully enumerates as a usb hid keyboard

341560
daemons	systemd
i am running sysvinit however due to debian changes i am running udev and the daemons lib systemd systemd-udevd is running

341606
bash	zsh
some shells like zsh or ksh93 have time-parsing capabilities built in but not bash

341609
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop is correct for iterating over the elements of the bash arrays losystem so given that you ve made the above corrections you can use it unchanged

341609
for-loop	arrays
however you don t need to set an arrays and it s much more idiomatic cleaner more intuitive to directly state the file glob in the for-loop

341609
next	except
the next part of your script is even trickier to review because it appears that you are setting filetype to the output of the isql command but then you don t do anything with this output except print itâ badly formattedâ with echo

341628
folder	directory
here s a sample output i get when i run it in a folder with 10 files and 1 directory

341656
sudoers	visudo
i tried adding the exceptions below to the bottom line of the etc sudoers file using visudo but nothing has changed

341676
jline	readline
jline the java readline clone doesn t have any problems using my .inputrc as intended

341745
mktime	strftime
if you have gnu awk which should be available on osx via brew i think then you could use the internal mktime and strftime instead of relying on system date

341776
ubuntu	debian
i can see a number of unresolved bugs for freedesktop here and here redhat ubuntu and debian and also similar questions asked on stackexchange

341793
loops	while-loop
the while-loop is also an endless loops since you do not increment num nor decrement var

341794
gentoo	debian
i ve a debian in my computer and now i want to add a gentoo distro

341794
gentoo	debian
i ve installed gentoo by terminal in debian and chrooted to gentoo in order to emerge all packages

341794
gentoo	debian
now i added gentoo to grub installed on debian and for that i used the command

341794
gentoo	debian
where sda1 is debian sda2 is swap for both debian and gentoo and sda3 is gentoo

341796
filesystems	xfs
besides of ext2 ext3 ex4 and xfs you can also change uuid of the following filesystems or block device

341810
for-loop	arrays
so to iterate a for-loop through all members of an arrays

341811
bash	subshell
since you re using single-quotes in the bash command line the text gets passed literally to perl and evaluated as an expression which means perl runs a subshell for cat and the contents in perl s mind of - which is not a perl variable at all

341817
mktime	strftime
alternatively if you have gnu awk and if you have gnu date you probably do you can use the builtin functions mktime and strftime

341857
mp3	ogg
since space and supported formats may be an issue on the target device smartphon car radio ... it can also convert down to ogg for mp3

341857
flac	ogg
i figured out a while ago how to convert flac to ogg so that meta data is kept

341877
ubuntu	linux
on an ubuntu based linux when i run the nproc command it prints 2

341883
filesystems	fat
while i dont understand your need to use a fat filesystems this seems a duplicate of

341886
spaces	delimiter
the -f option is based upon tab delimiter spacing so the -d option is required to specify a spaces as the delimiter as per rakesh-n s response

341909
pppoe	dhcp
the two physical interfaces are supposed to have dhcp pppoe or static ip addresses which i shall configure accordingly in etc network interfaces

341919
lvm	btrfs
the btrfs is an lvm lv on luks

341920
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu with linux 4.4.0-43-generic recovery mode

341938
versioning	upgrade
this will upgrade the apache2 package to versioning 2.4.7-1ubuntu4.13 july 2016 and probably lots of other packages with security fixes

341998
octal	decimal
so in your output the numbers shown are octal 0000000 0000020 and 0000030 which are decimal 0 16 and 24

342009
ubuntu	linux
if you have an ubuntu machine without an internet connection you can try keryx to download all updates on another windows linux pc and keep the ubuntu machine updating off-line via an usb

342040
ubuntu	centos
i know this question is for centos but since it was the first result i got when looking for ubuntu here are some ubuntu 16.04 helpers

342060
versioning	upgrade
i have a fedora 23 upgrade from versioning 21

342106
rsa	dsa
i tried it with several machines and users as well as rsa and dsa keys

342116
put	get
inside you put exactly what you want to match on an you get an implicit or statement between them

342134
openvpn	iptables
i would like to filter the iptables connections from openvpn

342138
unix	aix
on aix and on unix usually.. the tar command doesn t play

342168
freebsd	solaris
the above script fragment should also do the right thing on solaris and freebsd for example

342170
punctuation	words	for-loop	loops
so the for-loop and implicit outer loops over all lines counts all the unique words punctuation will lead to it being counted as a different words but that s easily fixed if desired

342174
folder	directory
can somebody explain why a standard folder has always 4kb and some special directory have more or less

342199
ubuntu	centos
using different versions of ubuntu centos

342255
bash	zsh
i used to access it via ssh but i wanted to connect to it with zsh instead of bash

342255
bash	zsh
i deleted the bin sh symbolic link to bin bash to replace it with bin zsh but since then i cannot connect to it using ssh

342274
dnf	yum
yum has been superseded by dnf in fedora

342274
dnf	yum
dnf provides better dependency resolution but otherwise mirrors yum commands very closely

342290
mtu	icmp
this looks like pc2 has an interface mtu of 4210 4182 + 8 icmp header + 20 ipv4 header bytes and not 2000 bytes

342304
stdout	stderr
once i ve disconnected from screen does console output for that session get suppressed entirely or is there a way i can still have logfile input from the stdout and stderr of my script

342308
icmp	tcp
try using traceroute -t to use tcp rather than icmp

342320
spaces	delimiter
parse input for single non-alphanumeric characters surrounded by spaces sort them by which is most common and assume the most common character is the delimiter which is assigned to

342353
filesystems	btrfs
i m french and i have install archlinux with luks on btrfs filesystems

342386
minix	linux
for that look at the device drivers in an operating system kernel â either linux or simpler ones such as minix 3

342390
google-chrome	firefox
alternatively if i could start certain programs by specifying the size of their window such as browsers like firefox or google-chrome that would also serve my purpose

342489
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
using the command line tools available in a common gnu linux distro fedora debian ubuntu etc is there a general way to get the value of some specific whois field the registrant s organisation name ideally without having to build a custom whois parser that is hard-coded to handle the differences between each registry s output

342511
debian	linux
one of my newer computers the one that s on all the time is a raspberry pi running raspbian a debian linux fork

342512
starttls	smtps
instead you could use the old legacy ssl versions of imap and smtps modern clients generally establish a normal unencrypted connection and then use starttls but google also offers the old ssl-encrypted ones and simply proxy your old mail client

342557
for-loop	loops
i want to execute a for-loop create new variables with values that vary with loops iteration and refer to the new variables within loops or later in the shell script

342569
for-loop	arrays
i ve tried defining the arrays on the remote host before the 2nd for-loop but that did not help

342574
bash	zsh
i am using zsh rather than bash

342603
macports	homebrew
did do you have another copy of coreutils installed from something like homebrew macports or pkgsrc that is now gone or changed order in your path

342635
filesystems	btrfs
how can i find the last btrfs check date timestamp of a filesystems

342643
filesystems	btrfs
being a virtuously lazy sysadmin i came up with the following which will start and enable the btrfs-scrub xxx.timer on all currently mounted btrfs filesystems

342663
dpkg	apt
ured apt source and checking for dpkg prompts about configuration file

342673
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
upgrade your apache versioning installation to something more recent

folder	directory
can we delete the bin folder in usr directory in linux

342684
folder	directory
can we delete the bin folder in usr directory in linux

342729
sudo	passwd
i don t mind this too much however if i don t notice my terminal asking for my sudo passwd it might be a few minutes until i check and notice it

342729
sudo	passwd
so my question is how can i disable the sudo passwd prompt from timing out

342740
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
steamos is a debian variant as is ubuntu mint etc

342754
debian-based	ubuntu
one very slightly dodgy workaround if you re using ubuntu and possibly other debian-based systems and have installed xmonad via your package manager which doesn t actually help the person who asked the initial question but might help others

342792
bash	zsh
note that the syntax can be used with bash zsh and ksh

342818
centos	linux
the operating system is linux centos release 6.7 final

342831
folder	directory
the correct way to descend files and folder two directory is mv fileorfolder .. ..

342849
switching	airplane
is there any way to prevent bluetooth from turning on when i switching the airplane mode off

342888
ethernet	wireless
i have a feeling that the installer is not detecting my wireless adapter as ifconfig shows it disabled by default and my ethernet read wired adapter as the only one configured

342899
folder	directory
for that you have to put those in a folder select the folder and then the context-menu option for that you need to add the directory to the conditions of the action in thunar or nautilus config tool and it will download subs for all included videos

342899
kde	gnome
it can be used as a nautilus script or as a regular application working under gnome or kde desktop environments.

342916
udp	tcp
udp contrary to tcp provides no guarantee of delivery

342916
bash	zsh
if you wanted to use the redirection operator you could use ksh -style process substitution also found in zsh and bash

342923
emacs	gedit
i ve noticed i can open the same file using gedit seems the problem is just with emacs

342969
put	get	post	put	post	get
sending get post put delete patch etc to api and pretty print json answer

342999
filesystems	btrfs
if you want to play this sort of game with your disks format them with zfs or btrfs these filesystems don t make the assumption of good data or no data and use checksums to spot bad data being read from the disk

343040
x86	64bit
also the architecture is 64bit x86 and the version is 4.7.2

343056
gentoo	ubuntu
the gentoo coexists with ubuntu

343078
debian	centos
is it possible overwrite - migrate reinstall a server with debian jessie to centos 7 remotely

343084
debian	centos
split the partitions one boot partition you should already have one one for centos the one you currently have shrink this one and a third one for debian

343116
udp	tcp
it s more like udp in that regard although that s a bit of a weak analogy and for many of the same reasons - for some applications tcp is bad solution because of those reliability mechanisms - your stream can stall for a retransmit and that hurts a near-real-time application more than a dropped packet does

343119
ubuntu	debian
those running debian or ubuntu or any of their derivatives can probably

343119
unix	bsd
colordiff is also packaged for a number of other linux unix and bsd

343126
packets	multicast
an alternative could be to use the nflog target which sends the packets through a netlink socket to a multicast group

343132
debian	linux
what can i do to know its linux distribution i.e redhat or debian or anything else

343155
hid	keyboard
background your keyboard is a hid usb device and the kernel properly recognizes the hid usb events for your slider keys and translates them to keycodes key_zoomin and key_zoomout

343165
dpkg	apt
apt list now does that and you ll get the same results as given by dpkg -l in a different format

343166
dpkg	apt
dpkg or apt

343166
dpkg	apt
dpkg should be seen as a system tool backend and apt as a tool closer to the user which overcomes the limitations of the former

343166
dpkg	apt
e g 1 you can list the installed package on your system through dpkg or apt

343172

you need to redirect traffic coming into the failover to the vpn tunnel and relay vpn client s packets to the net as well

343248
debian	linux
the programs included with the debian gnu linux system are free software

343248
debian	linux
debian gnu linux comes with absolutely no warranty to the extent

343263
sudo	passwd
shouldn t show the passwd require a sudo passwd

343281
int	chars
your int array then becomes element 1 of the array which we can set to a null string and the next one element 2 will have extra comma appended to the end of it so we can extract a sub-string of that starting from the second chars

343337
jobs	cron
i have two jobs i have setup in cron one to run at 1am the other at 2am daily

343341
stdout	stderr
you ll probably find that cron is swallowing stdout and stderr or as in classic cron attempting to mail you the output

343383
ubuntu	linux
when running php on cli with same script concurrently on ubuntu linux i have this

343441
fish	zsh
i m looking for a theme i noticed some time ago and that i can t find again it was a theme on fish or zsh where the prompt line user path had powerline theme the full path was displayed and after that line there was a carriage return so the typed command was done on an empty line

343447
dpkg	aptitude
the var lib dpkg doesn t exist and i can t make it and use aptitude or apt-get

343496
put	get
i can use ctrl + z to put the loop in the background call ps to get the pid and then kill -9 the program

343502
tunnel	vpn
i have a simple site-to-site ipsec vpn where server-a is connected to a fw-a over an ipsec tunnel

343503
hash	salt
passwords are typically stored as a base64-encoded salt hash of the password

343503
hash	salt
it s the hash part that makes the password unrecoverable and the salt part means that pre-generated lists of hash are useless

343512
filesystems	ntfs
a pragmatic solution would be to reproduce the source directories with the desired converted filenames locally using hard links to the original files then rsync this copy as-is to the ntfs filesystems

343557
ethernet	wireless
i have a machine running a derivative of debian raspbian with two nics one ethernet eth0 and the other wireless wlan0

343625
hid	keyboard
i have a linux based embedded system which i would like to behave as a usb hid keyboard when connected to a pc with a usb cable

343630
splunk	logstash
if you think a simple syslog server is not worth your time you could give a look to logstash and the elk stack in general or splunk .

343632
gentoo	ubuntu
the gnu grub documentation doesn t even mention uefi and the arch ubuntu gentoo wikis provide the bare minimal info to set up a basic non-chainloading install

343658
ubuntu	linux
i d like to compile my own version of the linux kernel and as minimal as possible running ubuntu 16.10

343676
ssd	sata

vmware	virtualbox
oracle vm virtualbox and vmware workstation player works just fine with this config but kvm can t read files from it

343814
chown	chmod
i ve tried to chown the files the container directory and even chmod -r 0777 on the entire drive

343822
folder	directory
the issue you will face is not in your documents or downloads or whatever folder directory that you normally see and use but in the hidden user-level application configuration directory - all those directory like .mozilla etc

343822
folder	directory
i d use separate homes and if you keep all of your data files mp3s movies word docs etc in the same folder in your home directory simply mount the other partition s and use links to get the same stuff in each of your home directory

343828
for-loop	loops
no for-loop required no while loops required just pure command-line bash

343843
stdout	stderr
they have at least one input stream called stdin and two output streams stdout and stderr but they can open and close as many as they want for readind and for writing mostly to read from files or write to them

343868
centos	linux
note that i am using amazon linux which is similar to centos but doesn t use systemd

343877
gentoo	linux
for example i started with gentoo linux from which i installed grub2 into the mbr the machine is too old for efi

343902
mouse	keyboard
however once i got the installer running i found that i was unable to enter any input via the keyboard mouse worked fine however

343926
rpm	yum
next step is to actually install the software package and you have the two options yum and rpm

343930
sysv	systemd
unless you made special effort the upgrade switched you from sysv init to systemd

343935
ubuntu	freebsd
i m using bash on ubuntu on windows from a windows 10 pro pc to backup my media library to a freebsd server that acts as my nas it runs nas4free

343956
bash	subshell
this works in ksh93 but not in bash since bash runs the read in a subshell

343974
bash	zsh
several printf implementations including gnu printf and the printf builtin of zsh bash and lksh a more posix compatible variant of mksh on debian-based systems at least support

343974
bash	zsh
some shells zsh where it originated bash ksh93 mksh freebsd sh also support that uxxxx notation in their quotes

343974
bash	zsh
depending on the shell those will be expanded to the locale s encoding that was in effect at the time the command was parsed bash or at the time it was run zsh or in utf-8 always ksh

344036
freebsd	netbsd
i have observed that freebsd and netbsd behave differently when adding an address that is currently in duplicated state

344051
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
i recently migrated an ext4 filesystems on a lvm volume to btrfs using btrfs-convert

344055
vim	gedit
even on i3 it s still not probably as intimidating to him as a terminal window running vim if i can probably open the file in say gedit before handing him over the control

344093
postfix	dovecot
i followed this guide on setting up postfix with dovecot and mariadb

344096
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have in the past dual booted windows 10 with linux mint and ubuntu

344096
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
in the past when i ve installed linux mint and ubuntu alongside windows 10 i usually get a prompt asking me if i want to install alongside windows or if i want to overwrite windows

344105
ubuntu	linuxmint
and i downloaded both iso from ubuntu and linuxmint site

344126
vim	gedit
a template with just a space or any other text in it works as it should but just if created with pluma xed based on gedit gedit itself or vim

344127
folder	directory
i want to keep the home directory in a folder on a disk partition other than the boot partition

344128
filesystems	ntfs
i have no idea how practical is to have home on an ntfs filesystems

344183
bash	zsh
what shell are you using i tested using zsh but bash will do the same output

344225
128bit	64bit
the emotion engine is a 64bit mips little endian cpu with support for 128bit addresses

344226
ssd	sata
3. a usb disk of at least 8gb either a usb flash drive or external ide sata hdd ssd will work

344226
debian	linux
while sony s ps2 linux and the blackrhino linux live dvd come with an on screen keyboard this installation will use debian 5 which requires a proper physical keyboard

344226
debian	linux
3. connect the usb disk you have selected for linux installation to your existing debian machine

344226
sudoers	visudo
29. you have sudo installed now but you aren t in the sudoers file so while in the root shell run visudo etc sudoers and under

344226
mouse	keyboard
the ps2 controller will not work as a mouse so i recommend a usb hub for both the mouse and keyboard if that is not an option mousekeys can be activated as usual with alt+shift+num lock

344244
dpkg	apt
these upgrades were not reflected in linux-image obtained with apt search linux-image or dpkg --list | grep linux-image

344256
centos	linux
my guest in the vm centos linux release 7.3.1611

344266
ubuntu	linux
2 ssd system one with windows the 2nd with ubuntu linux

344295
mouse	keyboard
forcing the deletion of the package pacman -rdd libwacom leaves me without mouse and keyboard or any external input devices

344340
centos	linux
on my host centos 7 linux i m having guest system as windows 2008 server

344382
subnet	traceroute
if you try to traceroute to a host that is not in the same subnet as the interface that you are specifying with the -i flag the traceroute will fail because of the absence of gateway assuming you are not lucky enough to use the single interface that has a default gateway defined

344400
vmware	virtualbox
try using some virtualization software such as virtualbox and vmware

344408
ubuntu	debian
i am thinking of switching to debian from ubuntu for various reasons moving towards a more free software supporting system being one of them

344408
debian-based	ubuntu
i m specifically asking because ubuntu is debian-based

344410
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
cannot reproduce tested on ubuntu 14.04.5 lts and linux mint 17

344416
solaris	bsd
it should be pretty obvious why no one bothers with cross compilers where the target system is something that s easy to create an instance of like linux solaris windows bsd on x86 hardware and even why when the target system is something harder like solaris on sparc almost everyone with a need to compile for that target just buys some low-end compatible hardware for compiling on

344437
openvpn	iptables
i tried installing openvpn on my server using iptables to change it up so that the gateway redirects to something else i wasnt sure what i was running which was a mistake on my part

344452
folder	directory
after some searching i found what appears to be a folder but looks like a .mobi file in my root directory

344453
google-chrome	firefox
i then tried downloaded it and checking the checksum on the following chromium same system firefox same system wget same system google-chrome windows and wget different system provided by my uni and they all returned the same checksum

344461
sudo	passwd
i am the only user of my linux mint system and i noticed that the passwd i chose to login is the same that got assigned to sudo

344461
sudo	passwd
so my question is will changing my login passwd also change the sudo passwd

344461
sudo	passwd
if not how can i change the sudo passwd

344464
sudo	passwd
yes sudo uses the same passwd database usually etc shadow for a small system as login

344474
sudo	passwd
there s no sudo passwd on its own

344474
sudo	passwd
a user can belong to the sudo group and run the sudo command but each user has only one passwd

344474
sudo	passwd
another similar misconception is that the root passwd is the same as one used for sudo ing

344493
tunnel	vpn
actually why dns requests are not going through the tunnel and sent by the vpn server

344494
chown	sudo
i ran sudo chown -r user user folder on opt android-studio and on root android sdk and on my project folder which i generated using android studio with root privileges

344505
cifs	smb
samba is windows s network filesystem protocol rather it s an open-source implementation of the protocol which was called smb and is now called cifs

344506
udp	tcp
i guess it should be both udp tcp protocols

344508
sudo	passwd
by default sudo asks for the user passwd

344508
sudo	passwd
thus changing the user passwd which is also used for login will also affect sudo invocations

344508
sudoers	passwd
however you can set in the etc sudoers for your user the rootpw flag in which case it would ask for the root passwd instead

344508
sudo	passwd
similarly the keyword for not requesting a passwd for sudo is nopasswd

344508
sudo	passwd
if you want to set the root passwd you can use sudo passwd

344513
mouse	keyboard
a kvm keyboard video mouse switch with a separate usb cable to a port to be shared to the vm is the best way to go here

344517
xfce	gnome
if you want to stick with gnome you can install parts of xfce

344533
udp	tcp
looking up port 554 in iana s port assignment list shows that both tcp and udp 554 is used by the real time streaming protocol

344560
ubuntu	mint
my guess is that when you used ubuntu and turned history off you still had data to feed it but with a fresh install of mint all that data is gone and with history off it never will be there again

344562
folder	directory
the prefix directory is where the secondary bootloader will look for its modules folder and config file

344574
spaces	delimiter
it will treat each spaces on every line as a column delimiter

344577
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r nobody nogroup tftpboot

344580
children	parent
if they die then their children need a new parent process it ll be your init

344586
hash	md5
the default hash used by openssl enc for password-based key derivation changed in 1.1.0 to sha256 versus md5 in lower versions

344608
openbsd	netbsd
on openbsd and netbsd use

344613
google-chrome	firefox
for configuring your survey you can use any other browser - google-chrome or firefox

344635
umask	chmod
not for umask but yes for chmod

344635
octal	binary
rwx means 111 which is binary for an octal value of 7

344635
octal	binary
rw- means 110 which is binary for an octal value of 6

344635
octal	binary
r-- means 100 which is binary for an octal number of 4

344661
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
as of the linux kernel v2.6.31 the fallocate system call is supported by the btrfs ext4 ocfs2 and xfs filesystems

344700
ubuntu	linux
so i ve managed to get windows 10 and ubuntu 14.04 lts dual booting -- i have grub set to come up for a few seconds on boot so i don t have to mash f12 when i want to boot to linux windows is the default

344725
mktime	strftime
it can be easily done via gnu awk by its time functions mktime and strftime but sed can do this too

344774
sudo	passwd
just re-lock your account sudo passwd -l username from an existing session and fix your ssh configuration

344780
ubuntu	debian
runlevels for debian and ubuntu systems are generally

344792
debian	linux
i m on debian 6 linux debian 2.6.32-5-686 #1 smp tue may 13 16 33 32 utc 2014 i686 gnu linux

344810
folder	directory
i have a folder on my hdd media kalenpw hdd documents shellscripts that is full of various scripts i would like to have accessible from any directory

344813
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu you can change the default grub resolution thereby resulting in larger fonts on the grub menu

344814
stdout	stderr
first for the stderr fd 2 is being sent to the terminal precisely where the stdout fd 1 is currently attached to presumably terminal so the errors are being shown

344877
mouse	keyboard
i d recommend checking out synergy - it s a keyboard and mouse sharing software which works on most nix boxes windows and mac

344891
debian	linux
i am trying to run hostapd on debian linux

344923
ubuntu	linux
i d like to do the same for linux using a bash script - particularly ubuntu but the more compatible the better

344947
debian	linux
i used ethernet over usb for some years to connect from my debian 8 workstation to a linux device with g_multi running

344947
put	get
i had to put it in etc network interfaces to get my network up

344962
put	get
i hope to get this out put been trying a rs that looks in the line for that field and returns field by field then i join the files it it s not effective

345019
vmware	virtualbox
alternatively the setup you describe in your question sounds most like running a virtual machine virtualbox or vmware

345045
debian	linux
in debian 6 uname -a returns linux debian 2.6.32-5-686 .

345066
xfce	gnome
haven t use fedora or gnome or xfce for that purpose for a long time

345066
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
the applications that xorg passes the key codes include the wms xfce or gnome or even kde and the windows open by those applications

345067
filesystems	fat
i did some research and it looks like cp437 is used to identify fat filesystems

345069
ubuntu	linux
this isn t universal in the linux world but it s the way it is in recent enough ubuntu and most other distributions these days media username filesystem label

345087
filesystems	xfs
when i freshly installed oracle linux 7 and opened proc filesystems i only saw xfs

345094
cifs	smb
to enable posix large write support smb cifs writes up to 16mb this option must be nonzeroâ

345102
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
it ll depend on the os variant centos ubuntu debian amazon.

345150
xfs	umount
the partition was formatted using xfs is umount during tests contains no files and isn t a boot partition

345150
xfs	mdadm
i wonder if this is a xfs known issue a mdadm issue or simply its due to fio raw writing on the md device

345167
folder	directory
i writing script to list the following details of all the files inside a folder or directory which the user gives as input

345195
packets	multicast
the discovery protocol addresses will be visible in packets captures provided you re connected to the same network and either it is a basic network switch with no multicast filtering enabled or you are running the specific discovery protocol

345195
ssdp	upnp
the other most significant discovery protocols are llmnr windows systemd-resolved lldp enterprise routers ip phones and others and ssdp for upnp devices including consumer routers

345220
filesystems	btrfs
i have a problem with btrfs filesystems btrfs is using subvolumes all highest hierarchy directories in btrfs has the same inode 256 512

345238
debian	linux
i am using linux kali 4.6.0-kali1-amd64 #1 smp debian 4.6.4-1kali1 2016-07-21 x86_64 gnu linux

345263
jobs	cron
my favorite method of searching a file while also watching for new lines i commonly work with log files to which are appended the redirected output of processes executed periodically via cron jobs is

345330
debian	linux
i am using linux debian jessie v8

345340
ubuntu	linux
ive been trying to install deco-ide on ubuntu 16.04 linux through this hack i found on github but i keep getting an error seen in the image below after the lines

345344
kde	gnome
but why then is there a need for gnome kde and how do they relate to x

345344
kde	gnome
is that true or is gnome kde independent of x

345346
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
gnome kde xfce and other window managers desktop environments are special applications that run in x that draw things like borders and icons and minimize and maximize that the applications themselves don t

345346
kde	gnome
and since gnome and kde both can or did run on ms windows and wayland to varying degrees yes they are or can be independent of x

345348
bluetooth	usb
i am trying to bring up a custom arm machine similar to raspberry pi to connect to a bluetooth keyboard using a uart hci interface as opposed to a usb bluetooth dongle

345348
hid	keyboard
are there other hid related configs needed to drive the bt keyboard

345348
hid	keyboard
finally here is a the verbose bluetoothd -n -d output which suggests hog hid over gatt is trying to load the hid keyboard i can t tell if output suggests successful or error honestly

345416
bash	zsh
to avoid that with gnu xargs and shells like ksh zsh or bash that support process substitution you could do

345441
google-chrome	firefox
that helped for kde applications but also for firefox and google-chrome

345444
ubuntu	debian
this scheme works regardless of the source of the next tzdata update debian or ubuntu

345453
bash	zsh
in bash you can also use these syntaxes inherited from ksh also work in zsh

345453
bash	zsh
bash and zsh also support

345471
filesystems	btrfs
i have a btrfs filesystems and it all the folders in the top level are inode 256

345472
folder	directory
i have accidentally removed my usb-stick but when i reconnected it in my media root directory appeared two folder of the same name but one was empty

345513
readonly	temporary
you may want to add a kernel boot entry to your grub configuration to make it easy to temporary disable the readonly root filesystem for patches etc

345546
traceroute	packets
i understand how traceroute works i give it a domain it takes 3 packets tries to go over intermediary servers to the end server

345547
versioning	upgrade
i only really need specific packages upgrade automatically the rest can be done manually as required but because the machines have never been on a standard update cycle they all have different versioning and dependencies i cannot just apt-get upgrade package-x package-y package-z

345551
versioning	upgrade
this will upgrade the named packages to whatever is the candidate versioning given your settings normally the latest versioning in your release and any required dependencies as necessary

345551
installation	upgrade
despite the command s name it works for both installation and upgrade

345555
ubuntu	linux
in my case ubuntu gnome 16.04 i have a linux kernel which apt-get autoremove suggests to get me rid of

345566
wan	lan
this is perfectly doable with just the ssh config without having to use separate aliases for lan and wan or creating any extra port forwards

345570
sudo	passwd
i enter in the command in the start up applications part of settings with sudo before it but since it requires my passwd i don t think it is running

345583
post	get
normally i don t post questions which are trying to get advice on how to directly a question in a textbook but in this case i feel it is necessary

345594
icmp	tcp
the advantages of icmp unreachable over just sending a tcp reset are

345603
jobs	cron
cron jobs are tasks that run on a schedule

345628
stdout	stderr
so now we need to redirect these file descriptors to bash s stdin stdout stderr

345628
stdout	stderr
so we re-exec bash with stdin connected to stdout connected to and stderr also connected to

345634
vim	gedit	gedit	nano
there s no gedit nor nano nor vim on my aix only vi

345637
folder	directory
suppose i ve a folder named csv_xxx in the directory home csv_xxx inside it contains

345637
folder	directory
20161010 is a folder inside csv_xxx with the directory home csv_xxx 20161010 contains

345639
ubuntu	centos
gist i am trying to add a ubuntu instance which is on the secondary hard drive to grub which is on the primary hard drive running centos

345639
centos	linux
the primary hard drive contains centos release 6.8 final x86_64 linux 3.8.8

345644
rpm	yum
also to install the yum rpm you need yum

345644
vim	gedit	gedit	nano
there s no gedit nor nano nor vim on my aix only vi

345691
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m on linux mint 18 but i also tested it on ubuntu mate and element os

345697
centos	linux
relatime mount option is default default since rhel centos scientific linux version 6 see here

345702
readonly	temporary
an overlay filesystem seems to be exactly what you need mount your data as readonly create a temporary filesystem tmpfs and then overlay those two

345727
mkdir	pwd
it is very unlikely this package would be missing ships mkdir md5sum pwd sleep tty ...

345744
vim	emacs
and some software still supports motif although by default it doesn t use it any more examples include emacs and vim

345772
filesystems	fat
this recovery guide details usage for fat filesystems likely the filesystems type of your pen drive

345776
freebsd	linux
on linux i can run ip route add local i order to add a large amout a complete 64 subet to an interface sf#209203 and using ip_bindany i can listen to any ip address on freebsd #207610

345787
ubuntu	linux
i want to know the details of user logins of my gnu linux servers rhel7 and ubuntu 16.04 who from what ip when

345800
filesystems	btrfs
i can also remotely access the btrfs snapshot filesystems subvolumes directly from the appliances command line via ssh without having to power down the machine or access a hypervisor api

345800
filesystems	btrfs
i want to have a btrfs formatted filesystems in a vm running from a qcow2 image

345813
folder	dir
i can generate a folder manifest of all subdirectories and files therein with dir b s and get output formatted as a bunch of paths.

345823
sunos	aix
aix sunos

345826
folder	directory
now currently if i have a folder in directory named linuxcommands and i write comm+tab it doesn t match linuxcommands folder

345826
folder	directory
it autocompletes and then cycles through the contents of the same folder after autocompleting which is one level behind on directory

345856
switching	screens
after hitting the sleep or hibernate buttons equivalent of xfce4-session-logout -s my screens doesn t switching on when i m trying to wake my computer up

345856
switching	screens
i thought it was a screens luminosity problem but i see the screens when i switching between tty

345881
disk	ram
i don t expect it would see much use as the server normally sits around 10 of ram used with the other 90 being disk cache

345901
sudo	passwd
for the purposes of a bash script i need to prompt the user for the sudo passwd if it hasn t been entered yet and if the user doesn t have sudo privileges at the time they run the script

345901
sudo	passwd
i first request the passwd with dialog passwd bog and then feed it to sudo like so

345901
sudo	passwd
apparently -s read passwd from stdin and -n non-interactive sudo are not compatible

345901
sudo	passwd
with -n present the passwd being fed to sudo is ignored and so no elevation occurs and without it sudo prompts for re-entry if an incorrect passwd was entered

345901
sudo	passwd
is there any way to validate sudo passwd without re-prompting for it if it s not the right one

345901
sudo	passwd
inevitably someone will point out that one should not be re-inventing the wheel and just use sudo s provided facility or that feeding a passwd to sudo via a pipe has security implications

345901
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i also don t want to enter the commands in etc sudoers recompile sudo as the script should be somewhat portable or disable sudo passwd prompt in general just in this script

345938
chown	mount	chown	chmod
you have to run the chmod chown commands after the mount happened

345947
mouse	keyboard
i was wondering if one can use it completely by keyboard without mouse

345947
mouse	keyboard
i have a handicap so i can work more accurate by keyboard than by mouse

345985
daemon	cron
tools running by the cron daemon get an environment from the cron and not from your shell

346008
folder	directory
now if i open folder in terminal the terminal would open the default user directory instead of the actual directory i m in

346010
debian	linux
uname -a linux version 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.16.39-1 2016-12-30

ubuntu	openbsd	solaris	netbsd	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	netbsd
i m serving exports home home directories and exports pkgsrc netbsd s pkgsrc repository from an openbsd nfsv3 server running openbsd 6.0-release to an internal network of openbsd and ubuntu 16.10 hosts and one solaris 11.3 host

346014
ubuntu	openbsd
this works well for the home directories on ubuntu and openbsd because the uids and gids of the users happens to be the same on both system

346014
ubuntu	openbsd
for the pkgsrc export i d like the mount to show up as root src on ubuntu and root wsrc on openbsd but the src group is gid 40 on ubuntu while the wsrc group has gid 9 on openbsd 9 is news on ubuntu

346016
versioning	upgrade
with linux-image-amd64 versioning 4.8.0-0.bpo.2 from jessie-backports i ve been s2disk -hibernating the x220 in question for 25 days with no mysterious reboot after loading image i m going to reboot now to upgrade the kernel to 4.9.0-0.bpo.1

346030
vlan	packets
use tc to match packets without 802.1q on ingres and push a vlan header with id 0

346030
vlan	packets
use tc to match packets in vlan 0 on egress and pop the vlan header

346049
gentoo	linux
i am running gentoo linux hardened with kernel 4.8.17-r2 on an amd fx 8350 using a radeon rx 480 video card amdgpu and for desktop environment i use mate 1.12.1

346062
stdout	stderr
in mimicing macos s terminal s open command or window s terminal s start the comments of this answer suggest appending stdout and stderr to .xsession-errors something like bash

346107
xfce	gnome
i am running ubuntu 16.04 server with xfce installed never had unity gnome

346119
int	chars
bash only understands base 10 int ranges or alphabetical chars ranges in brace expansions of intervals

346134
ubuntu	debian
for instance in debian where ubuntu gets most of its packages i have a libstdc++6-4.6-dev on my debian 7 machine which has this file

solaris	aix
or on solaris and aix

346192
ubuntu	debian
i have though a problem with my hardware setup and ubuntu - debian like installations

346195
lvm	xfs
the setup is ssd - dm-crypt - lvm - xfs

346195
filesystems	xfs
what i did not try was using different filesystems but xfs should be supported

346214
bash	zsh
zsh doesn t mind bash does

346255
vpn	lan
if i m connected to the lan without vpn i assign 192.168.10.x static ip and another .50.x ip to the same device to communicate with that server i also add a static route towards that server

git push prints to stderr apparently so redirect stderr to stdout

346566
stdout	stderr
without -t sshd gets the stdout of the remote shell and children like sleep and stderr via two pipes and also sends the client s input via another pipe

346566
stdout	stderr
sshd does wait for the process in which it has started the user s login shell but also after that process has terminated waits for eof on the stdout pipe not the stderr pipe in the case of openssh at least

346566
stdout	stderr
instead all the interaction stdin stdout stderr with the remote shell and its children are done using one pseudo-terminal pair

what fixed the permission denied for me was on the remote server change the folder ownership to root this can happen when you are sending a file to a non-root user and the directory is owned by root

it works this way both under vmware workstation and virtualbox on linux host

347850
freebsd	linux
for all the vmware solutions either enterprise or workstation you have got for linux and freebsd the open-vm-tools package

347850
vmware	esx
i know it can be done in vcenter vmware esx probably not in vmware workstation as it is a level 2 hypervisor and as such it is the host os that deals with managing the i o operations and slice quotas more on that later on

347850
vmware	esx
however if you are concerned about performance at least in the vmware realm at least for production systems i would advise going for their type-1 bare metal hypervisor esx or esxi instead of using vmware workstation

347850
vmware	esx
hyper-v and vmware esx esxi

347850
vmware	virtualbox
vmware workstation vmware virtualbox

here i have creating script which execute the ansible-playbook after the execute script which ask the sudo passwd which one i have to send sudo passwd though expect and send but getting below error

348853
stdout	stderr
is a little trick to swap stderr and stdout so that stderr gets piped to cat and all the normal output from ssh is shown on stderr

348876
folder	directory
in that folder also are some directory created by jdownloader but i can not delete that folder from windows explorer

348883
put	get
while doing that we might as well put the uasge first and the name second strip out the lines that don t represent real file systems and get the mount point for each file system

ubuntu	debian
i am trying to build a bleeding-edge package with new upstream versions packaged within hours for vim on debian 7 8 and ubuntu 12.04 14.04. 16.04 the problem i keep running into is that ubuntu 12.04 is having issues related to python 3 so i would like to remove the python3 dependency for ubuntu 12.04 and remove the configure options related to python3 in the rules for ubuntu 12.04 only also

348930
ubuntu	debian
so the packages for debian 7 8 and ubuntu 14.04 16.04 build with python 3 support and the corresponding python3 build dependencies but the package for ubuntu 12.04 builds without python3 support and without python3 build dependencies

348930
debian-based	ubuntu
if you are wondering whether this is necessary here is my open build service package providing vim on debian-based platforms so you can see my packaging files there and here is my build log showing the errors related to python 3 for building on 64-bit ubuntu 12.04

348936
ubuntu	debian
in debian or ubuntu user can also use dpkg command to search with fallback as keyword then use grep filter the result for appropriate file name extension usually png image hence .png

348944
daemons	systemd
systemd can only check for a running daemons or not given remainafterexit

348955
stdout	fflush
programs and practically all c or c++ programs fully buffer stdout when it is a pipe or disk file or in general not isattty and any output still in the buffer and not fflush to the os when you kill it is lost

348982
tunnel	vpn
my raspberry pi routes all traffic generated inside the machine to a vpn tunnel in tun0 interface all communications are cipher through the vpn

348982
tunnel	vpn
i would like to allow ssh connections from the internet in a specific origin ip from wlan0 without loosing the functionality that i already have all outcoming connections originated on the raspberry through the vpn tunnel tun0

348983
g++	gcc
recently whenever i compile a program using gcc or g++ the compiler creates a shared library rather than an executable file

348983
g++	gcc
i have tested this problem with multiple files and have found that while it always happens with gcc or g++ it never happens with clang

348991
disk	ram
do not use a ram disk

349003
postgresql	mysql
as far as i m aware the and directives don t require that the services actually succeed in starting up so you don t necessarily need to have both postgresql and mysql be installed if airflow doesn t require both them to be running

349011
dpkg	apt
indeed apt is a high level user friendly utilities set to operate with dpkg

349011
debian	linux
now somebody joined all these products into one apt tool that as i suppose can be decrypted as something like automated package tools and goes to debian linux thread development team basic concept

i had an application deployment file .war file on linux ubuntu 16 in the following folder

349130
sysv	systemd
there are systemd upstart and sysv methods to start the services

349130
sysv	systemd
sysv seems to work but it s not possible to make them autostart with update-rc.d since those are intended to be managed by systemd sysv compatibility generator

349130
sysv	systemd
systemd commands are the way to go to make use of the sysv scripts

349136
stdout	stderr
i know that stdout and stderr will be routed to the systemd journal

349148
stdout	stderr
when systemd parses stdout stderr of a service

349159
ubuntu	linux
an automated approach is to use bootrepair since you haven t told us your linux distribution i m assuming you re using ubuntu - here is the link for ubuntu s bootrepair howto

349169
ubuntu	linux
i have a windows 10 and ubuntu dual boot on my laptop i d like to turn it into a triple boot with kali linux the fact is i already have grub as the ubuntu installer added it

python s csv module for one can t parse it because it s got a multi-character delimiter comma spaces instead of the more common

349198
rpm	yum
is there a way to force a fresh install of an rpm package including config and log files either with yum or some other tool

349205
rpm	yum
this will scrub all of the files rpm ergo yum know trust belong to the fail2ban package

349205
rpm	yum
all the magic yum rpm is doing with config files is in the rpm spec file in lines with the prefix config noreplace with the macro _sysconfdir which means etc in your case

349243
folder	directory
assumptions there exists a folder named run but i do not know how many directory i will have to cd to get to it could be 3 x y z could be 10 or more

349255
folder	directory
run it with the root directory containg your unzipped stuff and the name of the folder to lift as arguments

349256
ubuntu	debian
i had ubuntu and elementary os before debian and it worked perfectly

i have installed one rpm using yum install.ex

349374
google-chrome	firefox
on linux google-chrome and firefox refuse to connect to some popular websites

349393

349448
tunnel	vpn
when the vpn connection drops or hasn t yet been established it must be unable to connect to the internet outside of the vpn tunnel

349480
rpm	dnf
it even handles signature verification differently afaik dnf mainly delegates this to rpm

349525
ubuntu	linux
if the dhcp server you are using is configured to provide the ntp-servers option you can configure your dhclient to request ntp-servers by adding ntp-servers to the default request line in dhclient.conf as shown at the end of this example from ubuntu linux 16.04 now but was installed as 12.04

349527
post	get
one method to get around that is to post the code as an image another way is to break the code by adding zero-length spaces #8203

349528
debian	linux
with openssh 7.4p1 on debian gnu linux amd64 at least and when copying remotely that is where either the source or destination is on a remote host it looks like scp -r processes the files in the order it reads them from the directories

349541
bash	zsh
with any bourne-like shell including zsh and bash you could always do

stdout	stderr
1 you need to redirect stdout and stderr to dev null so they are not redirected by the virtual terminal that holds the ssh session

349569
ubuntu	linux
since the osx and ubuntu versions of stat have some differences in that osx stat defaults to terse output and linux stat defaults to verbose some hoops would need to be jumped through

349597
daemon	cron
first of all the log file that you should check is var log cron to make sure that the cron is running indeed every minute as scheduled if not you should look into a problem with the functionality of the cron daemon

349597
daemon	cron
if the cron daemon is running fine and you task is indeed running every minute try to run the script manually from cli python home forge web-app database backup_mysql.py and see if is returning any output if your script is not returning an output message you will not receive any notifications by e-mail

349601
mtu	icmp
i know that there is a need at least icmp messages type 3 in ipv4 have to be allowed for the mtu negotiation to occur

349609
centos	linux
that s how it s shown in linux centos 6 7 in a terminal when running ls

349610
clang	llvm
to be honest i ve tried to build llvm from source but that didn t help i guess clang has to know somehow where to look for those symbols and i don t know how to tell it and i don t have enough disc space to build llvm clang at the same time it takes 20+ gb... following instructions from here

349616
tunnel	vpn
i provide my linux machine s address to the vpn client app and the port 8000 and the shared secret and initially the handshake occurs successfully and the client receives the parameters of the tunnel interface from the server

349616
tunnel	packets
after the initial connection and transfer of parameters i only occasionally see a packets being received by the tunnel

349672
apache	nginx
however what i missed was that i had nginx as a reverse proxy in front of apache

349682
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
there is an rsa public key dsa public key and ecdsa public key but the latter two are not used anywhere in the openssl codebase they only exist in the header file

349692
bash	zsh
with bash 4.3 or newer ksh93t or newer or zsh in sh emulation though in zsh you d rather simply do for splitting than using the split+glob non-sense operator of sh you could split the string on _ characters and reference them from the end

349694
freebsd	linux
i guess things could have changed from the beta to now v2.3 - but i ve decided that android studio is updated so often too often to be honest that i m not going to risk issues with freebsd and just run linux

349714
debian	linux
i have a powerful computer running linux debian desktop

349715
switching	screens
first screens is 0 you need to start any application for the second screens with -display 1 or whatever variation of the commandline switching the application uses

349719
debian	linux
gnu linux debian has no built-in tools for this problem but all information about programs installed in the standard way is saved in files with program-name.list in the location var lib dpkg info

349765
int	chars
could be any 7 8 byte int or a 7 8 chars

349773
debian	centos
i have two seperate vps boxes with vultr.com one is debian and the other centos i would like to set it up so two subdomains go to each one

i was facing similar problem with my ubuntu 14.04 vm and solution suggested by brandizzi for debian worked with little change

349841
bash	zsh
while bash now has date formatting capabilities it has no date parsing or calculation ones so you may want to use another shell like ksh93 or zsh or a proper programming language like perl or python

349848
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
i m going to write this answer from a freebsd perspective but it should be applicable to linux and debian .

349879
ubuntu	mint
i ve tried the various methods suggested on mint and ubuntu s forum

kde	cinnamon
however on reboot before or after installing the correct version of the guest additions for the actual version of virtualbox i use just end up with a black screen cinnamon or unresponsive kde screen with no widgets

349885
spaces	delimiter
if your file was a comma separated file then this code would do what you need during your initiall conversion from comma separated to spaces separated and would handle fields separated by spaces correctly since the delimiter is comma

349909
cpu	affinity
to set cpu affinity you can use taskset command

349915
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems do not allow to appear in directory entries filenames

please upgrade your kernel to the newest versioning you can and see if anything changes

350057
exif	xmp
it s stored in the exif xmp etc

350057
exif	xmp
there are a bunch of tools that can show exif and xmp data in a file

350114
solaris	aix
we googled the different options we had but everything our there was intended for linux or solaris - one thing that caught our attention was a workaround for linux that involved overwriting the value for the pid s stdin file descriptor which makes a lot of sense in the theory but sadly in practice this is not working in aix the same way it works on linux

350171
tar	gunzip
edit although i ve right now used gunzip which do not require target name but i m wondering if tar is not possible at all

350225
freebsd	centos
i m migrating product from centos 6 to freebsd 10.3 and put my_product.conf into apache24 includes

350229
freebsd	centos
so i assume that it s 2.2 default on centos 6 and 2.4 not sure if default on freebsd

350229
freebsd	centos
it s not problem of centos nor freebsd

350243
fish	zsh
in zsh or fish the text would be aligned correctly

350247
kde	gnome
if you want kde instead of gnome you therefore have two options

350247
kde	gnome
keep the exec line but drop everything beyond it for clarity and configure your default x configuration so it starts kde rather than gnome

350260
disk	ram
depending on how big the source disk is how about creating a ram disk on the copier caching your files in there and then copying from there to the multiple destinations using concurrent processes as hschou demonstrates above

350260
disk	ram
how to create real ram disk that reserves memory

350260
disk	ram
ram read is always going to be quicker than multiple random accesses to a flash or ssd even if some of the ram disk ends up being swapped to local physical disk

350282
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade virtualbox to versioning 5.1.16 and found that it has a bug 1 so i downgraded back to 5.1.14

i was trying to update the openssh versioning but without wanting my server got upgrade to ubuntu 16.10

350353

i am trying to setup a mail server with postfix dovecot maria db on centos 7 and have seem to hit a roadblock

350484
spaces	delimiter
this is a pure awk solution that works for two patterns per line spaces delimiter in patterns file with logical and operation

350489
bash	zsh
note that for variables of type array or associative array in bash or ksh posix sh has no array except which you couldn t use here as that would be the arguments of the superecho function itself that only prints the value of the element of indice 0 while in zsh that would output the concatenation of the values with the first character of and with spc characters in yash

350489
bash	zsh
in ksh zsh bash or yash the 4 bourne-like shells with array support

350505
debian	centos
this will disable the root account on debian not sure about centos

350568
ubuntu	debian
the trial mode where you can start debian without installing it worked just fine but when i tried installing ubuntu before i had similar problems when choosing the ubuntu usb stick as boot medium i got a ubuntu loading screen then blackscreen without even getting to install it

350582
bash	subshell
your current shell is interpolating the variable before the second bash or subshell sees it

350601
pull	push
git remote add origin ssh user server home user repo mine.git but if i try to push pull from it it hangs

350602

we are using our own custom linux os based on opensuse 12.1 and recently verification departement has found that the var repository is getting bigger and bigger due to unsend mail in the maildrop queue of postfix

350653
debian	linux
i used to have a raspberry pi with raspbian debian and i used kali linux debian in a virtualbox

350653
ubuntu	debian
i d like to know however because i haven t tried ubuntu gnome what are the main differences between ubuntu gnome and debian

350654
wan	lan
add iptables rules to directly copy packets with source addresses matching stbs macs from the lan to the wan interface

350654
wan	lan
add iptables rules to directly copy packets with destination addresses matching stbs macs from the wan to the lan interface the opposite of the above

350656
folder	directory
since my server key is located at my home directory in .ssh folder and i m currently logged as root i had to specify that key with the option -i identity_file

350660
daemons	systemd
gentoo eschew this convention entirely and because of the proliferating deprecation of the systemd v init systemd in favor of upstart and other pid 1 daemons

350671
bash	zsh
in any posix-style shell sh except on ancient unix systems dash bash ksh zsh etc. you can use arithmetic expansion to tell the shell to perform arithmetic when it s parsing the variable assignment

350671
bash	zsh
in bash ksh or zsh you can use let or â to perform arithmetic instead

350671
bash	zsh
another possibility in bash ksh or zsh is to use the typeset builtin to declare the variable as an integer

350681
filtering	grouping
the downside of using a grouping is that you can no longer use chroot you have to use the less robust named-based filtering approach

350738
debian	linux
i have an isp billing system installed on debian gnu linux 8 which has 3 nic cards

350749
bash	zsh
there are several ways you could be doing this but none of them have difference in behavior when run from the cli or from another script unless you have some esoteric configuration such as a bash binary in that is actually a zsh or some other sillyness

350767
gentoo	linux
i have a linux installed on this same machine gentoo and this os does have a driver

350785
unix	bsd
i think i need a bit of handholding to understand how to approach this in the bsd world as opposed to the windows world i m used to as i m not sufficiently familiar with how a more experienced sysadmin would combine the use of unix permissions acls unix home dirs soft hard symlinks users groups and samba include exclude parameters to achieve the desired outcome

350813
folder	directory
for the server version i downloaded the dvd fedora-server-dvd-x86_64-25-1.3.iso which i then extracted completely in the folder and took the kernel and initramfs from the images pxeboot directory

350819
mouse	keyboard
just keep the keyboard and mouse plugged in

350819
sudo	passwd
even if it doesn t correct anything go to the terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+t and type sudo apt install smartmontools confirm with your passwd

350821
ubuntu	centos
i ve encountered this with apt on ubuntu and yum on centos 7

350824
openbsd	freebsd
this is something that xnu freebsd trueos and openbsd all have in common

350824
bsd	xnu
the gnome terminal authors decided that a failure to set the hard limit to the same value that was initially read is a fatal error without accounting for the fact that gnome terminal will have in the meantime triggered the xnu bsd behaviour that silently lowers the hard limit causing their code to end up trying to raise it which is grounds for failure.

350826
ubuntu	linux
right now linux ubuntu is on 21.4 gb of my 110 gb disk space according to disk usage analyzer

ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu packages

350836
debian	mint
i m coming from being a mint user so am unfamiliar with debian based oss

350843
kde	gnome
as stephen stated in the comments recognizing files by extension and associating them with a program to open them would generally be done by your desktop environment kde gnome etc

350843
emacs	kate
for example on my computer - which uses kubuntu i use kate to open plain ascii and utf files but when said files end with .c .h .cpp .hpp .cmake etc they are opened with emacs instead

350861
jobs	cron
i assume that this is effecting all of my cron jobs

350880
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop in tandem with arrays variables can be put to use here like as

350906
mouse	keyboard
my aim is to have a ubuntu laptop which starts one application and the users can t use the mouse or keyboard

350912
debian	linux
astra linux is a debian derivative

350912
debian	linux
about 2 3 of all linux distros are debian based

350939
wan	lan
to answer the question as stated i got some advice from a friend network guru to bridge the lan and wan interfaces then use ebtables to filter out what is to get bridged

350939
wan	vlan
move the wan ip configuration from the nic to to the wan vlan incl

350939
vlan	packets
optional add firewall rules to avoid lan packets from leaking into the isp vlan

350939
wan	vlan
- add them as vlan entries to the .network file matching on the wan nic

350939
wan	vlan
this example uses 1234 for the wan vlan and 56 for the internal iptv one

350939
wan	vlan
etc systemd network eno1.1234.netdev - wan vlan

350944
centos	linux
i try to build linux from scratch without root access at a custom location and within an existing centos installation

350957
gentoo	linux
i have a laptop which had a linux installed gentoo with grub2

350957
gentoo	linux
what i tried is to move everything between menuentry gentoo gnu linux --class gentoo --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os menuentry_id_option gnulinux-simple-6e038879-4460-4056-a7c1-f3d6c22d16d4 and into the 40_custom file and ran bootadm regenerate-list -f

350989
ubuntu	mint
correct me if i am wrong but mint is an ubuntu s derivative

350989
ubuntu	mint
i imagine that from april ubuntu is having this app in their repos and therefore mint will do as well eventually

350995
ubuntu	debian
it was added in apt 0.9.14.3 exp3 in january 2014 and merged in the main branch in apt 0.9.15 that same month so any release of debian or a derivative with a version of apt greater than or equal to 0.9.15 will have it â this includes debian 8 although the documentation doesnâ t mention it the forthcoming debian 9 and versions of ubuntu starting with 14.04

351019
folder	directory
so here s the question how can i either get libreoffice not to create a lock file in the same directory as the file being edited or suppress the updating of the folder s date modified attribute under those conditions

351058
postfix	dovecot
my question is assuming that i screwed up the tutorial what s the command to reset the server back to it s empty state before installing like postfix or dovecot

351063
vmware	virtualbox
for virtual machines like vmware virtualbox you can create a snapshot as stephen suggested

351064
stdout	stderr
but any application can be controlled by a terminal and any application that reads or writes files or their stdin stdout stderr can be made to perform i o to a terminal device

351064
stdout	stderr
it will also have its file descriptors 0 1 and 2 stdin stdout and stderr open on that file again as inherited from its shell parent

351088
debian	linux
afaik the debian linux kernel is generic that means it works for intel and amd processors

351091
versioning	upgrade
but when doing an apt-get upgrade or dist-upgrade it doesn t install newest package versioning

351091
versioning	upgrade
why apt-get upgrade doesn t find and install newest versioning of the released packages e.g wget deb7u4

ready	each
this is by design what i personally needed to see each mac address which was present in my network during last days - you can easily modify it there is a ready section for this in code just add one condition

351134
jobs	cron
cron jobs run from your directory so if you want to write a file to your directory you need to do one of two things

351149
affinity	irq	cpu	irq	cpu	affinity
to be able to spread irq to all available cpu s you need to change the affinity

351149
affinity	irq
for example to change irq affinity for eth0-txrx-0

351149
cpu	affinity
change affinity by echoing cpu bitmask

351149
affinity	irq
you can read more detailed info at smp irq affinity

351171
stdout	stderr
for dynamically linked applications you could run them with a ld_preload blob that installs a handler on sigttou and do the stty tostop that reopens stdout and stderr on dev null if they were going to a terminal

351171
stdout	stderr
that would handle the case of non-setuid setgid applications writing on the terminal via their stdout stderr and don t handle sigttou themselves

351181
stdout	stderr
you pipe only the stdout to grep but your curl puts out errors to stderr which are printed without passing the grep

351181
stdout	stderr
if you want the stderr to be filtered too redirect it to stdout first

351185
kde	gnome
if your login screen allows you to change the session then try to change it to something else try logging in with gnome rather than kde or vice versa

351197
vpn	wlan
imo there is also technically no need to ask their dns server as the vpn is on top of the wlan

351210
folder	dir	folder	directory
bash script wc -w should give the word count of each file in the current directory but not any of the folder so that the output never has any of the sub dir is a directory lines

351238
installation	upgrade
edit #2 i was able to do a dual boot installation with a fedora 22 usb stick with the thought that if that worked i could just upgrade fedora afterwards

351264
folder	directory
at this point you can think of having finished all the preparation now we simply take the snapshot but are specifying the overlay image goes in the top level domain directory and the memspec file goes in the snapshot folder beside it s backing disk image

351266
awk	ksh
its possible your script was written to work with ksh zsh or maybe even awk or expect

351273
for-loop	loops
a for-loop executes the body with loops variable the â œcontrol variableâ bound in turn to each word in the list

351284
bash	zsh
this requires ksh bash or zsh

351290
stdout	stderr
by using sudosh as the user s login shell you can enforce that everything is logged stdin stdout stderr etc

351299
for-loop	loops
should i use for-loop or while loops

351328
folder	directory
however i have managed to change the apache2 running directory to network-drive website in order to be able to build a home website from that directory which means i can just view the files in windows explorer from my laptop like any other folder

351348
bash	zsh
i found a way assuming a shell that supports csh -like brace expansion like ksh bash or yash -o brace-expand zsh supports brace expansion but not as the first argument like that as that conflicts with command grouping

351359
folder	directory
at the moment every folder in the main directory is set for download rights for sftp so my idea is to make a list.txt containing the files that the user can not access and set the permissions to something

351394
automake	autotools
i m using automake autotools to install the sources

351424
folder	directory
note i would test the following on a small example folder before modifying your 500gb directory

351442
bash	tcsh
in tcsh the default shell for freebsd root i can t seem to figure out how to escape the escape and get the equivalent of the bash escape codes

351450
tput	tcsh
you might as well call the tput or clear commands then but in tcsh that s not needed as tcsh has built-in support for termcap terminfo so you can do

351474
put	get
but when i put it in a file.sh and double click it then i get an error

351503
tunnel	vpn
for my particular needs i don t want the route for the 172.16.0.0 network to be generated because i am adding another route to go through vpn tunnel server

351504
tar	md5sum
one is to md5sum the original files tar and untar from tape and check the md5sums to make sure the files are still getting recorded properly

351556
bash	zsh
while zsh is installed by default in macos it is not the default shell you get in a terminal unless you ve explicitly changed your login shell from the default of bash

351556
bash	zsh
so you d need to either start zsh first by entering zsh at the prompt of the bash shell in the terminal or run

351557
debian	centos
i noticed that etc os-release contains the info i need on the distributions i tried centos debian but how safe is it to rely on the presence of it

351576
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m having unexpected behavior using the telnet command on various linux linux mint ubuntu server

351577
stdout	stderr
of course we now have to redirect the reminder to stderr because stdout is assigned to the variable

351638
ssl	https
i have installed ssl certificate on my webserver and enabled redirection of all http requests to https using certbot

351658
bash	zsh
this worked for me in bash dash ksh and zsh

351669
gentoo	linux
when starting openvpn on gentoo linux i get the following error

351681
debian	linux
so i finally decided to dip my toes into linux and installed debian jesse

351684
daemons	systemd
of course if what you actually want is a daemons that watches for changes in the number of usb devices or something you should look into systemd which might provide something more elegant

351687
folder	directory
i want to copy all files in main folder folder0 to somewhere else such that all file be in one directory

351687
folder	directory
i just want all files in directory and sub directory not folder

351705
stdout	stderr
i want to write to existing file by redirecting stdout and stderr to file1.txt while overriding the noclobber option

351709
mpfr	mpc
library-check.sh - to check for gmp mpfr and mpc libs

351753
folder	directory
i d like to be able to access other folder in the network-drive directory using php scripts inside the website folder

351756
stdout	stderr
i would imagine it could detect it by sending lots data stdout stderr and if that blocks then it would indicate that the client program was suspended

351756
stdout	stderr
but can it be done without sending data to stderr stdout

351814
folder	directory
as target would not work as the project can be placed in tmp as well as in my special folder for projects while github is always placed in users home directory home gilhad or home friend or what points to

351857
vpn	lan	tunnel	vpn	tunnel	lan
so we tought about setup vpn tunnel for outside users to our lan server

351857
vpn	lan
where vpn server will be either separate machine or virtual machine with its own ip set on lan server machine

351857
vpn	lan
all outside traffic will have to pass trough vpn but lan users can directly access server by 0.200 8010 address

351858
uniq	grep
there would appear to be no such word list apt-file search usr share dict | sort | uniq | grep latin but there is a dict english latin dictionary dict-freedict-eng-lat

351912
switching	screens
i ended up switching to tmux because the issue only exists when i start a new screens session

351922
bash	zsh
ksh93 bash or zsh

351965
filesystems	xfs
i have 2 xfs filesystems where space seems to disappear mysteriously

351965
filesystems	xfs
the 2 xfs filesystems were created at that time

351965
debian	linux
itâ s now running 32-bit up-to-date debian jessie with a 64-bit 4.9.2-2 bpo8+1 linux kernel from the backports archive

351965
filesystems	xfs
i donâ t have any other xfs filesystems on this system.

351967
sudoers	passwd
you ll also need to update etc sudoers to allow your user to run the above command without requiring a passwd

352000
ubuntu	debian
check the projects subforum for discussion about xenialdog ubuntu 16.04 xenial xerus lts 32-bit 64 bit debiandog-jessie xenialdog 64-bit debian frugal and others

352009
ssd	sata
i have also gone into bios and realised that the ssd is recognised and my exact model is listed under devices sata nvme m.2 ssd

352010
mouse	keyboard
it s 2 desktops but i can mouse and keyboard between them

352066
openbsd	linux
i m using tmux in openbsd tmux in the base system of openbsd 6.1-beta and i do some development on linux hosts

352066
ubuntu	linux
the ps1 variable on the linux host ubuntu 16.04 in an lxc container is set to

352080
daemons	systemd
filesystems are better left with the default 5 reservation include those containing the directories root var and tmp that are often used by daemons and other operatins systemd services to create temporary files or logs at runtime

352087
ubuntu	centos
this setup has worked on several other ubuntu centos machines

352090
stdout	stderr
of course that will collapse stdout and stdin but piping just stderr in bash gets a bit hairy so i ll ignore that

352097
ubuntu	linux
i am new to web programming and linux i have an angular2 nodejs app running on a linode ubuntu server

352099
switching	screens
to switching to xorg on gnome 3 you can click on the gear button and choose gnome on xorg when you reâ on the login screens

352101
bash	zsh
if the shell you re calling that bash script from is zsh you can also do

352102
virtualbox	parallels
i ve seen this issue before it crept up on one of my other virtual machines and after hours of research now in 2 separate events i wanted to reach out to see if anyone knows how to go about solving this i can t find documentation on it anywhere and i m not using virtualbox i m using parallels

352107
temp	tmp
as far as i know the best way to get the temp dir is just tmp is there any distro that won t work using that path

352114
versioning	upgrade
until you can upgrade to a newer versioning of systemd where the issue is resolved you ll have to use another mechanism besides update-alternatives to copy and move files instead of symlink them as the behavior of systemd can t be changed with the current versioning

352123
bash	zsh
the pipe2script function defaults to using bash but it can take a second argument of any other shell name dash zsh ksh93 python etc

352163
sudo	passwd
this can be a bit surprising when the first passwd prompt comes up so itâ s worth adding a message before the first sudo in the script

352169
centos	linux
then add elrepo in centos 7 rhel 7 scientific linux 7 using command

352169
ubuntu	centos
now the solution we are actually going with is to reinstall the computer with ubuntu and run centos in a virtual machine

352185
solaris	aix
certain aix and solaris hosts doesn t have column command

352248
sudo	passwd
how to execute the command sudo dpkg -i brackets .deb directly without asking to input passwd

352275
sudo	passwd
in order to increase security over a short passwd for sudo i wanted to increase the delay between failed attempts

352275
sudo	passwd
what would you consider a good guidelines for setting up the delay of sudo in pam relative to the passwd length

352278
mouse	keyboard
however neither the keyboard nor the mouse worked even to change to a vt so i still had to hard boot

352280
daemons	systemd
i found in manual that in systemd wide daemons configuration should not use automatic detection

352305
ubuntu	debian
you are trying to follow instructions for ubuntu not debian

352305
ubuntu	debian
while ubuntu does have a package called apturl the debian equivalent package was apparently called aptlinex but since none of the links on that page work it looks like it s no longer packaged in debian

352312
filesystems	btrfs
i m using virtualbox and guest os has btrfs filesystems

352316
bash	zsh
but as i am adding a shebang in the front of the script and explicitly asking it to use bash answers posted here always return bash as expected although i am executing this script on a zsh terminal

352332
chown	mount
so you must mount it and then chown the directory mountpoint

352359
ubuntu	centos
your loaded modules show a lot of iscsi modules on the ubuntu working side so if you look at lsscsi -h on the working system you ll see what controller #3 is and you can replicate it on centos

352364
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux i wrote files to a bd-r using growisofs per

352381
filesystems	btrfs
root btrfs filesystems was converted from ext4

352381
filesystems	btrfs
home btrfs filesystems was converted from ext4

352398
ubuntu	debian
there are lots of partition table types and many of them are disabled in ubuntu debian redhat kernels

352454
folder	directory
then if he connect through ftp sftp ssh he will be logged into is home test directory that contain a link to the folder he can modify

352476
sorting	filtering
you re not sorting the file before filtering it

352481
ubuntu	linux	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
edit this is the same on all distros i have tried ubuntu chakra kde manjaro xfce linux lite xfce pclinuxos mate elementary deepin zorin fedora gnome

352495
postgresql	mysql
on my laptop i use mysql and postgresql only for testing

352495
sudo	passwd
but starting the services manually and typing in my sudo passwd is a minor annoyance

352495
postgresql	mysql
but a quick google search seems to indicate that socket-based activation is not yet supported in postgresql mysql

352495
postgresql	mysql
systemd 229 kubuntu 16.04 mysql 5.7 postgresql 9.5

352505
postgresql	mysql
socket-based activation is not yet supported in postgresql mysql

352506
put	get
now i would expect the reading threads to each take a line or a few lines but the first reading process will take all the lines in a random order which i don t understand but that s ok put it in a buffer somewhere and all the other reading processes will not get any line

352517
ubuntu	freebsd
i have an nfs share hosted on freebsd 11.0.1 and a mounted on trusty tahr ubuntu 14.04

352569
hex	binary
given a binary file how do you convert it to a hex string and back using only standard tools like sed and cut on a minimal system with busybox installed

352569
hex	binary
i m looking for a script or command to convert a file to a hex string and a corresponding one for converting it back to binary

352574
pulseaudio	mixer
routing the metronome to the pulseaudio jack source makes the jack source appear in pavucontrol under the input devices tab - the mixer shows it is receiving the metronome signal

352576
disk	ram
linux always tries to use ram to speed up disk operations by using available memory for buffers file system metadata and cache pages with actual contents of files or block devices

352604
dpkg	apt
the simplest way is to use apt instead of dpkg

352604
ubuntu	debian
for example in ubuntu 16.04 and debian 8 and newer the following command will do everything for you

352604
dpkg	apt
apt is built on top of dpkg precisely to handle your use case a lot of dependencies to download and install

352640
ssl	https
i have installed ssl certificates and redirection of the http traffic to https and this part works without problem

352648
bash	zsh
to process several files with zsh bash ksh93

352650
filesystems	ntfs
the problem persists whatever the usb s filesystems is i tried ntfs fat32 and ext4

352677
daemons	systemd
i have two daemons that are both configured as systemd services

352692
vlan	packets
a packets arrives from network a so it is tagged with vlan id 1

352707
chown	chmod
i was wondering if there is any way to view the changes history of commands chmod and chown in the whole system folders and files in

352718
xfs	btrfs
like btrfs zfs or xfs for instance which are most likely not grub compatible

352751
cinnamon	gnome
usually in cinnamon or gnome there is terminal application

352765
stdout	stderr
this way program would not hang your terminal and send both stdout and stderr to a file named nohup.out

352768
stdout	stderr
n.b. your redirections are ineffective as 2 1 will make stderr go where stdout goes display and which it anyway goes

352812
children	parent
usually a program forking children will also read their exit status as they exit so you ll see zombies only if the parent is stopped or buggy

352819
folder	directory
all folder and files in my current directory have rwxrwxrwx and the same is true for descendant files and folder

352819
folder	directory
i can copy a whole directory to another one and then freely change its name or i can copy its contents to the folder with the desired name and those solutions are acceptable but using just mv would be easier

352830
cat	tee
the cat and can both be replaced by a single tee

352841
vpn	lan
i do share this vpn connection locally with lan clients by using the linux server as their default gateway 192.168.1.2

352841
tunnel	vpn
i think this is due to the fact that once this paid vpn connection is established all outgoing internet traffic is routed through the tunnel tun1 so the client s handshake requests remains unanswered

352940
sudo	passwd
any reason not to disable the root account using sudo passwd -l root

352940
sudo	passwd
terdon i am fairly sure that i never ran sudo passwd or even plain passwd on this operating system

352956
google-chrome	firefox
this works quite well for some applications for example firefox looks perfect but for example google-chrome has a big problem with that solution and displays all gui-menues in a really tiny font

352964
centos	linux
seek rpm or look into parts manufactor s website for linux centos driver

352997
post	get
i would appreciate any solution or even other approach that will let me call the same ip on different interface using regular http get post methods

353007
ubuntu	linux
at boot time grub asks which ubuntu to boot from but now i have to add a new menu item into grub and that menu item will allow user to change default linux to boot

353042
udp	tcp
so i modified my iptables rules for detect what are the tcp udp open needed by android

353045
kate	gedit
nautilus kate gedit or firefox can be run with no issues whatsoever and are displayed on my local machine correctly

353052
pop-up	dialog
it seems the third parameter 2 passed to the org.kde.ksmserverinterface.logout means the application kwrite should be killed immediately instead of pop-up dialog

353074
dpkg	aptitude
as explained in this response to a similar question regarding aptitude and dpkg netstat is truncating the output because when it s piped to grep it doesn t know how wide the output should be

353082
ubuntu	linux
i found the above answer and found it to be very useful but i also found that the certtool command syntax on ubuntu linux today was noticeably different than described by goldilocks as was the output

353100
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade your kernel versioning

353155
stdout	stderr
this sends stderr to stdout which is being written to a file

353165
mouse	keyboard
the employee should not be able to interact with the ad space so the mouse and keyboard should only work on his workspace

353212
punctuation	words
assuming that i have a file containing only of characters and numbers no special characters or punctuation marks how can i swap two words that may or may not be right next to each other using vim

353230
filesystems	btrfs
the filesystems of choice will be btrfs for reasons outside the scope of this question

353245
filesystems	btrfs
other filesystems such as btrfs or zfs can maintain a record of all changes over a period of time and can transmit those changes to a replica location

353254
folder	directory
not sure what you mean by folder structure as you dont really show us any folder outside of the source and destination directory

353281
sudo	passwd
this will immediately ask for the passwd if necessary and abort executing the script if sudo fails

353295
ubuntu	debian
it s available in the standard repositories on arch debian and ubuntu

353375
x86	64bit
x86 32- and 64bit x86 the latter also known as amd64

353376
x86	64bit
it used to be there but the 32-bit i386 and 64bit amd64 architectures were unified in a single x86 architecture around 2007

353403
sudo	passwd
it did work for ssh login and su with passwd but when using sudo su from root without passwd or when cron is running user s crontab entry the supplementary group ids are not being added

353431
unix	solaris
sysstat is just a collation of tools most of which can be found on solaris as well as other unix oses

353433
openbsd	freebsd
freebsd has the same option and comment from openbsd in 2004 not posix yet...

353450
folder	directory
a new folder tar-1.29 will be created under your current working directory including all .h files

353457
ubuntu	debian
is it the same or similar case for installation from .deb files on ubuntu or debian

353467
binutils	newlib	toolchain	newlib	toolchain	binutils
i was able to get the cr16 toolchain using binutils gcc newlib

353477
stdout	stderr
the is the preferred syntax for redirecting both stdout and stderr to a file

353501
versioning	upgrade
the problem is that i upgrade to versioning 9 of debian and now when i run the same command to update debian9 it throws me errors of public keys repository not found or unsigned

353512
uninstall	upgrade
an rpm -u upgrade of a package will run the new pre- and post- install scriptlets then the old pre- and post- uninstall scriptlets

353517
ubuntu	centos
i used rufus 2.12 from w10 2 times to install both centos and ubuntu

353537
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
you should be able to do this with any linux distributions including debian and ubuntu

353540
for-loop	loops
i m looking for a way to perform loops say on the last 5 directories in order to prevent counting directories previously counted and cut back execution time the for-loop allows specifying certain directories but i still need to only count xml files

353558
wav	ogg
can i play wav or ogg files through that

353611
umask	sudo
i was surprised to find that i could not run umask with sudo

353612
octal	decimal
in languages like c or perl a leading zero signifies an octal number and since file permission bits are customarily represented in octal the zero has to be used in those languages so that the number isn t taken as decimal

353619
folder	directory
keep as it is and add the other mime types like inode directory for folder for audio etc.

353632
folder	directory
when i navigate to media root persistence directory and type ls the . trash-0 folder is not shown so i suppose the folder itself and it s content is hidden

353651
sudo	passwd
in addition to this you could define your sudo rule to not require a passwd and it wouldn t prompt the user

353671
debian	linux
please assume i m using a recent version of debian linux on ext4 on a 2 tb seagate momentus hard drive with all the default settings

353674
ubuntu	linux
today i removed my gpu out of an linux ubuntu machine and after that the ethernet stopped working

353689
spaces	delimiter
the optional - inside the brackets above changes the way the delimiter is matched and allows indenting each line inside the heredoc content with tabulations no spaces allowed

353701
stdout	stderr
for a client then creating a login process which has the slave side of the pseudo-terminal as stdin stdout and stderr

353708
uniq	grep
here grep extracts the full username value fields cut extracts the value and uniq | sort -u makes the usernames unique

353731
post	get
turning fiddler off - i can get to google just fine turning it on gives me the page i mentioned at the top of this post

353749
versioning	upgrade
i have centos6.8 vps and installed php5.5 versioning using cpanel but now i ve to install upgrade php5.6 on server but getting no packages available for php5.6 and php7.0 also

353751
debian	linux
linux debian stretch 9 testing

353751
debian	mint
how do i achieve the goal to have my personal aliases sourced when sudo -s on debian like it works on mint

353751
debian	mint
it is working for my purpose on mint i have a lot of useful aliases defined and i want it also to work on my debian server

353759
switching	screens
a well-known way to get rid of screens tearing on nvidia cards is to switching to a mode with a special option like this

353780
debian	mint
notice that the lll alias works on your mint before you sudo -s and it won t do so on debian because that s an ssh session so a login shell while on mint it s just interactive

353783
put	get
i want get the number on each line as a value and put same amount of # marks at the end

353794
filesystems	btrfs
but maybe you use a hdd with a btrfs zfs or similar filesystems

353809
ssd	sata
shows that the ssd sata ports are 100 busy but only writing ca

353811
stdout	fflush
so i went looking for a way to force a fflush from the jobs stdout buffer to the file - and found the stdbuf command

353826
openbsd	freebsd
on systems like freebsd and openbsd the init program only permits logging on as user #0 in single user mode on terminals marked as secure in the etc ttys file

353826
openbsd	freebsd
and the login program directly on openbsd through a pam module in freebsd enforces the secure flag in multi-user mode

353826
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu similarly have the etc securetty mechanism

353826
tunnel	lan
one can manually direct programs that make sounds to a pulseaudio server over the lan or manually tunnel from the remote sound clients to a local pulseaudio server

353872
folder	directory
cd documents will probably fail on your machine unless you actually have a directory called documents in your home folder because the first letter isn t capitalized

353883
folder	directory
so you re saying that you are in a folder say documents and you have several folder within this folder so you change directory cd into that directory an want to count how many .txt files are deep into that directory in every sub-folder

353889
google-chrome	firefox
you can view either using google-chrome or firefox

353901
vpn	lan
i can continue using dhcpcd for this connection but i need to connect to vpn sometimes and networkmanager is not allowing me to establish vpn connection unless it s ensured i have lan connection

353907
mouse	keyboard
on my laptop when it completely freezes unresponsive mouse or keyboard on mint 17.3 i m able to do control + alt + fn + f7 then control + alt + fn+ f2

353915
ubuntu	debian
i did a lot of research and testing what i ended up having to do was use a second bootable usb running ubuntu so that i could run refind alongside efibootmgr the latter is not included in live versions of parrot and debian

353918
versioning	upgrade
easy way install a supported versioning and upgrade to an unsupported one

353918
installation	upgrade
it occurs when running the command emerge --config which is run after a clean installation as opposed to an upgrade

353918
versioning	upgrade
then upgrade it to the later unsupported versioning from the overlay

353918
versioning	upgrade
now unmask the later unsupported versioning from the overlay repository and upgrade to it

353930
ubuntu	debian
choose p persistent live only debian and ubuntu

353956
ftp	telnet
i can telnet other ftp and http

353969
fish	bash
i m using fish but i ve tried doing konsole -e bash as well it inserts a visible s there

353986
mouse	keyboard
they are supposed to switch on again on after any input keyboard mouse like the idle standby only done on command

354020
zsh	subshell
in zsh the right-hand side of a pipe operator runs in the original process and the left-hand side runs in a subshell

354023
bash	zsh
experimentally on debian jessie dash bash mksh and zsh load a 130kb here document into memory whereas ksh93 copies 64kb chunks without allocating more memory

354059
versioning	upgrade
after that i upgrade to vmware esxi versioning 6.5 because it has a newer versioning of the voma command

354073
passwd	visudo
please advise why i get passwd if already added in visudo the following

354081
sudoers	visudo
you re not using sudo so any changes you make there in etc sudoers the file that visudo edits won t affect the behavior of su only that of sudo which is not the same program

354081
sudo	passwd
in any case the line you show simply means that the user moon can run any command as the user starus with sudo without needing to enter a passwd

354081
sudo	passwd
if you are logged in as moon you can use sudo to run a command as starus without a passwd

354083
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
on the other hand the edits that youâ ve made to etc sudoers allow the starus user to use the sudo command with the -u option to run commands as the moon user without being prompted for a passwd

354095
bash	zsh
zsh s printf counts in characters instead of bytes so wouldn t have bash s issue above

354139
ubuntu	linux
note1 i have actually tried this with ubuntu instead of arch linux as i have decided to switch but i believe the problem here had to do with how windows was installed and not with the linux version so i would expect this to work with arch as well

354152
sudo	passwd
in this case the external bin passwd command would run with sudo

354156
jobs	cron
we have a multi cron jobs runing everyday on different hours

354173
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
tested not working on kali linux v2 and ubuntu mint v16.04.1 lts

354178
jobs	cron
modify your cron jobs to immediately terminate upon startup if that file exists

354178
jobs	cron
and for the cron jobs

354178
jobs	cron
note however that without working on locking the cron jobs themselves if the long process goes longer than one cron cycle you could end up with two concurrent instances of the cron job waiting to jump into action

354187
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
debian linux ubuntu

354204
filesystems	btrfs
i have a btrfs filesystems with a hdds of various sizes

354253
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
run apt-get install mailx debian or ubuntu or yum install -y mailx centos or redhat

354263
ubuntu	linux
but then i remember the power of linux and thought there could possibly be a way of booting from a flash-drive and then switch to full ubuntu in the hard drive

354266
stdout	stderr
nothing is sent to stdout but stderr does get triggered in this case because it s not permitted to make new files in proc that s the no such file or directory error

354269
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu you could do an upgrade dry-run via apt-get dist-upgrade -s and look for a new kernel being installed

354276
gentoo	debian
what s inside the mdadm.conf used by debian vs gentoo

354287
udp	tcp
all udp connections are prefixed with tcp

354301
freebsd	linux
from linux os add the new freebsd entry to your etc grub.d 40_custom then regenerate the grub.cfg file

354305
disk	ram
i understand that when ram fills up and the kernel starts moving pages back and forth from disk to ram programs will become less responsive

354338
min	max
however after several hours of troubleshooting i was unable to address the issue because i cannot change the min max thresholds that are read-only

354338
min	max
the critical state comes because the input vcore voltage value is outside the min max values

354338
min	max
after reading the documentation of lm-sensors config file i found out that i can correct the min max values with some proper configuration

354338
min	max
my second attempt was to try to try the compute statement in sensors conf file but i soon found out that i cannot just compute the min max

354338
min	max
is there any way to soft-tune only the min max values in lm-sensors if these values are read-only

354353
apache	nginx
you can have nginx on the same machine as your apache server and you can configure it to redirect requests to the secondary server based on the url

354353
ssl	https	apache	nginx
another great advantage that this setup offers is ssl tls offloading you can have the apache backends serve plain http and nginx to serve ssl tls enabled https so you have your certificates in one single server which makes it much easier and tidier to maintain

354371
portrait	landscape
i have two monitors one landscape and one portrait and i m currently working with a window split landscape across both monitors

354371
portrait	landscape
my landscape monitor is ever-so-slightly off-centered from my portrait monitor

354379
daemons	systemd
usually the systemd logger daemons will also put it in var log messages by default on most distributions with which i ve worked

354387
put	get
alternatively i can put down a file in sudoers.d on every machine that has all 30 names of these microservices but that defeats the purpose of having a system where these sudo rules get centrally managed freeipa

354393
jobs	cron
check var cron tab and etc crontab to find any newly added jobs if any also checking var log cron would help to identify some suspicious jobs that were run which means that the cron configuration was modified to look in other folders for extra jobs

354413
centos	linux
i am trying to copy one file from linux centos to windows

354418
postfix	dovecot
i have setup a local mail server using postfix and dovecot

354418
starttls	smtps
i am getting errors however since fetchmail does not use starttls when connecting via smtps to the local postfix

354418
starttls	smtps
according to this previous question this is because fetchmail does not support starttls when talking to an smtps server and states that it

354418
starttls	smtps
is it the way to go to relax the security constraints in postfix s master.cf for smtps and only enforce starttls for submission

354447
bash	zsh
for array conjunction and disjunction look at zsh instead of bash

354456
put	get
it needs to be after any user input to get a good result so if you re prompting for information put it after the prompt s

354467
toolchain	binutils
i ve taken the older toolchain of gas binutils gcc and made them to run under windows so you can cross compile linux 0.10 0.11 0.12 0.95 0.96 0.97 0.98 directly on your windows machine and included qemu a simple filesystem to boot up your kernel

354486
sudoers	passwd
i also added the following to etc sudoers file to ensure that user4 doesn t get prompted for passwd in order to get access to the serial port dev ttyusb5 through minicom

354487
debian	linux
i am running debian linux on an embedded system

354537
toolchain	binutils
according their the wiki i need a toolchain with binutils v2.17 and gcc v4.1.2 for the mipsel-elf target with

354557
min	max
so now the min max warning values have been set to 1.05v 1.40v and the critical values to 1v 1.45v

354560
daemon	cron
since it does work on manual execution i assume the script runs in a different cwd when executed by the cron daemon

354560
stdout	stderr
if nothing works you may debug further by watching the syslog tail -f var log syslog | grep cron and write any output stdout and stderr to disk

354563
dnf	yum
all lsb compliant distributions all the big ones provide the file lib lsb init-functions which defines the listed functions in the meta-package lsb-core-noarch which can be installed using the distribution s package manager yum dnf apt ...

354583
folder	directory
this creates a directory but it is quicklydeleted somehow and by the time i start the service the folder isn t available

354585
jobs	cron
use a cron job for periodic jobs

354608
ubuntu	debian
in debian and ubuntu sh is dash in which echo evaluates c-style backslash-escapes in its arguments

354621
ubuntu	opensuse
i switched to opensuse leap 42.2 from ubuntu

354621
ubuntu	opensuse
note i couldn n found any opensuse commad equivalent to below commands available in ubuntu

354633
octal	hex
if the system you re targetting has gnu bash you can take advantage of its support in it arithmetic expressions for bases other than just octal and hex

354633
post	put
for instance i wouldn t put this into a cgi script under apache where file comes the post data of a form submitted by arbitrary internet users

354671
ubuntu	linux
the only linux distro i have ever installed on this particular computer is ubuntu

354697
fish	zsh
note that if the variable s value contains special characters such as spaces you need double quotes when using it unless you use zsh or fish as your shell

354715
sys	argparse
unfotunately overwrites import sys argparse and does not replace variable with its content

354736
bash	tcsh
don t know about bash i don t use it if i can possibly avoid doing so but in tcsh other shells you could simply use the history mechanism

354789
debian	linux
i am using debian gnu linux 8 jessie 64-bit with gnome 3.14.1 in my computer

354875
versioning	upgrade
finally you also have an option to upgrade to a specific versioning

354877
debian	linux
i am using debian gnu linux version 8 with lxde

354899
ubuntu	debian
i want to switch from ubuntu 16.04 to debian 8.7.1

354899
debian	linux
i ve looked into installing debian from a unix linux system but that looks really messy

354908
versioning	upgrade
according to the official website you should upgrade your kernel versioning

354930
sudo	passwd
this will ask you for the root user s passwd at which point you should probably apt install sudo log out of the root shell and then proceed as normal

354930
sudo	passwd
mind that unlike sudo which asks you for your passwd su will ask you for root s passwd

354987
switching	screens
but when i switching to one of the command lines doesn t matter which one the screens turns black

355004
freebsd	linux
i know it s possible to configure it to load windows linux freebsd etc

355042
ubuntu	linux
linux lite is based on ubuntu which restricts symlinks in world-writable sticky directories including tmp symlinks there can only be dereferenced by their owner

355042
ubuntu	linux
i mentioned the connection between linux lite and ubuntu because the documentation for this is seemingly ubuntu-specific.

355064

355163
bash	zsh
i heard zsh has a feature where it asks for confirmation executing pasted commands is there something i can put in my .bashrc to make bash ask before executing commands that were pasted in the terminal

355177
switching	screens
this command starts an x11 server the gui backend that does basic things like remember that a certain window is at a certain position as well as a bunch of useful applications typically at least a window manager a program that provides ways to switching between windows to move windows around and control which one is active to start programs etc. and often a desktop environment that completes the window manager with additional screens widgets and utilities such as a clock a desktop switcher an icon tray a session saver etc.

does anyone know of a way to display thumbnails for contact vcf vcard files in nautilus or another file browser in ubuntu 14.04

355198
vcard	vcf

355216
hash	md5
decode it and calculate the md5 hash

355249
bash	zsh

355257
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade de openjdk package from versioning 7 to 8 but the first issue i found in debian jessie is that it s not yet in the stable package so i had to add the jessie-backports repo info to the apt s sources.list file

355268
chown	chmod
chown chmod have no effect because the filesystem is read-only

355275
bash	zsh
alternatively run zsh instead of bash and take advantage of its zmv function

355276
gentoo	linux
portage is the default package management system of gentoo linux and its derivative distributions including calculate and funtoo linux

355277
gentoo	linux
portage is the default package management system of gentoo linux and its derivative distributions such as calculate and funtoo linux

355297
filesystems	btrfs
if you want to change who owns something on a btrfs filesystems just use the chown command

355297
chown	mount
if you want the entire filesystem to be owned by a specific user mount it and then chown the mountpoint directory

355303

since you claim it started after an upgrade of your arch installation it s likely that this is just a bug in the most recent versioning of the pptpclient program

355411
width	height
you can crop a percentage of your image though in this case to avoid running additional commands to get the image height and width in order to calculate crop offset which by default is relative to top-left corner you ll also have to crop relative to gravity so that your crop offset position is relative to the bottom-left corner of the image

355419
filesystems	xfs
assuming the default xfs filesystems

355428
daemons	systemd	kde	gnome
gnome and kde both provide keyboard-handling settings daemons that should handle systemd xkb options including changing on the fly

355433
filesystems	ntfs
if you want to extract data from a possibly damaged ntfs drive you might want to consider using recuperabit which is a software i developed to perform filesystems reconstruction

355442
pull	push
if you click yes and provide the admin password you don t actually get logged in as user1 and this is an issue because user1 needs to not be admin and needs access to its own git files repos etcetera to push pull its updates

355455
mouse	keyboard
i can t move the mouse click use the keyboard or open a terminal

355459
ecdsa	rsa
you can achieve some difference in performance by using different key types ecdsa ed25519 ... or smaller rsa sizes

355460
put	get
then we put the epoch time and the current line in an anonymous array reference and get back the contents of this array by dereferencing it the double quotes ... around the expression ensure that the list elements shall be space separated

355498
daemons	launchd
i don t know what qtgui.qdesktopservices.openurl does but i strongly suspect it opens a url in an appropriate application by communicating with some kde daemons through the x11 session not by launchd a browser directly as a child of itself

355511
folder	dir

filesystems	fat
is it possible to use any filesystems on a boot disk and mark it as bootable or it has to be fat only

355655

the mkfs.fat command is redundant since the dd command will overwrite the fat filesystems with the pathtoiso.iso file which contains an iso9660 filesystems in itself

as stephen kitt mentioned in a comment it looks like you tried to upgrade the system from ubuntu 14.04 to debian testing

355830
ubuntu	debian
my guess is that you added a debian repository to your ubuntu system s package manager configuration and then attempted to perform an upgrade either implicitly or explicitly

355830
ubuntu	debian
your system is most likely currently in some mixture of states between debian and ubuntu

355830

while ubuntu and debian both use the linux kernel and both use similar packages sidegrading i hesitate to call it upgrading a system from one to the other in-place is not a supported operation

other way is get the website of the repository that doesn t seem to work put it in to internet explorer of a windows pc set up by it and see if the specific site is specifically blocked by the proxy

356267
switching	screens
login screens gdm to allow user switching and i can confirm that the system takes much longer to boot up to gdm rather than the native xfce version

356279
affinity	irq	cpu	irq	cpu	affinity
irqs have an associated affinity property smp_affinity which defines the cpu cores that are allowed to execute the isr for that irq

356279
affinity	irq
the interrupt affinity value for a particular irq number is stored in the associated proc irq irq_number smp_affinity file which can be viewed and modified by the root user

356279
cpu	irq
in your case the value for smp_affinity is 2 means that the irq can be serviced on the cpu 1 2nd core

356288
ubuntu	debian
finally pam copied ubuntu s idea of etc update-motd.d and therefore debian and others also have that behaviour

356290
ubuntu	linux
is it possible to do this on a regular linux distribution eg ubuntu

356293
tunnel	vpn
what i want is that when a request to an ip in 192.168.0.0 24 comes in through in0 i want to route it to the vpn tunnel and not to my gateway 192.168.25.1

356373
bash	zsh
ksh93 and bash have a -n option similar to zsh s -k but they don t support the nul characters and the bash one is buggy

356395
tar	gunzip
it also works with cp mv dd tar gzip gunzip cat etc

356399
post	get
i am trying to get the source html code from the latest post but.

356454
debian	mint	debian	linux
to test if the os is the problem i have tested linux mint and debian i ve put the ssd in my computer with an i7 3770 where the turbo boost works perfectly fine

356472
stdout	stderr
any process anacron runs it will capture stdout and stderr and email those to the system root account

356491
cpu	hyperthreading
i have an i5-7440hq cpu which doesn t support hyperthreading intel wikipedia and my bios agree on this

356512
put	get
the reason you get home user final is a directory and not home user final their_file is a directory is because the cd is executed in a sub-shell which is what happens when you put it in back-ticks or within

356516
awk	ksh
use printf feature of awk then pipe to ksh

356518
bash	zsh
instead of using bash you could use zsh where that syntax comes from

356518
bash	zsh
you did actually use zsh syntax in your example as in bash you need instead of for the expansion of not to be subject to word splitting and so dependant on

356528
disk	ram
a boot loader must typically first load itself in several stages then locate the kernel on the disk load it into a predefined location in ram and finally start the kernel

356532
free	malloc
i know that if a process does a malloc but doesn t actually write on this memory linux consider that this memory is free and can be used by other processes overcommit

356544
post	get
you will find that that blog post outlines how to get started

356549
ubuntu	centos
i installed kvm in ubuntu 16.04 and made a centos 6.8 vm on it using virtual machine manager

356589
vmware	virtualbox
i have a acer r11 x86 chrome-book that has a kernel issue with running virtualbox and vmware yes i installed kernel headers they are incompatible with my kernel and virtualbox

356616
stdout	stderr
i don t mind stderr and stdout both going to the same log

356648
daemons	systemd
which is based on the provided systemd service for running as a daemons and writing to a file i can t run it directly as a daemons using -d and -p and pipe the output

356665
jobs	cron
it turns out rvm which is how i m using ruby has specific instructions for handling cron jobs

356686
bash	zsh
there doesn t seem to be a way to safely print just a hyphen via the echo builtin for example without knowing if you re in zsh or bash

356718
filesystems	ntfs
if it is ntfs default filesystems

356720
jobs	cron
other shells and things not started from a shell at all cron jobs may have completely different paths

356722
debian	centos
you ll only find coreutils echo out of the box on gnu systems debian trisquel cygwin fedora centos ...

356722
freebsd	aix
freebsd will have freebsd echo most linux-based systems will have busybox echo aix will have aix echo .

356738
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 8.7 jessie

356743
folder	directory
i want to copy all files and folder from one directory to another without changing the permissions of the destination directory

356745
filesystems	xfs
rhel 7 uses xfs as the default filesystems so that may be what you re running

356749
sudo	passwd
but still when i start service using xyz user it asks for sudo passwd

356758
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i am a user of debian based distros - debian ubuntu linux mint

356763
octal	hex
hex escapes vs octal and other tricks are less portable as far as i know

356764
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
it might be a stupid question but how linux mint relate to ubuntu

356764
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
as i see both os use .deb packages but is it possible to install mongodb on linux mint using instructions for ubuntu os

356773
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is very very close to ubuntu

356773
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
mint is made by modifying ubuntu just like ubuntu is made by modifying debian

356773
ubuntu	debian
however ubuntu has diverged considerably for debian the debian repositories are not compatible with ubuntu nor the ubuntu ones with debian

356773
ubuntu	mint
mint on the other hand is very similar to ubuntu

356773
ubuntu	mint
mint can use ubuntu repositories including ppas with no problem

356773
ubuntu	mint
so yes any instructions you find for ubuntu are almost certain to be applicable to mint as well

356784
width	height
the -f option creates a new pane spanning the full window height with -h or full window width with -v instead of splitting the active pane

356785
width	height
the -f option creates a new pane spanning the full window height with -h or full window width with -v instead of splitting the active pane

356787
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
mint is built on top of ubuntu which is built on top of debian

356787
ubuntu	mint
as a ubuntu user what specifically would mint offer me if i was to start using it - what would it give me over ubuntu

356788
bash	zsh
for echo n | wc -l the sh of solaris outputs 2 but bash and zsh in sh emulation mode output 1

356793
jobs	cron
it also means you don t need to configure anything that is expecting things in var www to look for them in home www startup scripts applications that use the webserver cron jobs etc

357797
kde	gnome
but recently i installed kde was running gnome before and suspend started working flawlessly in kde

357820
opera	firefox
one alternative is to install and use firefox as i am not so fond of using exclusively the other alternatives opera and others for freebsd

357820
freebsd	linux
whilst in the past freebsd had only a firefox linux package nowadays there is a native firefox package

357829
unix	solaris
this feature was later integrated in at t svr4 unix solaris and borrowed by bsds and linux

357840
versioning	upgrade
i have tried creating these scripts the install goes well however once the application versioning is bumped and say i try to upgrade to apx v2.0 nothing goes well

357854
hash	whirlpool
the hash are the first few lines sha1 sha256 sha512 ripemd160 whirlpool

357867
rpm	yum
red hat pointed out that usr local lib should not be on the default search path as any library added there could be picked up by rpm and yum

357867
rpm	yum
if you install your own version of a system library in usr local lib then it could satisfy a dependency of another system package you install normally via rpm or yum

357874
ubuntu	debian
an ubuntu package should work on debian too

357874
ubuntu	debian
in fact an ubuntu package will work on debian just as well as ubuntu

357874
ubuntu	debian
what could make it not work is if the package requires a different set of library versions from what debian offers in which case the package would only work with a specific ubuntu release and not with other ubuntu releases of a similar vintage to the debian release

357876
debian	linux
if you like to have the latest version of software even when you don t need it then you should install a rolling release distribution such as debian unstable or arch linux

357876
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
distributions with coherent releases such as ubuntu mint or debian stable are for people who don t want to break their system every week

357892
min	max
rtt min avg max mdev 0.861 1.274 1.688 0.415 ms

rtt min avg max mdev 0.589 0.739 0.889 0.150 ms

357929
packets	multicast
correction it rejects those packets which their destination mac address is not equal to its mac address or multicast or any additional addresses in its filter

357932
bash	zsh
with a typical shell ksh bash or zsh you need to quote the following characters in at least some circumstances

357932
bash	zsh
â â even in the middle of a word ksh extended globs also available in bash and zsh

357944
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu also have packages called gnome-screenshot

357970
disk	ram
is there any reason why i shouldn t use any of the directories as a ram disk

357978
udp	tcp
tcp and udp ports used by apple software products

357980
ubuntu	centos
i have been trying to add a second os ubuntu 16.04.2 actually i have installed centos 7 as primary os

357987
subnet	packets
in the early says of ethernet hubs not switches sent packets are available to all hosts on the subnet but hosts that are not the intended recipient are supposed to ignore

357987
subnet	packets
obviously it didn t take long for subnet to saturate so switch technology was born to solve the problems and one of the things they did was make the network switch only route packets destined for that host to that port plus andy broadcast traffic

358007
spaces	delimiter
the xargs utility reads spaces tab newline and end-of-file delimiter strings from the standard input

358008
put	get
then we put together the old the new to get the line we want to send over to xargs which will then invoke mv with the right arguments to effect the rename

358013
for-loop	loops
for one this is not a for-loop that you are using rather a while loops

358022
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr excluding stdout s final result

358022
stdout	stderr
as i understand as a newbie with this command we get no stderr and no stdout besides the stdout s final result which in this case is the file we searched for if it was found

358042
stdout	stderr
these file descriptors are available as streams stdin stdout and stderr

358042
stdout	stderr
and you can do that independently for stdout and stderr

358065
move	drag
drag and drop worked however i had no chance just to copy it always move

358086
stdout	stderr
there are two standard output streams in unix standard output stdout file-descriptor 1 and standard error stderr file-descriptor 2

358086
stdout	stderr
to redirect stderr to wherever stdout is going use

358086
stdout	stderr
to redirect stdout to wherever stderr is going use

358142
sudoers	visudo
if you manage sudo with visudo whether it is via pam or just local sudoers file then you use groupname

358146
debian	linux
pretty_name debian gnu linux 8 jessie

358146
debian	linux
name debian gnu linux

358149
ubuntu	debian
i know for sure this applies to ubuntu so i assume it also applies to debian

358149
postgresql	mysql
serious databases with serious content do rely on timestamps mysql postgresql mariadb

358152
folder	directory
if there are only 2 folder abc and def in the current directory executing the command

358158
ubuntu	debian
i know for sure this applies to ubuntu so i assume it also applies to debian

358158
postgresql	mysql
serious databases do rely on timestamps mysql postgresql mariadb

358186
fflush	gets
it appears that in this case since uniq is not writing to a terminal it doesn t bother to fflush its standard output until the output buffer gets full

358202
tunnel	vpn
is it possible to tunnel all traffic from the other machine through to the machine connected to vpn

358217
bash	zsh
in ksh and also bash zsh mksh you can use

358228
chown	chgrp
but changing the ownership user group of files and directories with the commands chown chgrp is only allowed to root

358261
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
msdosfs ntfs fat filesystems do not support linux unix ownership and permission attributes

358298
chown	chgrp
in addition root can chown and chgrp and furthermore the owner can chgrp as long as the owner is a member of the target group

358361
rpm	yum
yum deplist myrpm says that myrpm requires that release and it s satisfied by that rpm which is in my repository

358366
centos	linux
now i have met strange problem in linux centos 7

358371
vim	gedit
when i type text using the keyboard in a text editor gedit vim or a command prompt what is the encoding being sent by the keyboard to the application

358381
bluetooth	usb
full instructions to get it bluetooth usb to work on ubuntu 14.04

358389
vpn	lan
when lan clients are set to use 192.168.1.5 as their gateway they are on the vpn as intended

358395
filesystems	hfs
now afaik the standard filesystems of osx is was hfs which saves the case of a file that is created or renamed but is case-insensitive in operation it s case- preserving but case- insensitive

358407
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
so it looks like case sensitivity is the norm but it is possible to support a non-compliant case-insensitive file system and still call your product unix as long as it can also support case-sensitive file systems

358442
rpm	dnf
apparently it is no longer possible to install via dnf and i cannot get rpm to work for anything rpm -l shows nothing despite having enabled both free and nonfree repositories

358443
opensuse	linux
i don t know arch linux but let me share what worked for me using opensuse leap 42.2 with gnome 3.20

358443
ubuntu	debian
curiously it seems that those same instructions apply to ubuntu and debian

358450
udp	tcp
i found the issue was with the tcp switch and found out that the backup server had been rebuilt and they didnt bind the ports so all nfs connections were defaulting to udp as mountd had picked up a blocked port

358472
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian

358474
gentoo	freebsd
after losing my beloved 5+ year gentoo install to a hardware failure i ve gone to freebsd

358505
profiling	benchmarking
note that profiling benchmarking are affected by system load and other limiting factors so youâ d need to repeat this a large number of times to get a true picture of which version is faster than the other

358512
hash	md5
rsync checks md5 hash of file

358514
debian	linux
system debian linux version 8 jessie

358532
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade your kernel versioning then install the apropriate linux-headers package

358536
put	get
and so on for other folders also.how can i get the desired out put

358579
rpm	yum
i thought yum localinstall would work but it first attempts to load the rpm from it s repos before using the rpms in the directory leading to a failure due to the lack of connectivity

358590
daemons	systemd
i m working on setting up a linux server that will have dozens of daemons controlled by systemd

358590
daemons	systemd
the daemons are grouped into targets so that they can be brought up and down in groups but the systemd administrators can manually control individual services

358605
width	height
video codec width height fps keyframe distance gop and bitrate

358605
rtsp	rtmp	rtsp	sdp	rtp	rtmp	rtp	sdp	rtp	rtsp
any code created should also be input neutral and support rtsp rtmp mpeg-ts rtp sdp hls and a looping file

358624
hide	show
for instance i would like to be able to run different scripts that would color what i m currently seeing in different ways or to show hide certain lines in the file

358630
udp	tcp
how to drop inbound un-encrypted tcp udp connections using packet inspection and not a specific port or protocol such as 22 ssh or 443 https using iptables or nftables

358638
debian	linux
i m not sure which debian version you re running linux 4.4 isn t in a released debian version but running lsb_release -a or cat etc debian_version will tell you

358644
bash	zsh
the zsh and ksh93 packaged in debian go with bash on this

358675
bash	zsh
alternatively in ksh bash or zsh you can use recursive globbing instead of calling find

358678
filesystems	btrfs
for a btrfs filesystems use btrfs filesystems label

358689
sudo	passwd
sudo nano usr local etc ssl certs tails.boum.org-ca.pem you will need to set up administration passwd before

358694
centos	linux
centos linux release 7.2.1511 core

358710
stdout	stderr
stdout file descriptorâ 1 and stderr file descriptorâ 2 .â

358710
stdout	stderr
to stdout and stderr file descriptorsâ 1 andâ 2 .â

358710
stdout	stderr
can we have more file descriptors other than the usual stdin stdout stderr 0 1 2 ones

358711
put	get
where should i put my bash script and how can i get values as ip username from where request comes

358752
sudo	passwd
you re mixing sudo which allows running commands as another user and is highly configurable you can selectively specify which user can run which command as which user and su which switches to another user if you know the passwd or are root

358752
sudo	passwd
as sudo is configurable you can control who can use this command and if he she needs to enter a passwd to run it

358752
sudoers	visudo
you need to edit etc sudoers using visudo to do this

358752
sudoers	visudo
be careful when editing etc sudoers and always use visudo to do it

358778
disk	ram
i want to use it on a laptop computer for root and home file system and storage space and data safety recoverability after power loss or other random inconsistencies very low risk of corruption due to low ram etc. is more important than disk performance

358795
debian	linux
also for what it is worth i am using kali linux a debian distribution

358804
bash	zsh
i can use bash on xterm or zsh on gnome-terminal or bash over an ssh connection or.

358813
disk	ram
also its a trade between ram and disk and on a budget system you have neither so you will gain not much

358850
bash	subshell
are there more ways either explicitly or implicitly in which one creates subshell in bash

358853
post	get
i have tried other relevant post here and on other communities but could not exactly get what i want

358871
debian	linux
how can you genarate such otps by yubikey neo in linux debian 8.7

358874
freebsd	linux
as a standard desktop i use mate on all my computers with different gnu linux distributions and freebsd

358874
freebsd	debian
i have the first style solid background in all my systems using an older mate version freebsd debian 7

358874
versioning	upgrade
i have tried to switch the style back after the upgrade to the new mate versioning but i cannot find any options related to the backgrounds of the elements i have indicated above selected workspace selected window selected menu item

358881
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i tried to do the same in linux mint 18.1 which is based on ubuntu 16.04 by installing autokey and mapping the same shortcut to

358908
dpkg	apt
most dpkg apt commands you try to use are probably trying to configure the currently unconfigured packages on your system this is why you hit always this bad or buggy configuration script

358922
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
it s also possible to do something similar at the filesystems level using btrfs but here s what you can do with lvm

358923
centos	linux
i program in c++ and run it on linux centos 7

358938
debian	linux
host gnu linux debian 9 stretch testing

358941
pop-up	dialog
do not click format in the dialog box that pop-up

359004
daemons	systemd
so if a vulnerability in the daemons is exploited the daemons is not running as root with full power over the systemd

359006
openbsd	solaris
solaris will give the first general purpose user uid 100 on openbsd it s 1000 and on macos it appears it s uid 501 that will be the uid for the first created interactive user which is also likely a macos admin user

359006
daemons	systemd
the accounts with lower numbers are systemd user accounts for daemons etc

359006
openbsd	freebsd
on some unices a range of the system service accounts may be allocated to third-party software such as uids 50 to 999 on freebsd or 500 to 999 on openbsd

359006
openbsd	solaris
most unices reserve uid 0 for root the super-user and assigns the highest possible uid or at least some high value to the user nobody solaris uses uid 60001 openbsd uses 32768 but uids may be much larger than that

359033
post	get
that should do but post if you get any error output when running the mount command

359051
kde	kubuntu
there are dated forum threads that mentioned system requirements for kde on ubuntu forums in 2009 and kubuntu forums in 2014 however these are either unofficial or uncertain

359058
kde	kubuntu
after some digging i found that kubuntu 16.04 which had kde plasma 5.5 as desktop required 1 gb ram 10 gb hard drive and a 1 ghz processor

359103
bash	zsh
if the files were not in the same directory you d need to either use the double-star zsh - enabled by default or ksh with set -o globstar or bash with shopt -s globstar

359118
filesystems	ntfs
i m creating a 4tb ntfs filesystems on a drive that will be installed into and stay in a windows 7 or 8.1 machine later on

359118
filesystems	ntfs
so i m wondering if there s any potential downsides to initially creating the ntfs filesystems on a linux box with mkfs.ntfs

359120
folder	directory
or you have all the original documents in one folder pass that folder path to the macro and then iterate the directory listing there are examples as well

359126
freebsd	linux
first off there are several similar questions here usb drive permissions when automounting but they are linux based which means they use udev while freebsd uses devd

359142
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i had this same issue on mint 18 but the solution i found can probably be applied to ubuntu 15 16 as well as similar linux distributions

359149
rsa	dsa
if the certs are for different key types rsa dsa ec and the client offers only ciphersuites that use one key type java server will use the cert for that key type

359151
gentoo	ubuntu
see this gentoo wiki page or that ubuntu documentation one

359166
freebsd	solaris	unix	solaris
unlike many other unix and unix like oses file system standards freebsd and solaris the fhs fails for some reason to define net as a generic mount point for automounted nfs shares

359166
daemons	systemd
mnt is defined to hold file systemd temporarily mounted here by the administrator which doesn t exactly match file systemd automatically mounted by a daemons

359221
debian	linux
apt the package manager is a linux tool from debian gnu linux

359221
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
there are projects like homebrew macports and fink that provides packaged third-party software for macos

359232
debian	linux
i tried to search like crazy for a tutorial on how to fix grub in a dm crypted device i only found 1 tutorial about arch linux and the commands described didn t work on debian

359232
ubuntu	debian
i m trying to abandon ubuntu in favor of debian however i find it really hard to setup a full encrypted device except boot partition

359236
kde	gnome
i tried gnome kde and i3

359236
daemons	systemd
this is a message that will show up occasionally through a systemd tray notification it does not use my notification daemons

359247
debian	mint
on debian derivatives including mint itâ s disabled

359252
debian	linux
i ve been trying to install some programs in debian and it s my first time using linux so i m having some trouble

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
find apache access.log file location on debian ubuntu linux

359267
sudo	passwd
i broke zsh passing this passwd to sudo on stdin

359267
sudo	passwd
so here s what s wrong i use sudo with the targetpw flag meaning that the passwd asked by sudo is the passwd of the target user not mine

359267
sudo	passwd
invoking sudo command now asks as wanted my gnupg key passphrase to decrypt the root passwd and with sudo --shell i properly get a root shell

359268
sudo	passwd
pass printed the passwd and sudo read it and started a shell

359268
sudo	passwd
subsequent executions within the sudo timeout window didn t require authentication and so the shell received the passwd itself and tried to execute it as a command giving that error

359268
sudo	passwd
you could set an alias up that ran pass root_password | sudo --stdin true if you wanted and then rely on the timeout to run commands without a passwd

359268
sudo	passwd
it would provide the passwd via pass when asked for it by sudo

359296
mouse	keyboard
the mouse or keyboard commands

359300
filesystems	btrfs
a few days ago my btrfs raid56 filesystems was suddenly mounted read-only

359309
udp	tcp
or a pseudo terminal a socket unix ip4 ip6 - raw udp tcp an ssl socket proxy connect connection a file descriptor stdin etc. the gnu line editor readline a program or a combination of two of these

359317
debian	linux
my debian systems and probably most other linux distributions have several choices available directly through the package manager

359318
debian	linux
if you want to run natively in linux basic you have several packages in debian to choose from

359318
rmdir	mkdir	rmdir	chdir	mkdir	chdir
bwbasic s implementation of the rmdir chdir mkdir name kill environ and environ commands and functions offer further shell-processing capabilities

359322
chown	chmod
i ve also tried chmod 777 as well as chmod o+x as well as chown to nobody nobody and back again to root root

359323
unix	bsd
or does the unix format has its own set of flags while the bsd format has an entirely different set of flags

359333

i skimmed through the manpage for the ps command to see which flags are for the unix flags format and which flags are for the bsd flags format but i did not find anything

unix	bsd
edit this is not a duplicate in the other question i am asking if the flags are different for unix and bsd flags format while in this question i am asking what are the flags for the unix flags format and what are the flags for the bsd flags format

359336
freebsd	netbsd	unix	bsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
since there obviously is some confusion around the unix options and the bsd options for ps and since none of openbsd netbsd freebsd and macos even lists the bsd options dash-less flags in their manuals for ps maybe it s better to forget about them and see them as part of a closed chapter in unix s history

disk	ram
so i thought i might reserve some of the ram say 0.5g for a ram disk and use that as a swap file saving writes to the ssd

360658
disk	ram
in your case where you have a tremendous amount of ram but costly hard disk with zero seek time swap fragmentation is not an issue thus maybe also lesser would be enough

360658

in my opinion this have at least 512m swap advice is bad the amount of swap you use have to depend on your system parameters disk cost ram amount disk amount hard disk seek time etc

i d prefer every folder to have their own sha1result file but one at the base directory is fine

361054
sudo	passwd
you can have sudo ask for the target user s passwd rather than the calling user

361054
sudo	passwd
then user git will have to type the passwd of user www when he runs sudo -u www .

361125
ubuntu	linux
however when ubuntu boots it brings me to a menu asking if i want to try linux which i m currently on typing this question or to install linux

361125

so my question is how can i install ubuntu on this drive in a way that doesn t erase anything from my harddrive windows and my files such that i can bring this usb with me as a portable linux with all the associated files that i save on-the-go

i want it user-configurable so that a user can add a cron job by running list jobs by my_script list and remove by my_script remove job_number where the job number is listed in the output of my_script list command

363376
jobs	cron
so what is the proper way to handle the cron jobs

363383
dnf	yum
it might be possible to do an in-place upgrade using yum and dnf and a lot of work â but i m quite sure this will be more work than reinstalling

363421
wan	lan
the firewall has ethernet nics for lan eth0 and wan eth1

363421
tunnel	lan
so far i have not succeeded in a round trip connection from a lan client through the tunnel

363421
vpn	lan
in my research i ve found an excellent overview of a split-tunnel vpn under linux at but its policy routing is based on a user id and does not cover the additional functionality required of a lan gateway

363421
traceroute	packets
traceroute 4.2.2.2 from the gateway shows that packets are still going out the normal isp path through eth1 so the policy routing for the output chain-based marking may not be working

363421
tunnel	traceroute
which implies either a ping or traceroute appears to be successfully routed through the tunnel

363427
debian	mint
or even install several versions i always end up with several installed for some reason on debian not on mint but that shouldn t matter it s the same package manager in addition to a few cross-compilation ones

363436
bash	zsh
in a shell with process substitution ksh bash zsh

363439
filesystems	ntfs
note that you are not mounting an ntfs filesystems on home it s already mounted on mnt store hd2

363439
filesystems	ntfs
rather than put your home directory on an ntfs filesystems i recommend keeping it on a linux filesystems

363446
jobs	cron
this is how most linux distributions manage system cron jobs that can be installed by individual packages

363446
debian	linux
debian fedora arch linux and others ship a tool called run-parts whose job is to run the scripts in a particular directory one by one

363448
jobs	cron
your current cron implementation probably supports etc cron.d where jobs have an additional run as user specified after the regular time fields and before the command

363453
filtering	grouping
you can list all processes in a given grouping by filtering the output of ps

363472
stdout	stderr
despite redirection of stdout to file1 instead of dev tty0 the error about file does not exist will display on dev tty0 through stderr file descriptor

363472
stdout	stderr
if stderr writes to dev tty0 similar to stdout what is the purpose of stderr

363474
stdout	stderr
we need stderr file descriptor 2 to separate the output stream stdout file descriptor 1 from the error stream

363474
stdout	stderr
just an an example to send stdout to a file and stderr to a different file

363527
int	chars
a program may fetch the value which is always a chars string corresponding to a key the name of the environment variable but will then have to convert it to an int or whatever data type the language expects the value to have

363550
children	parent
they are typically inherited by children processes created by a fork exec sequence children processes get their own copy of the parent variables

363569
int	chars
logical int numeric complex chars raw or factor

363589
opera	firefox
opera takes about two seconds but firefox takes about 20

363599
vmware	esx
now what is interesting is that on vmware esx which uses busybox ash as the shell things work as expected that is the control character is not echoed literally but rather accepted as a control character and interpreted along with the remaining characters once the foreground process is done

363622
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
i have made a simple addition program in c in both os linux ubuntu and centos and windows 7 with the same source code which is as follows

363622
ubuntu	centos
in windows it runs when i double-click on addition.exe but in ubuntu also in centos when i click on the executable file addition nothing happens

363627
ubuntu	centos
i don t know about centos but as far as ubuntu goes it s the requirement that .desktop applications must be made executable also if they are located in any directory under user s home directory

363642
jobs	cron
that will be a whole lot easier to maintain than a number of cron jobs

363649
put	get
and then get the out put to a output new file

363652
asterisk	pbx
not sure whether it s what you re looking for but there is asterisk an open-source software implementation of a telephone pbx

363677
single-quotes	double-quotes
the first rule changes doubled single-quotes to double-quotes

363695
youtube	vimeo
i download files from the internet youtube vimeo etc. or transcode stuff from my fm radio

363696
post	get
i can not post i get python-errors and the relevant output is in german

363705
google-chrome	firefox
after much research i believe the problem is that most recently both google-chrome 58 and firefox 48 now require that certificates specify the hostname s to which they apply in the subjectaltname field

363705
google-chrome	firefox
now your certificate will have a subjectaltname and google-chrome and firefox will be happy

363725
put	get
where as if i put ls -ll i get this

363728
jobs	cron
i ve successfully migrated a few of my cron jobs over to systemd

363748
put	get
after you select that and press done you will get a dialog from which you can select the partition you created to put fedora on

363757
apache	nginx
e.g - when server goes down i want to ssh in it then check load free -m last 10 mins apache nginx logs exim logs mysql slow query logs and many more

363768
ssl	https
add this to apache config and you will have redirect of all web sites which do nto use https to ssl tls

363788
stdout	stderr
my goal is to have the function that can preface a command and will pass the stdout and stderr of the command to dated logfiles

363792
bash	zsh
this will use the brace expansion of bash originally a zsh feature also available in ksh93 to generate numbers between 1 and 251 and for each number the printf will print an ip address with the number inserted at the end

363792
bash	zsh
on the command-line we feed in as a here-string originally a feature of zsh but also available in bash and ksh93

363805
ubuntu	debian
the problem is now in fedora it doesn0t work in debian 8 worked thought it could have been that the file got damaged while changing os since it s the only .xml with the problem so sent it to a friend that has ubuntu and no problem there either

363815
jobs	cron
this can be used with various cron jobs can send me data with subject lines indicating the content

363819
debian	linux
os linux debian 8

363852
proftpd	pureftpd
just noticed i had the same problem with proftpd i thought it would work better with pureftpd but no

363853
stdout	stderr
because it s piped into another command i have no stdout or stderr to see which file it s hashing atm

363866
freebsd	solaris
that trick works with the strftime of gnu freebsd and solaris but i don t know how portable it is outside of that

363871
mouse	trackpad
i cannot zoom with or without mouse or with the trackpad

363887
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu users

363891
vim	emacs
should i install bash or is it possible to have vim line editing mode rather than emacs natively without having to install other shells

363906
stdout	stderr
how can i send all stdout and stderr to dev null since i don t want my screen to get messy

363909
sudo	passwd
sudo have option -g that do same by user passwd

363911
ash	tcsh
the tcsh shell is available in the freebsd base system as is sh which on freebsd is ash the almquist shell

363913
pulseaudio	mixer
if you are running pulseaudio anyway i d advise to leave the the mixer controls alone unless something is not working and use pavucontrol to set the volume

363922
ubuntu	freebsd
works on ubuntu and freebsd as well

363934
centos	linux
centos gnu linux 2.6.32-642.15.1.el6.x86_64

363937
pulseaudio	dbus
before i roll my own which i suspect would require me to learn more about dbus and pulseaudio than i care to what are my options

363945
udp	tcp
as wol packets can be udp tcp whatever yes even tcp but probably useless i have to check every incomming packets for the wol specific pattern

363965
ubuntu	linux
i m a bit new to linux running ubuntu 14.04 - using it about a year and i ve recently started having issues with apt-get

363970
ubuntu	linux
those are the manuals i can think of on ubuntu linux that best fits your description

363973
debian	linux
debian version debian gnu linux 8 n l

363991
solaris	bsd
i have no idea of the internals of say linux bsd solaris or whatever and i wouldn t dare assume any similarities or differences between them

364012
bash	zsh
later the feature was added to zsh from the start 1990 and bash in 1993

364012
bash	zsh
zsh was using temporary named pipes to implement it while bash was using where available and named pipes otherwise

364012
bash	zsh
so if you have a script that uses you should use a shell that supports the feature to interpret it like zsh bash or at t ksh of course you need to make sure the rest of the syntax of script is also compatible with that shell

364019
filesystems	btrfs
i have a btrfs filesystems for which the output of btrfs fi usage mnt is

364037
daemons	launchd
they re invoked automatically by a daemons launchd which is running with administrative privileges

364037
daemons	systemd
daemons launchers my terminology for the purpose of this answer include systemd start-stop-daemon runuser etc

364090
png	ico
i want to convert those png images to multi layered ico files at once

364103
daemons	launchd
this means that it is launchd via your session s dbus daemons and then provides a common dbus interface for such activatable programs to specify the files to open

364116
octal	hex
are to be considered a numeric string if their value happens to be numerical allowing leading and trailing blanks with variations between implementations in support for hex octal inf nan...

364116
memcmp	strcmp
prints yes but that s because it s doing a lexical comparison depending on the implementation using memcmp strcmp or strcollate of 3.14 and the conversion to a string via the convfmt format string .6g in gawk and many other implementations of that 3.14 number

364156
bash	zsh
i can only use bash for the project this is a part of so even if zsh or some other powerful shell can get around it that won t be a viable solution for me

364159
folder	directory
i am trying to go through all of the users in the user folder and print out how many files they each have in their home directory

364166
stdout	stderr
but this just put stdout and stderr in tmp stdboth_file and never wrote to tmp stderr_file

364176
bash	zsh
zsh has it in bash in though provided the redirection into stderr+stdout.log didn t fail

364176
bash	zsh
something similar and with the same caveat can be done with process substitution in bash zsh and ksh93

364195
stdout	stderr
i have several processes that are producing output on stdout and stderr which i have redirected to numbered file descriptors and i want to collate all the output together into a single file

364202
stdout	stderr
you need to add stderr and stdout into stdout in each process

364202
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr would be redirected via the pipe as the stdin for processb

364202
stdout	stderr
so if you need stdout and stderr of processb as stdin for processc it would be

364234
tunnel	vpn
it does however obliges you to have a direct connection to your server be it with vpn or ssh tunnel

364245
postgresql	mysql
note that if you re running packages that manage their own data for example a database like mysql or postgresql a mail server a web or ftp server etc. that data may be stored in var or srv

364264
ethernet	wireless
instead of entering in a pin somewhere the configuration is done over an ethernet cable until pairing is complete then they will work wireless

364326
ramdisk	umount
umount the ramdisk

364326
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout stderr to the new dev console and exec the new init

364332
mouse	keyboard
and wayland doesn t seem to re-enable dpms when it detects mouse or keyboard inputs so it stays off

364332
mouse	keyboard
as i said try grabbing the mouse and keyboard inputs with evtest --grab dev input eventx use just evtest to see which device is which

364333
apache	nginx
on fedora 24 a web server node.js is running standalone no apache nginx on port 5000

364374
mouse	keyboard
the linux kernel drivers for such device the 8042 ps 2 keyboard mouse driver see drivers input serio then reserve the ports they need request_region on init i8042_platform_init in i8042-io.h release them on exit and to port i o inb outb etc. to communicate with it

364374
post	put
if you can t make sense of the dmesg output put it in a pastebin and post a link

364387
versioning	upgrade
the server is running centos 6.5 and the upgrade was done by following this tutorial newer versioning of centos but that shouldn t make a difference right

364413
freebsd	procfs
procfs is also available in freebsd but from the man page it seems that fd is not implemented

364413
freebsd	linux	freebsd	procfs
procfs is usully only used in freebsd for linux compability

364413
freebsd	procfs
the native replacement of procfs on freebsd is procstat which you can use with the -f parameter to get the file descriptor

364426
stdout	stderr
it also automatically captures output to stdout and stderr and logs it for you so you don t need to redirect the output to a log file either

364430
sorting	filtering
this gives me the opportunity to do my own spam filtering and mail sorting on my local machine

364433
content-disposition	content-type
if you want your browser to render it as html which is most likely a terrible idea you can change the content-type header the server returns so that it reflects the type of your data which would be and the content-disposition header to suggest the browser what to do

364471
ubuntu	linux
i have connected to a linux server like tacc-lonestar or other redhat ubuntu server

364517
chown	chmod
i am new to unix systems and i understand chmod and chown and how the permission bits work...but now i am learning there is another permission system inside linux the acl with setfacl and getfacl .

364574
bash	zsh
in my case the user had zsh at the top of his .bashrc file so that he could drop into zsh shell instead of bash

364579
ubuntu	centos	vmware	virtualbox
i migrated a ovf from vmware running on centos 7 to a new machine running virtualbox running on ubuntu 17

364592
udp	tcp
i have this situation a piece of software got hardcoded ip address let assume it is being 196.10.10.100 20000 to which it binds a socket and sends tcp and udp traffic to 196.10.10.9 20000 hardcoded too

364592
subnet	packets
there is new server software that expect to accept packets and respond using separate nic for each instance ip addresses allowed to be in arbitrary subnet

364600
ubuntu	debian
that message comes from the gnutls configuration of lynx making it likely that op is using debian or a derived distribution such as ubuntu

364600

364705
ubuntu	centos
i donâ t use centos but use ubuntu full version and minimal version - difference are following minimal version doesnâ t have gui and packages like firefox libreoffice etc

364717
gnu	uclibc
still nowadays some embedded linux sdks use the old linuxthreads implementation because they are using smaller memory footprint version of libc called uclibc also called âµclibc and it took considerable amount of years before the nptl user space implementation from gnu libc was ported and assumed as default posix threading implementation as generally speaking these special platforms do not strive to follow the newest fashions with lightning speed

364726
udp	tcp
is there some quick command or thing i can do to make system basically echo or chargen on a large range tcp or udp ports

364756

the mainstream desktop environments gnome kde would include complete icon theme by default

364809

364842
daemons	systemd
a possible solution to your need may be to have a script that determines the current run-level of the systemd and then uses some if loops to start or stop the httpd daemons based on the target

364919

it doesn t matter if the vpn servers have access to the 192.168.2.0 24 lan but it would be a nice to have

traceroute	packets
also what traceroute does is send packets with increasing ttl so the decrease is shown implicitly in the output so if the route had some part where the ttl would decrease by more than one or a router would not send the icmp error it would show up as an empty line

365145
traceroute	packets
here the router at hop #2 didn t answer so traceroute got replies for packets with ttl 1 and ttl 3 but not for the one with ttl 2

you re more likely to find such advanced features either built into fish or provided in zsh through some customization code either shipped with zsh or through a third-party plugin

filesystems	xfs
why is xfs recommended for larger filesystems

365373

welp i can t do anything b c once i manage to boot my live os from either my flash drive or external hdd my keyboard and mouse no longer respond

365783
mouse	keyboard
either way now i just cannot interact with these os s without a keyboard or mouse even though i can see their swell-looking desktops

365809
debian	linux
i ve been wondering how a linux pc debian is restarted

365816
folder	directory
the d letter means it s a directory a folder if you prefer that name

365838
filesystems	xfs
i found out that linux kernel since version 3.15 supports the necessary system call to enable fallocate 1 â s --collapse-range option which essentially allows you to delete bytes from a file in place starting from anywhere at least on ext4 and xfs filesystems

365875
sudo	passwd
wondering why sudo via a console works while it prompts for a passwd over ssh

365875
sudoers	passwd
alternatively one can allow one specific user to use empty passwd by means of a nopasswd sudoers file as described by slm

365910
centos	linux
how to use the linux auditing system on centos 7 states that

365954
ubuntu	linux
on the ubuntu linux system that i have access to neither manual mentions sw as a mount option for swap for some reason

365985
x86	mips	x86	64bit
x86 arm mips 64bit

366008
octal	hex	octal	decimal
may be specified in decimal hex or octal and can be determined

366012
folder	directory
so if you want to change directory cd into the folder var log and then list ls its files you could append in your .bash_profile file the following

366024
gentoo	linux
if my distribution is somehow relevant it is gentoo linux

366033
openbsd	freebsd
other shells such as dash or ash which serves as sh on freebsd and pdksh which is sh and ksh on openbsd does not have a read that has this option

366037
filesystems	fat
the first format to fat cleared the superblock but all the files and directories were still there just non-available because they are not referenced anymore in the filesystems

366037
filesystems	fat
mke2fs -n displayed the location of the backup superblock for the ext4 filesystems which was the filesystems you had before formatting to fat

366037
filesystems	fat
how formatting say ext4 to fat clear the superblock but not the other parts of a filesystems like inodes

366057
wav	flac	wav	aiff	wav	ogg	flac	aiff	flac	ogg	aiff	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
it can read and write many audio formats including au wav aiff mp3 via an external lame mp3 encoder ogg vorbis and flac

366067
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
a friend who unfortunately knows less about linux than me told me of his problem to install even basic packages on another debian distro though this seems odd since i heard that the repository of debian is far more bigger than that from ubuntu

366073
centos	linux
try this any linux but tested on centos 7.3

366109
stdout	stderr
a shell in linux for example bash have its stdin and stdout and stderr file descriptors all point to the same device file for example the following are the stdin and stdout and stderr file descriptors for bash

366109
stdout	stderr
what i mean is when bash reads from dev tty1 stdin and when bash writes to dev tty1 stdout or stderr is it reading from and writing to the same file or does dev tty1 points to two files one is used when reading from dev tty1 and the other is used when writing to dev tty1

366165
sudo	passwd
in this loop sudo only asks my passwd the first time or if the balance took a lot of time

366171
rpm	yum
in my case i had a rpm db lock that was getting the yum stuck

366175
bash	zsh
att ksh bash and zsh each have a dynamic module loading system that allows loading additional code into an existing shell instance and the dynamically loaded code can implement new builtins

366194
sudo	passwd
mostly installing and updating and also mounting removable drives. i even created an alias so i wouldn t have to type sudo each time i install an update but i still have to enter my passwd every update which on arch linux are fairly frequent and i have to use a different command if i m just looking up packages

366197
sudo	passwd
even if the installer for the distribution you chose begins by having you set a root passwd as long as some user account is able to use sudo the root account can later be locked with

366197
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and many of its derivatives actually disable the root account by default so this practice is not uncommon in the linux world

366209
versioning	upgrade
apt-get upgrade upgrade the programs if the package versioning of the new program does not match the current installed versioning

366228
stdout	stderr
this may be useful for logging or filtering purposes where you don t want to see stdout of commands but only stderr

366242
bash	zsh
i m used to using tab completion in bash to get apt list --upgradable by typing apt l tab --u tab but i can t do the same thing with zsh --u doesn t expand to --upgradable when i press tab

366255
sudoers	passwd
i have set up etc sudoers so that i can run these commands without passwd

366258
bash	zsh
in ksh bash and zsh you can instruct the shell to make a pipeline exit with a nonzero status if any component of the pipeline exits with a nonzero status

366258
bash	zsh
in mksh bash and zsh you can get the status of every component of the pipeline using the variable pipestatus bash mksh or pipestatus zsh which is an array containing the status of all the commands in the last pipeline a generalization of

366266
screens	tablet
right now if i draw with my stylus on the tablet a small area in the upper left corner of my screens will drag my pointer across the entire screens we re talking roughly a 1x1 inch area is being translated to the entire 22inch screens area

366267
filesystems	hfs+
creation although not one of the original file properties included in unix this one is available on many filesystems today including most pertinently to macos hfs+ and the modern versions of tools like ls and stat know how to access it ls -u stat uses b documented in the manpages

366289
postfix	dovecot
i want to put my own mail server on vps using postfix dovecot lmtp and postgresql database

366324
wan	lan
i have the wan interface set to nat in virtualbox and i m trying to figure out the best way to setup the lan interface so both my host and another guest can access it

366329
hash	md5
usually i use md5 or sha1 hash to verify the data is intact by re-reading both the source and the destination

366339
bash	zsh
i d prefer a zsh or bash solution though i m open to others too

366348
children	parent
is there an option to pause or stop the parent process and all its children rather than kill it outright

366378
lseek	posix
they canâ t be detected using standard userspace apis at least not yet â as pointed out by stã phane chazelas at least solaris and linux support the seek_data and seek_hole lseek 2 flags which allow userspace programs to find holes and these flags might be added to posix at some point

366378
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
support is filesystems dependent â only xfs btrfs ext4 and tmpfs currently support these operations

366411
debian	centos
no luck building compiling ted with debian 8 jessie libtiff errors lots but a package built on centos 7 works perfect with the default debian 8 libtiff5

366436
ethernet	wireless
for example if i plug another computer into the ethernet and it gets assigned an address of say 10.0.2.27 i can t ping form a device connected to my wireless that has an address like 10.0.1.10

366444
bash	zsh
with brace expansion you may also do in ksh93 and zsh but not in bash

366449
ansible	puppet
this makes it easier to manipulate independent sets of rules especially if some files come from packages or from configuration management software such as puppet or ansible

366451
comm	grep
you can check with ps -o pid ppid pgid comm -c recoll then ps -o pid ppid pgid comm ww | grep -v recoll to see if there are any other processes in the process group

366468
ubuntu	debian
just to add to nils answer if changing the location of the logrotate script on a debian or ubuntu box it s probably safer to use dpkg-divert instead of just copying the file and copying dev null to the original position

366488
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian how do i use dpkg -i to install packages on a computer with no internet

366488
folder	directory
for example if chrome and all of it s dependencies are together in one folder the command wants to install chrome before the dependencies and spits out dependency errors even though the files are right there with chrome in the same directory

366488
folder	directory
in past versions of ubuntu all i would have to do is use the following command on all of files in the same directory and it would install the package and all of it s dependencies if they were there together in the same folder

366500
ubuntu	centos
this exact configuration works on ubuntu 17.04 server but not on centos 7 1611

366500
ubuntu	centos
the only difference i see is that centos 7 is running svn 1.7 and ubuntu is running svn 1.8

366507
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have linux mint 18 the remote machine have ubuntu 16.04

366514
ubuntu	linux
i am using maui linux based on kde neon which is based on ubuntu

366533
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu and similar systems place the following in the

366535
centos	linux
the hanging commands run fine on a random centos linux server

366544
stdout	stderr
is redirecting the output of both file handle 2 stderr and file handle 1 stdout to file handle 5

366545
stdout	stderr
stdout 2 is stderr filedescriptors

366545
stdout	stderr
send stderr and stdout to filehandler 5 i.e network

366580
bash	zsh
if you want them to run with their own variable and option scope as bash doesn t have the equivalent of zsh anonymous functions you d need to define a temporary function

366589
elasticsearch	kibana
but now i want to send my all logs to elk elasticsearch logstash kibana stack by network

366606
debian	linux
i ve set up my linux laptop running pixel for x86 based on debian to have three desktops

366642
bluetooth	usb
so today when i attached my wireless keyboard i discovered that other bluetooth usb adapter which i used to connect with my headphones receive files from phone is not working anymore

366642
mouse	keyboard
unifying receiver which is the receiver for keyboard and mouse

366642
mouse	keyboard
is there a way to get them both working or make the old one to accept keyboard and mouse also because i think the receiver doesn t have functionality for all this file transfer headphones etc.

366645
sudo	passwd
you can run sudo -l to see the permissions that your user has been granted if any of the user specific nopasswd commands appear before any command in the output you will be prompted for your passwd

366664
centos	linux
i am trying to use the alternatives system on centos linux release 7.3.1611 core

366668
bash	zsh
in ksh bash zsh but not in plain sh you can write this in a more compact way

366700
bash	zsh
in zsh where associative arrays were added in 1998 compared to 1993 for ksh93 and 2009 for bash or expands to the non-empty values of the hash to the non-empty keys in the same order and to both keys and values

366700
bash	zsh
also note that zsh uses a much more sensible and useful array definition syntax than ksh93 s copied by bash

366727
clang	llvm
if should matter it s compiled with llvm clang 3.5 on an arm box with ubuntu

366742
filesystems	hfs
but it seems not to be true for solid state disks ssd with particular filesystems on it in my case apple s hfs

366744
ansible	puppet
it sounds like you want a provisioning tool such as ansible saltstack chef or puppet

366803
debian	linux
my system debian gnu linux 9 4.9.0-3-amd64

366809
ubuntu	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux
the most i ve messed with linux is by far the command line and x interface on debian-based distros like ubuntu raspbian...etc

366823
gentoo	linux
if it is somehow relevant i am running gentoo linux as my host os

366826
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux machine ubuntu 16.04 which i want to access using remote desktop

366856
put	get
so i put it under debian jessie got fan control to work get my linux.

366859
freebsd	debian
this question is tightly linked to safe freebsd test on system running debian with zpools

366870
gif	png
i m trying to create a gif animation from a set of transparent png images in various resolutions

366881
ubuntu	linux
i was recently investigating private internet access and i noted that its linux client is listed as requiring ubuntu 12.04 or newer

366881
ubuntu	linux	redhat	fedora
the context to this question is i bought a new laptop that came preinstalled with ubuntu but i was thinking to wipe it and install fedora or redhat to experience the linux installation process first-hand

366886
ubuntu	debian
i am writing ubuntu specific answer it should work on debian as well never used debian

366904
udp	tcp
for example i want to redirect ports from 1-5655 to client 10.8.0.2 tcp + udp and then i want to redirect 5657-5756 5758-65535 both protocols to the same openvpn client

366914
filesystems	btrfs
i recently had problems with a btrfs filesystems on an up-to-date kernel 4.10.0

366914
filesystems	btrfs
after switching to vmware the filesystems was still corrupt and surprisingly btrfs check wasn t able to find and fix the error

366914
filesystems	btrfs
the original cause is probably a broken version of btrfs-convert which i used years ago when i created this volume and still a limited feature set of the current btrfs check which at least should be able to find all damages on a volume which reproducibly lead to a transaction abort or any other problems instead of just saying that my filesystems is healthy

366919
udp	tcp
stream via udp tcp directly to some single destination receiver

366919
wowza	ffserver
ffserver wowza etc can receive from ffmpeg

366950
udp	tcp
note multiport can only be used by specifying the protocol with -p tcp or -p udp

366955
stdout	stderr
if you run this command you ll get two files one called stdout and one called stderr containing the output to stdout and the output to stderr respectively

366971
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade to latest versioning and not current stable versioning you can use

366983
daemons	systemd
if the daemons stops doing that the systemd is

366996
for-loop	loops
ifs splits on by default the space character so your for-loop actually loops over each word

366997
chown	chmod
you change them the normal way chmod chown etc

367012
printf	strncpy
compatibility with other platforms or compatibility with older stuff to avoid overruns while using printf and strncpy

367012
printf	strncpy
portable applications should code to this lower value and use printf or strncpy to avoid buffer overruns when writing into this field

367022
sudo	passwd
anyway i noticed when i try to sudo i m asked for a passwd and when entered it says it s incorrect

367050
bash	subshell
it doesn t really matter how complex the parts of a pipeline are you can often just visualize them as separate scripts if you want especially in shells like bash which will run each part of a pipeline in a subshell anyway

367061
stdout	stderr
i believe duplicity s option is intended for complex pipelines where you want to separate stderr and stdout from your log

367076
for-loop	arrays
at the end we use a for-loop to iterate through the keys of arrays date1 or date2 - keys are the same in both arrays and for every key found we print the key the date 4 and we also print the value sum of all values for the same date divided by value numeric count of the lines found having the same date same

367092
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
lsof doesn t show sctp sockets only tcp and udp

367092
udp	tcp
it only shows the pids for udp and tcp sockets

367112
bash	zsh
using the korn bash zsh ... syntax to mimic the of c

367124
centos	linux
server centos linux release 7.2.1511 core

367134
filesystems	btrfs
the btrfs filesystems uses the terms subvolume root-volume snapshot top-level default subvolume somewhat confusingly to me

367138
ubuntu	linux
there is a non-patched local privilege escalation vulnerability on some linux kernel versions for example cve-2017-7308 on the 4.8.0-41-generic ubuntu kernel

367138
versioning	upgrade
according to the researchers an unknown group of hackers has started hijacking linux pcs just a week after the samba flaw was disclosed publicly and installing an upgrade versioning of cpuminer a cryptocurrency mining software that mines monero digital currency

367148
installation	upgrade
if your samba installation meets the configurations described bellow the fix upgrade should be done asap as there are already exploits other exploit in python and

367158
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
i checked this behavior on a handful of unix systems linux debian freebsd and openindiana to get some diversity so this behavior seems to be at least wide-spread if not standard

367159
spaces	delimiter
so for each line of the inputs paste merges the subsequent sections with a spaces delimiter given by

367176
vim	emacs
is there a way to use the behaviour of vim with emacs

367196
xfce	gnome
i found the problem xfce installed xscreensaver as a dependency and it was automatically started alongside gnome for some reason

367202
cifs	smb
is there a way to make smb 2.0+ the default for all mount -t cifs calls regardless what calls it

367221
post	get
i ve seen multiple blog post of people getting around the u-boot bootdelay 0 environment variable to get to the u-boot cli

367239
centos	linux
i have a text file on linux server centos 7 which include a lot of entries in the following format

367248
centos	linux
i have a text file on linux server centos 7 which include a lot of entries in the following format

367273
ubuntu	debian
just a heads-up that all of the above suggestions do not work for any current debian or ubuntu preseeds

367276
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu dekstop 16.04 on the same pc never copies faster than 45mb per second so it takes basically twice as long to copy the same folder

367281
udp	tcp
additional suggestion is running firewall rules on the actual file sharing host that whitelist only local and eventually vpn network adresses on all smb ports 139 tcp 445 tcp 137 udp and 138 udp

367290
srt	subtitle
the subtitle format i am seeking to display is srt an easy text-based format

367301
filesystems	ntfs
linux systems write to ntfs systems via the fuse subsystem which uses user-mode code to implement the filesystems access code

367303
hash	md5
possibly some kind of checksum md5 hash check

367323
ubuntu	linux
i m a new linux user and when i was installing ubuntu i have created 2 partitions first 50gb for root folder not sure but something like that and second one for usr folder i thought all the user files stored there as seen that programmes are being installed there

367329
ubuntu	linux
i have an arm based computer that seems to work alright running ubuntu linux non gui

367354
put	get
you can use eval which is hard to get right and easy to screw up or indirection like in which case this is a dupe of bash array with variable in the name which sx already put automatically in the related list for you to look at

367385
folder	directory
however i do not have the init file folder in my usr bin directory

367398
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs filesystems show and

367398
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs filesystems df

367398
filesystems	btrfs
it seems that while the second command btrfs filesystems df indicates that most everything of the data single is used the first command btrfs filesystems show seems to tell me that there is still some roughly 13gib space left

367399
versioning	upgrade
may i have to upgrade openssh to a newer versioning that supports multiple entries for authorizedkeysfile i think i have to build it with rpm

367402
dpkg	apt
given that you have a flatpakref file for it on your computer you probably installed it via flatpak rather than apt dpkg

367404
for-loop	loops
another approach would be add comma ahead but instead of for-loop use while loops with counter to simulate c-style for-loop behavior

367420
filesystems	btrfs
assuming that there is enough un-allocated memory on the backing block device s of the btrfs then the metadata part of the filesystems allocates - just as assumed by the op - automatically memory to increase expand the metadata

367420
filesystems	btrfs
the automatic allocation of memory for the devices backing the btrfs filesystems is not anymore possible simply add up the totals of the allocation 38.12g+1.55g+

367420
filesystems	btrfs
since there is however excess free space that was allocated to the data part of the filesystems it can now be usefull necessary to balance the btrfs

367424
vim	emacs
to build upon philippos answer it doesn t make sense to try to configure vim to work like emacs you should set git to use your preferred editor instead

367481
hash	md5
the at the beginning of the password field hints it is a md5 hash

367481
hash	md5
to encrypt a password in a md5 hash you can use the openssl passwd command

367481
hash	md5
so to generate the md5 hash a short bash example

367483
rss	feed
i suppose from the name that it used to point to an rss feed of news from fridge.ubuntu.com

367483
rss	feed
you can change the url either for fridge.ubuntu.com or some rss feed by editing home .xscreensaver

367487
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
in zsh the equivalent of bash s is like in tcsh but zsh has directives to change character attributes so there you d rather do

367489
kde	cinnamon
i d like to use the cinnamon kde desktop environment and have my drive fully encrypted

367489
debian	linux
i used windows 10 before and am not an expert in unix linux debian which i wouldn t consider a necessity for this

367506
mpfr	mpc
unpack gmp mpfr mpc as described in the link and you can configure from build example

367508
ubuntu	debian
please note that giorgio s script also makes use of notify-send so make sure you have the right package installed libnotify-bin on debian and ubuntu or comment remove those lines from the script

367519
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
if you are having this issue try at least booting to ubuntu centos or your prefered linux distro even from a cd and see if it works

367532
rpm	dnf	rpm	yum	dnf	yum
then your rpm yum dnf will be back

367538
hid	keyboard
for an usb keyboard a standard called hid human interface device exist

367539
filesystems	xfs
trying to build firefox and i have weird errors and kernel messages before a silent fail of the compilation process compiling over a xfs filesystems but no fails while compiling over jfs in the same hardware different partitions

367539
filesystems	xfs
when i built on xfs the filesystems becomes unusable and for further details i will provide the exact kernel message

367573
cpu	processors
my processors intelâ core tm i3-2348m cpu 2.30ghz

367576
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
you are using mint which is based on ubuntu which is based on debian

367576
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
install the iucode-tool package and also the intel-microcode packages from mint ubuntu debian and use the command

367579
debian	mint
on modern debian derivatives including mint mingw32 is no longer available

367580
openvpn	iptables
this happened when i was setting up iptables to for openvpn following these instructions

367605
dpkg	apt
it wouldn t show up in a dpkg query and apt etc wouldn t know it was installed convert the deb file to a tgz extract it run ldd on the binaries and see what libs it needs install those individually via apt or whatever and then just move the contents of the tgz over.

367624
folder	directory
i have samba set up on ubuntu server and trying to share folder inside sharedfolders at the root directory

367634
sudo	passwd
the problem is that i reset the passwd for account admin and then when i tried to to sudo su - it gives me a message passwd incorrect but the passwd is the correct one the new one

367638
gentoo	linux
it so happens the gentoo linux documentation on the topic is quite exhaustive

367641
mp3	ogg
it occurs to me that for a significant portion of the music there is no difference between the two instances - generally when the distributed version was only available as mp3 ogg and didn t have embedded covers

367649
sudo	passwd
to finalize this process add a passwd for the user so they can sudo

367649
sudo	passwd
if they want to change the passwd later they can with the sudo passwd command

367653
rpm	dnf	rpm	yum	dnf	yum
use yum or dnf to resolve dependencies instead of using rpm directly

367670
sudo	passwd
sudo will ask for the passwd of the user invoking sudo not for the root account passwd

367670
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you also need to make sure that the user using sudo is allowed to do so in the sudoers file by either allowing a group that the user is a member of to sudo or by allowing the user directly to sudo with or without entering a passwd

367696
udp	tcp
you can limit the search interface by adding -t option for only showing listening tcp sockets similarly -u for udp -x for unix domain sockets

367707
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
i have tried kali linux ubuntu opensuse it still same

367731
ubuntu	debian
however debian and ubuntu only provide polkit policykit-1 version .105 initially released in 2012

367731
ubuntu	debian
clearly debian and ubuntu are not liking the newer javascript way of

367759
filesystems	ntfs
fsck itself would call relevant programs for each filesystems type ntfs here

367765
mouse	keyboard
display at least one screen a keyboard and a pointing device often a mouse

367784
vim	emacs
however it does not work well with complex applications such as vim emacs screen that needs to run inside a tty

367784
ubuntu	debian
i also would like to use the most basic applications as possible i want to use only the application installed by default on most operating system debian and ubuntu for example

367796
dpkg	apt
this makes sense because i could have done the crossgrade dpkg tar and apt part of that wiki without properly crossgrading my architecture - i could have missed an error because i m such a noob

367800
stdout	stderr
precede the command passed to at with chronic from the moreutils package so that you still get both stderr and stdout if the command exited with an error status otherwise nothing

367800
jobs	cron
do the same to your cron jobs while you re at it

367853
bash	subshell
ksh93 works the way you describe same shell while bash creates a subshell for cmd2

367879
sudo	passwd
can i combine the security of su which is in my view and broadly speaking not everybody can be root and the convenience of sudo passwd timeout if i

367879
sudo	passwd
in my opinion it s convenient that sudo lets you run commands for some minutes without having to enter the passwd and after timeout requests it again

367883
ubuntu	debian
the general dnf update equivalent in debian ubuntu is a combination of apt update apt upgrade and apt autoremove

367883
dnf	yum
there is a nice comparison between the package management tools apt yum dnf and pkg

367918
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
there are several ways of doing this including using homebrew macports fink or netbsd s pkgsrc

367934
bash	zsh
in that shell is process redirection as opposed to the of ksh bash zsh which is process substitution

367934
bash	zsh
it will work in bash and zsh

adding the -e md5 option gives the hex-encoded md5 hash but note that now there s a prefix indicating the hash type

367973
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
or install emacs in a standard location accessible through your either by compiling it yourself or using something like homebrew macports or fink and then simply use

367979
dpkg	apt
the apt dpkg system has the ability to provide un-attended or non-interactive installs

367980
dnf	yum
dnf or yum is automatically updating the package lists when used .

367981
filesystems	btrfs
grub can boot btrfs partitions however the module may be larger than other filesystems

367982
disk	ram
however when commands are being run a copy of their files from the hard disk is put into the ram where they come to life and can do stuff and are called processes

367982
disk	ram
ok so what i wonder about is if the double life of a command one on the hard disk the other in the ram is also true for other kind of files for instance those who have no logic programmed but are simply containers for data

367983
disk	ram
apart from the first reading of the file subsequent accesses will be made to ram rather than to disk

367995
disk	ram
however when commands are being run a copy of their files from the hard disk is put into the ram

367995
disk	ram
ok so what i wonder about is if the double life of a command one on the hard disk the other in the ram is also true for other kind of files for instance those who have no logic programmed but are simply containers for data

367999
hfs+	ntfs
i have two external hard drives hd #1 is ntfs and hd #2 is mac os extended i think this is the same as hfs+

367999
hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+
and is there something about ntfs and hfs+ filesystems such that copying from one to the other results in different binary representations of files

368027
bash	subshell
ls then bash starts a subshell and runs the commands in that subshell

368047
mouse	keyboard
update 2 alright so now i tried starting it without anything connected to usb mouse and keyboard

368129
daemons	systemd
that command could in turn pipe the contents on to a syslog daemons or even into the systemd journal

368140
fgetc	fread	fgets	fread	fgets	fgetc
as noted above the stdio library pulled in data in blocks and were obtained by the program as needed fgetc fgets fread etc

368178
bash	zsh
the alias below works well in zsh when spaces in directory names are escaped but bash doesn t handle them properly

368182
filesystems	btrfs
i want to do a few experiments on the btrfs filesystems but i don t want to make any changes to my existing partitions and i want full control over things like device size

368205
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
if your btrfs filesystems were on lvm then yes you d be able to move things around because the filesystems would be tied to virtual sectors

368240
stdout	stderr
what i know is that redirection is to prevent stdout stderr messages on the terminal

368242
stdout	stderr
when you use find both the stdout and stderr are sent to your terminal and it has to write out both of them the actual results and all the permission errors and whatnot

368250
stdout	stderr
what i know is that redirection is to prevent stdout stderr messages on the terminal

368265
jobs	cron
this means that with sudo crontab -e you will be editing the list of cron jobs for the root user

dnf	yum
replace dnf with yum if dnf is not working

368310
disk	ram
for several weeks now i have been having issues after resume both from ram or from disk my home seems not to be accessible at least for writing

368312
versioning	upgrade
the easiest is to increase the versioning and or release when you build a new package so that the rpm -u upgrade command will work normally

368318
bash	zsh
however it occurred to me that different versions of bash or sh or zsh etc

368322
debian-based	linux
have a debian-based linux that has been hardware cloned a few times

368330
freebsd	linux
i am using the kde4 on freebsd 11 the kdelibs vulnerability affect linux and unix systems with the kde4 kde5 desktop environment

368363
for-loop	loops
you should really be using the while loops since the for-loop loads the whole file in memory at one go

368394
chown	chmod
you might need to add chown and chmod commands to the script

368402
disk	ram
that s pretty hungry for ram but like cache it tries to keep disk io in ram just in case it s needed

368422
division	modulo
the modulo performs integer division and returns the remainder so for each line it will return the sequence 1 2 0 1 2 0 ...

368466
apache	lighttpd
the former is using apache while the latter is using lighttpd

368466
apache	lighttpd
i have already noticed lighhtpd is much more lax concerning proper content-type definitions however the issue at hand is that safari will load and auto-execute .mobileconfig files properly with lighttpd whilst the same does not happen with apache

368466
apache	lighttpd
both in apache and lighttpd

368466
apache	lighttpd
actually i just remembered lighttpd is using http and apache https

368466
apache	lighttpd
i tested it out lighttpd with https and it also works over https while apache does not

368479
spaces	delimiter
the -d tells cut to use a spaces as the delimiter

368491
rss	feed
the easy way to keep an eye on go releases is to set a watch at the releases page at github or just add the relevant feed to your news feed assuming you re using rss feed that is

368536
post	get
post robots.txt 200 should be a get but it succeeds so no problem

368540
terminate	timeout
gets terminate when a timeout occurs on cat producing the wrong output and exit code

368540
for-loop	loops
hacky fix is to loops through every line first and use a for-loop which will bypass this

368562
sudo	passwd
set passwd for root sudo passwd root

368567
vesta	cpanel
i recently found the vesta panel and i m evaluating it to use as a panel for boxes that don t really warrant wmh cpanel

it is of note that nothing of the sort occurs in centos 5x 6x or even on solaris

368641
vim	emacs
though i suppose vim and emacs are probably configurable in what they do

368663
bash	zsh
also works with is a special operator of the korn shell copied by zsh and bash

368663
heredoc	herestring
and it expands to the content of the file heredoc herestring or whatever can be read from the file descriptor if using things like minus the trailing newline characters

368663
bash	zsh
in bash also works in zsh is a more effective way to read the content of a text file into a variable

368663
bash	zsh
to be portable to all versions of ksh zsh and bash best is to limit to only avoiding comments and bearing in mind that modifications to variables made within may or may not be preserved

368671
put	get
but i also put a link to my public_html in the server s root directory at var www html so when the localhost url is called i get the index with a link to my dir at localhost tomas

368672
sudo	passwd
the invoked sudo will normally ask for a passwd just once or not at all if the user has recently used sudo

368712
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
in practice you ll need to make several binary packages .deb for debian and ubuntu .rpm for fedora for the most common linux distributions and versions

368712
ubuntu	debian
obviously you ll need to make different packages for fedora and for ubuntu and you might need to make a different package for debian jessie ubuntu 16.04

368712
ubuntu	debian
however sometimes a package for ubuntu might be installed on some particular debian or vice versa

368718
rhel	suse
in addition to that several distributions attempt to provide lsb compliance including rhel and suse

368723
debian	linux
for example if you are using the 3.16 linux kernel in debian jessie

368810
folder	directory
verify that all the needed files and directory have been uncompressed into the above folder

368811
filesystems	fat
it handles mounted filesystems so youâ d copy your filesystems in the same way you currently do then use fatattr to list all the fat attributes of all the source files and parse that to instruct fatattr to set the attributes appropriately on the target files

368828
mouse	keyboard
it is a python library for controling both mouse keyboard

368830
mouse	keyboard
yes there s a number of tools that can simulate mouse or keyboard events for example xdotool xte or xrecord xmacro

368851
sudo	passwd
even when using an ssh connection and sudo with a passwd where ansible is described as needing to use a pseudo-tty

368859
post	get
as pointed out in the post this thread is probably the best you can get

368874
installation	upgrade
this is useful for faster download and installation of rpm files that are an upgrade to an existing installed package

368875
rpm	yum
at the end the reconstructed rpm is put into yum download directory where the normal package installation routines pick it up and install it

368880
rpm	yum
i have a directory full of rpm files recently installed gotten by running yum install --downloadonly prior to the install

368968
ubuntu	linux
i don t know how to set my linux partitions correctly so what i usually do is using the automatic tool in the ubuntu installation process

368985
ubuntu	linux
i had the same problem with mageia zorin os ubuntu and manjaro arch linux

368986
ubuntu	debian
i wanted to install debian 8.8 on my laptop which was using ubuntu 16.04 lts

369061
bash	zsh
setenv does not exist in sh and csh is extremely rarely used in scripts and has been surpassed by bash for interactive use for the last 20 years and zsh for even longer so you can forget about it unless you encounter it

369083
ethernet	wireless
the router has a wireless interface wlp2s0 that connects to my wireless network for internet connectivity and an ethernet interface enp1s0 where i plug my laptop into

369083
openvpn	iptables
ideally openvpn would run on startup and use wlp2s0 to create a tun0 interface and then some iptables rules would forward enp1s0 traffic to tun0

369083
openvpn	iptables
i added an iptables mangle rule that marks openvpn traffic and then a fw rule that makes the marked traffic use table 100

369083
openvpn	iptables
the issue is that openvpn traffic just doesn t seem to hit the iptables mangle rule

369083
openvpn	iptables
iptables rule that marks the openvpn traffic

369084
gentoo	linux
running gentoo linux distribution with kernel 4.9.16 and bluez 5.43

369084
mouse	keyboard
have two devices logitech mx anywhere 2 mouse and logitech k780 keyboard

as a result it causes a lot of inconvenience if you accidentally touch mouse first keyboard will have no chance to work unless you turn mouse off and turn it on again after keyboard is connected

369086
wildfly	jboss
but i was given another detail it is assumed that my dockerfile unloads the wilfly and i put it an opt jboss wildfly but that is not happening

369133
filesystems	btrfs
a btrfs filesystems reported some errors during btrfs receive operation due to some missing extends

369133

369198
sudo	passwd
you can even tell sudo not to ask for a passwd in that case

369218
ubuntu	linux
then you can boot ubuntu on the vm and run linux programs there.â

369218
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox and vmware are two well-known hypervisors

369230
hex	binary
because vim counts 0x0a as a newline and the binary file contains those 74 in your version of ls ... so when swapping between the raw binary and some other form those 74 lines in the binary will be removed and new lines added for the much more verbose hex display

369268
octal	decimal
if you wanted to handle decimal numbers in any notation 1 010 meaning 10 not octal 8 -1.123 2.23e-4 inf infinity nan... you d need to adapt the matching regular expression like

369275
filesystems	btrfs
a successful btrfs check --repair command doesn t necessarily yield a consistent btrfs filesystems

369275
filesystems	btrfs
thus since the runtimes of a btrfs check followed by a btrfs check --repair and a btrfs scrub can be quite significant - and those actions have uncertain outcomes a practical alternative is to just re-create the btrfs filesystems and restore a backup

369337
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	mint	centos	mint
rocks is based off centos the same way mint is based off ubuntu

369337
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	mint	centos	mint
this is the case with mint and ubuntu but with rocks and centos i m not too sure

369342
bash	zsh
ok so it s basically what i usually set in my .inputrc to get zsh like behavior in bash

369357
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux 14.04 i m having trouble with log rotation

369386
ubuntu	linux

i absolutely need the systemd mode because the daemons mode sometimes unexpectedly exits and i must relaunch it

369525
pbx	elastix
if you are using freepbx elastix wich has freepbx underneath or another gui to manage your pbx you must have a directory application

369557
fish	zsh
as well that was fixed by the forsyth shell and derivatives like pdksh zsh and fish at least

369561
debian	linux

369629
debian	linux
i have a zfs volume on a linux debian

369637
for-loop	while-loop
your while-loop looks as barmar points out in his comment to the question as if it was originally a for-loop that iterated over a variable possibly holding the whole contents of a file

369668
debian	linux
i m running debian gnu linux 9.0 stretch

369685
mouse	keyboard
notice here that my ergonomic keyboard also shows up as a pointer â not sure if this is part of the issue pixart gaming mouse is the offender

369696
jobs	cron
your small server could be on 24 7 so it could do cron jobs in the background while you sleep

369711

i would like to don t have to write at all the sudo passwd for these commands

369852
sudo	passwd
it shouldn t ask for sudo passwd any more

369854
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
with macports install details will likely be very similar under fink and homebrew

369854
fink	homebrew
and then configure ssmtp via opt local etc ssmtp ssmtp.conf or wherever fink or homebrew hide that file with something like

369863
children	parent
the process whose pid is 1 has a job if a process dies while it has running child processes the children s parent process id is set to 1

369868

don t forget to chown your scripts to root and also remove all unnecessary modes via chmod

369885
ubuntu	linux
i have a local linux vm ubuntu 14.04 lts that i use for development

369890
folder	directory
aim-db-dir contains .svn folder in all the directory and subdirectories and these .svn folder contain some folder and files which i am not concerned with

i want to copy everything in the directory and subdirectories under aim-db-dir except the .svn folder and its contents

369901
freebsd	linux
i couldn t get rid of jeff directory on linux machine therefore i used the freebsd machine and re-mounted the hard drive on freebsd again

369903
ubuntu	mint
i ve used a decent amount of ubuntu but heard good things about mint so switched over

369914
for-loop	loops
in bash and any other shell that supports brace expansions your explicit for-loop may be changed into an implicit loops

369946
folder	directory
rather than copying out files from the installation directory it would be better to set the solr_java_home in etc default solr.in.sh to the location of the jre folder in your installation such as usr lib jvm java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.65-0.b17.el6_7.x86_64 jre

369965
stdout	stderr
either way if any output is generated stdout or stderr then it will be sent via email

369978
apache	nginx
i m using apache 2.2.22 without nginx

369978
ssl	https
i bought aplpha ssl certificate it works at least with ispmanager but i can t open the site using https

369983
sudo	passwd
the solution for you here will be either to use one of the family directly or to include a call to setuid 0 or to configure a tool such as sudo to allow you to call your target program directly and presumably without a passwd

369988
lvm	xfs	filesystems	xfs
i have created a lvm pool based on xfs filesystems and have mounted the same to some location say xfspool tmp

369988
lvm	xfs	filesystems	xfs
my goal is to find the used space in xfs filesystems based lvm array

369989
bash	zsh
in zsh or bash you can also use

369992
ubuntu	linux
i m currently on linux ubuntu 14.04 i think

370013
spaces	delimiter
if the delimiter is just a spaces the following command should work

370035
put	get
but i can t seem to use commands like ls put get

370035
ftp	telnet
i can also telnet to both ports and i know that the proxy is working correctly because it takes my test credentials on the ftp server

370059
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
in ubuntu and derivatives specifically linux mint 17.2 is there a setting in a config file somewhere to run fsck -y on boot

370070
bash	zsh
i ve played around with etc bashrc and discovered that bash_completion allows this to work in bash but i can t figure out how to make this work in zsh

370166
folder	directory
mounting the folder with noexec or ro in your case does not change the permissions on files and directory

370172
mouse	keyboard
it shares the mouse and keyboard between computers

370255
folder	directory
there are many files and folder under the tmp directory

370269
disk	ram
but sometimes the server can fail to start and data can be lost when the reboot operation try to synchronize the informations in your ram to the disk during the restart if dmesg shows that you are running with memory or filesystem errors i will recommend a data backup before the reboot if that is possible

370273
bash	zsh
tested on macos bash and arch linux zsh and bash

370275
cat	tee
i m learning bash redirections and wonder if there a way to emulate tee command with cat using redirections

370299
crypt	salt
crypt actually includes a salt field in the crypted password string the format

370301
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux	debian-based	mint
on elementary os and other debian-based distributions such as ubuntu and linux mint the package is libnotify-dev

370325
freebsd	linux
the system-side of secure boot in open source operating systems themselves - eg linux or freebsd - is fully open source as well

370331
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu 104 how can i remove release dhcp address from a nic

370346
daemon	cron
first most likely you are not running logrotate automatically usually through cron daemon

370357
bash	zsh
with zsh yes not with bash

370367
debian	linux
i am trying to set up 2 wireless access points from linux device debian jessy

370371
umask	chmod
given all the questions in this section relate to chmod and umask is the question flawed in that you can t achieve the desired goal using umask

370400
ubuntu	centos
i had install centos 7 minimal version in my virtualbox in ubuntu mate

370408
folder	directory
each directory has a specific purpose and seems like a web application should be distributed in different directory rather than being encapsulated in a folder

370413
freebsd	linux
although there is no official version ported to freebsd dwarf fortress can nevertheless be run using either wine or freebsd s compatibility with linux

370463
bash	zsh
i don t know if it matters but i never start bash directly i always start if from zsh

370463
bash	zsh
when i want to test some command that i m going to write in a bash script i open a terminal using zsh as the default shell then i execute bash from there

370463
bash	zsh
so maybe bash inherits some environment variable from zsh which causes the first error message

370465
ubuntu	linux
arch is harder to setup so i suggest you first try ubuntu and get used to linux before you try out arch

370498
ubuntu	linux
i am using a vpn shrewsoft on my laptop to access a tplink router i can access the linux programs via firefox which i assume uses the tcpip protocol just like i was inside the office but i am unable to get to my files that are located on the ubuntu server

370501
xfce	kubuntu
installing thunar on kubuntu 14.04 with no xfce packages previously installed required 2.8mb of downloads 23 packages

370508
daemon	cron
a consequence of this is that the message body cannot contain the five characters from at beginning of line anywhere in it. if your cron daemon s messages contain a fqdn domain name you ll obviously need to adapt the regex

370508
folder	directory
you d run this in the folder you want to examine or include the full path to the new cur and tmp subdirectories in the directory arguments

370511
debian	mint
i m using debian jessie mint lightdm radeon

370512
ubuntu	debian
but i accept recommendations and probably if you suggest me to change to ubuntu if it s better than debian for web servers

370528
chown	chmod

you can use google-chrome chormium or firefox with selenium when your code with selenium runs an open browser window automates the clicks but the best way to do is to use a headless browser like phantomjs with selenium

chown	chmod
other cases where ctime is modified but not mtime include any modification to metadata except atime on access like chmod chown setfacl ... and using touch to set an arbitrary modification time is another case where the ctime and mtime can end up being different

but ubuntu and debian seem to just be a stable linux distribution

370717
ubuntu	debian
i don t think it is possible to fully answer this question as it may be too broad or opinion based but the debian wiki on children software distributions gives a pretty good overview of ubuntu s goals

370717
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
ubuntu is a linux distribution that starts with the breadth of debian

the xinetd daemons essentially listens for requests and then launchd given service for it

370967
disk	ram
the first time you start an application or otherwise read from disk into memory the data from disk are cached into free ram called buffers in the output of free

370967
disk	ram
if the same data need to be read a successive time before the cache is discarded or used for other data they are read from ram which is naturally faster than being read from disk

371066

i am already using curl wget openssl from the command line but i also want to ensure that the firefox google-chrome browsers too perform as expected as the various validations that are performed by these browsers might be more involved restrictive than that of the other tools

371067
gnu	groff
for systems using gnu roff like gnu or freebsd you can avoid those sequences being used in the first place by making sure the -c -b -u options are passed to grotty for instance by making sure the -p-cbu options is passed to groff

in the past in the unix world i was highly dependent on compiling sources for instance as i was managing solaris aix ultrix digital ultrix and hp ux systems which sometimes were no longer maintained by the vendor or which implementations of common services were far behind what was commonly used by others unixes including linux

371154
ubuntu	debian
i still keep in my local repository debs for freeradius versions compiled by myself from the dev git repo as there were a string of stable versions that had serious bugs in debian and usually the corresponding .debs for debian ubuntu have not been adequate for our needs

371157
mp3	ogg
examples of this could be patching postfix to have the ability to manage quotas or using a distribution like gentoo where you can opt to not use systemd or you opt specifically to support ogg theora vorbis whatever and not mp3 due to licensing issues or whatever

371157
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	centos	debian	mint	redhat	fedora	centos	mint
distribution families - ie debian w ubuntu mint et al and redhat with centos whitebox fedora et al - all use different package formats

371157
redhat	fedora	gentoo	debian
if you wrote some software to scratch some itch and wanted to make it free and post it on gitlab your own webserver whatever would you rather just post a generic .tar.gz file of source with instructions on building or would you rather package up versions for 2 versions of debian stable and testing maybe oldstable multiple versions of redhat and fedora as rpms a tgz for slackware an ebuild profile for gentoo etc

371162
hash	salt
if one does the pap module will remove the header convert from base64 hex as appropriate hash the password the user provided with the same digest algorithm and salt and compare the result

371163
sudoers	passwd
after an hour or so of research all i have found is ways to make the window manager accept my passwd if i have sudoers rights which as i understand it requires me to enter in both my and the other accounts passwd to launch anything and polkit which seems to prompt only once for a passwd and helpfully allow a more granular rights management system for some things unfortunately not apt-get not anything that simply allows selection of account and passing passwd onto the authentication system

371163
debian	linux
does one not exist for cinnamon debian or linux

371169
centos	linux
anyhow in vmware when selecting the os do not select centos instead select other linux 3.x kernel 64-bit

371172
freebsd	linux
runs on gnu linux freebsd os x and windows

371172
influxdb	opentsdb
export to csv influxdb cassandra opentsdb statsd elasticsearch or even rabbitmq

371183
sudo	passwd
if you decide to use the sudo passwd then consider temporarily disabling bash history so the passwd is not logged

371200
disk	ram
in android the initial ram disk stays mounted throughout the entirety of the time the operating system is running

371202
stdout	stderr
of course it s possible â â but only by going through another program such as sh . however you want to redirect stdout as well as stderr and does exactly this

371202
bash	zsh
it s been about 15 years since t csh had any advantage over bash for interactive use about 25 years over zsh and csh has never been good at scripting

i converted some cron jobs to systemd.timer units and want to send a mail on each job failure and success

tensorflow library i have installed is not compatible with the cudnn i think

371309
folder	directory
of course you can only mention folder one would find in a home directory on a typical fedora installation

371315
daemons	systemd
the correct way to handle services and daemons on an openbsd systemd since openbsd 5.7 is by using rcctl 8

371327
bash	tcsh
in the shell console either bash or tcsh everything is fine

371339
freebsd	debian
i m trying to follow a guide to compile a program for debian in freebsd

371339
folder	directory
i have installed all of the default headers on freebsd in the usr src directory but i can t find a modules folder

371339
freebsd	linux
i m guessing the makefile needs to be translated for freebsd though i am very new to linux and so i have no idea

371340
freebsd	linux
you will probably not be able to compile or use the code associated with the linux kernel module on freebsd as it s written specifically for linux and the linux kernel is totally different from the freebsd kernel

371340
freebsd	linux
this is not a trivial undertaking and requires knowledge of both the linux and freebsd kernels

371349
debian	linux
i recently started learning linux and i m booting into debian from usb

371355
jobs	cron
the idea behind not running exactly on the hour is to make the load spikes from multiple cron jobs less sharp

371355
jobs	cron
and if users set their own cron jobs to run on the hour at least these will not start at the same time

371357
debian	linux
note the debian gnu linux uefi installer menu at the top right under the centered name version

371368
apache	nginx
if this is the topology or pretty similar there is a particular reason for using iptables instead of implementing an apache nginx or haproxy as a reverse proxy

371375
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu linux

371386
stdout	stderr
as explained in your question s comments the variable release_command_output will only get the stdout standard output of your command but not the stderr standard error as it seems to be your case

371387
filesystems	xfs
how do i detect a failed xfs filesystems

371387
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
outside of checksumming filesystems like zfs btrfs maybe xfs in the future too it s not really part of the concept to run checks on a filesystems level while mounted apart from whatever sanity checks the filesystems itself does internally

371387
filesystems	xfs
it s the nature of xfsdump to walk the xfs filesystems in its entirety and store all the files

371440
post	get
it would send a valid http get or post request once the tcp connection is established and wait for the server s response to it then report that back to the user somehow

371440
post	get
a common annoyance is testing get static-page and not catching that the thing you really want to work is returning a 500 server error but post dynamic-content with a test payload was too hard or tedious to automate so you never did

371442
centos	linux
for gnu-coreutils ls including on linux dot at the end of modebits means selinux context applies -- use or --context to see details -- and recent redhat centos by default enables selinux to restrict access to all kinds of resources including files

371446

on the plus side sysdig and systemtap are vastly more efficient than strace run vmstat 1 and watch how strace pushes context switches through the roof when running

371557

in bash plain echo doesn t expand them but in zsh it seems to

371638

371997
google-chrome	firefox
if i set the alternate_names to example.local and the common name for the request to example.local example.local shows as secure in both google-chrome and firefox

371997

for-loop	arrays
the for-loop prints all the indices of the arrays called a

372113
hex	binary
this command changes file display format from binary to hex and ascii

372119
stdout	stderr
as you are not caring for the output you can redirect the stdout of a job to dev null and let the stderr being send via mail using mailto environment variable

372119
stdout	stderr
will send mail when there is output only on stderr with the stderr and will discard the stdout

372135
rpm	yum	ubuntu	debian
i usually only admin debian ubuntu servers so i m not sure where i would find a ksh rpm that i can install on a rhel 6.5 server as we don t have access to yum command

uefi boot works in brief that the firmware understands partitions at least gpt and probably dos as well and filesystems at least fat

372310
debian	linux
a linux kernel supported in debian since wheezy

372329
for-loop	loops
how does one write a statement inside the for-loop so that it writes to a different text file each time loops is performed

372331
rpm	yum
i can not use apt-get yum or rpm since none of these package managers are installed on my system

372352
ready	each
and subsequently each data fragment is dressed as a network packet and put on another queue for nic which will be sent along wire when the nic is ready

372357

372380
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
for a debian or debian based system ubuntu mint etc you can look at var log apt history

372381
filesystems	fat
i booted up an opensuse live image deleted every partition on the drive created a new blank efi system partition with a fat filesystems and then my troubles began

372393
google-chrome	firefox
even though the cert has in san and cn and is now otherwise valid my firefox 53.0.2 and google-chrome 59.0.3071.109 still reject it with ssl_error_cert_domain_error and err_cert_common_name_invalid respectively

372393
google-chrome	firefox
i guessed they might not be excluding local from the normal 2+-level logic and tried google-chrome does accept that but firefox doesn t

372393
google-chrome	firefox
i also tried and both google-chrome and ie11 like that but still not firefox and of course assigning yourself names in real tlds like .org is not the way dns is supposed to work

372393
google-chrome	firefox
with some work openssl can be made to generate a cert containing almost anything you want but what firefox and google-chrome will accept i do not know

372396
selinux	jail
i m pretty sure i ve set up everything right â enabled the sshd jail in jail.local using firewallcmd-ipset as the ban action definitely using firewalld not using selinux

centos	linux
centos 7 replaced the traditional iptables linux kernel firewall with

372462
ubuntu	linux
is there any way to do this easily with ubuntu linux

372473
memcmp	strcmp
depending on the awk implementation that will enforce either a memcmp byte-to-byte comparison strcmp same but can t handle nul bytes strcoll whether the two strings sort the same or wcsncmp character-to-character as opposed to byte to byte comparison all of which should be equivalent if your input consists only of decimal digits and period characters

372478
ubuntu	linux
on my linux clients most ubuntu i changed the umask to 0002

372478
folder	directory
if source folder and files have only read permissions for group the files and directory also get only read permissions for groups

372488
ubuntu	mint
i use to work with ubuntu 16.04 kali recent as for june 2017 raspbyan ubuntu mate and mint

debian	linux
how to add user to a network and power group so that i dont have to use every time sudo iconfig or sudo poweroff i remember that groups used in old linux box to control network and power able to access b normal user i m using debian now

372536
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
if typing a passwd every time is what bothers you you can edit etc sudoers with visudo to make those two commands unpassworded for your sudo user

372546
debian	linux
i am running debian 9 but this is a more universal linux question

372562
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
executing sudo su would immediately require the passwd and then report that the user was not in the sudoers file

372562
sudo	passwd
executing sudo touch this sudo cat sudo vim and other such commands would require me to wait 60s before asking me for my passwd

372562
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
upon entering my passwd sudo reported that i was not in the sudoers file

372563
folder	directory
also i removed every hidden folder in the home directory that had something to do with android such .android

372570

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
what is the best practice for increasing partition space in linux systems rhel ubuntu debian etc running on vmware vsphere environments

372640
ubuntu	linux
the bug is related to newest linux kernel i have this bug on 4.8.0-56-generic kernel on ubuntu mate

372652
ssd	sata
the server has 30 internal sata ports that we plug the ssd s into upload the data and then send the disk s back out the field to capture more data the ssd s never sit in the server for longer then an hour

372658
visualvm	jstat
if you want to monitor a jvm running on a remote system there is a better approach than trying to run a gui on the remote system you can start jstat on the remote system run visualvm on your local system and connect to the remote systemâ s jstat instance

372664
bash	zsh
in zsh bash and ksh93

372664
bash	zsh	stdout	stderr
except in zsh and recent versions of bash that have a operator to redirect both stdout and stderr to a file like in csh and where works only as long as is not numerical

372684
filesystems	ntfs
on free space create new partition and change its type to ntfs without creating any filesystems

372723
dpkg	apt
go to var cache apt archives and dpkg -i --force-depends package_version.dpkg the file in in such directory

372723
dpkg	apt
in any case i finish with few dpkg --configure --pending and new apt update so that the correct dependencies are finally fixed

372734
cpu	hyperthreading
i know it is usually considered a good practice to overcommit your physical cpu cores in a ratio 1 2 when defining the number of the vcpu cores because of the hyperthreading

372745
icmp	telnet
even when i do a ping which fails but i shoudl still see the icmp packets go out or try a telnet ip port i see .

372762
debian	linux
i m a fairly new linux user and have been playing around with debian without a desktop in virtualbox on osx

372773
websphere	ibm
i can see the following error on my websphere ibm bpm logs

372787
client-side	server-side
if using freebsd as a file server for windows clients it s useful to be able to run file searches server-side rather than client-side

372787
docx	xlsx
but freebsd doesn t have a notion of well known file filters or a specific single api for parsing file data to text that uses pluggable filters to a common format although there are well-known text extraction filters for many individual filetypes such as pdf doc docx xls xlsx archive formats sqlite databases binary files containing strings etc so you can t just throw grep find -exec pdftotext or unzip | sed using microsoft xml extraction code universally at the results

372798
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
pbkdf2 is a salt password hash meaning that in addition to the password the hash function takes as input another string the salt which is generated randomly when the password is set or modified

372798
hash	salt
the idea here is that an attacker cannot precompute the hash corresponding to common passwords since they also need the salt

372798
hash	salt
the salt is stored as part of the password hash and to compare a plaintext password to the hash one the correct salt to use is read from the hash

372798
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	md5	hash	md5
compared to a plain cryptographic hash function like md5 or sha-256 pbkdf2 is also iterated meaning that it runs the underlying hash multiple times in a loop thousands of times at least

372798
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
the password hash used by the system etc shadow see the crypt man page are also iterated and salt as any proper password hash should be

gentoo	linux
i have gentoo linux installed on dev sda2 with dev sda1 being the boot partition where grub files are installed

372799
gentoo	linux
i have pressed esc and checked the boot options and while a live usb of mine shows up the boot menu as does my gentoo installation my arch linux installation does not show

372817
folder	directory
i have a directory in my home folder containing some build output which the build process has chown to another user for reasons unknown to me. i want to delete the directory but can t because it s not empty and i can t delete the files it contains because they are not owned by me

372853
ubuntu	debian
we need to determine the list of packages that the package we removed depends on like so this list is from a xubuntu install but the result will be nearly identical as ubuntu is a debian fork

372858
bash	zsh
also note that not all implementations support sub-second granularity bash s test builtin as of version 4.4 still doesn t for instance gnu test and the test builtin of zsh or ksh93 do at least on gnu linux

372865
put	get
but because of the â œmagicâ nature of functions what you get out of it is not what you put in it s a normalized version â â in particular with aliases expanded

372897
ssd	sata
i have two hard drives in my laptop - an m.2 ssd 1st and a sata 3 ssd 2nd

372909
sudo	passwd
a sudo su - will start a login root shell but using the user passwd not root passwd

372921
ubuntu	debian
i am using ubuntu mate but i want to switch over the debian mate or debian lxde testing

372922
i2c	spi
it sounds like you are connecting the flir one via usb but the code seems to access the lepton module inside the device vie spi and or i2c

372934
google-chrome	firefox
rstudio support here but you need to be logged in to read the thread and works in firefox my google-chrome is not accepted there to get logged in

no it is not a gnome or kde based option but can run programs from both either

372951
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	kde	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
here you go torrent links to gnome kde cinnamon mate lxde or xfce and assuming you need an amd64 version others are available at the same site

bash	zsh
ksh zsh -o kshglob bash -o extglob

372961

so i m an intermediate-level linux user i ve run things like ubuntu in the past but i m still learning lots - recently i got fed up with windows and decided to install arch

372963
ubuntu	linux
to boot from 3.0 linux lite ubuntu mate 16.0

372968
switching	screens
3-4 seconds after 2 seconds so there is something wrong between the 7th second and the 9th second no switching was here but also no picture on the screens

373018
folder	directory
i have an external hard drive that holds all of my folder in my home directory documents pictures blah blah all in the root of the external hdd

373037
bash	zsh
tmux has nothing to do with bash or zsh or whatever shell you are using

373046
filesystems	btrfs
the btrfs filesystems is used for the ssds

373050
chown	chmod
all files on share as checked and set on app server are chmod 777 and chown www-data which is the php-fpm user

373088
qmail	exim
one thing you can do however is send all your mail through an mta like sendmail qmail exim etc.

373106
disk	ram
use this tag to refer to any kind of data retention method including ram flash hard disk punch cards or magtape etc

373111
mouse	keyboard
any suggestions about how best to persuade the kernel to recognise the extra device as a keyboard rather than a mouse

373123
ubuntu	debian
i burned the debian installation .iso to dvd under ubuntu

373124
switching	screens
i think it installs a kernel module that needs to be loaded and or a service that needs to be enabled then restart the vm and at the login screens hit the button in the lower-right corner to change your video driver and make sure you switching to vboxvideo

373126
mouse	keyboard
it s enough to make it show up in this list even if it shows up as mouse - you can reassign it to the virtual core keyboard

373133
temp	tmp
for example temp is tmp in cygwin but quite different in windows so if this was causing problems you might end up with

373137
hid	keyboard
do cat sys kernel debug hid device_id rdesc for the device_id that corresponds to your keyboard see dmesg and update question with output

373141
gentoo	debian
there are so many articles on debian based distros but not one in arch gentoo other distros

373165
debian	mint
i ll admit to not using the mint update manager but instead i use the utilities since i m so used to working on debian servers

373165
versioning	upgrade
first become root with sudo -i then update the list apt-get update then upgrade all the way for your current versioning apt-get dist-upgrade

373174
vmware	virtualbox
we moved a vm from virtualbox to vmware esxi and are having a hard time booting the system

373186
stdout	stderr
the command prints both on stdout and stderr and its output changes over time so just writing it to a file and sending some kind of notification wouldn t do the job very well

373193
folder	directory
-- compressing all folder within current directory

373214
hash	md5
that will give you the md5 hash

373223
bash	zsh
suppose the default shell for my account is zsh but i opened the terminal and fired up bash and executed a script named prac002.sh which shell interpreter would be used to execute the script zsh or bash

373229
bash	zsh
if bin sh is a different version of bash than you were using directly you ll see different output when you run the script from bash directly and from zsh

373246
kde	gnome
to avoid malicious .desktop files to be responsible to the launch of hostile or unwanted programs kde and gnome developers introduced a custom hack that somewhat deviates the intended unix file execution permission purpose to add a security layer

373248
google-chrome	firefox
the save file dialog in google-chrome firefox and geany are different

373252
mouse	keyboard
instaed as there you don t need keyboard or mouse

bash	zsh
to activate it run shopt -s cdable_vars if you are using bash setopt cdablevars in case of zsh

373275
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
it may be more sensible to install dos2unix from a package system fink macports homebrew and use that for linefeed conversions

373282
bash	zsh
it does nt seem to bash does support it but it works very well with zsh

373294
execvp	posix
on solaris 10 using execvp will have it interpreted by bin sh even with usr xpg4 bin find even in a posix environment a conformance bug

udp	tcp
pptp uses two different protocols tcp port 1723 is used for initial setup but the data streams use gre -- generic route encapsulation -- which is neither tcp nor udp -- it s ip protocol number 47

373313
installation	upgrade
the vpn connection works perfectly fine after the installation of the operating system but as i upgrade the system for one or two times the vpn connection fails in successfully getting established

373322
bash	zsh
i think zsh should be compatible with bash and offer such an option

373337
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
for example windows filesystems fat ntfs forbid characters such as and

373344
bash	zsh
the -nt operator isn t defined by posix but it s present in many implementations including dash bash pdksh mksh att ksh zsh gnu coreutils test and busybox

373351
zsh	tcsh
finallyâ here is complete implementation of tcsh s autolist in zsh

373354
autoreconf	ldflags
a more permanent solution might be to modify the configure.ac file to add -lz to libs instead of ldflags and then re-generate configure using autoconf or autoreconf if necessary

373368
stdout	stderr
get the file discriptor of 1 stdout or 2 stderr proc your_python_pid fd 1 2

filesystems	hfs+
afaict macos doesn t seem to even store sub-second time information in the file attributes on the hfs+ filesystems at least

373432
versioning	upgrade
i have web apache servers with jessie or stretch that have been upgrade successively from older versioning of debian from squeeze onwards depending on the servers

spaces	delimiter
looks like a simple table format what i can sugest is to use cut command and remove the first two columns delimiter by spaces

373567
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
i had to upgrade gcc versioning from 4.4.7 to 6.3.0 for installation of some packages but it still says 4.4.7 on the python screen

373567

centos	linux
it is a server machine and i have to be on centos 6.9 linux

373578
versioning	upgrade
please assist i can t find any way to upgrade it without reinstalling the debian to newer versioning

373603
ubuntu	debian
in order to prevent them from loading after reboot edit the file etc modprobe.d blacklist if you are using debian ubuntu and add the line

373610
zypper	yum
you should use yum or zypper on opensuse for the external dependencies

373611
udp	tcp
the rtsp server use both tcp and udp

373622
cpu	processors
why does it show 0 for cpu cores in processors 1

373636
spaces	delimiter
the one solution i have assumes that the columns are separated by multiple spaces so i can replace them with a delimiter that doesn t occur elsewhere in the file and then re-columnate with column -t based on this delimiter

373640
sudo	passwd
i do not believe you can sudo via sftp but if you can somehow setup so sudo would not ask for a passwd for example use

373641
debian	linux
i am working with an embedded linux device raspberry pi debian with two identical usb cameras connected

373660
octal	binary
an octal digit is representing 3 binary digits

and a page preferably of the manufacturer for the bought model that describes how exactly to get them to work under linux debian

373684
rpm	yum
i can download the rpm but i once again get stuck at line #2 - yum install

373704
bash	zsh
my solution parse the process tree and look for vim and bash zsh and figure out the current process s depth within it

373710
zsh	subshell	zsh	tcsh	fish	subshell	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	subshell	bash	tcsh	subshell	tcsh
tcsh and several other shells zsh ksh93 fish and bash at least maintain a variable which they increment on startup and decrement before running another command with exec unless that exec is in a subshell if they re not buggy but many are

373718
debian	linux
i installed debian 9.0 just a few days ago and am a newcomer to linux

373719
centos	linux
my goal is to be able to somehow convert this package to a format compatible with other linux flavors such as centos so i can install it on them as well

373723
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
we have an embedded pc with an linux os which seems to be an debian ubuntu derivate with rt-preempt patch

i m seeing that bootstrap tries to load kernel of a non-existing floppy drive rather than hdd

373770
for-loop	arrays
have you tried creating a variable arrays with all your directories and then have a for-loop execute the commands on each of them

373783
ubuntu	linux
the issue wasn t with iptables or with ubuntu linux version i was using but rather the issue was with this third rule

373790
stdout	stderr
i understand it such that stdout or stderr has the form

373790
put	get	stdout	stderr
i need to direct stdout stderr initially to url-variable put the oauth on the background curl the urlon3rdrow to get verification code and then respawn the oauth to input the verification code -- and very lastly now getting the oauth token and oauth token secret

373797
tunnel	vpn
i use it as a second gateway that way the clients i want to tunnel traffic through the vpn go through the pi and everything else goes through my normal router

373866
ptrace	exploit
another paper about a ptrace exploit is available here .

373873
uniq	grep
if you want to count how many unique lines there are that fulfill this criteria this is how i interpret different lines then pipe the result of grep without the -c flag through uniq and wc -l

373881
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i observe at least three installations of different linux ubuntu 16.04 antergos latest as per 2017-06-28 debian 9.0 with the following behaviour

373894
restrict	shared
i m having trouble getting a solaris 11.0 server to restrict access to an nfs shared to a single client system

373896
centos	linux
there is no clear way to convert arch linux packages into centos packages

373909
centos	linux
if linux is client this is a solution it is distribution dependent but on centos depending on version being used you can create the file etc ppp ip-up.local or etc ppp ip-up with the following contents

373921
tar	gunzip
i am trying to compress each into a tar gunzip archive

373932
ubuntu	mint
in etc resolv.conf on modern distros link mint 17 and ubuntu 16 there s a warning

373934
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am running linux mint 18.1 ubuntu 16.04 lts base

373956
ubuntu	mint
that way you can keep running ubuntu or mint the default way

373968
hash	salt
that means for whatever hash you have the password begins with a salt value onf5m3f1u in this case

373968
hash	salt
so imagine these four hash of the password b with salt

373968
hash	salt
the salt prepends so you d hash db to get just b or ab to get c

373970
openbsd	solaris
if you need want additional blocking you could look into using ipfilters or the solaris firewall derived from openbsd pf pkg network firewall

374049
stdout	stderr
the progress bar is on stderr and the content you piped in is on stdout

374065
centos	linux
i prefer use centos but you can to use another linux flavor..

374084
openbsd	freebsd
openbsd and freebsd can modify access permission of symlink by chmod

374103
daemons	systemd
if there is an fstab entry with noauto and x-systemd.automount reloading the systemd daemons systemctrl daemon-reload will generate an automount systemd unit under run systemd generator at least this is the path where it get s generated under ubuntu 16.04

374116
rsa	dsa
if you open the private key file in text editor you will be able to see encrypted in the second line of the rsa dsa key file

374117
kerberos	ldap
the hadoop cluster has a dedicated kdc open-suse kerberos with ldap

374117
kerberos	ldap
we have microsoft ad with ldap both in read-only and according to security policy no cross-realm trust from ad to hadoop kerberos is allowed

374117
kerberos	ldap
maybe i can add the read-only ldap directories as additional kerberos backends

374147
uniq	grep
after i saw the solution utilizing a for-loop with awk and sort and uniq and grep and sed i tried a solution with one tool instead of six

374166
octal	hex
thta is the character 034 in octal or 0x1c in hex

374190

redhat	fedora
for redhat enterprise linux the first repo to usually add is extra packages for enterprise linux epel hosted at the fedora project

374226
rpm	dnf	rpm	yum	dnf	yum
yum rpm dnf emerge etc

374229
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
apt is well integrated with debian and its derivatives and even if they debian ubuntu mint knoppix... use the same tool for package management their packages are linked and configured with specific package versions that in some cases will work only with specific dependencies that that distribution has

374234
rpm	yum
also apt-rpm cannot be used with yum repositories so it s not useful unless someone has built rpm repositories that can be used with apt

374234
dpkg	apt
but trying to set up a parallel debian-like system using dpkg and apt would be a complete non-starter i think

374234
dpkg	apt
it s mostly because of debian s famous quality control though the debian package management tools dpkg apt etc. can take some of the credit for being well designed and implemented

374238
rpm	yum
likewise yum is a front-end for using the rpm system

374238
debian	linux
you may prefer using the closely related fedora linux which has a far larger selection of packages in its official repositories or you may want to switch to debian or one of its derivatives

what i d like is for these commands not to hang up at the passwd prompt when the command i want to run is not in sudoers

374288

374452
centos	linux
this is running under linux specifically rhel 5 or rhel 6 or the rough equivalent centos machines

374452
sudoers	visudo
it is not clear how a non-root script can inspect the contents of the sudoers file without using some interactive mechanism such as visudo which will require a ncurses enabled terminal which is not an option

374458
debian	linux
i am trying to install a new kernel that i just built from source using the following command on a machine currently running linux rc70 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u2 2016-01-02 x86_64 gnu linux

mouse	keyboard
i can t get the screen to wake by moving mouse or pressing keyboard buttons

374534
jobs	cron
for cron jobs add lines to the crontab

374538
bash	zsh
this is only available since bash 4.0 so not on the default bash on osx but the feature is also available in zsh

374567
folder	directory
on my mac i symlink the directory let s say macdirectory to the shared folder sharedfolder so when i compile and put a file there it follows to the vm directory where the application is running

374589
hex	binary
because a string of hex digits or binary or whatever else isn t generally understandable to a human

i compiled a vanilla linux kernel 4.9.20 using i am running debian stretch on my laptop

374670

by default cron will email you any output any of the cron jobs generate either to stdout or stderr

374708
sudo	passwd
i ve made sure that the root account has a passwd set by setting it using sudo passwd root

374709
sudo	passwd
i think sudo normally prompts for that current user s passwd so long as the user is a member of the wheel group

374723
ubuntu	debian
it happened to me twice under ubuntu 16.04 and most recently under debian 9.0.1

374732
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
but when i install any distribution of linux such mint 18 or ubuntu 16.04 alongside of windows is 10 it working very very slow

374753
bash	subshell
so although the curly braces by themselves do not create a subshell the pipe then does this in bash

374753
stdout	stderr
example below shows a possibility where one still can use a code block transfer its whole output to a log here stdout and stderr are appended to different log files and have the changed variables accessible later as we do not get into a subshell

374768
folder	directory
only when the user did not supply the name of a folder would you need to use the current working directory

374770
post	get
i am a total noob when it comes to linux so if you need more logs or something i would appreciate if you could just quickly tell me how i d get that log or point me to where i can find out since i probably won t know how to get it and i ll post it as soon as possible

374803
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
as for the host linux i m planning to go with the new debian 9 or possibly ubuntu 16.04

374814
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems is ntfs

374834
freebsd	linux
it appears that you are trying to compile a linux kernel module on freebsd

374834
freebsd	linux
although both linux and freebsd are unix-like operating systems they employ kernels that are in many aspects totally different from each other

374834
freebsd	linux
this means that a piece of kernel code a kernel module for example that is written specifically for the linux kernel will not compile and or work on a freebsd system

374834
freebsd	linux
it s in situations like these that someone with knowledge of the freebsd kernel and its architecture and at least a general knowledge of the linux kernel would possibly consider sitting down to port the driver from linux to freebsd

374862
versioning	upgrade
it used to work fine and it does work fine on another machine using debian jessie with same firefox and video downloadhelper versioning but i can t tell for sure that the issue dates from the upgrade to stretch

374875
ssl	socks
recently after a dist-upgrade to debian 9.0 i happened to notice that danted a socks v5 proxy server and stunnel4 an ssl tls tunneling service services can not resolve domain names

374892
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
several installations of linux specifically ubuntu and mint including newest 17.04 and 18.1 respectively and kali are not setting the correct cpu frequency driver nor the speedstep support state

374899

the -p enables the perl mode of grep -o show you the matching portion -h will hide the filename from being displayed alongside the matching line and -l will list the filename only

374900
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu systems the following setting in the repository gmailremote should do the trick

374909
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading technology allows a single processors core to execute two independent threads simultaneously

374909
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading makes cpu x to behave like two cpus cpu - x1 and cpu - x2 but physically not

374912
acpi	vga
append vga 791 quiet rw root dev ram0 loglevel 0 pci pcie_scan_all realloc reboot acpi

374913
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading technology allows a single physical processors core to

374913
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading makes a physical processors to behave like it has two physical processors which are called logical processors

374917

ubuntu	linux
as the second vmware instance i m running ubuntu 16.04.2 server and this server is mounted with sshfs inside my fedora linux

374942
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
if you insist on the other variants make a short script that contains both the socat and the chmod chown and execute that script with sudo

374969
next	except
i m trying to do is create a new process from within bash like nothing ever happened except my terminal is on the next line where that process would normally steal my stdout.

374986
debian	linux
i d want to display graphical programs executed on a windows machine remotely on a linux host debian

374987
stdout	stderr
pipes stderr into stdout

374991
stdout	stderr
of course you might want to redirect both stdout and stderr of your apt-get commands to which you might want to pass --yes

375001
disk	ram
if you think the output is going to be rather long or have the file written in ram instead of on disk if you think the output is going to be rather fast but how to do those things is another question idk

375059
opensuse	linux
the automounting you see on a modern linux distribution like opensuse or fedora is implemented by the udisks2 service

375100

375110
ubuntu	linux
little disappointment addition i guess ubuntu people doesn t care since they asked me to post this here instead - for what the linux community is worth p

375118
folder	directory
i just noticed that there is no build directory in lib modules 4.9.0-kali3-686-pae build there is no build folder there

375142
dnf	yum
after the os completed installation i installed some other software through yum and dnf cli tools

375152
init.d	pid
however regardless of whether i reboot execute service opendkim start or etc init.d opendkim start var run opendkim is used as the rundir instead and so the pid file and socket are placed in the wrong locations

375156
bash	zsh
although it works in all my other typeset -supporting shells bash yash zsh pdksh

375157
bash	zsh
to be able to use local scope in code portable to bash zsh ksh88 ksh93 pdksh yash or dash freebsd sh you could do

375161
ubuntu	linux
i tried the reverse setting up remote port forwarding in ubuntu and then connecting from the linux box and that just works

375234
spaces	delimiter
this uses cut with a spaces as delimiter and cuts out the second column

375235
folder	directory
i tried to purge it but when i execute locate -c pscxr the output was 48 so it means i still have a folder directory content on my system

375251
daemons	systemd
on bsd systemd racoon daemons is used for it

375258
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
pubkeuyauthenticationtypes rsa dsa ecdsa

375258
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
that also had no effect so i changed it back to what i originally had rsa dsa ecdsa

375265
debian	mint
i am running debian but lack of driver support for stuff i want has made me decide to switch to mint

375280
disk	ram
the system stores the official copy of memory on disk and caches only the most frequently used data in ram

375280
ready	each
we also break ram into page frames each the same size as a page ready to hold any page of virtual memory

375296
mouse	keyboard
the menu option with the mouse pointer and press the keyboard shortcut

375299
openbsd	freebsd
i ve always liked the openbsd philosophy which matches my own and just today realised that i ve assumed i would learn on freebsd where in fact i could easily switch to openbsd as an os install to learn with

375299
openbsd	freebsd
i m happy to use both and i d like to learn on openbsd primarily but so far i ve only used freebsd and that s been dabbling at most

375343
filesystems	btrfs
the mistake you made is that you created two separate btrfs filesystems

375343
filesystems	btrfs
you can see in the output of sudo btrfs fi the two filesystems each with one device

375343
filesystems	btrfs
to fix it use the btrfs device add command to add the new disk to the existing filesystems

375358
google-chrome	firefox
start firefox or google-chrome or the gimp or some other larger app and time how long it takes

375394
google-chrome	firefox
also i ve noticed that problems seems to intensify after running firefox or google-chrome and closing them results in no artifacts at all i ve tried to induce problem without browser running and did not manage to observe any problems

375396
folder	directory
this is my current directory which contains the following folder

375402
udp	tcp
--inet only show raw udp and tcp protocol sockets

375403
jobs	cron
the reason that by default a smtp server is up and running in a new linux install is for the system to deliver important notifications and other information status of cron jobs etc. to the root user

375406
spaces	delimiter
the tr is to remove the commas as dc fields are spaces delimiter and negative numbers begin with _ rather than -

375434
put	get
my first problem is that if i put a dir on the nodelete list but this dir have old files inside the files didn t get deleted so far the only solution that i was able to do it is to run one command for directories and other to files it s pretty ugly i m no developer

375436
sudoers	visudo
moreover always use visudo to edit the sudoers file

375439
ubuntu	debian
if you need to install things from debian or ubuntu repos in your rpm-based distro i believe your best bet is to setup a corresponding chroot via debootstrap and install whatever it is you need in there

375450
ssd	sata
dell e7270 with ssd disk liteon cv3-8d512-11 sata 512gb

i was encountering the same issue with 4.2.4-4393 on linux mint binary compatible with ubuntu

375577
daemon	cron
i start the cron daemon as a background service and log to cron.log verbosely

375597
sudo	passwd
putting aside for the moment the fact that you re using apt on a mac when you run sudo it asks for your passwd

375599
debian-based	linux
the apt command package manager is for debian-based linux systems

375736
pulseaudio	dbus
4 use the dbus interface of pulseaudio from python

375759
versioning	upgrade
like i mentioned in the comments the upgrade also changed my kernel from 3.16 to 4.9 and i just found it interesting that sudo startx shows these kernel and os versioning

375772
stdout	stderr
a simple solution seemed to always redirect their stderr and stdout output to a file system destination which was stored in an environment variable

375772
stdout	stderr
we need the copying of stderr to stdout by the caller

375784
freebsd	linux
you won t see this in xterm or in unicode rxvt or in the terminal emulator built into the linux kernel or on the freebsd console

375799
