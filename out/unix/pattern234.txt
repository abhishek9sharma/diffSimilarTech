235578
mp3	aiff	opus	aiff
pattern4	
i choose aiff format because it supports id3v2 tags but when for test i convert a mp3 file contains metadata to aiff format with sox program and convert it to opus with opusenc result was the output opus file lacks metadata don t known what is the problem exactly also there was need to specify bit-rate value of mp3 file so use of mediainfo is necessary

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux	debian-based	mint
pattern4	
if you are more used to debian-based distros like linux mint i would recommend debian or ubuntu server

239390
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
pattern4

251266
ubuntu	debian

pattern4	
the symptoms match tcp connections get broken after a while when the other contender grabs the ip address and keeping a ping running helps because then the same contender tends to remain in the arp caches

313441
gentoo	ubuntu
pattern4	
however if we compare gentoo - the distro known for compiling almost everything from source code and doing things from scratch with ubuntu - the distro which s noob-friendly we will see that if you want to get your standard laptop configuration webcam microphone speakers and optimus dual graphics card setup you need to do much more on gentoo side - you need to find proper drivers to compile compile them and set up configuration so that x recognizes both cards

given the fact virtual memory might be present in ram on disk files or swap or nowhere you cannot reliably compare ram and virtual memory usage

413014
sudo	passwd
pattern4	
that is set the filesize limit to 0 for the update of the timestamp file to fail but as long as we don t let that limit kill sudo we re still able to tell if a passwd was required or not

418400
ubuntu	linux
pattern4	
my question is what can i do to further investigate this and improve performance of the arch linux system to match ubuntu
