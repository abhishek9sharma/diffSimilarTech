free	malloc
but ram usage by the kernel for some process is widely varying with time for a given process and even its virtual address space is changing by calls to mmap 2 and munmap used by ld-linux 8 dlopen 3 malloc 3 free and many other functions needed to your python interpreter...

375899
bash	tcsh
i m most familiar with bash so i checked for .bash_profile and .bash_rc but i now know that tcsh uses a different set of .profile files

375919
stdout	stderr
in a shell script i want to write to the stdin of an external process x using a named pipe and i want to send the stdout stderr from another named pipe to the current terminal

375919
stdout	stderr
the external process x is receiving stdin via pipein and it s sending it s stdout stderr to pipeout

375919
stdout	stderr
what i am trying to do above is set-up a read on pipeout before sending stdin to x to make sure i capture all of the stdout stderr of x

375982
daemons	systemd
in some cases you would need to delegate this to a process supervisor daemons for example systemd

376001
filesystems	xfs
also keep in mind that logical volume are seldom use alone most of the time a filesystems ext4 xfs and many other is put in top of it

376006
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
so i have a few packages that i need to install in arch linux but the install instructions are for debian ubuntu

376008
centos	linux
i am facing the following issue when trying to enable and start the icinga2 service in centos linux release 7.3.1611 core

376011
ubuntu	debian
i have used ubuntu for over a year and decided to try debian - i m fairly familiar with the basics by now

376011
debian	linux
question does debian follow a do-it-yourself approach like i heard arch linux does

376018
debian	linux
for debian you need to download the .tar.gz for linux from adobe then copy it to usr lib flashplugin-nonfree because the flash-plugin-nonfree doesn t get updated as adobe changes the link

376019
ubuntu	linux
i am using latest linux alpine 3.6 as os in a docker container also tested on ubuntu 16.10 outside of docker with same result

376026
gentoo	debian
i wouldn t call debian a diy system like arch or gentoo because it does provide you with a nice base to use

376029
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
in general while i would say that debian assumes more initiative on the part of the user than ubuntu or linux mint the goal of the debian project is to offer a complete general purpose so unless you explicitly chose a minimal install a default debian installation would include most or all of the tools you d expect

376058
bash	tcsh
shell application bash tcsh etc that helps user to interact with system

376064
tripledes	aes
for some reason when i go about using any cipher in the list apart from aes and tripledes i get this error

376097
sudoers	visudo
remember to only edit etc sudoers using the visudo command

376133
dpkg	apt
since you say executables you could also check out software packaging apt and apt-get and dpkg

376139
freebsd	linux
most of them except arch linux and freebsd

376139
debian	centos
make it really easy to install software and most of them except centos and debian keep up to date with new versions of software continuously

376139
freebsd	linux
once you re familiar with those you could cut your teeth on arch linux or freebsd to get a desktop that is completely optimised for your machine

376151
debian	linux
note my machine is a debian linux with rt kernel 4.9

376152
stdout	stderr
it pumps the file content into stdout which you pipe into another program md5sum and the progress indication is output through stderr

376153
fish	bash
i find myself using bash more often than not on remote machines even though fish is my preferred shell

376162
ubuntu	mint
for example when i have mint and ubuntu installed on two partitions i want it to boot into ubuntu unless i do something while it s booting

376169
switching	screens
a simple xorg.conf switching off xinerama adding devices monitors screens and server layout

377231
jobs	cron
i ve looked at cron jobs on both the client and server and can not see any which might be doing this

377238
rpm	yum
if you want to clean up config files from a program that you recently removed via an rpm system all you have to do is enter yum clean all

377241
daemon	cron
and assuming the cron daemon is running the command will be executed each minute

377241
daemon	cron
- because the conrjob runs in a different shell below the cron daemon which doesn t have access to your x session thus firefox will fail and report something like

377241
daemon	cron
typically the cron daemon will try to send you a mail see var spool mail eventually

377274
ubuntu	debian
the package tmsu preview here information is done for ubuntu here but trying to apply for debian 9

377298
stdout	stderr
strace prints to stderr not stdout

377298
stdout	stderr
you will need to redirect stderr to stdout if you want to pipe it

377300
ubuntu	linux
this was tested on both my own arch gnu linux system and an ubuntu vm

377300
bash	zsh
the commands specific to zsh zsh -c ... were also tested using bash

377300
bash	zsh
arch gnu linux zsh 5.3.1 bash 4.4.12 1

377300
bash	zsh
ubuntu 16.04.2 lts zsh 5.1.1 bash 4.3.48 1

377300
bash	zsh
this doesn t tell me much more than zsh and bash handle setting of variables differently

377307
switching	screens
for some terminal types switching into cursor addressing mode under the covers switches to an alternate screens buffer and the alternate screens buffer has no scrollback and hence no scroll bar widgets

377309
vim	emacs
the followup with examples for vim and emacs citing konsole is interesting

377309
vim	emacs
the interesting part is that what emacs echoes is different from what vim echoes and that the former resembles the older obsolete behavior

377321
cinnamon	gnome
installing all the stuff i need customizing gnome or possibly cinnamon the way i like it gets tedious when i have to do it on three separate machines

377326
chown	chmod
note that using root i can t even write in this directory nor chown or chmod it

377339
debian	linux	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
i have a gentoo linux laptop raspberry pis running raspian a gentoo server arm devices running debian and have various android devices

377343
filesystems	btrfs
you can t hard-link or ref-link files from the btrfs filesystems into the ecryptfs filesystems or vice-versa

377351
ubuntu	debian
hello i have recently migrated from ubuntu to debian testing because of stability

377357
ubuntu	mint
the thunderbird ubuntu package page shows that the latest version 52.2.1 is available as a security update for many supported released of ubuntu including 16.04 so you should be able to install it in mint 18.2 as-is

377367
octal	hex
have you tried dumping the start of a file in octal hex to see if that s the case

377372
spaces	delimiter
cut -d -f2 will using spaces as delimiter get only the second column which is the pid

377376
debian	centos
from what i can tell the default permissions for centos 7 and debian 8 9 are 755 root root

377388
stdout	stderr
but i hope the stdout information is after the stderr .so i change the command into

377388
stdout	stderr
but i get a empty file .how to make the the stdout information is after the stderr in a redirect file

377448
kde	cinnamon
edit i now switched from cinnamon to kde and from nautilus to dolphin both are way better

377454
bash	subshell
at least when time is the bash builtin but then a subshell is useless

377467
stdout	stderr
this is not the case here as all you re literally doing is connecting both the stdout and stderr to the file descriptor that points to the file all

377467
stdout	stderr
which first redirects stdout to the file all then redirects stderr to wherever stdout is pointing

377483
daemons	systemd
i think i may be daemonizing my script wrong so do you know what the better ways are to use systemd to turn a python script into a daemons process

377498
daemons	systemd
in this mode if the process offers functionality to other processes on the systemd its communication channels should be installed before the daemons is started up sockets set up by systemd via socket activation as systemd will immediately proceed starting follow-up units

377499
openvpn	iptables
i added forwarding rule between openvpn and openconnect in iptables

377517
post	get
if you get an error message and you cannot find the workaround then please post it as a comment so i can help you troubleshoot it

377522
folder	directory
below you config.vm.box variable and the folder where is located vagrant file will be mapped with var www directory of your ubuntu os

377530
daemons	systemd
systemd can track the child daemons process pid

377591
debian	linux	daemons	systemd
i have noticed this across several different linux debian based systemd running the openssh-server daemons

377612
mouse	trackpad
method of utilizing complex mouse trackpad pen gestures on linux is easystroke

377624
filesystems	btrfs	filesystems	ntfs
i m getting filesystems errors sdb1 is ntfs containing a loopback btrfs filesystems

377624
filesystems	btrfs
it s affecting btrfs because i believe the kernel is unhappy about having the same filesystems uuid mounted twice

377645
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the bios to the last versioning 02.18 june-2017 but no change

377668
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu like debian on which ubuntu is based uses .deb packages

377713
tunnel	vpn
is your network vpn ssh tunnel firewall configured correctly

377734
btrfs	vfs	filesystems	btrfs
it s a true copy as far as the linux vfs virtual filesystems is concerned but within btrfs the files would share the same blocks extends so no additional space is required until you modify the files

377734
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is pretty neat and all but it doesn t work like your traditional linux filesystems extn reiserfs etc.

377769
kde	gnome
i ve seen guides from my research for and using desktop or kde desktop gnome desktop etc as well as seeing guides to install a vnc server yum install vncserver then configuring it and trying to use vnc viewer or tiger vnc to connect to it from windows side

377778
bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash	ash	tcsh
that is not true in almost all shells jsh ash yash dash lksh mksh ksh93 attsh and of course csh and tcsh except bash

377784
redhat	fedora
i ll describe my approach for accessing a redhat or fedora desktop from a windows system which i think is relatively straightforward

377793
dnf	yum
you need to use the equivalent yum or dnf commands to accomplish your task

377816
mp4	webm
ssr supports many different types of codecs like mkv webm mp4 etc

377820
spaces	delimiter
if an spaces or a new line is the delimiter of the strings you pasted in your question we can recover the original array with copy and paste from your post

377827
openbsd	solaris
probably overkill but if you re using v11 you can also install the pkg network firewall solaris firewall is derived from openbsd pf in case that would meet your needs

377827
solaris	bsd
you ll find docs on oracle s site noting how to use ipfilters but since it s based on bsd s ipfilter you can also look at that documentation as well as other examples that can be found for solaris and bsd

377830
hid	keyboard
the new keyboard has an unusual hid descriptor and sends one extra data byte

377830
hid	keyboard
hid descriptors of the new keyboard via

377830

hid descriptor of the old keyboard interface 0003 17ef 6022.0087 only one keyboard interface

377847
bash	zsh
but at least in bash and ksh and zsh they could be selected just as easy

377868
wan	lan
router add a port forwarding rule to map port 80 on the wan side to the internal lan ip address of your computer that s running the vm if in nat mode or to the vm s ip address if running in bridged mode

377873
hid	keyboard
here is a translation of the raw hid descriptor of 0003 17ef 609b.0089 the new keyboard using hidrd

377873
hid	keyboard
however the switch to usage page keyboard in the next input field from usage page led in the output field occurs in the middle of the block and apparently that confuses the kernel hid descriptor parser so that it interprets this input field also as leds which makes no sense at all and prevents it from translating the keys as it should

377881
jobs	cron
in rhel oel you can list the cron jobs created by all users

377908
filesystems	btrfs
i ve needed to run btrfs balance on my single device filesystems as i was getting enospc even though there was indeed free space

377917
uninstall	upgrade
btw if someone has the same problem and need to upgrade this firmware you need to unplug all pci-e graphics and uninstall in windows with display driver uninstaller in safe mode all amd or nvidia drivers ever installed

377940
ubuntu	debian
the proprietary driver stopped being updated a while ago and is no longer compatible with the x server used in debian 9 or in any other recent distribution â for example ubuntu 16.04 and later arenâ t supported either

377944
hex	binary
be sure to use the -h option to get hex output since shell scripts don t play nicely with binary

377945
cpu	processors
if you have more than one cpu processors in this sense on your mainboard this does not properly work

377945
cpu	hyperthreading
i have got a intel r core tm i7-3740qm cpu 2.70ghz 4 physical cores hyperthreading

377945
cpu	processors
since everyone uses cores cpu and processors in another context i introduce a nomenclature for my answer here

377945
cpu	processors
cpu cpu processors

377945
processors	hyperthreading
if the intel- processors is able to perform hyperthreading the number of virtual cores is twice the number of physical cores i am not sure how other processors vendors call this feature

377945
cpu	processors
processors intel r core tm i7-3740qm cpu 2.70ghz

377954
udp	tcp
you really should check for all listening tcp udp port if you want to know what your server is serving

folder	directory
i need to delete all sub directory and their contents in a given folder whilst leaving a particular sub directory

377973

ftp	smb
needing to link a smb share directory to a empty directory with a ftp share

378056
filesystems	btrfs
unlike most conventional filesystems btrfs uses a two-stage allocator

378056
filesystems	btrfs
the most common case these days when you get a -enospc error on btrfs is that the filesystems has run out of room for data or metadata in existing chunks and can t allocate a new chunk

378056
filesystems	btrfs
you can verify that this is the case by running btrfs fi df on the filesystems that threw the error

378064
stdout	stderr
i tried sending stdout stderr to dev null but apparently that s not doing the trick

378065
ubuntu	mint
any answers for either removing package no longer used after i switch to icewm or removing any default mint ubuntu packages a developer doesn t need would be appreciated

378069
filesystems	ntfs
the key is that the filesystems image is really small just to hold the filesystems 2mb for ext2 or ntfs and it takes minimal size when on tmpfs with initial size around 256kb so the flash is not hurt at all

378095
ubuntu	centos
and it is only with centos 7 because with ubuntu xenial64 it works

xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
the number of available inodes is often determined when a filesystems is created and canâ t be changed some filesystems such as btrfs or xfs allocate inodes dynamically

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am using linux mint 18.2 cinnamon version based on ubuntu 16.04 but i was told i can t post in askubuntu

378221
filesystems	btrfs
subvolumes in btrfs are functionally equivalent to zvols from zfs except they are inherently rooted somewhere in the filesystems itself

378222
filesystems	btrfs
it looks like you ve got a filesystems which is using the raid1 profile which means you ll need to add a fourth device temporarily so that btrfs can allocate new chunks

378223
sudo	passwd
sudo prompt s me correct for passwd and than apt-get abbort s after y n for installing or not

378229
xfs	btrfs
while this does not perform quite as well as ext4 or xfs on top of md raid10 it still performs far better than the btrfs raid10 implementation or running a single btrfs device on top of md raid10 on the same devices and provides the same data safety guarantees

378235
stdout	stderr
ie on a separate line telling to redirect stderr to the same thing stdout is going to your terminal

378285
subshell	ifs
when writing defensive code i d recommend that the clause either be run in a subshell or ifs and shellopts saved and restored around the block

378332
folder	directory
customize further by filtering the find command to directory of interest either specifying the list of directory instead of or excluding folder like proc dev home and tmp

note also that lts is not an official debian project. so presumably the jessie linux kernel would be supported till then

qubes does have a debian os template that is similar to ubuntu in many ways and can be easily installed from dom0 like so

installation	upgrade
i upgrade to fedora 26 the day of the official public release earlier this week and long story short ended up screwing up my installation so i did a partial reformatting

378664
bash	zsh
zsh is my default shell and i have a plethora of plugins installed oh my zsh fzf etc. so i figured one of these might ve gone out of whack during after the upgrade so i switched to bash same thing autocomplete takes a good 10-30 seconds depending on dir size to come up

378664
fish	tcsh
i installed some more shells to troubleshoot the cause and to my surprise tcsh and fish work absolutely fine

378664
bash	zsh
under the same setting these two perform perfectly fine where bash and zsh would hang for a good +10 seconds

378664
bash	zsh
i ve done the usual diagnostics with bash whose config is pretty vanilla compared to my zsh install strace set -x etc. but couldn t find much of interest

378664
bash	zsh
still my gut tells me this must be some sort of weird hashing caching problem of the completion engine that somehow affects both zsh and bash but i don t really have any evidence to support that

378664
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
i think what s really intriguing here is the fact that tcsh and fish have 0 problem autocompleting anything i throw at them but bash and zsh don t

edit - i tried ubuntu instead of debian and it says it can t detect any other operating systems on the hdd even though the windows partition is there

sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
the problem is that in order to mount a veracrypt volume you need to supply a sudo passwd so i added veracrypt to etc sudoers

378732
pop-up	dialog	sudo	passwd
this is because i want my drives to be mounted with permissions for my user account and because when you use veracrypt to mount a drive it automatically prompts you with a pop-up dialog for your sudo passwd anyway

however i ve checked the swappiness in one of my machines running ubuntu 16.04 and they have it set to 60 same as the one with debian and have considerably less memory than this one too

379555
ubuntu	debian
so...my question is what do ubuntu does different than debian that may prevent the described behavior

379555
ubuntu	debian
or it maybe has to do with the kernel version debian s 4.9.0-3-amd64 vs ubuntu s 4.4.0-83-generic

is it possible to configure audit daemons to log all systemd calls for every process running in the systemd

more recently swap files do not work if the filesystems is btrfs so it is simplest for distributions to always create swap as a partition

the cron daemon is usually sleeping while it waits for when it does work

how would i pass in the passwd at the login for both the username and the sudo

379837

at the very least the user should be using key exchange for the ssh login and allow the use to execute the desired commands via sudo with no passwd

the error is no relation with hard disks and can be ignored unless you cannot use the keyboard and mouse

speaking from personal experience adding software is non-trivial because the cd itself is a yum dnf repository and you have to regenerate the metadata

dosbox is a pc-and-dos emulator it provides both the hardware emulation and the bios dos software layer so it doesnâ t need freedos or any other dos

building on the previous post where the requirement was to have cron jobs send status messages via a single command line as posted here

381132

cron jobs always run in the user s home directory so it is always good practice to use a full directory path to the attachment file

381134

improve your daemons for interaction with systemd

381279
daemons	systemd
if you implement both sides of systemd and your daemons s interactions you can handle it perfectly

381279

if you re using bash zsh you can use the dotglob option to change the meaning of so that it includes files and directories beginning with a dot yash also has a dotglob option

381472
stdout	stderr
i currently hide all of stdout and stderr from my remote calls because i don t want them to taint my stdout and stderr

381472
stdout	stderr
how would one allow logging or redirecting of stdout and stderr from the remote calls using ssh to be available to whoever is calling my script

381472
stdout	stderr
so if someone calls my script in the grand scheme of thins much bigger than this example we should never see anything output to screen except what i echo to stdout or stderr

381473
for-loop	loops
not the only way but the best and simplest way is indeed a loops and preferably a for-loop

if you install software using package managers such as rpm in fedora and redhat and apt in debian and ubuntu the applications usually will be installed in folders such as usr bin usr local bin and opt

to use a different disk for the applications you may 1 mount the other disk as opt or a sub directory of opt or 2 create a symbolic link that redirect the folder opt or one of its sub directory to a folder in the other disk

needrestart detects daemons which need restarting and restarts them with the appropriate systemd context if systemd is in use

381988
daemons	systemd
upgrading a live systemd minimises the risk of ending up with an unreachable server and keeps the systemd services available although apt could be improved in this regard too since daemons can be stopped for a long time during upgrades â but thatâ s another issue

381992
postfix	dovecot
after i added the aliases i added it to postfix with postalias aliases then i restarted my postfix service and then my dovecot service

381996
jobs	cron
in my case i had 5 five cron jobs and they were sending mail by default

381996
jobs	cron
so i needed to add this expression at the end of cron jobs

382013
unix	solaris
i am using solaris o s and a newbie to unix and this forum

382014
symlink	dotfiles
if the user wanted a little more they could put it in a dotfiles folder and symlink the files or use gnu stow to handle that

382019
solaris	aix
solaris aix date

382019
solaris	aix
sadly there is no solution possible with only solaris aix date

382026
debian	linux
i have a kiosk linux debian computer

382060
sudo	passwd
when i run sudo and enter my passwd a subsequent invocation of sudo within a few minutes will not need the passwd to be re-entered

382061
sudo	passwd
once a user has been authenticated ... the user may then use sudo without a passwd for a short period of time 5 minutes unless

382073
sudo	passwd
a program like sudo might be configured to allow users in group 0 to execute commands via it without a passwd but in the unix kernel ignoring capabilities the extra abilities are all associated with user id 0 not group id 0

382097
stdout	stderr
from your cshell command line do this to separate the stdout stderr streams

382122
ubuntu	debian
to install pre-compiled software if you have a package for your distro a .rpm or .deb file then use the distro packaging tools to install it - dpkg on debian ubuntu rpm for fedora etc

382122
dnf	yum
if you don t have a copy of the package yet but it is available as a package for your distro then use apt debian or dnf or yum fedora to fetch and install it

382124
fish	zsh
are not ignored contrary to what more sensible shells like pdksh zsh or fish do

382124
bash	zsh
ksh and zsh in ksh emulation handle it correctly but bash presumes you re requesting dotfiles

382128
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems type ntfs

382168
stdout	stderr
the problem here is that sshd waits for end-of-file on the pipe it is reading the command s stdout not the stderr one for some reason at least with the version i m testing on from

382172
dnf	zypper
i know for certain that emerge pacman and dnf support this and i m pretty sure zypper does too

382203
opera	google-chrome
usually i use a web browser either google-chrome or opera an editor atom and a terminal

382220
lapack	openblas
as you may know numpy is a dependency for tensorflow and numpy has blas openblas atlas lapack as optional dependency to improve performance

382220
cudnn	openblas	lapack	openblas	tensorflow	cudnn
in my case i am using cuda and cudnn so basically most of the computation is done in gpu through tensorflow libcudnn and therefore cuda my doubt here is if should i care about if numpy have been built or not with blas atlas lapack openblas support

382221
vmware	esx	centos	linux
i m running linux centos 7 as a virtual machine on top of vmware s esx hypervisor

382222
solaris	aix
here is the final script that works and outputs text and date go back 9 months and picks first day of that month into a file on solaris aix kshell

382281
daemons	systemd	jobs	cron
it s also too coarse-grained and potentially dangerous for this job...there s a lot more happening on your systemd at any given time than just compiling a program all sorts of background tasks daemons cron jobs etc

382294
bash	zsh
this is how i call everything from bash zsh

382307
bash	zsh
bash 3.1 used to behave like zsh

382311
stdout	stderr
to get the stdout and stderr both on console and in a nohup.out file execute the following before executing your nohup command

382311
stdout	stderr
this will not create the nohup.out while displaying stdout and stderr on the console

382313
folder	directory
but i have to some times visit those folder which i have never visited before so sub-directory bakfiles2 may not exist there can i somehow create that backup directory with current timestamp as to avoid conflictions with any existing directory on the fly when with single copy command or bash script

382329
stdout	stderr
this is what happens when you pipeline stdout and don t suppress stderr

382336
versioning	upgrade
i ve got myself into a bit of trouble trying to upgrade the versioning of postgres on a server and now i want to revert back as it s caused some issues

382340
apache	nginx
to achieve the latter make apache nginx on the host to work as reverse proxy redirecting each domain to a different apache-php container thanks to docker port mapping

382340
apache	nginx
you don t even need to have apache nginx on the host it can be in a container also

382340
post	get
my steps summarized i can not post more than to links when i get enough reputation i will edit and add them

382347
cpu	irq
once keyboard pressed apic raises irq line to the cpu

382357
put	get
put it in the background get a coffee and let it finish

382360
filesystems	fat
the host laptop that is being used is lubuntu the iso image that was copied is ubuntu v16.04 and the usb drive is 8 gb fat filesystems type

382380
bash	zsh
for zsh the same questions except that why the first example outputs 2 instead of 1+1 as for bash

382380
bash	zsh
both bash and zsh use dynamic scoping at least in the examples

382380
bash	zsh
the option -g of typeset in both bash and zsh means to declare a nonexisting variable with the global scope or to change an existing variable to have the global scope

382393
bash	zsh
in all of bash zsh

382398
qstring	qobject
qobject connect no such slot mainui setcaption qstring

382419
wan	lan
i have two zones lan type bridge and wan

382419
wan	lan
i set the firewall to forward from lan to wan

382421
debian	linux
for graphical or desktop users of debian and other linux distros it is important that a graphical tool be provided to make bootable .iso images on usb pen-drives

382481
cat	tee
with fd 1 being redirected twice zsh when the mulltios option is enabled on by default would do an internal tee to forward the output to both destinations by running an internal process that reads cat s output and writes it to both destinations

382490
children	parent
since the processes p2 p3 .... are all children of the same parent p1 then all the processes are in the same process group so any signal sigalrm

382511
mouse	keyboard
when i looked in lsusb i could see external mouse and keyboard were recognized

382537
debian	linux
debian does not include the minor version number in etc os-release despite the clear indication in the manual that minor versions are allowed and despite the inclusion of minor version numbers there by other linux distributions

382537
debian	linux
this is the linux kernel package in debian with linux version 3.16.43 and debian version 2+deb8u2

382539
debian	centos
the centos boot menu shows me the debian and windows systems but cannot successfully boot them

382539
debian	centos
i tried simply copying the relevant entry from centos s grub.cfg file to debian s

382539
debian	centos
since i plan on removing debian i would like centos s boot menu from its boot partition on dev sdc to be used but if i have to create a separate boot partition on dev sda i can live with that

382579
filesystems	btrfs
dev sda2 contains a btrfs filesystems with the uuid blah-blah-1

382588
installation	upgrade
i made an upgrade on my arch installation i don t know if it s the upgrade that caused this or something else but now when i try to boot on my arch i get

382628
bash	subshell
in bash one way to explicitly put commands in a subshell is to place the commands inside parens ...

382630
debian	linux
one can easily activate it with super-l on most linux systems including the common debian variants

382631
debian	linux
short answer is appropriate value for zram at least on debian stretch with linux 4.9 i believe that is best value

382640
spaces	delimiter
with masterfile containing the original data and using the substr function of awk we ignore the first letter of the first and third spaces delimiter fields leaving us with the numbers to compare

382651
mouse	keyboard
another option is to acquire a keyboard and or mouse with a power switch

382695
bash	zsh
the shell s primary purpose is for interactive and or scripted job control not to do complex text processing by itself bash and zsh are a lot more capable than plain old sh in this regard but a dedicated text processing language like awk or perl is always going to be better and faster

382720
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
lists the public keys dsa ecdsa ed25519 rsa that can be used for logging in as this user

382769
debian	linux
i use in virtualbox to host old debian linux 2.4.27-3-286

382770
ubuntu	debian
so is this a new behavior under ubuntu debian etc

382777
bash	zsh
in other areas where zsh is divergent it s because ksh and bash are sticking closer to the original bourne shell

382777
bash	zsh
all shells heirloom sh modern ksh bash and zsh seem to handle the first line the same way

382837
jobs	cron
printer definitions samba passwords cron ed jobs default shell

382844
versioning	upgrade
if your versioning of linux mint is still supported and you are happy with your current system then you don t need to upgrade

382844
versioning	upgrade
but if i don t upgrade when my versioning stops being supported i can no longer install or upgrade individual packages with apt-get

382844
versioning	upgrade
what i would like to do is to retain the ability to install individual new packages and new versioning of already-installed packages but without ever doing an overall upgrade of everything on the system

382849
stdout	stderr
is it possible to determine if the stdout stderr are hooked up to the stdin of another process

382862
ubuntu	linux
i m searching for some sort of web interface to install on my linux nas armhf ubuntu 16.04 that would allow me to share folders containing pictures and videos with my friends and family

382880
ubuntu	linux
from windows i used diskinternals linux reader and i can confirm that all my ubuntu files are there

382881
installation	upgrade
i recently tried to upgrade my jessie installation to stretch by altering my etc apt sources.list to point to the stretch repositories and then running apt-get update and apt-get upgrade

382889
backslash	double-quotes
use double-quotes and escape a double quote you want in the output with a backslash

382910
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu are based on debian so it uses debian packages so the .deb package will run better than .rpm

382918
versioning	upgrade
as for stephen kitt addressing possible problems with configuration files what happens is that the upgrade will touch the diverted file and if the configuration has significant changes for instance the odds are greater that upgrading to a new debian versioning the daemon won t boot and that situation has to be addressed manually

382918
debian	linux
imo dkpg-divert is one of the functionalities that shows the true flexibility of the debian package manager compared to other linux distributions

382932
zsh	tcsh
where foo in tcsh also in zsh just tells you where foo is located in your or more exactly the different foo commands the shells knows about by looking in the list of shell builtins and keywords aliases and executable files found via a lookup of mapped to the array

382961
ubuntu	linux
yes there are only few viruses for ubuntu linux but it s also because of good security and default unprivileged user

382962
debian	linux
msmtp is distributed in debian so it is likely to be included in other linux distributions

382962
mutt	msmtp
msmtp is an smtp client that can be used to send mails from mutt and probably other muas mail user agents

382964
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
it s true that except for ksh and its clones pdksh and further derivatives and bash all other shells with arrays csh tcsh rc es akanga fish zsh yash have expand to all the members of the array

382964
zsh	tcsh
but in both yash and zsh when in sh emulation the two bourne-like shells in that list that expansion is still subject to split+glob and still empty removal even in zsh even when not in sh emulation so you still need to use the awkward syntax or or in zsh which are hardly easier to type to preserve the list csh and tcsh have similar issues

382964
zsh	tcsh
csh tcsh zsh don t support exporting arrays though nowadays that may not sound like a big limitation

382969
daemons	systemd
in order to solve this problem pulseaudio must be started with root privileges so that it runs as a systemd wide daemons of which there is only for all users

382969
daemons	systemd
note that user daemons is not the same as systemd daemons

382969
daemons	systemd
to make this persistent and for the pulseaudio daemons to start automatically on startup it needs to added as a systemd service

382969
daemons	systemd
pulseaudio will not start a user daemonâ² when it already finds a systemd daemons this is why this solution works

382969
daemons	systemd
the official pulseaudio documentation advices against using pulseaudio as a systemd daemons

382972
bash	zsh
lets say i print this to a terminal tested with bash and zsh in a genome-terminal in a vm running a fresh linux mint

382992
ubuntu	linux
but now there seems to be some kind of new feature in the linux kernel ubuntu or kde that suspends programs if they are not in the active x session

382992
switching	screens
bob s splash screens appears and i immediately switching back to alice using ctrl + alt + f7

383017
xfce	gnome
one could also ask why they went back to gnome as a default desktop but these are just decisions they make and which their users basically ignore since you can make the systems the way you want that is to get xfce desktops i don t install xdebian as in xubuntu i just install debian core xorg and xfce and off i go

383021
ubuntu	debian
the answer to my rpcbind point is fairly simple people can try to promote debian and it has many cool features but it is not as polished and friendly or even reliable for someone trying to learn as ubuntu is

383024
debian	linux
debian and other linux distributions do provide user space tools like iptables to manage that functionality

383053
lvm	btrfs	lvm	mdadm	mdadm	btrfs
yes and it s probably the quickest easiest way if all you re interested in is mdadm software raid and not lvm or btrfs etc - but the raid device names are arbitrary so you can t just assume they ll match - most will but they don t have to and the default standard may change in future

383055
starttls	smtps
it even supports encrypted smtps using starttls smtps or submission and smtps auth

383055
debian	linux
s-nail is available pre-packaged for several linux distributions on debian apt-get install s-nail

383062
for-loop	loops
you can loops through your files with a for-loop or use find -exec as you like

383077
debian	linux
we are currently setting up a system where we are using a linux computer debian that acts as a wifi control and router

383097
chown	sudo
when i am using the command sudo chown -r root boot i am getting an error operation not permitted

383103
ubuntu	debian
first off i do want to repeat what has already been said debian caters to a rather different group of users than many other mainstream distributions particularly so ubuntu

383103
ubuntu	debian
remember that ubuntu is a debian derivative and to this day still retains a great similarity to debian

383103
openbsd	debian
debian is a bit like openbsd in that regard just not as extreme

383119
next	except
these are nested folders with nothing in them except for the next folder

383166
bash	subshell
you can propagate functions from bash to bash subshell

383190
spaces	delimiter
as you don t have any delimiter like spaces or tabulator it need some fixup with sed

383193
ansible	puppet
there has been substantial work on the management of linux vms with large communities around ansible puppet and others

383196
bash	zsh
you could also use zsh instead of bash where read -k which predates ksh93 or bash s read -n -n reads one character from the terminal and handles d by itself returns non-zero if that character is entered and doesn t treat newline specially

383199
kde	gnome
as mentioned above dbus starts requested services on-demand so this is osmething that you can definately disable automatic startup of but it probably will be started by other components of your system especially if you re using gnome or kde for your desktop

383207
folder	directory
with . usr bin cinelerra your shell will look for a folder called usr in the current directory a folder called bin inside that and cinelerra inside the latter

383309
sudo	passwd
the idea is to force the user to use the sudo instead of sharing a single root passwd between all users and using the sudo comes with some advantages for example

383323
stdout	stderr
in sh you can only pipe stdout to another command so you have to swap stdout and stderr first

383323
stdout	stderr
duplicate stdout which is currently redirected to the pipe and redirect stderr to it

383323
stdout	stderr
duplicate file descriptor 3 which is currently redirected in the original stderr and redirect stdout to it

383323
stdout	stderr
in this state we have swapped stdout and stderr and the pipeline receives stderr

383323
stdout	stderr
we then let tee do its job to write stderr to the file and output it again on its own stdout

383324
dnf	yum
after a sudo dnf -y update host and sudo yum -y update

383330
ready	each
the function might return data an end-of-file indication or an error other than one indicating that it is blocked and in each of these cases the descriptor shall be considered ready for reading.

383333
put	get
i m trying to get this base64 decoded and then put back at the end of a line but i still don t have that part figured out yet whether if i can use awk or sed

383334
vlan	packets
so i m able to see the vlan tagged packets only with vconfig using that specific vlan id

383334
vlan	packets
how can i see all packets without knowing the vlan id to add on vconfig

383337
vlan	packets
try using tshark -i eth0.10 -w home debian capture testcapture8.pcap to capture packets for vlan 10

383365
bash	zsh
if i say yes it simply logs in and my shell changes from bash to zsh

383411
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	debian
but for having checked some time ago i can tell that none of the charsets that may be available for use in a locale in a debian freebsd or solaris systems have such characters which is good enough for me and why i ve settled on

383411
bash	zsh
bash zsh alternatives

383411
bash	zsh
with bash and zsh assuming the output has no nuls you can also do

383411
bash	zsh
to get the exit status of cmd you can do in bash but not in zsh

383411
fish	subshell
in fish command substitution is with cmd and doesn t involve a subshell

383422
folder	directory
the folder i am writing to and files directory in it have permissions 775

383444
sudo	passwd
it seems that for some reason when apper asks for the root passwd when installing deinstalling or updating packages it doesn t make use of the sudo command why

383444
qstring	qobject
qobject connect no such slot mainui setcaption qstring

383446
folder	directory
the link without the trailing slash is at a lower level than you would normally think of it a link to the file called folder a file which just happens to be a directory

383446
folder	directory
the link with the trailing slash is explicitly to a directory called folder

383487
uniq	grep
i ve found some ways using grep and a perl script which both work to remove rows based on the regex but none of them provide the count which is why uniq is much more ideal

383492
sorting	grouping
i m lacking a feature in nemo which is a stable sorting or sorting by multiple attributes grouping

383527
ubuntu	debian
see also how to set up apt caching server on ubuntu or debian

383537
ubuntu	linux
i am working on linux ubuntu and i want a bash script whose output is to convert the timezone 7 hours in advance from my server time

383545
mtu	pppoe
the hypervisor is responsible to establish a pppoe connection to the internet and the ppp0 interface has an mtu of 1492 bytes

383574
bash	zsh
the normal behavior followed by all bourne posix shells dash ksh pdksh mksh bash zsh even when not in sh emulation mode busybox sh bourne shell â is that read -r line strips leading and trailing whitespace characters

383574
bash	zsh
calling read with an implicit variable name is a ksh extension which bash and zsh imitate

383584
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome fails utterly firefox almost succeeds and xmlto wants tex which has in past been a problem install on this box

383589
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
i ve had to import gnupg keys on the mirror server to fix issues with mint clients i mirror mint debian and ubuntu for some lab use and because i can but no issues with debian

383613
spaces	delimiter
i have an alternate solution which involves read file using while loop and by using cut command based on delimiter and storing it in variable based on position and replacing the spaces by using sed and append all the splitted variable in to one variable and append it in a new file

383615
spaces	delimiter
the syntax used to replace spaces with literal in index column and below is showing each index position based on | delimiter

383650
tunnel	vpn
i have set a vpn tunnel from my laptop at home to my desktop at the lab

383655
tunnel	vpn
sshfs is probably the easiest to get working for this purpose - certainly easier than setting up a vpn to tunnel smb or nfs securely

383655
pull	push
another useful alternative worth considering is to set up a git server somewhere where both your home desktop and the lab workstation have access to edit wherever you happen to be with whatever editor you like and use git push and git pull to keep them in sync

383657
nas	qnap
in my qnap nas ssh and

383723
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome opera and firefox are supported

383750
stdout	stderr
so the stdout and stderr of of the aide process is getting directed to null the parent bash shell is writing to its parent

383770
bash	zsh
in shells where export and other local typeset ... is both a keyword and builtin ksh bash and recent versions of zsh in

383772
debian	linux
the version of gettext mentioned was released in 2016 while the linux kernel version dates from 2003 with debian that might only be ten years older than the gettext version

383774
debian	mint	debian	linux
why is mate desktop listed as upgrade in a cinnamon desktop in linux mint debian betsy with this commands

383850
versioning	upgrade
i ve got a debian server with postfix for years now i ve decided to upgrade it to the newest versioning currently i m running on 6.0.10 which is not supported for a year and a half

383850
versioning	upgrade
should i upgrade it from versioning to versioning 6 - 7

383856
dnf	yum
for installing dependencies of source packages both yum and dnf provide the a builddep command

383873
ubuntu	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux
now if i could only make it permanent with some linux distros i use ubuntu fedora gentoo bsd and others which are all different

383881
folder	directory
after successful attempt directory will be created in tmp created folder name by systen

383900
freebsd	linux
i want to apply the following from the freebsd to the linux systems

383904
sudoers	visudo
add following line to the etc sudoers file by using the command visudo

383912
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
the folder of your music library flac ogg mp3 ...

383912
mp3	flac
the flac files transformed to mp3 vbr high quality

383918
sudo	passwd
the point is root may or may not have a passwd that is needed to use su -c and sudo may or may not be allowed to run docker

383954
sudo	passwd
echo passwd | sudo -u nobody -s command

383954
sudo	passwd
echo passwd | sudo â

383962
ubuntu	linux
in your case i assume you re talking about linux live cds like the ones provided by ubuntu arch linux and just about any other major linux distribution

383965
jobs	cron
cron jobs are started with the current working directory being the home directory of the user

383965
folder	directory
or since that script is not specific to the folder you want to run it store it in a generic place like bin and pass the path of the directory as argument

383971
disk	ram
the live environment works entirely in your computerâ s ram writing nothing to disk

383998
iperf	nmap
this is for any and all cli based tools nslookup ping iperf nmap curl wget ect

383998
ubuntu	debian
i must be missing some simple additional configuration that is required for debian that is slightly different than ubuntu

384015
opera	firefox
maybe i need to mention that firefox works pretty fine with youtube and other videos that do not work on opera

384029
google-chrome	firefox
browsing with firefox is extremely smooth even smoother than browsing with google-chrome on my host machine

384056
jobs	cron
my ubuntu vm does not run cron jobs with a tty not even when i log in and run the command from the user s env

384060
switching	screens
it is possible to connect my laptop to any network equipment like managed switching or firewall via mini-usb port on them then use screens to connect to its tty

384060
unix	bsd
assume operating system is linux unix bsd hardware itself doesn t support emulation of terminal by usb port

384064
freebsd	linux
i m coming from linux i installed freebsd 11 xfced all things is right but i have some problem not dangrous the most important is sound when i installed xfce4-volumed some people told me that isn t correct to install xfce4-volume i removed it but know when i up or down the sound it did it suddenly

384088
fish	bash
i just recently switched to the fish shell from bash and i am having trouble sourcing my dircolors template file to get custom colors to appear for certain file extensions

384092
debian	linux
i understand that aslr can be disabled in linux by setting proc sys kernel randomize_va_space to 0 but my debian system has value 2 in it

384109
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
you can use a filesystems btrfs xfs which supports snapshots for both your os and data volume s

384114
bash	zsh
if you re familiar with bash but have heard of zsh and it s powerful filename globbing syntax you could

384141
freebsd	linux
fcitx is an input method framework for the x window system that runs on linux and unix systems like freebsd

if you re talking about things currently available within the debian ubuntu repositories i know of at least two options offhand

384198
ubuntu	debian
the packages currently in debian ubuntu are based on this fork

384201
gentoo	linux
also the host is running gentoo gnu linux

384208
post	get
in your form you have and because you use post you actually get the message

384240
spaces	delimiter
if so use spaces as delimiter and then you can easily convert the input string to an array and iterate over it s contents

384241
folder	directory
i am trying to set up a script for copying symbolic links folder data and my idea is to set up a single folder and to create several symlinks in this folder where the rsync will then copy the data within those directory

384245
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 16.04

384245
centos	linux
linux centos 7

384268
disk	ram
compiling big things like the linux kernel or the libc can require a lot of disk space which will turn into ram space in your situation if i m not mistaken again i don t know lfs

384281
ubuntu	linux
i ve resized my windows partition in order to install linux but after several hours trying to make a bootable key with ubuntu 16.04.3 lts on it i still cannot manage to boot from the key

384306
debian	linux
i m running debian 9.1 with kde and am still new to gnu linux

384313
folder	directory
configuration files in the home folder are always hidden or in hidden directory so my solution is to have rsync backup all non-hidden files and only backup hidden files contained in a whitelist excluding all other hidden files

384315
daemons	launchd
the nixos manual suggests configuring as below to launchd emacs as a daemons with some packages

384321
sysv	systemd
you need to use sysv init systemd

384322
bash	zsh
with zsh or bash you could use a redirection to a process substitution

384322
bash	zsh
sill with zsh and bash you can also do

384333
sudo	passwd
when you execute sudo command the system prompts you for your current user accountâ s passwd before running command as the root user

384341
sudoers	passwd
and it is good idea to configure your sudoers to do not ask for a passwd for the two command of course

384383
ubuntu	debian
i know that network works because i am duel-booting ubuntu alongside the debian system and i have wifi working with ubuntu

384384
debian	linux
i m using debian 9.1 with kde but i m still new to gnu linux in general

384391
daemons	systemd
in the startup and shutdown - background services configuration applet make sure the keyboard daemons service enables switching keyboard layout through shortcuts or systemd tray is checked and in the running state

384426
ethernet	wireless
for instance i put wi-fi adapter to my comp then i connect comp and router through the ethernet and after editting some configs i will have wireless access to the internet

384441
unix	aix
i m with aix unix tls v6

384447
bash	zsh
the syntax from ksh93 and now found on most modern bourne-like shells including zsh bash mksh freebsd sh uses the standard as in c and most other languages as opposed to echo syntax for octal escapes

384453
packets	pcap
it appears that snort does not write the alert log when processing a pcap file however it should write the correct packets capture log var log snort snort.log.1502097194

384464
sudoers	visudo
edit your etc sudoers visudo as follows

384479
ubuntu	linux
after upgrading my ubuntu to 17.07 i am not able to install any software i m a fresh linux users

384491
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r user .trash-1000

384520
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
on modern linux systems and i believe also freebsd and possibly recent versions of solaris dev is a temporary in-memory filesystem populated by the kernel or udev if you use systemd because they don t trust the kernel to do almost anything

384522
ubuntu	centos
now i have been mostly experienced with ubuntu and centos is though similar has some differences

384533
ubuntu	debian
for example devmem2 was rejected from debian but an ubuntu package was created nevetheless

384534
min	max
i m trying to create a script that will get a word min 3 chars max 10 chars as its input then it will reverse the position of the characters

384539
spaces	delimiter
awk uses a spaces as a delimiter

384553
google-chrome	firefox
internet browsers firefox 52.2.x google-chrome 59.x

384569
debian	linux
given debian linux and assuming there s only one long_running_command

384570
min	max
i m trying to get a word min 2 max 5 chars as its input

384571
debian	linux
so i deleted and formatted the linux partitions and re-installed debian on a new partition

384608
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
so in bash and zsh and similar csh and tcsh

384639
filesystems	xfs
i ve checked the filesystems it is xfs

384640
kde	kubuntu
i am using kubuntu 16.04 64-bit with kde plasma 5.5.5 and qt 5.5.1

384698
awk	ksh
with gnu tools gnu shell or other shell with support for ksh process substitution gnu xargs or compatible like freebsd s for -a -r -0 gnu mv for -t awk for nextfile also supported by some other implementations

384702
put	get
if you run sleep 10 at the prompt of an interactive shell the shell will put that job in the foreground through an ioctl on the tty device that tells the terminal line discipline which process group is the foreground one so only sleep will get a sigint upon c and the interactive shell will not so it s not useful to test that behaviour

384704
sudo	passwd
first of all using su username you have to provide the passwd of username to be able to switch into its account while with sudo su - username for a second with your own passwd you will become root then without using any other passwd you are running the su - uesrname to switch into the username

384704
sudo	passwd
it s not a good idea to share a single passwd between users so it s best to not use su at all instead we can use sudo also there is no need to run something like

384760
debian	linux
i have recently started to learn linux and debian is the most likeable to me

384765
stdout	stderr
only the stdout stream is being sent to the piped grep command the error messages are in a seperate output stream stderr

384765
stdout	stderr
so even though you are seeing the error messages in your terminal session due to the fact that the terminal is printing both stdout and stderr to the console your grep command is not receiving those lines of output

384765
stdout	stderr
the pipe | only connects stdout to the next command s stdin so the stderr does not go into the next command

384780
g++	gcc
i have a hard time building some projects that check the version of gcc and g++ to be less than or equal to 5

384780
g++	gcc
here is some information about binaries related to gcc and g++ at my usr bin

384792
daemons	systemd
detaching from the controlling terminal is one of the steps traditionally required to start a background process for example a systemd logging daemons

384800
ubuntu	debian
the whole thing is largely irrelevant today except for the lsb_release command being the only reliable way to determine the distro you re on because it s not been updated in years and includes things like qt 3 and it was never well supported on ubuntu or debian systems to begin with because it was largely based on red hat

384818
filesystems	hfs
the filesystems is hfs

384823
debian	mint
for mint debian systems add nomodeset to grub kernel boot parameters

384836
installation	upgrade
either install the relevant php 5 package or upgrade your php installation to php 7 to resolve the conflict

384891
daemons	systemd
and that docker is not quite intended to run systemd inside it only a single daemons

384916
stdout	stderr
in my situation i redirect stdout and stderr but it also displays following in the log file

384920
ubuntu	centos
tested both on ubuntu 16.04 and centos 7

384931
min	max
i want to print the min and max using the values in both column 3 and 4

384936
min	max
but i guess you are looking for something like below to find min max within 2columns not min in 3rd column and max in 4th column only as above is finding

384940
min	max
short datamash solution for separate min max calculation within 3rd 4th columns

384946
freeswitch	pbx
i want to turn off buffering of sip calls in freeswitch pbx software

384946
freeswitch	pbx
i have two sip clients and freeswitch pbx

384970
asterisk	pbx
i don t use freepbx but asterisk as a pbx so i don t know if it s a feature or just the computation delay

384970
rtp	sip	asterisk	pbx
maybe you should consider use the equivalent of direct_media feature found in asterisk so the sip negotiation is done through the pbx but the rtp payload is direct between peers

384990
centos	linux
running centos linux release 7.3.1611 bash 4.2.46-21.el7_3.x86_64

385027
udp	tcp
ie i have two interface eth0 and tun0 and i would like all tun0 tcp and udp connexions are redirected to a socks5 server .

385032
versioning	upgrade
the only potential caveat is that it will upgrade the package if there is a newer versioning but i don t think there is any way without embedding a shell script into the playbook that you can work around that you would have to parse the output of apk versioning to figure out if it would update it or not

385041
ubuntu	linux
can i produce the package directly on the busybox or do i need another linux like ubuntu

385052
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	xfce	kubuntu	xfce	kde	kde	kubuntu
however described behavioral was also found on other zenbooks and other used oses like linux mint 18.2 xfce linux mint 18.2 kde recent kde neon peppermint os 8 xubuntu 16.04 kubuntu 16.04 and ubuntu 16.04 however

385083
bash	zsh
if you can use zsh instead of bash then it s a lot easier

385090
stdout	stderr
i think you could remove the reason being you do not need to pipe either the stdout or stderr into the next conditional if anything you can just use

385099
versioning	upgrade
note that i had the same problems with the previous versioning kernel build recently and removed the old virtualbox packages before system upgrade reinstallation

385137
daemons	systemd
systemd administration tools and daemons

385140
debian	linux
kali linux debian can t see sinhala fonts in chrome or firfox

385147
packets	multicast
note that both with udp singlecast and udp multicast you ll have to deal with dropped packets and resending unless the data is video audio where the occasional dropped packets doesn t matter but then you don t have to implement your own solution just use a ready-made one so use the appropriate protocol pgm ...

385179
mutt	msmtp
i use mutt with two different imap accounts and have configured smtp accounts a and b with msmtp and mutt

385181
redhat	fedora
in etc bashrc file in fedora redhat i see following line

385204
bash	zsh
nul is a character that can t occur in a file path but unfortunately bash contrary to zsh can t have such a character in its variables

385206
versioning	upgrade
you would need to upgrade the entire openssh-client package and at the moment no new versioning of that exists in debian backports so you would need to look to third parties with all the risks that carries

385221
zsh	tcsh
tcsh and zsh also have the echotc builtin which you can use with the termcap equivalent of that terminfo el echotc ce also echoti el in zsh

385228
hadoop	ambari
we have an hadoop cluster clients are installed on linux red hat machines and central management via apache ambari

385240
rpm	yum
not 100 sure but i think earlier versions require downloading the epel repository and installing manually using rpm then you can just yum install iftop as per other answers

385260
vpn	lan
i m having issues accessing only the transmission jail at 192.168.1.26 on my home internal lan when i vpn in

385281
debian	linux
on a fresh installation of debian gnu linux testing system with installed proprietary nvidia drivers

385283
centos	linux
is amazon linux based on centos 6

385284
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
showing linux s dev null was much slower than freebsd and solaris the popular unix-like systems back then

385352
hex	binary
looking for something with a front-end similar to bless on ubuntu or binary viewer on windows or ..almost the delta hex editor netbeans plugin

385390
bash	subshell
from what i ve read online and in the bash reference set -e aka set -o errexit may apply to certain subshell such as command substitutions

385396
centos	linux
and if it is not is it possible that centos server can be the repository and from there on distributed to other types of linux

385396
rhel	suse
rhel suse

385398
kde	gnome
if i use kde in centos how can i remove the default gnome environment to avoid file conflict

385405
folder	directory
how do i preserve the internal directory structure but ignore the parent folder

385419
debian	mint	debian	linux
they are on linux mint debian cinnamon

385438
filtering	grouping
you can however match by user grouping for filtering out drop packages

385452
kde	gnome
there will be no file conflicts with installing kde plasma and gnome

385494
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
there are any plans on developing a fuse fs so that refs will be mountable and writable under linux debian and centos at least

385496
filesystems	ntfs
resilient filesystems refs codenamed protogon is a microsoft proprietary filesystems introduced with windows server 2012 with the intent of becoming the next generation filesystems after ntfs

385498
fish	bash
it s written for the fish shell but should easily be portable to bash if you change all the set commands to bash variable assigments

385505
children	parent
i m trying to get a name of a process given its process id along with its children parent and grandparent names

385505
children	parent
i ve used ps -eo for getting the name of the process id but not not for any of its children parent or grandparents

385522
centos	linux
we have a couple of centos application and database servers as an application that we use requires linux

385535
pull	push
you can now run adb pull sdcard myfile myandroidfiles myfile in order to get your file s and adb push myotherfile sdcard myotherfile to transfer a file from your computer to your phone

385549
rpm	yum
however yum doesn t seem to be able to detect that they ve been installed so installing the application s rpm still fails on missing dependencies

385553
rpm	yum
yum can only detect things which are installed with rpm or tools that use it such as yum itself

385553
rpm	yum
as pip does not use rpm there is no way for yum to know about anything that pip manages

385572
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr

385574
mouse	keyboard
my desktop freezes randomly at times and takes no input from either mouse or keyboard

385599
ubuntu	linux
i suspect that if i put this file into my efi partition into efi ubuntu grubx64.efi i will be able to add entry for this file and it will be seen by bios and my non-bootable linux partition will start to boot

385633
stdout	stderr
except that 0 1 and 2 are by convention reserved for stdin stdout and stderr

385634
vlan	packets
let me quickly explain how vlans work on the wire a normal ethernet packets does not have a special field for the vlan id

385634
vlan	packets
vlan packets on the other hand are a later extension that uses a new packets format which consists of all fields of the old format plus the additional tag as definined in 802.1q

385634
vlan	packets
all tagged packets received on ports 5-6 are ignored for this vlan

385634
vlan	packets
what it doesn t do is to somehow forward packets between different vlans a packets tagged with 100 and received on port 1-4 is not retagged with 201 on port 5-6 and forwarded to the vlan and then again retagged with

385713
ubuntu	debian
after you change the partitions and adjust etc fstab you should run the update-grub - available on debian ubuntu script or grub-mkconfig -o boot grub grub.cfg to generate a new config file and then reinstall grub into the first hdd that you bot from

385730
cinnamon	gnome
in my case if i logged in using cinnamon the gnome desktop was shown

385743
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
on a debian ubuntu distros and on centos 6 you ll get 12k 3 per each dir block size 4kb

385745
filesystems	xfs
the size of a small directory is 0 on centos rhel7 because it s using xfs rather than the ext4 filesystems on centos rhel6

385756
rar	zip
zip compresses each file independently but other popular formats tar.anything 7z rar compress the archive as a whole

385768
debian	linux
i came to know that kali linux is based in debian so is it possible to upgrade not sure if i need to downgrade my current os to kali linux

385769
filesystems	xfs
the filesystems type for root and home are xfs which i think is something i ll need to specify in the mount command

385769
folder	directory
aside from popping the drive in and typing a mount command what else am i missing like will the folder inherit the ownership and permissions of the parent directory

385777
sudo	passwd
the -i option will log you in and you won t have to retype the passwd or add sudo before commands every single time

385779
folder	directory
recently there is a folder created in opt jboss directory with root user now while using this command i m getting permission denied from the particular folder which is interrupting the search how do i exclude the particular folder which is having root privileges

385783
next	except
adding to sheppy s answer i wouldn t recommend jumping straight from any other version to another one except for the next version

385783
versioning	upgrade
if you do want to upgrade nonetheless i would suggest editing your etc apt sources.list putting the newer release name do either an apt update update the index and then install the newer kernel versioning reboot the system and see everything is fine

385792
folder	directory
to be read as inside the top directory opt joss any folder that is not named . owned by root is not to be followed into

385794
ubuntu	linux
i booted into both windows and ubuntu and both could display on all 3 monitors so i know it is not a hardware issue or one with linux in general but something about my install

385797
cat	tee
tee copies stdin to both a file and to stdout - it s like a fancy version of cat that also copies its input to a file

385814
stdout	stderr
usually unix shells just open the required files with open then fork themselves then dup2 the previously obtained fd s to stdin stdout stderr 0 1 2 so they re handled accordingly by the program they execve later

385836
versioning	upgrade
blkid from the util-linux v2.30 provides uuid also for udf filesystems so just upgrade util-linux to new versioning and then you can use uuid in etc fstab

385874
cpu	hyperthreading
i have a quad core cpu core i7 7700 with hyperthreading

385879
umask	chmod
you could change umask for those users to use the exact chmod that you want this way every single archive they enter in the system would start with that defined set of permissions

385906
octal	binary
the resulting binary number so constructed should be printed as octal

385911
centos	linux
as mentioned by the user the problem was fixed by using packages rpms built for his system centos linux release 7.3.1611 core

385938
folder	directory
see automatically change file permission upon write to a folder and all files created in directory should be owned by bob

385938
daemons	systemd
deployment should be triggered manually but it should be performed by an automated service which runs in a systemd user account grabs a version from ci downloads it and restarts the daemons

385945
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade it to any newer versioning but i get messages such as

385950
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have been using ubuntu mint for some years now but i m new to arch linux and such

385979
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian provide a whole mess of behind the scenes shell scripting in gui login session startup and shutdown that bodges both the starting stopping of graphical-session.target and injecting the display environment variable

385985
for-loop	loops
you can loops through all files with a for-loop then remove the suffix using syntax and finally replace that middle part with the syntax

386012
cpu	processors
processors of my computer intelâ coreâ i5-4310u cpu 2.00ghz ã 4

386013
bash	tcsh	x11	konsole
in my case it might not be yours because i m using tcsh and not bash as the default shell in my konsole sessions and because for whichever reason x11 failed to read .xsessionrc at every new startup i also had to add this line to the .tcshrc shell startup file

386066
vmware	virtualbox
when you install linux on disc you are going to use the kernel for the specific hardware that your machine has with the os from that distro if you use a vm instance there should be a mid-layer between your machine hardware and the os this could be using extra modules from a kernel like vmware and virtualbox or creating a special kernel that has no proper os like xen

386083
decoder	encoder
omxplayer works by utilizing hardware capabilities of the videocore iv part of the cpu which has an embedded media encoder and decoder

386083
decoder	encoder
but as modern intel amd cpus and also nvidia amd gpus also include hardware media encoder and decoder they might provide openmax compatible driver

386101
centos	linux
etc redhat-release centos linux release 7.3.1611 core

386118
stdout	stderr
redirects stderr to stdout which goes to awk

386145
centos	linux
i m trying to set up a heartbeat client on a linux machine centos linux release 7.3.1611 which is sending icmp echo requests to roughly 1300 hosts

386145
icmp	tcp
researching online led me to increasing the memory allocated to tcp ip connections by the system however these are icmp requests which as far as i m aware should be separate

386148
folder	directory
the above command moved the public and private key combo to my user s profile home .ssh directory home myuser .ssh i think i may have had to create the .ssh folder there in order for ssh-keygen to work properly

386150
folder	directory
inside the home myuser .ssh folder on linux copy the public key file the one that has the .pub file extension contents into a file called authorized_keys you ll have to create it just like you might have to create the directory home myuser .ssh where myuser is whatever your username is

386168
redhat	fedora
if i ll build it on fedora will users be able to use it on other systems like redhat

386179
single-quotes	double-quotes
use single-quotes for fixed strings without any variables in them and double-quotes for strings that need variable interpolation to take place

386181
redhat	fedora
if i ll build it on fedora will users be able to use it on other systems like redhat

386182
folder	directory
the above command moved the public and private key combo to my user s profile home .ssh directory home myuser .ssh i think i may have had to create the .ssh folder there in order for ssh-keygen to work properly

386206
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
it usually has bin sh or bash or ksh or zsh or whatever as the shell instead of the cthulhu-shell csh or tcsh

386206
bash	tcsh
tcsh csh are indeed horrible sanity-destroying monstrosities and shouldn t be used but it s trivially easy to type exec bash as soon as you su to root

386210
openssh	jail
openssh has been providing such a chroot-based jail for years now

386241
filesystems	fat
pure speculation but it could be down to some corruption on the filesystems and the macos driver for the fat filesystems returning that error upon encountering that corruption which eventually makes it through to the return of read

386241
filesystems	fat
or use the gnu mtools to access that fat filesystems

386261
versioning	upgrade
on the hosted update server you cannot lock in a specific versioning for example 7.3 you can only upgrade to the latest available

386308
ubuntu	debian
if you re using a systemd based os like ubuntu 16.04 or debian 9 you ll need to use the systemctl command instead of service

386317
comm	grep
with the same assumption if you can manage to sort your two huge files cleaned1 and cleanedr you can replace grep with comm -1 -3 cleaned1 cleanedr which will be quite fast

386327
migrate	staging
once i get the new site fine on the staging server i plan to migrate it over to the live site and update that domain to also run php 7.1 with the appropriate modules for a joomla 3.7.4 site

386345
auto	nullptr
nullptr auto lambdas are not supported and there are a lot in the code

386367
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
control + z writes the control character susp which sends the signal sigtstp number 20 on linux amd64 24 on solaris amd64 18 on freebsd amd64.

386369
spaces	delimiter
spaces is the delimiter character used to separate things adding a spaces makes it be two things and bar

386417
filesystems	btrfs
the exact list you get for default options will vary by filesystems type btrfs has a different set other than rw relatime than ext4 for example by specifics of the filesystems you can embed some default options in the superblock for ext4 and sometimes even by hardware btrfs tries to guess if you have an ssd and will add the fs specific ssd mount option if it thinks you do

386422
free	malloc
this can be pretty simply proven by calling malloc to allocate a chunk of memory the same size as your free memory calling mlock on it and then forcing every page to be faulted in don t do this on a production system it will trigger the oom killer and that may not choose your test program to reap

386431
disk	ram
hopefully this will force imagemagic to regularly dump already processed data on the disk instead of trying to fit more than 2 gib in ram buffers

386465
min	max
our current zfs memory variables for the arc are max 255gb and min 64mb

386465
min	max
i am looking forward a rule of thumb in order to configure the values min max arc memory

386465
min	max
should the arc gets a fixed amount of memory min max the same or should check the max memory per timeslot h or 1 2h and go with that value added a cap of +10

386495
mouse	keyboard
when i try to resume after suspend the keyboard and mouse doesn t work not even the tty1 tty2.. and the screen come out blank with just the moose pointer

386502
ubuntu	debian
in others systems like debian and ubuntu piped sha1sum to tar output works well

386530
width	height
they are of different width and height

386531
bgp	ospf
setting up anycast with the help of ospf or bgp and sshing to a anycast vip

386536
ubuntu	linux
i always see a connection being closed in linux ubuntu 4.4.0-53-generic

386536
ubuntu	linux
sometimes i see a connection being closed in linux 3.13.11 pure kernel not ubuntu

386555
debian	linux
those limits don t come from debian or from linux they come from the hardware

386570
chmod	mkdir
registered writers are files open for writing as well as ongoing operations that write metadata mkdir chmod etc.

386576
disk	ram
disk caches are vital to performance and dropping them is a major performance hit and so is not leaving enough room in ram for caches by the way

386609
udp	tcp
with raw sockets you send and receive non-standard transport level protocol data in ip packets instead of tcp udp etc

386623
lvm	xfs
however once you layer lvm and luks in xfs and ext4 can no longer detect the partition stripe

386623
lvm	xfs
the stability and proven reliability of md-raid lvm and xfs are very appealing

386623
filesystems	xfs
on these i will build by xfs filesystems

386632
sudoers	visudo
i added local user test to etc sudoers via visudo as follows

386642
freebsd	netbsd
on freebsd sh is based on the almquist shell like dash or netbsd sh

386673
tvos	ios
it will also be on watchos tvos ios

386675
lvm	mdadm
i had used ubuntu 12.04 to build a mdadm software raid 1 array from 2 harddisks and then i created a lvm on this array and used this lvm to install my ubuntu 12.04 system on it i still have a boot partition outside the lvm

386675
lvm	mdadm
in fact the lvm is built on 2 mdadm software raid 1 arrays

386678
spaces	delimiter
specifically the spaces character loses its signification as an argument delimiter and is instead included literally in the argument passed to ln

386686
ubuntu	linux	switching	screens
but on my linux ubuntu 16 when i switching the screens rearranges and moves all windows around

386690
mouse	trackpad
the trackpad was completely gone from mouse touchpad in the settings application

386692
chown	mount
p.s mount the folder onto the partition before running chown

386693
cvs	rcs
it is recommended that you use cvs rcs

386711
centos	linux
centos linux release 7.2.1511 core

386712
debian	linux
the arch linux user community less strict than debian based package management

386730
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian and back when i used ubuntu i think it was this page that finally got my card working

386758
gentoo	debian
it s replaced unionfs in some distro s livecd s mostly debian and gentoo derivatives

386758
filesystems	btrfs
all the in-kernel options have limitations on what the backing filesystems can be most notably not working with networked filesystems or btrfs

386766
daemons	systemd
does systemd use a different timeout setting for stopping a running daemons rsyslog when rebooting the systemd by running reboot vs when you simply restart the daemons systemctl restart rsyslog

386766
daemons	systemd
i ve set the timeoutstopsec option but it appears that systemd may be killing the daemons before it has a chance to safely save its state and terminate cleanly

386783
centos	linux
but i still can t tell what version of centos my amazon linux distro is based on

386789
mouse	keyboard
use bluetooth mouse and keyboard

386807
keydown	keyup	mouse	keyboard
if you want the mouse buttons to act the same as the multimedia buttons on a keyboard you have to emulate the keydown and keyup events as opposed to a one-shot keypress

386809
filesystems	ntfs
a system reserved partition 500 mb ntfs c ntfs the primary partition and an empty partition 858 mb entry for filesystems empty

386812
centos	linux
i am running centos linux release 7.3.1611 3.10.0-514.26.2.el7.x86_64

386842
filesystems	ntfs
the same is the case for ntfs filesystems as well

386842
filesystems	ntfs
i would be also interested in knowing if ntfs filesystems also have something similar

386851
switching	screens
what is probably happening here is that x is switching between the resolution of your laptop 1366x768 and your larger screens 1920x1080

386858
ubuntu	linux
works on ubuntu and kali linux

386873
folder	directory
i have a directory with three sub folder wherein i built a cross gcc

386873
binutils	glibc
so there are the directories binutils gcc and glibc that are only the build directories the corresponding sources are in different directories

386876
init.d	pid
in the short term your etc rc.d init.d ilogtaild should name a pid file with a redhat pidfile header

386888
mouse	keyboard
and due to this my mouse and keyboard are getting sync issue means keyboard will not respond for few second

386903
stdout	stderr
here using fd 3 to dump the function names to keep it separate from the stdout and stderr streams

386929
openvpn	iptables
use iptables to filter out traffic from other than openvpn interface

386936
spaces	delimiter
the delimiter used is the awk variable ofs output field separator a single spaces by default so if you want a tab between the two use

386937
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you are better off doing certificate authentication that way even if your certificate is retrieved by a 3rd party they will at least not be able to change the user s passwd without the root passwd and many more things especially if you have sudo and your user is on the sudoers list etc .

386937

debian	linux
system gnu linux debian 9 stretch

386951
put	get
i should probably put a hold on things until we are able to get blu-ray burners

386963
bash	subshell
can stdout be overwritten by two bourne or bash if that matters subshell commands running asynchronously

386968
stdout	stderr
in the default configuration stderr is not buffered but stdout is

386968
stdout	stderr
if you redirect their stdout to the stderr also this stderr will be unbuffered

387026
icmp	snmp
the external devices sometimes know it s down but not always and i don t think they expose this in any useful way like sending an icmp unreachable or via snmp

387054
ubuntu	debian
the cause of the problem is that with no update to the debian wiki or other similar doco and pretty much only a couple of largely ubuntu -related announcements on a non-debian personal www site support for keys that state a preference for sha-1 encryption has been turned off in apt as of debian 9

387102
debian	linux
the current linux distribution is 32-bits i am going to replace it with 64-bits debian 9 stretch

387107
integer	unsigned
and ino_t shall be defined as unsigned integer types

387124
filesystems	hfs+
looks like your hfs+ filesystems is mounted read-only

387144
daemons	systemd
my aim was the same as original posterâ s one but with one difference i needed to run sdl application as a systemd daemons

387144
mouse	keyboard
there is no keyboard or mouse connected to rpi

387144
mouse	keyboard
please note i didnâ t test whether pygame application is able to receive keyboard and mouse events or not

387145
timemachine	hfs
timemachine is a great tool but every now and then you have to start anew due to some hfs problems

387171
bluetooth	usb	ethernet	wireless
at first everything worked allright but now in the top bar when i click i just see proxy and bluetooth options internet is still working and the pc detects the ethernet cable and the usb wireless card

387171
ethernet	wireless
airmon also detects the wireless card but when i take the ethernet cable off i can not use the internet

387193
stdout	stderr
can that be the case or do all processes always send eof to stdout and stderr after being terminated with whatever signal

387193
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu 17.04 with linux 4.10

387206
debian	linux
there are in linux preferibly debian some libs and commands like my mockup ones for manipulate the terminal output

387208
kde	kubuntu
i know this is an old question relating to kde 4 but i thought i d just chime in with how i solved this in kde plasma 5 kubuntu

387215
bash	zsh
modern most popular shells like bash and zsh use gnu readline as input library

387216
urwid	ncurses
as far as i understand you re looking for a library like ncurses or python s urwid

387221
sysv	systemd
this disables one layer of systemd abstraction and allows the sysv startup script to function more normally

387234
fish	bash
i m not sure why you are starting bash then starting fish

387234
fish	bash
chsh -s usr local bin fish then on the rare occasions you want need to run a bash command you simply type bash which drops you into a bash shell then once you finish you type exit to go back to fish

387241
rpm	yum
i just got to know that removing old kernel in rhel centos via yum update the grub menu automatically wherein removing old kernel via rpm -e does not and one need to manually edit the grub.conf file

387295
debian-based	ubuntu
in ubuntu and other debian-based distros you can install it from your terminal by executing this command

387301
sudo	passwd
however i haven t set up any kind of sudo but yet whenever i plug in an ntfs drive kde device notifier allows me to mount it without any kind of passwd

387301
put	get
i d like to put this mess into some order get an overview which devices can and can t be mounted by users and allow mounting by both scripted methods kde and systemd

387301
sudo	passwd
how does kde manage to mount anything that actually requires root-access on command-line without asking for passwd nor using any kind of sudo

387317
ubuntu	centos
centos 7 uses different grub than ubuntu s grub correct me if i am wrong

387355
kerberos	ldap
the only way to solve this is by either modifying the ldap schema as many sites suggest use smbpasswd or use kerberos for authentication

387382
switching	screens
however when i try to use the mate gui to switching users to a user in freeipa that can successfully log in via ssh which will otherwise quickly fail and return me to the login screens as the user doesn t yet have a home directory i get the error incorrect password please try again

387422

the cron job launches a script which runs our nightly jobs for our application system

387501
filesystems	btrfs
i have a disk with a btrfs filesystems on top of bcache that was used in an old installation i no longer have unintentionally nuked

387501
filesystems	btrfs
lsblk -f indicates that bcache is present on the drive but i can t map it to get to the btrfs filesystems underneath and recover my data

387517
put	get
however i don t know what i should put as action to get that it working

this says for lines that don t contain exactly or usr in the second whitespace delimiter column append to h old spaces fetch n ext line loop b ack to label a

387580
versioning	upgrade
btw apple is rumored to dislike the gplv3+ license so you might upgrade your bash to a recent versioning 4.4 in august 2017 on your apple computer

387591
uniq	grep
cut the first two fields uniq them as you suggested and use the result to grep the lines in the original file

387599
dpkg	apt
if no what do i need to do instead to repair my dpkg apt

387628
x86	64bit
you can run 64bit x86_64 in redhat and relatives amd64 in debian relatives or 32bit i386-i686 software code kernel os on 64bit amd64 em64t enabled x86 compatible hardware cpu

387684
versioning	upgrade
i ran into trouble when upgrading my system to the current stable versioning of debian apt-get dist-upgrade and none of the manually installed packages were upgrade

387703
profiling	debugging
for debugging purposes you can add messages to the profiling to make sure it s getting set right too

387740
post	get
i guess i solved my problem but as i would like to get a better understanding of awk i decided to post this question as i am curious to know what i am doing wrong when i try and feed awk a variable

387758
spaces	delimiter
instead it is treated as a literal string delimiter by spaces

387758
spaces	delimiter
to do what you want you need to escape any spaces you have to avoid the delimiter from kicking in

387787
ubuntu	linux
how to login into the skype with microsoft account from linux terminal in ubuntu

387798
bluetooth	usb
workarounds include using bluetooth a2dp or usb audio dongles soundcards dacs

387803
mp3	wav
i m looking for a software that reproduces audio files wav and mp3 if possible and provides a way to change the playback speed in real-time flawlessy

387820
bash	zsh
with zsh ksh93 or yash -o braceexpand but not bash you can do

387822
mp3	wav
mplayer can playback wav and mp3 files and you can interactively change the speed with keys and although wav files cannot be played slower than than their original speed

387826
folder	directory
when they open it they see some but not all of the folder in the volume1 directory

387826
ubuntu	linux
to make things harder getfacl which seems to be the standard tool for this sort of thing isn t installed installing software on this computer is quite difficult as it s not a regular linux ubuntu install it s some weird proprietary variant with quite limited capabilities

387827
sudo	passwd
i m surprised about the permission denied if you have sudo at the beginning of the command it should ask you for the passwd when you run it manually

387861
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
for example on ubuntu debian and centos it shuts down services first while on arch linux it reboots immediately at least with my setup

387865
jobs	cron
inspetting the cron jobs on my debian desktop machine it seems there is nothing related to the rtc although it could be hidden in some other tasks

387897
stdout	stderr
i d like to keep any output currently on stderr printed could be to stdout but should not be hidded

387899
centos	linux
i am working on a centos release 6.9 linux distribution where my username is a member of two different groups mygroup1 and mygroup2

387905
filesystems	btrfs
given your exact description no it s not possible because you will have lost part of the metadata tree as well and if you re really unlucky you will have lost the chunk tree the system chunks in btrfs fi df output too which is equivalent to wiping the superblocks and part of the inode tables on an ext4 filesystems

387906
dpkg	apt
i tried to fix it with apt upgrade -f and dpkg --configure lilypond-data but whatever i do i get the following message

387924
ssl	https
then on the application server define a server on a port that is for ssl connections and set the fastcgi param https to on

387937
folder	directory
first of all open the folder apue that you have downloaded and uncompressed and copy all the items in that folder for example advio daemons etc. everything to your current working directory.you can know your current working directory by using the command pwd .now in the folder include you will find the header file apue.copy that too to your current working directory.in a nutshell any .c file that you are going to use in your program must be in your current working directory.so copy all those files to your current working directory

387958
openbsd	aix
using awk on openbsd which seems to complain in exactly the same way as your aix awk the original code has a syntax error in that it s not possible to print unless put inside parentheses in which case it will evaluate to 0 false or 1 true

387978
versioning	upgrade
i m using ubuntu 17.04 and i manually upgrade my kernel versioning to 4.12.8 using the tool ukuu ubuntu kernel update utility

387980
stdout	stderr
your command possibly outputs to stderr instead of stdout

387980
stdout	stderr
to redirect stderr to stdout

388028
mouse	keyboard
why not just ssh into the powerful laptop forward x and use your lower-power machine as keyboard monitor mouse

388058
debian	linux
i am running debian linux stable regularly updated with lxde desktop and it is otherwise running very well

388072
pull	push
currently you have to manually enter the environments in the export then push it to a git repo and then pull the master

388093
filesystems	fat
fat seems especially vulnerable while a journaling filesystems should be more robust

388095
ubuntu	mint
this affects all ubuntu based distros like mint

388095
switching	screens
to see if this might be the reason to switching to suse debian lmde or arch could someone on a non-ubuntu based distro confirm that rotating the screens actually works there like suggested here

388100
daemons	systemd
it is starting the service as a daemons at the start of the systemd

388102
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
also there are a lot of ppas that hold newer drivers pre-packaged for ubuntu and hence can be used for linux mint so you should look that up as well

388108
filesystems	btrfs
how would i accomplish the following in linux using the btrfs filesystems

388112
processors	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading
are there any methods linux kernel options sysctl settings or configurable scheduler modules that can cause a high priority process thread to run on a physical processors core with the second hyperthreading virtual core unscheduled in order to maximize single thread performance by preventing from competitive situations not sharing the l1 cache and the possible use of maximum cpu clock - turbo boost while at the same time running lower priority processes threads on both virtual cores of other physical cores with lower cpu clock to maximize total system throughput

388112
cpu	affinity
while the high priority process is sleeping both virtual cores of its former physical core should again become available for lower priority processes which makes it inappropriate to use taskset to exclude one physical core from the cpu affinity mask of all other processes

388121
disk	ram
a routine at the head of it does a minimal amount of hardware setup decompresses the image fully into high memory and takes note of any ram disk if configured

388138
postfix	dovecot
i have a postfix + dovecot mail server today while checking my logs i see login attempts from unknown users ip adresses i guess this has to be a brute force attack

388170
bash	zsh
same as zsh s except that you need there a ksh glob operator for which you need extglob in bash

388213
debian	linux
keep in mind i m fairly new to gnu linux and i ve decided to try out debian for it s history

388233
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd	apache	nginx
if i understood your issue correctly and you don t care about security risks you can install sudo add www-data www-data is a default user used by nginx apache to the sudoers file with all permission and no passwd required and use it to execute a command as another user

388246
sudo	chgrp
you can run sudo chgrp -r apache your_folder

388266
google-chrome	firefox
you need to do it manually for firefox maybe pepper works for google-chrome users

388293
children	parent
in linux parent processes can get additional information about their children in particular the ability to ptrace them which allow the debugger to access process s low level information like read write its memory registers change signal mappings stop its execution etc

388301
sudo	passwd
currently we use sudo bash to get into the root shell without typing any passwd

388301
sudo	passwd
i understand that giving sudo access on individual commands is recommended but at least for now i wanted a mechanism where we type our passwd and then get a root shell

388301
sudo	passwd
to re-iterate sudo bash or sudo -s works fine but when i typed sudo su - it prompted for my passwd and once i typed it it gave me a message sorry user username is not allowed to execute bin su - as root on lt

388314
cpu	processors
if each individual process uses under 20 cpu capacity it s even possible though unlikely that all five might run on the same processors

388315
for-loop	loops
you can also try a for-loop which might give you some more space loops to do thigs

388335
libpcap	wireshark
what this suggests me is that wireshark shows us the packets as soon as from the libpcap

388341
png	ico	gif	ico	gif	png
i just use the chrome webrowser which supports jpg svg png ico animated gif .

ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian
after testing with several different distros debian ubuntu centos and opensuse

388396
debian-based	opensuse
opensuse provides an option to enable disable secureboot support and when it was installed with this disabled i got the same results as i did with the debian-based distros

388399
ubuntu	openbsd
i m trying to use the upwards arrow and it has no effect if i start a new shell with openbsd or ubuntu xenial

388428

388445
xfce	cinnamon
i have been experiencing this same issue in linux mint cinnamon mate and xfce

388446
move	drag
i believe to recall that in the past i was able to use the same mouse behaviour as when moving a file with drag drop +modifier key to then generate a symbolic link at the place of where i otherwise would have move the file to

388459
chown	sudo
the solution was to do a sudo chown -r home user and then using pavucontrol to unmute the output

388461
put	get
if your intention is to get the job done correctly put some effort to run it on your host

388484
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu you need previously add correct sources in etc apt sources.list

388497
int	chars
the chars l in the name lseek means â â long integer.â â before the introduction of the off_t data type the offset argument and the return value were long int

388499
folder	directory
i want to have the default folder that houses all of my sync items in my home directory which currently rslsync has no access to of course

388499
folder	directory
in the sync directory i have also created 2 folder dropbox and resilio

388499
folder	directory
what is the best way to give user rslsync read write and execute access to the resilio folder located in my home directory

388519
bash	zsh	awk	ksh
i m open to a solution that uses bash ksh zsh or possibly some crazy awk feature

388522
xfce	kde
ps i am thinking of starting with manjaro with xfce and debian with kde

388529
mouse	keyboard
the common thread on all the gui frameworks is a central main event handler that receives the events requests to redraw keyboard and mouse input etc

388530
bash	subshell
bash does make the pid of cmd2 or more exactly of the subshell as it does run cmd2 in a child process of that subshell even though it s the last command there available in but doesn t let you wait for it

388530
bash	zsh
though bash and zsh make cmd1 s exit status available in and respectively see also the pipefail option in a few shells so can report the failure of pipe components other than the last

388542
folder	directory
i then created another folder in the directory named test so the directory is now home sync test

388542
folder	directory
how does an owner of the top directory folder rslsync not have access to one of its sub folder thats created by another user that is even in the same group as itself

388543
mouse	trackpad
i currently have an issue where i can no longer get my right mouse click to work on my laptop trackpad

388547
folder	directory
on linux ownership and permissions for each file or folder are handled separately from all other folder and files - independently from the parent directory state

388551
mouse	keyboard
the tutorial i followed left me with a graphics system where my keyboard and touchpad and mouse no longer worked

388554
debian	linux
i installed cinnamon on my debian linux laptop but now it won t let me change the wallpaper or the theme when i click on the wallpaper i want it just highlights it but leaves it as the default debian wallpaper and when i click the theme i want it doesn t change the icons at all

388566
google-chrome	firefox
common culprits are the gnome desktop environment and the firefox and chromium google-chrome web browsers

388572
bash	zsh
in ksh bash yash and zsh you can use an array variable

388575
ubuntu	mint
however it seems intel does not like to support older versions of ubuntu and does not strictly support mint so there a lot of workarounds out there

388596
daemons	systemd
quite confused over the difference between linux name service caching daemons nscd and systemd security service daemons sssd

388625
kerberos	ldap
sssd primarily provides daemons to manage access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms like ldap kerberos nis etc...so it is more about authentication and authorization

388629
chown	sudo
i then changed the srv shared ownership to mason and group mason with sudo chown mason mason srv shared

388635
elf	dwarf
on modern linux and many unix-like systems the debugging information including meta-data about symbol s types source code location type of variables etc etc .... is in dwarf format and sits inside the elf executable or elf shared libraries when it is compiled with some -g option

388635
elf	dwarf
also core 5 files are dumped by the kernel which should not care about existence of dwarf sections in elf 5 executables because these sections are not mapped into the virtual address space of the faulting process which dumped core on some signal 7

388648
daemons	launchd
can you launchd everything from a single long-lived daemons process

388656
xfce	gnome
xfce and lxde will work fine gnome will make problems i assume

388673
children	parent
a process outside the chroot is allowed to open files and then its chroot ed children can only access those files outside the chroot that the parent process deigned to pass to them

388673
stdout	stderr
the order of operations is now fork with default stdin stdout and stderr exec chroot chroot now inside chroot exec bash knows how to handle redirection fork implementation detail of bash open file exec echo with new stdout

388674
ubuntu	centos
since i was moving from an ubuntu 10.10 system to a centos 6.9 even though it had been successfully mounted on centos 6.9 for a few weeks i figured that would explain why the dev md0 device was smaller than the original pv

388783
centos	linux
operating system centos linux 7 core

uniq	grep
use grep to find all instances then count unique lines using uniq -c

388822
apache	nginx
apache nginx other

388823
prng	random
if one knows the initial input values and the particular prng algorithm one can determine every single future random output value

388823
prng	random
the random outputs are all entirely predictable until the prng is re-seeded supplied with a fresh seed that is unique or as near as one can get to that run of that operating system installation for the first time

388823
freebsd	linux
and that s what var lib systemd random-seed on systemd operating systems var lib urandom random-seed on non-systemd linux operating systems and var db entropy-file on freebsd trueos are all about holding a re-seed value that can be applied as that first re-seed value as soon as possible after the next bootstrap

388824
octal	decimal
gnu printf and the printf builtin of bash and dash only accept decimal octal or hexadecimal literal constants so 020 16 and 0x10 mean the same with leading but not trailing blanks ignored and return an error message but otherwise use whatever valid number if found at the start of the argument or 0 if none if it s not recognised as a valid number

388824
octal	decimal
and output bc in bash dash gnu but also an error message as a is not a valid decimal octal hexadecimal literal constant

388832
stdout	stderr
- stderr number 2 redirected to the stdout number 1 and stdout to the output.txt

388845
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
you forgot to quote the glob operator and are using a shell like csh tcsh fish though fish doesn t support glob operators zsh bash -o failglob most probably t csh given the error message that rightly fails the command when a glob fails to match

388852
bash	subshell
now all those won t work if you want to change an environment variable for a builtin or function and don t want them to run in a subshell like in bash

388880
mouse	keyboard
grub 2 is something that needs to manage ressources like disk devices in order to load kernels mouse and keyboard input

388883
daemons	systemd
i created init scripts for sysvinit and systemd to distribute with one of our software packages it should run a non-interactive background daemons for a network service

388883
debian	centos
the automatic stuff works well for centos and debian so i am already quite happy

388905
spaces	delimiter
the data is delimiter by spaces

388934
ubuntu	debian
more info like which unix os you are using ubuntu fedora debian or microphone type dynamic condenser and how it connects to your sound card 3.5mm jack like earbuds jack for mp3 players 1 4 inch plug usb xlr cable with or without interface

388949
fish	zsh
if you want a shell with nice features such as colored completions use zsh or fish if you don t like configurability

388951
stdout	stderr
if you want to see errors you can redirect stderr to stdout like this

388958
stdout	stderr
if the connection goes down that won t affect script if it doesn t try to read or write to stdin stdout or stderr

388993
openbsd	freebsd
the freebsd ports and packages and the openbsd equivalent for that matter aims at providing third-party software for that particular operating system only

388993
openbsd	freebsd
as usual the freebsd project is concerned with supporting as many freebsd users as possible and therefore has the largest 3rd-party software collection while openbsd is driven by developers for developers you say you want this but i don t see a patch from you

388993
freebsd	netbsd
the tools are different the structure of what constitutes a port package is different and even some of the terminology is different a netbsd port is not the same as a freebsd port

388993
openbsd	linux
coming from openbsd and therefore familiar with that system s port system i have successfully used pkgsrc on various linux systems where i haven t had root access as well as on my personal macos machine

389004
ansible	puppet
there are however specialized software for doing automatic provisioning and configuration management such as ansible and puppet

389007
tar	gunzip
assuming the target system has gunzip and tar not posix commands but quite common

389027
ubuntu	linux
on my ubuntu linux host my terminal type is ansi

389028
ubuntu	linux
on my linux desktop ubuntu 17.04 my local network is on eth0 and my internet connection is through usb via an android phone tethering

389038
hide	show	filesystems	btrfs
how can i mount the volume and probably through specifying mount options show the btrfs partition as a flat non-snapshotted filesystems hide the snapshots and show only current versions of files

389046
hid	keyboard
as one is able to easily forward the usb hid signals from the keyboard to the virtual machine i d be surprised if this wasn t possible

389067
bash	zsh
with ksh or zsh -o kshglob -o nobareglobqual or bash -o extglob

389067
bash	zsh
with bash -o dotglob -o extglob or zsh -o kshglob -o dotglob -o nobareglobqual

389067
bash	zsh
with zsh -o dotglob or bash -o dotglob the dotglob being to include files whose name starts with

389076
debian	linux
i have a router running debian linux 4.1 which has

389089
hid	keyboard
first the native keyboard support in virtualbox and any other vm manager is not forwarding usb hid signals from your keyboard it s interpreting scancodes provided by the os and generating the emulated scancodes in the vm and it s probably a ps 2 keyboard in the vm not usb

389092
ubuntu	opensuse
tom yan is correct .snapshots is not a btrfs internal directory it s created and managed on opensuse and possibly ubuntu by a piece of software called snapper

389110
bash	zsh
or using a shell instead of perl to do the substitution and call mv for the renaming here using bash and the ksh parameter expansion operator you can replace bash with ksh or zsh if you don t have bash

389126
switching	screens
you ve just to switching off save lines to scrollback in alternate screens mode checkbox

389154
redhat	fedora
for redhat fedora centos systems corresponding to rhel version 7.x the rpm you need can be found here

389155
ubuntu	linux
i suspect that this should also hold true for nearly any other modern ubuntu based distro and possibly even most modern gnu linux distros

389163
range	max
this will output my max ip range

389163
range	max
how can i make this script find my max range like this but instead it writes it like this

389167
ubuntu	centos
i have a build machine running ubuntu 16.04 lts which may eventually be changed to centos

389192
mouse	keyboard
there is no response from mouse and keyboard

389220
for-loop	arrays
the second part iterates over our arrays which corresponds to your string using the c-like for-loop in bash

389227
ubuntu	centos
building centos from ubuntu is bit tricky as i tried an failed at matching the yum db

389263
filesystems	xfs
is it possible to corrupt a rhel7 system specifically an xfs filesystems by completely filling it with data

389272
bash	subshell
somehow this magically fits in with the way bash removes these newline characters when grabbing output from a subshell

389281
ubuntu	linux
i m venturing beyond ubuntu for the first time and chose antergos to ease my way into wider world of linux

389289
sysv	systemd
for compatibility with sysv if systemd is called as init and a pid

389291
filesystems	ntfs
100 full ntfs partition we had warned the user not to run their laptop that full but they did for months... ended up with filesystems loops so when you tried to backup data off of that 300g disk you could fill a 3t disk or whatever because loops

389312
stdout	stderr
one option is to redirect the stdout and stderr to a file when backgrounding the job

389350
ubuntu	debian
an updated version of rstudio is available for ubuntu 16.04+ and debian 9+ both 64-bit only on their download page

389352
ssl	https
whenever i attempt to access an https site the browser throws an ssl error saying that it cannot be established

389372
min	max
rtt min avg max mdev 0.343 0.376 0.407 0.031 ms

389372
min	max
rtt min avg max mdev 0.293 0.361 0.391 0.039 ms

389407
bash	zsh
zsh and bash make that available in the variable so you can do

389437
chown	sudo
i ran a quick sudo chown -r username username which fixed some issues i was having with my audio but now all my plain-text files and even movies and music are marked as executable other users can view my files etc

389447
rpm	yum
i ask because i have on occasion found myself sitting behind a proxy that blocks a direct request to download a specific rpm file but using yum s downloadonly plugin still works

389461
udp	tcp
so in this case the firewall configuration has to be changed from tcp 1197 to udp 1197

389465
switching	screens
awesome by default duplicates screens and i want to switching focus on my display using the keyboard

389495
bash	zsh
i just found a way to start zsh when i start the bash on windows from

389496
bash	zsh
your example executes replaces running process in this case bash with zsh on if stdout is open on a terminal not a file pipe etc

389498
bash	zsh
so if you running bash as interactive shell terminal - see this thread for terminology explanation bash will be replaced by zsh

389518
centos	linux
i have a linux centos 7 server where i normally place our code

389520
filesystems	btrfs
is there any straightforward way to get this value or would i have to write a script that sums up df output and compres it to btrfs filesystems df output

389524
sudo	passwd
caching is feature that allows you to run sudo multiple times within 5 minutes without prompting for passwd not running command with elevated privileges for 5 minutes

389525
nas	qnap
it s a script to install packages on a qnap nas

389547
centos	linux
centos linux 7 kernel 3.10.0-514.26.2.el7.x86_64

389555
bash	zsh
as to why you see a difference between bash and zsh when you call setenv in gdb i suspect that s because you re calling setenv before the shell initialises for instance upon entering main

389555
bash	zsh
you ll notice bash s main is and bash maps variables from those env vars in while zsh s is and zsh gets the variables from environ instead

389556
ubuntu	centos
i know there s a way to do it in ubuntu i would like to know how to do it in centos

389567
rpm	yum
so since the httpd rpm upgrade is located on disc 2 why does yum not know about it when disc 2 is mounted

389568
rpm	yum
rpm -q yum doesn t work either because yum appears to have been side-loaded on that server

389576
ftp	telnet
ftp is not a remote shell like ssh or telnet

389576
put	get
for example many terminal clients have ls or dir which will be translated in ftp list command put into stor get into retr etc

389578
gtk	motif
motif the toolkit powering cde was until recently bogged down by licensing issues and therefore left in the dust by other toolkits like gtk and qt

389585
rpm	yum
install them on rpm with yum on debian apt-get

389597
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	centos	debian	mint	centos	mint
this would refer to all frozen pool distributions in particular mint debian stables ubuntu ltr redhat enterprise centos and so on

389598
g++	gcc
strangely enough we have many versions of gcc bundled but only one version of g++ 6.0

389602
daemons	systemd
this causes systemd daemons to keep track of the process but return immediately from systemctl effectively backgrounding it for you

389652
bash	zsh
the intent of this line is clearly to run zsh when opening a terminal without disrupting other uses of bash

389652
bash	zsh
but even that is not a good idea it prevents opening a bash shell which is useful even if you use zsh

389652
bash	zsh
forget about this blog post and instead simply configure your shortcut that opens a terminal to run zsh instead of bash

389652
bash	zsh
don t arrange things so that â œwhenever you open the bash application on windows it will now start up with the zsh shellâ when you want zsh open the zsh application

389657
fcntl	fork
if the producer runs background processes you may want to set the close-on-exec flag on the pipe fcntl 1 f_setfd fcntl 1 f_getfc 0 | fd_cloexec before fork them

389670
cifs	smb
if using samba and cifs ensure smb is active and running on the server

389671
folder	directory
freespace on backup drives sufficient to create backups for the other real top-level directory folder currently in bin .config etc lib lib64 opt root sbin tmp usr var

389696
jobs	cron
now i deleted all cron jobs in machine 1 so it wont open close machine 2

389696
jobs	cron
so it seems cron jobs does not open shut machine 2

389714
sudoers	passwd
on my single-user workstation i configured sudoers 5 so that some commands can be executed without passwd

389714
ubuntu	linux
the os is ubuntu 14.04 but i think this question is not specific to a particular linux distro.

389773
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i searched enough and did not find a similar option for other browsers such as firefox google-chrome midori seamonkey epiphany and opera

389773
google-chrome	firefox
even the add on s in firefox and extensions for google-chrome does not solve the problem of redirection

389781
filesystems	xfs
i am trying to setup a new xfs filesystems in debian 9 stretch

389784
kde	gnome
look out for example for the locate 1 database indexes of desktop search engines recent files entries in gnome kde different programs etc

389791
google-chrome	firefox
such options exist in both firefox and google-chrome but they re not easy to find

389791
opera	google-chrome
opera should have an option similar to google-chrome s

389791
google-chrome	firefox
depending on the site you may also be able to stop redirects by disabling javascript there are numerous extensions for both google-chrome and firefox that allow you to do this on a per-site basis

389792
vpn	wlan
or could it be tor which starts automatically and the vpn causing problems for the wlan

389792
vpn	lan
it works with my lan cable but i get traffic on eth0 even though i have tun0 for the vpn connected over openvpn

389812
redhat	fedora
the chrony redhat documentation provides a nice overview of chrony for redhat centos and fedora of course

389829
disk	ram
it changes what the kernel will favour when an application requests more ram either throwing away cache data or writing some less used memory to disk

389841
nas	qnap
vm is qemu kvm machine is qnap nas and the program in quesiton is hmailserver with its database hmailserver.sdf on the network drive

389859
dpkg	apt
is there an easy way how i can reinstall these packages from scratch tell apt or dpkg to install the same package again without changing its flags especially preserving the auto-installed flag

389883
bash	zsh
bash and zsh have different defaults

389901
kde	cinnamon
i rebooted and realised i already had unity kde and cinnamon desktop

389905
rpm	dnf	rpm	yum	ubuntu	debian	dpkg	aptitude	dnf	yum
if you re using a distribution like debian or ubuntu that is designed for you to use utilities like dpkg apt-get and aptitude then you should not typically attempt to install software with rpm yum and dnf

389906
debian	linux
i recently did a clean install of linux the latest version of debian version 9.1 64-bit cinnamon and am unable to add myself to the sudo group

389941
openbsd	netbsd
on netbsd and openbsd pseudo terminals may be created up to a limit of 992

389953
temp	tmp
.muttrc is set to call gpg to decrypt the file containing the password then awk the content into temp file and pass it to mutt then delete the decrypted tmp file

389989
mouse	keyboard
now my mouse keyboard touchpad aren t working and i am stuck on login screen

389994
folder	directory
i want to have folder which represent a view to that directory with a certain filter

390016
versioning	upgrade
second you may think on a kernel upgrade if you aren t on the latest versioning of your distro

390016
ubuntu	debian
these are for ubuntu but you will have a good chance to make them working also on debian

390031
cpu	processors
-i visited intel page for my processors google for intelâ coreâ i7-4700mq processors can t paste links have newbie restrictions for my cpu and it said that it does support 32 gb

390057
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs expects that only one filesystems with a given uuid is present at one time

390059
ubuntu	linux
i am using a university server that runs linux ubuntu 16.04

390089
freebsd	linux
it works on linux and freebsd trueos dragonflysbd and has no hard-wired system call numbers or anything of that sort

390093
cifs	smb
i switched from nfs to smb cifs since the permission system of nfs annoyed me

390095
debian	mint	debian	linux
i have lmde 2 betsy linux mint debian edition installed and am trying to learn to use vim

390099
switching	screens
but when i disconnect the projector later and want to switching back to only using the laptop screens i need to do something like

390117
pull	push
push or pull method can be significant if the transfer uses an adsl line because bitrates are different when you download or when you upload

390171
ubuntu	debian
like what debian ubuntu distribute as somepkg-dbg . idk if that was the case in 2013 when you asked this

390174
filesystems	ntfs
in case of ntfs there is a 3-number combination like x-y-z designating file id in the filesystems

390208
udp	tcp
then i want to use one server 139.162.131.242 as a proxy server to proxy tcp and udp traffic the proxy process listens on local port 8300

390208
udp	tcp
step 3 set up the proxy client program to make all tcp and udp traffic go to the relay server

390208
udp	tcp
for example i am playing a online game that use udp or tcp to communicate with the game server

390220
bash	zsh
with ksh or bash -o extglob or zsh -o kshglob

390223
jobs	cron
is it possible to set my debian 9.1 with kde machine into some sort of performance mode or gaming mode that prevents processes not explicitly started by the user from taking up much system resources lowers the load of background-processes and most importantly delays cron jobs until that mode is stopped again

390229
debian	linux
to get grub-mkconfig which is the backend for debian s update-grub to detect the second linux instance as suggested on the raid wiki page it sufficed to install the os-prober package

390230
jobs	cron
leave the scheduling untouched but run all cron jobs under nice and possibly even ionice

390230
jobs	cron
disallow any cron jobs during certain times

390232
bash	zsh
this is originally a ksh extension to the standard read specification and it s also implemented in bash and zsh

390232
bash	zsh
hence you need to run the script with bash zsh or ksh

390236
jobs	cron
will prevent any cron jobs from running and

390260
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
the processes were ran from inside a dockerised ubuntu 16.04.2 lts see while the host is a centos box linux 3.10.0-514.26.2.el7.x86_64 #1 smp

390260
cpu	processors
the total memory is 1056760752 kb and the number of intel r xeon r cpu e7-4820 v3 1.90ghz processors are 80

390263
dpkg	apt
is there any way to generate binary or deb files of the built opencv library so that i can copy them and install using dpkg or apt

390270
ubuntu	linux
i know that there are linux distributions e.g ubuntu that can be partially adapted to physical mac keyboard and its layout but it is clunky and only covers some scenarios

390272
debian	linux
currently running debian systems with seperate user accounts but could change this an extra layer of some sorts as long as it still appears like debian or maybe other linux at a stretch to the users

390274
filesystems	btrfs
be welcome to include bits regarding other filesystems than just ext4 and btrfs if you find it handy - thank you

390282
freebsd	linux
when you do find isos that do not boot it might be easier to select other linux or freebsd distributions that still support 32-bits operation

390283
bash	zsh
how would you script the result below with the following variables using sh not bash zsh etc.

390300
next	except
i m looking for a way to extract the first column of a text file that has no specific delimiters except for arbitrary digits that begin the next column

390312
hfs+	ntfs
please no ntfs hfs+ plain ufs and exfat unless you can really convince me

390335
bluetooth	usb
part of the problem was that the magic keyboard shows up with vendor id 0x004c bluetooth vendor id for apple and hid-apple only looks for 0x05ac apple usb vendor id so the hid-generic module was used instead of hid-apple

390342
openbsd	linux
i would like to move share some files between linux and openbsd

390342
openbsd	linux
what would be a simple way to share files between linux and openbsd while keeping permissions and timestamps

390346
ubuntu	openbsd
i have my home mounted on both ubuntu and openbsd from an openbsd nfs server and have no issues same uid gid on both systems

390346
openbsd	linux
i ve never tried to share partitions between linux and openbsd i d use virtual machines instead of dual-booting

390363
ubuntu	centos
i am pretty new to shell scripts i have few unix systems of different distro s rhel centos fedora ubuntu is there any way to have a script to check for the filesystem disk space usage example below

390377
stdout	stderr
what is the state of stdin stdout and stderr

390377
stdout	stderr
so does it mean that i don t have stdin and redirect the stderr to stdout

390387
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu on a local pc with the following linux distro kernel

390390
stdout	stderr
under normal circumstances stdin stdout and stderr always exist

390409
openbsd	freebsd
on a freebsd system but could be openbsd or even osx

390409
freebsd	linux
personally i have a dedicated file and media server freebsd with a nfs set-up for shared files between freebsd and linux and samba set-up for windows 10 and osx

390416
openbsd	linux
to mount a linux filesystem sd0a for example onto an openbsd machine do as root

390416
openbsd	linux
if you want to permanently share a linux directory with openbsd use nfs openbsd supports only nfs version 1 to 3

390416
openbsd	linux
on the openbsd side do in the following lines replace linuxhostname by your linux box hostname or ip

390439
versioning	upgrade
note that the database binary data file formats are not backwards compatible so once you have upgrade to mariadb 10.1 you will not be able to switch back to any previous versioning of mariadb or mysql unless you have a proper database dump

390443
children	parent
i want them to always be running - unless the parent process quits or gets killed so i have the children in a loop that just always restarts if it quits

390443
children	parent
when i m sudo ing if i press ctrl+c or press q to quit it will exit the parent main process but not the children and i receive this error

390459
debian	linux
so it seems debian was the first linux distribution to store per-package distribution-specific changelogs separate from the upstream changelogs

390473
versioning	upgrade
as you can see there is a mismatch between the kernel versioning and the modules versioning from the upgrade rootfs therefore commands like iptables will not work

390478
debian	linux
linux version 2.6.26-2-amd64 debian 2.6.26-29 dannf debian.org gcc version 4.1.3 20080704 prerelease debian 4.1.2-25 #1 smp sun mar 4 21 48 06 utc 2012

390491
zsh	tcsh
note that except in zsh or tcsh or if your which is itself a shell function that invokes gnu which as recommended by its manual which will not show the alias while type python will

390493
centos	linux
centos linux release 7.3

390506
filesystems	ntfs
after all this is set and done and your ntfs mounts ok i recommend running a filesystems check to ensure your content is alright

390532
dpkg	apt
i d be more than willing to bet that such an option exists for apt or possibly dpkg itself

390548
folder	directory
i think what you re wanting to copy is all the dns and http log files inside the yyyy-mm-dd folder keeping the directory structure

390551
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i think i added a wrong ppa to my linux mint pointing to some ubuntu stuff

390562
put	get
someone else decided that they needed to get those commands executed so they just put everything in backticks

390570
bluetooth	usb
when i connect a smartphone to it via bluetooth it appears as a hardware input device so that i am unable to change the playback device which is currently my internal soundcard instead of the usb headset i would like

390580
ubuntu	mint
correct libstdc++6 version is 5.4.0 on ubuntu xenial mint 18

390580
ubuntu	mint
that means that libstdc++6 is being fetched from an non-official mint ubuntu repository

390584
bash	zsh
this is not a bourne-style shell like bash ksh zsh busybox and others

390637
kde	gnome
i d like to be able to imitate the functionality shown in my script for gnome in kde plasma

390650
versioning	upgrade
how can i force an aptitude install or upgrade with exactly this versioning

390661
versioning	upgrade
in a given ubuntu release software typically doesnâ t get upgrade to newer upstream versioning it only gets security patches and fixes for serious bugs

390668
jobs	cron
in general it s better to put all non-trivial cron jobs in their own scripts and then schedule these instead

390668
daemon	cron
it additionally makes any subject lines in emails sent to you from the cron daemon more readable

390680
kerberos	ntlm
however yum additionally used to disable kerberos negotiate authentication because in some cases that would be the first option offered and it would fail where ntlm would work

390691
kerberos	ntlm
however yum additionally used to disable kerberos negotiate authentication because in some cases that would be the first option offered and it would fail where ntlm would work

390717
mouse	keyboard
i m using xfce and the screen goes to blank if i m not doing anything on my mouse or keyboard for a while

390734
pull	push
case 1 while the most common is the most complicated because it involves more than just push and pull commands

390750
centos	linux
i...what the...anyways this also happens on centos 7 which is more or less rhel which is more or less oracle linux

390757
for-loop	arrays
i d like the output to scan through both arrays from the outer for-loop and print the respective strings in the inner for-loop which calls echo

390794
portrait	landscape
the photos could be landscape or portrait orientation and this will affect the placement of the watermark .png

390813
put	get
or put them in a git repository so if they do get overwritten it can be reverted

390824
debian	linux
to install taudem in gnu linux debian you can download installation script from this link

390841
bash	zsh
in addition to bash zsh and ksh support

390859
bash	tcsh
if i create a environment variable in bash such as sport baseball then switch to tcsh and change it to running

390862
bash	tcsh
it runs bash sets an environment variable then starts tcsh and changes its value

390862
bash	tcsh
running this bash script which invokes tcsh will result in

390862
bash	subshell	bash	tcsh	subshell	tcsh
but we don t even have to switch to tcsh to see this in action it s enough to introduce a subshell which has a separate environment with ... in our bash script

390882
ubuntu	linux
trying again but this time on ubuntu with the en_us.utf-8 locale should work on any glibc linux and in most locales except the c or posix locales

390893
stdout	stderr
edit if you do want seconds resolution you can use sleep but you have to redirect stdout and stderr in order for ssh to let go of the connection

390922
cpu	processors
binaries are files of computer-readable code in binary format that control the cpu and processors directly with bits

390948
rpm	zypper
after that i run for these rpm s and after this operation zypper is fixed

390960
bash	zsh
on gnu linux and with the gnu shell bash or zsh you can do instead

390960
bash	zsh
that works because bash and zsh implement here-strings with a deleted temporary files and dev stdin on linux is implemented as a symlink to the file which means it can be opened several time and each time it s open at the beginning

390971
ubuntu	linux
enable full read write access to a shared folder on a windows host from an ubuntu guest for a non-root linux user

390976
jobs	cron
so that s exactly the way to set environment variables for your cron jobs

390976
debian	linux
on the debian gnu linux system cron supports the pam_env module and loads the environment specified by etc environment and etc security pam_env.conf

390988
apache	nginx
i ve previously worked with apache and nginx

391027
folder	directory
see this thread which also shows how to include the directory path in the description metadata which is helpful for google photos which does not preserve folder hierarchies

391033
bash	zsh
the local thing requires ash pdksh bash zsh or you can change it to typeset which a few other shells also understand.

391050
daemons	systemd
option so that systemd can identify the main process of the daemons

391064
spaces	delimiter
i have 1 csv file spaces delimiter

391067
bash	zsh
goal script the creation of iptables rules using sh not bash zsh etc. with the following format

391080
stdout	stderr
to be a bit more robust send the exit status to a separate fd so it can be handled independently of stdout stderr

391094
spaces	delimiter
using -t _ -k2 with sort would make sort consider the input as delimiter on the _ character instead of on the spaces and then sort on the second field the one starting with either high or low

391099
disk	ram
ide disk pcnet nic 1 x kvm64 cpu 256 mb ram

391125
udp	tcp
due to the checkum error i disabled the tcp udp checksum offloading to the nic in the vm however it did not help

391145
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux server ubuntu 16.04 where i would like to mount an external storage box where to periodically backup several terabyte of server s data both high and low-frequency changing possibly keeping track of user s attributes owner group permissions

391152
ubuntu	mint
i have then tried several other guides with some more or different mdadm setup stuff tried to install ubuntu instead of mint hoping that it might have better compatibility with my array

391156
switching	screens
ncsd ... the screens goes black and i can t switching between ttys

391158
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
a docker-compose system that sets up 6-7 containers works fine on ubuntu redhat centos and oracle linux

391160
stdout	stderr
normally a cron job s stdout and stderr are e-mailed to me as per the mailto setting in crontab when the job finishes

391160
stdout	stderr
what happens with the stdout stderr of the child job

391167
stdout	stderr
a child process inherits its stdin stdout and stderr from its parent

391167
jobs	cron
fork and exec are common in cron jobs consider that every command you run in a shell script involves a fork exec

391167
stdout	stderr
having it go to a separate mail is easy enough just pipe its stdout stderr to mail or similar

391190
sudoers	passwd
on this machine i am a sudoers and do not have the root passwd

391199
ubuntu	mint
version ubuntu 14 mint 18

391202
cifs	smb
if you absolutely have to mount the storage directory as a filesystem you re pretty obviously stuck using either smb cifs or sshfs which just needs working sftp support on the storage device

391202
cifs	smb
if you can get working nfsv4 support and you absolutely should be able to if it s an ubuntu box regardless of what the oem says that will usually outperform both smb cifs and sshfs most of the time

391202
ssl	https
sftp and scp are what i would probably use in your situation because regular ftp and ftps which is ftp over ssl is crap and webdav regardless of if it s over http or https was not designed for bulk storage scenarios dav stands for distributed authoring and versioning which pretty well describes the fact that it was designed as an alternative to ftp for pushing content to web servers

391231
bash	zsh
in bash ksh or zsh the following simple loop skips repeated events in a 10-second period

391234
put	get
if they try they get suspended by a sigttin t ele t ype in put signal

391234
sudo	passwd
if sudo tries to read from the terminal to prompt for your passwd it gets suspended

391257
debian	linux
i m also in the process of trying to fix an issue with some applications requiring libgcrypt11 package which doesn t exist in current linux repos besides older versions like debian wheezy as most systems today have libgcrypt20 which doesn t work for some applications particularly source games from steam like gmod but i can t install it until this issue is fixed first

391271
freebsd	linux
htop output on a linux machine shows lots of processes for chromium browser while it only shows few processes for chromium on freebsd

391271
freebsd	linux
also my observation is that chromium browser on linux has a very high cpu usage specially when watching youtube videos but on freebsd the cpu usage is much lower

391287
wan	lan
the only way traffic from lan can get to wan is through the router and so in that sense isn t coming from outside from the perspective of the wan zone

391342
ubuntu	debian
failing that it seems to have been removed as a debian and ubuntu package you may use

391344
stdout	stderr
when i run gpg --with-fingerprints --with-colons keyfile.key i get a machine parsable output on stdout containing the key fingerprint for the key inside the keyfile which is exactly what i want plus the following error on stderr

391355
dpkg	apt
the next 2 let dpkg and apt forget existing available info

391356
sudo	passwd
since your script has sudo you can use -s flag to make sudo accept passwd from standard input

391358
mouse	keyboard
the mouse is bus 2 device 7 and the keyboard is 2 4

391376
sudo	passwd
with sudo i press ctr-d at the second passwd request

391411
filesystems	hfs+
this is possible on macos hfs+ filesystems under certain conditions

391444
filesystems	btrfs
i have no idea how btrfs work and i know it s not as the ext filesystems so maybe there is some explanation there but i can not make one out of it

391456
stdout	stderr
when you want to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file you can do it by using or

391457
stdout	stderr
since you have stdout and stderr writing to the file in two different operations the last one to write will overwrite the first

391521
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
the reason i started messing with processors affinity is because i would launch multiple bash child processes and all the bash child process affinities had the value ff so it seemed like they were all targeting the same cpu

391538
post	get
where should i post this so that the right people get to see this message and so can work on it

391544
ubuntu	linux
i have a windows host system running an ubuntu linux guest

391591
range	max	range	min	min	max
ref 3 falls within a range of min input 2 max input 3

391626
min	max
from this array we attain the variables tag min and max

391645
versioning	upgrade
it is reported as reverted to normal but the versioning i am using still shows the symptom although satisfies the upgrade suggestion

391651
gif	png
first command find and list jpeg gif files with png extension

391653
debian	linux
linux kali 4.9.0-kali3-amd64 #1 smp debian 4.9.18-1kali1 2017-04-04 x86_64 gnu linux

391668
hex	binary
unfortunately as i didn t used -w with tcpdump my output isn t binary and wireshark refuses to import file - it tries to read hex data with isn t there

391673
chown	sudo
i ve done sudo chown rvs rvs -r mnt elementery-1tb

391674
bash	zsh
in bash ksh93 or mksh or zsh you can store the files as listed by that gnu ls in an array with

391679
bash	zsh
i didn t test zsh though â there ought to be a bash solution for such a simple thing don t you think

391684
folder	directory
i symlink dot files from my home directory to actual files in a separate folder that is under git source control

391692
folder	directory
if i exclude the directory and only use media homeuser the drive mounts to that folder instead obviously

391709
dpkg	aptitude
i manually installed aptitude alongside apt-get using dpkg

391723
sysv	systemd
synchronizing state of ssh.service with sysv service script with lib systemd systemd-sysv-install

391742
debian	linux
i need a specialized configuration for our companys sftp server to be able to exchange files with our customers in a secure way the server runs debian linux 8.7

391742
folder	directory
how should i handle the .ssh folder for the different users when the home folder is the corresponding sftp chroot directory if this is a correct solution at all

391770
versioning	upgrade
make sure that the systemd package is also upgrade versioning 232 worked for me

391796
sudo	passwd
both of these commands work note the -s in sudo tells sudo to read the passwd from stdin

391820
sudo	passwd
at first sudo will execute and reads the passwd from stdin

391820
sudo	passwd
note sudo doesn t ask the passwd for a while after the first use

391820
sudo	passwd
this way sudo doesn t read from stdin and your passwd in the stdin will be read by tee

391820
sudo	passwd
to make sure sudo ask for passwd run sudo -k to invalidates cached credentials

391822
portrait	landscape
however i would like pandoc to output my pdf pages in landscape rather than portrait format

391828
packets	pcap
then use another awk to take the time from column 1 of each line of your data file and prepend it to this same packets telling the conversion program to extract this timestamp in the given format and get it converted to pcap format suitable for wireshark

391835
mouse	keyboard
note for full console input output i have used in the past an ipkvm hardware device as linked to in the comments by roaima that plugs in to the usb and appears to the bios and os as keyboard and mouse

391836
arp	udp	arp	tcp	udp	tcp
and to properly fake packets with the hints given in the tcpdump output make a frame make ip with the ip addresses make a tcp or udp packet of the correct size and ports what about arp and other protocols etc etc etc

391836
packets	pcap
for instead packets per second from the timestamps without the fuss of pcap one could first use an epoch-to-packets-seen-in-that-second script

391838
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your kernel to the newest versioning in the hope that maybe in the meantime a driver for the codec has been added

391870
debian-based	ubuntu
if you have a ubuntu system maybe any debian-based system it is very likely that your session will be locked as you have executed the ctrl + alt + delete shortcut

391910
rpm	yum
theres a lot of downloadable files showing if i type in google yum php7 rpm

391939
wan	lan
for example where obviously stands in for the wan interface of the router does not block incoming tcp connections to non-router hosts on the lan

391939
udp	tcp
how do i default-block incoming tcp connections on the wan interface regardless of destination host and block incoming privileged-port udp connections on the wan interface regardless of destination host using ufw

391968
hid	keyboard
029 042 054 and 056 are the keyboard codes normalized into a common system from the usb hid usage numbers and the ps 2 scancode numbers but it is the lctrl lshift rshift and lalt actions in the map that define these keys to be modifier keys

391968
implements	modifiers
the exception to the rule is the fn key which is the one modifiers that is implements in hardware

391968
hid	keyboard
but most operating systems with ps 2 or usb hid devices from ms pc-dos where the current modifier state is a well-known byte in memory to windows nt where keyboard maps are kernel-mode dlls containing code and data work in roughly this way

391982
bash	zsh
in ksh zsh bash yash you may want to use arrays instead or associative arrays in ksh93 zsh or recent versions of bash

391982
bash	zsh
note that ksh bash array indices start at 0 and arrays are sparse more like associative arrays with keys limited to positive integers while in all other shells including zsh and yash on the bourne-like front indices start at 1 and arrays are normal arrays

391982
bash	zsh
in ksh bash zsh -o ksharrays

391982
bash	zsh
or using another ... extension of the posix sh syntax common to ksh zsh bash

391982
bash	zsh
or with ksh93 bash zsh -o ksharrays

391993
atom-editor	sublimetext
i m currently learning web development html css javascript etc. i want to install either atom-editor sublimetext adobe brackets or visual studio code but i am running arm arch linux

391995
ubuntu	linux
i am new to ubuntu and fairly new to linux as a whole

392008
mouse	keyboard
until you can update the kernel and bluez on affected systems you can mitigate the issue by disabling bluetooth which might have adverse effects of course especially if you use a bluetooth keyboard or mouse

392015
pop-up	dialog
this seems to suggest the only way to enter a domain is via a pop-up dialog box

392029
daemons	systemd
it applies additional restrictions on most systemd daemons

392034
xfce	gnome
after this mess happened i tried installing other desktop environments like gnome or xfce but none of them work

392038
filesystems	btrfs
a dev mapper alexmini-vg--root logical volume containing a btrfs filesystems

392038
filesystems	btrfs
dev sdb1_crypt contains a btrfs filesystems

392038
filesystems	btrfs
the btrfs filesystems is also my root filesystems

392043
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i ve spent the last year trying to install either ubuntu cinnamon or linux mint with cinnamon

392075
openbsd	linux
if your system has inotifywait most linux distributions openbsd and possibly others as others have mentioned the least resource-intensive approach is to use inotifywait

392081
bash	zsh
bin bash she-bang indicates though it looks more like a mix between bash zsh and ksh93 syntax if it s meant to check for quad-decimal ipv4 addresses where the parts are limited to 3 decimal digits in bash it would give some errors about 008.008.008.008 for instance

392082
ubuntu	mint
you should eventually get output of the dependencies and these should all be compatible make sure to download them for your version of mint ubuntu

392094
debian	linux
note debian wiki but it is possible to replicate in other linux distros

392101
mouse	keyboard
you d need to get this to be supported by the compositor e.g gnome in your case or have the compositor expose a way e.g via a wayland protocol to lock the mouse and keyboard so that you can modify pyxtrlock to work with that compositor

392109
wan	lan
lets say we have three device interfaces lo lan and wan

392117
ubuntu	centos
i am trying to run this below command from a centos local machine on a remote ubuntu server

392130
bluetooth	usb	mouse	keyboard
my computer has a bluetooth keyboard connected using a usb bluetooth adapter and a wireless non-bluetooth mouse

392130
bluetooth	usb
bluetooth usb keyboard does not work when attached to this computer however works flawlessly attached to another machine

392139
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
if your root filesystems spans multiple encrypted partitions such as a btrfs filesystems or a filesystems sitting in an lvm logical volume you will not be able to properly mount the filesystems at boot because only one of your encrypted partitions will be decrypted

392139
filesystems	btrfs
for btrfs filesystems cryptroot will run btrfs commands to query the partitions backing your filesystems

392139
filesystems	btrfs
side note whenever the update-grub runs for btrfs filesystems spanning multiple devices it does not generate the kernel command line properly

392146
hash	md5
this bash script uses the md5sum utility from gnu coreutils to compute the md5 hash from the base name sans extension of any given pathname

392146
hash	md5
where c9e89fa443d16da4b96ea858881320c9 is the md5 hash of the string file name here

392146
hash	md5
note that running this twice on a set of files will compute the md5 hash of md5 hash and that the original filename then becomes unrecoverable unless you make careful notes about what files are called what after each run of the script

392186
ubuntu	linux
one volume is for files shared between ubuntu and kali and other two are of kali linux

392187
ubuntu	linux
the very same script works on ubuntu linux instances provided by travis and fails on os x instances

392204
cpu	processors
however if it is really required to hold this processors on the maximum frequency and see beautiful numbers in cpu usage it is possible to change cpu governor from powersave to performance - look on the internet but remember that your cpu must be driven by pstate

392206
centos	linux
i m on centos linux release 7.3.1611 core and in etc modprobe.d

392225
zsh	subshell
zsh alternative that avoids forking a subshell

392225
zsh	subshell	bash	zsh	bash	subshell
bash alternative that avoids forking a subshell also works in recent versions of zsh

392236
folder	directory
is there a way to copy the entire directory structure all folder and sub-folders but ignore any symlinks

392239
debian	linux
i m using debian linux ruby on rails 5 on apache with passenger

392245
daemons	systemd
or start it as a daemons when the systemd boots up

392255
jobs	cron
i m trying to use this line in a bash script to update my cron jobs

392258
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu 16.04.2 lts gnu linux 4.4.0-83-generic x86_64

392265
hid	keyboard
so you need a custom kernel keyboard or hid mapping that maps your keycode 264 and the rest to other unused keycodes that are in the admissable range

392266
switching	screens
if i switching for example to workspace w2 it should be visible on the beamer and cloned to the laptop screens automatically as well

392266
switching	screens
however if i switching from w2 to s the workspace w2 should stay visible on the beamer but s should appear on the laptop screens with mouse focus

392269
free	malloc
you are not supposed to do explicit memory allocation and management malloc free in c in java the jvm takes care of all this for you

392286
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu ship a password caching script decrypt_keyctl with cryptsetup package

392363
tunnel	vpn
otherwise the vpn tunnel couldn t connect to the other endpoint

392372
solaris	aix
the remaining problem there are 2-byte wchar systems cygwin windows plus aix and solaris on 32bit which need to transform codepoints from upper planes into surrogate pairs and vice versa and the underlying libunistring gnulib cannot handle that yet

392397
bash	zsh
that in posix shells like bash in list context is the split+glob operator zsh only does the split part as you d expect

392397
bash	zsh
it does have the disadvantage though that the full content of the file has to be stored in memory several times with shells like bash and zsh

392397
bash	zsh
with some shells ksh zsh and to a lesser extent bash you can optimise it with instead of

392397
bash	zsh
or with gnu mv and gnu xargs and ksh zsh bash

392400
versioning	upgrade
the two servers upgrade one package the same versioning but only one server need to restart

392403
bash	zsh
this assumes gnu date and a shell like bash ksh93 or zsh

392404
bash	zsh
assuming gnu date is available you can use this bash ksh93 zsh script

392418
debian	linux
so i use my raspberry pi zero w raspberry pi with built in wifi running debian linux as a security camera and lately it is streaming much slower now only getting .3 fps whereas i used to get 10

392419
bash	zsh
of the 3 shells that support that for ... syntax ksh93 where it comes from zsh and bash two have built-in support for that though in different ways

392423
daemons	systemd
libexec is meant for systemd daemons and systemd utilities executed by other programs

392425
versioning	upgrade
i managed to run a dnf upgrade --refresh which dropped in a new versioning of the kernel but the issues remain

392435
folder	directory
i want to copy the content of this folder to the current working directory

392444
bash	tcsh
if you re learning shell programming do consider learning the sh shell unless your work requires you to grok csh and tcsh scripts in this case you may use a sh shell like bash as your interactive shell regardless of what types of scripts you work with

392454
centos	linux
i have to configure yocto 2.3 emulator in linux centos 7 eclipse

392460
put	get
also this process doesn t get put in a new session scope unit

392479
fish	zsh
that s to work around a bug misfeature in shells other than zsh fish and the descendants of the forsyth shell including pdksh and derivatives whereby the globs includes

392479
fish	zsh
though beware that if there s no non-hidden file it could change the permissions of the file unless you had the failglob option on to mimic the behaviour of zsh fish

392483
centos	linux
how to restrict some commands for admin in linux centos

392484
installation	upgrade
installation and upgrade guide

392517
dnf	yum
the etc sudoers file is marked config noreplace which means that if it has been edited a yum or dnf update would not overwrite it

392523
versioning	upgrade
stephenkitt added that upgrade userspace might require a newer versioning of the kernel in which case the system might not be able to boot with the old kernel and that distribution release notes mention this when appropriate

392529
mouse	keyboard
doesn t allow keyboard without mouse

392539
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
in sshd_config while keywords are case-insensitive arguments are case-sensitive

392581
ubuntu	debian
it s a type of apt repository and a service where people can publish their own packages in addition to the ones that debian and ubuntu publish

392588
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
you don t state your distribution but these drivers are packaged for debian and therefore ubuntu and presumably other major linux distributions as well

392590
gentoo	linux
i use funtoo linux clone of gentoo with git instead of rsync and some bug-fixes as i read

392594
packets	multicast
the moment you enable the send to computer option from the camera it starts broadcasting upnp udp packets across the network to multicast address 239.255.255.250 1900

392634
ssid	wlan
i have to prepare an embedded linux board for commercial distribution and preconfigure a wlan binding in order to at the first system startup trying to connect to a ssid provided by the user guide

392637
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
on debian based linux distributions and ubuntu these come packaged in the zlib1g-dev package for example

392643
ubuntu	debian
if networkmanager was provided by your distribution then it s preferable to report the bug to the package maintainers through for ubuntu for debian etc.

392676
ubuntu	debian
under debian ubuntu this can be installed with

392679
hid	keyboard
those are perfectly conventional input reports for a conventional usb hid keyboard device with the conventional 8-byte boot report descriptor

392696
filesystems	btrfs
i am not familiar with the details of btrfs but i see the risk that the metadata dump of a damaged filesystems might be incomplete

392719
bash	zsh
in shells that have the ksh93 operator ksh93 bash zsh mksh offset and length are expressed in number of characters not bytes utf-8 however is the only multi-byte character encoding supported by mksh and only when the utf8-mode option is enabled

392731
dnf	yum
so installing a fedora centos always requires a post section in the kickstart file where you would call a dnf yum update -y in order to upgrade the old and outdated packages

392731
dnf	yum
this is a waste of time and bandwidth and the dnf yum installer can use multiple repositories at the same time and pick the latest version

392731
dnf	yum
how can i tell anaconda during a fresh install to include the updates repository for installation so that a yum dnf update -y afterwards is not required as the updates woud already be installed

392742
filesystems	btrfs
note btrfs and zfs filesystems may span multiple devices but only one will be listed here

392743
mouse	keyboard
this happens on both 1 an asus vivopc vm62n-g050r with the supplied wireless asus keyboard mouse running slackware 14.1x64 dual-booting with the native win8.1 and on 2 a generic whitebox with a wireless logitech mk520 keyboard mouse running slackware 14.2x64

392743
mouse	keyboard
everything works great on both boxes until i plug in an external usb disk and then the keyboard mouse hangs pretty badly maybe 5-10secs between pressing a key and its display or 5-10secs between moving a mouse and the cursor beginning to move in a jittery fashion

392743
mouse	keyboard
but if i then plug a wired usb keyboard mouse into any adjacent usb port that works fine

392743
mouse	keyboard
since the wired usb keyboard mouse works i m guessing it s not a usb problem per se

392743
mouse	keyboard
only thing i can guess is that slackware s loading some module when it sees the usb drive get plugged in and that module s interfering somehow with a module for the wireless keyboard mouse

392752
sysv	systemd
these are buildroot linux so no systemd but the former sysv environment

392758
debian	linux
having debian gnu linux 9.1 stretch using its systemd-networkd and libvirt

392770
bash	zsh
that would work with dash bash zsh mksh busybox sh posh on linux but not ksh93

392781
stdout	stderr
first means redirect stdout and stderr to a file named 4 you probably mean

392783
ubuntu	linux
i have an ubuntu linux image which i use for my single board computer

392792
jobs	cron
you can read more about setting up cron jobs here or here

392832
put	get
it would be better to use a shell function for this and to get the -exec right don t put in a subshell

daemons	systemd
many of them allow inter-operation of different systemd daemons which usually do not use same files

fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
shells supporting arrays are t csh ksh bash zsh rc es yash fish

392843
fish	bash
and to be able to use that variable as just as opposed to in ksh bash yash or in t csh you d need a shell with a sane array implementation rc es or fish

spaces	delimiter
-w - use whitespace one or more spaces and or tabs for input field delimiter

392860
spaces	delimiter
-t - use spaces instead of tab as output field delimiter

392861
spaces	delimiter
this is pasted together with the last two columns from the original file produced by the second cut using a single spaces as a delimiter

392916
switching	screens
i have installed a debian 9 minimal install with drivers and just necessary stuff to autorun an emulator app when system starts and when app is started is called from xsession in etc x11 and runs in windowed mode my gamepad is working perfectly but when i switching to fullscreen then gamepad is not working and i see only a part of the app screens with black borders around

freebsd	linux
there are tools to do much the same in both freebsd and linux and other operating systems besides

392975
ubuntu	debian
i m attempting to mount an ubuntu .iso to a usb drive using the dd command in debian however i m having trouble

392976
bash	zsh
if you wanted to assign the value of 4th element of the array to you d do in zsh or in ksh and bash which just copied ksh arrays

392991
packets	multicast
wireshark verifies the packets are really multicast

392993
bash	zsh
so with gnu xargs and a shell with support for process substitution like ksh zsh or bash

392993
bash	zsh
to get the exact value of the exit status of the here last failing commmand with zsh or bash you can also do

393014
filesystems	btrfs
the disk is a hdd was installed with an os kubuntu 14.04 with a swap partition and used the btrfs filesystems

393048
freebsd	linux
gettid returns the thread id on linux and it appears it doesn t have a direct equivalent on freebsd

393048
freebsd	linux
so given the error it seems the software you re trying to compile has a hard requirement for linux and the appropriate course of action would be to file a bug report to get it ported to freebsd

393067
sudo	passwd
now on a local user whenever i execute a command with sudo the prompt asks twice for a passwd

393068
vim	atom-editor
as a self-imposed exercise i am trying to create a fully functional desktop launcher shortcut for the text editor atom-editor i know vim is great but that s beside the point here folks

i ve added the following to the etc sudoers file using pkexec visudo and there are no syntax errors but it is still not working any ideas

393127
mp4	h.264
ffmpeg automatically selects x264 for h.264 video in mp4

393130
rtsp	rtcp	rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp
i ve used vlc a few years back to send a video using rtp and its two friends rtsp and rtcp

393139
stdout	stderr
you either need to take that into account when coding these programs or code some wrapping shell script setting things well redirecting stdin stdout stderr

393146
ctime	posix
on linux and on most other systems though posix doesn t give you that guarantee unless the move was across file systems that would have updated their ctime so assuming none of the other ones in usr bin have been touched in the last 24 hours you should be able to move them back with

393151
versioning	upgrade
the erlang provided by epel repository is of versioning r16b03 and its better to remove and upgrade it

393153
folder	directory
terminology unix have directory not folder

393153
dpkg	aptitude
the wise approach is to never change usr bin bin sbin usr sbin outside of package management tools dpkg apt-get aptitude etc...

393163
rar	zip
the answers to that question show that rar and 7z multi-files can be easily created but i wondered if zip files can be as accessible

393169
folder	directory
this swill prevent passing full path of file relative to current working directory and avoid a folder with same pattern to be renaming wrong instead of file name itself

393169
bash	zsh
instead of or better switch to new shells like bash zsh

393183
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
for a shell with real arrays you can have a look at shells like rc es fish yash zsh or even csh tcsh though those shells have so many issues they re better avoided

393183
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
in fish not a bourne-like shell contrary to bash zsh

393190
ubuntu	linux
with above details and benchmark test which on can run linus only usb 3.0 can or both can also please specified which kind of linux i want to know if centos7 ubuntu or tails os for tor browser can run on it notice i m using all os above for desktop version not terminal version

some of the most popular and mainstream linux distributions are arch linux centos debian fedora gentoo linux linux mint mageia opensuse and ubuntu together with commercial distributions such as redhat enterprise linux

393197
redhat	fedora
on fedora and other redhat family distributions that file as presented by agetty â on other distros different getty programs may be used but the concept is basically the same

393199
versioning	upgrade
if i install linux-lts or upgrade the linux package using pacman a folder with the corresponding kernel versioning name is created in lib modules as should be but xorg fails to run because it still looks for drivers in lib modules 4.10.13-1-arch

393199
versioning	upgrade
also even after the upgrade the terminal still shows the linux versioning as 4.10.13-1 instead of the upgrade one

393204
ubuntu	centos
it should be general also because it used to happen to me in ubuntu the version lts up to date in 2016 and also on centos 7 which i installed about one year ago on the same desktop a 2011 hp compaq 8000 elite

393205
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux

the destination of the stream is 10.0.2.2 tunnel address of d for the udp and rtp method

393213
cinnamon	gnome
i ve tried gnome and cinnamon and get the same result

393225
folder	directory
directory permissions on the shared folder are

393232
queue	fifo
if i use fq_codel as the queue discipline and ath9k_htc doesn t support it then does the system become unstable or fallback to fifo

393261
folder	directory
i need to extract huge file .tgz where i have thousands of unnecessary sessions located in folder var s3 tmp so i want to exclude that directory while i m extracting that file

393272
ubuntu	centos
so i have a centos or ubuntu docker container and discovered that there are no ip netstat to ifconfig

393305
filesystems	xfs
so does this also happens when doing cp on a linux with ext4 or xfs journaling filesystems

393322
cpu	hyperthreading
my machine cpu is 24 core and i run 47 sandbox using hyperthreading on kvm

393354
ethernet	wireless
it will be a device that when you plug an ethernet cable in will provide wireless access to the network

393363
lvm	mdadm
if you re using lvm on top of mdadm sometimes lvm will not delete the device mapper devices when deactivating the volume group

393386
ubuntu	linux
i know this isn t strictly linux but as my host is ubuntu i thought i d ask

393417
freebsd	linux
the lm-sensors package can do this on linux but it s not available on freebsd

393466
spaces	delimiter
reads and splits the first line into an array ary1 with one-or-more spaces delimiter between

393471
folder	directory
the new files will be placed in the modified folder in the current directory

393533
ubuntu	centos
it works as it should on ubuntu 12.04 ubuntu 16.04.3 centos 6.9 and centos 7.4

393536
chown	chmod
more easily by lessening the need to use chmod or chown to share new

393536
chmod	mkdir
if commands like chmod and mkdir routinely

393546
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
but what happens if both hosts are running linux say ubuntu server or centos 7 or a mixture of the two -- just both machines running linix

393569
disk	ram
use disk ram network usage for a full conclusion and may be per proccess load

393570
centos	linux
i m using centos linux release 7.2.1511 core and updated virtual machine manager 1.4.1

393584
gentoo	ubuntu
a gentoo host and an ubuntu container

393591
arp	icmp
this will use arp instead of icmp

393595
versioning	upgrade
i can not access my samba shares after upgrade my centos to 7.4 samba versioning was upgrade to 4.6.2

393601
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome 61 and firefox 55 but doesn t work in chromium 63

393606
kde	kubuntu
as the title says i have no colors in my terminal on kde kubuntu 16.04.1

393626
perl	tcl
tcl uses the same syntax as perl for this around the variable name

393636
chown	chmod
attempting to change these values via chmod chown will return success but have no effect

393643
filtering	grouping
grouping search filtering blank

393643
filtering	grouping
grouping membership filtering blank

393682
centos	linux
here is the reason why you get this error from yum update you have redhat linux 6 or centos 6 and google chrome browser no longer supports your os rhel6

393702
uniq	grep
with lspci -kk | grep kernel modules | sort | uniq i could list the modules in use currently and with them together with the default config i got it up and running

393703
bash	zsh
bash uses .bash_history as the default history file ksh93 has no default according to its manual nor does zsh

393722
versioning	upgrade
you should also upgrade to a newer versioning of openbsd

393726
bash	zsh
the above works in bash ksh93 and zsh but the emacs command line editing mode is not standard as in posix standard

393744
centos	linux
it looks like youâ re running amazon linux which gets most of its base packages from centos 6

393763
rpm	yum
remove yum package and replace with rpm package

393777
jobs	cron
cron jobs are not run in the same environment as your interactive gui environment and you may therefore not generally schedule cron jobs as if they were ordinary commands typed at the command prompt without taking care to set up the needed environment variables etc

393785
sctp	udp
there are some file types like datagram sockets udp sctp or unix domain at least or sock_seqpacket on some systems that preserves message boundaries but you d need a different api than read and write if you want to allow empty messages and the reader would have to know in advance the maximum possible size of those messages and allocate a buffer that big to receive it

393792
hash	md5
m --- md5 hash value only checks on file content not permissions etc.

393793
ubuntu	centos
with a nmap scan from ubuntu machine i can see remote 666 port as open while from centos machine 666 port is filtered

393793
ubuntu	centos
in vmware client i can see ubuntu network adapter type where it works is defined as flexible while centos one is defined as vmxnet 3

393796
packets	pcap
from the captured pcap file i found that the packets are captured captured on receiving side it means packets has reached the machine but there was no ack sent

393848
mouse	keyboard
didn t you plug your hard disk into an usb slot which is dedicated for keyboard mouse

393871
ubuntu	debian
googling a bit brought up the debian ubuntu package firmware-b43-installer

393873
debian	linux
i am running arch linux with a debian lxc container

393885
ubuntu	mint
i bought a used thinkpad laptop recently with no operating system installed and have tried running ubuntu mint manjaro fedora and others on this machine to no avail

393896
debian-based	ubuntu
in debian-based distros including ubuntu the package command-not-found is commonly installed and available as usr lib command-not-found from the link

393916
toupper	uppercase
toupper str - return a copy of the string str with all the lowercase characters in str translated to their corresponding uppercase counterparts

393919
kate	kde
in the terminal and with a text editor kate in kde the users can collaborate on files that were created in shared1 as expected

393919
umask	mount
i do not want to use the umask mount option for sshfs in etc fstab as that does not give the desired behavior

393936
postgresql	mysql
it is for well-known reasons important that a service such as mysql or indeed postgresql or mariadb or percona or many other database systems shut down cleanly and not simply be killed without the server having the chance to flush its database tables indexes and whatnot from memory to disc

393938
umask	mount
it is important to note that using the sshfs mount option umask is not recommended

393938
kate	kde
while this solution works on the command line and with some desktop apps kde s kate text editor it does not work correctly with many desktop applications including kde s dolphin file manager xsane etc.

393939
stdout	stderr
after trying the tr solution below i was able to get real time output but if i try to redirect via pipe or via stdout stderr redirection i get buffered results of 50-60 lines at a time instead of getting a line by line result

393940
translation	transliteration
you can translation or transliteration the # characters into newlines with

393944
bash	zsh
the above solution has the benefit of working in at least bash unless you have a debug trap set and zsh

393969
filesystems	btrfs
you can increase total swap space by creating a swap file note you can t place a swap file on btrfs filesystems

393971
udp	tcp
from then on it can interact with one several or all node demonds via udp unicasts or tcp or whatever

393973
disk	ram
i ve got 32g of ram and the ram disk size is 50 16g so i need to create a new ram disk everytime i boot the read-only usb containing the custom kali iso

393974
daemons	launchd
contrary to classic versions of telnetd the one provided with busybox is a standalone daemons which needs a -i option to interface with inetd services launchd by inetd have a specific interface incompatible with a standalone daemons they must not open and listen to sockets they must communicate with the client through stdin stdout

393985
sudo	passwd
to be able to change to another user with sudo from the postgres unix user account you will either have to assign the postgres user a passwd or allow the user to use sudo in that way without a passwd not something i would recommend

393986
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	opensuse	gentoo	debian
include debian ubuntu fedora gentoo and opensuse

393996
dnf	yum
but i m on fedora rather than centos and have dnf instead of yum

394029
bash	zsh
contrary to ksh or zsh bash has no builtin support for sorting arrays or lists of arbitrary strings

394032
versioning	upgrade
the easy way is to install debian stretch then upgrade your kernel versioning from backports kernel 4.13 is available

394041
daemons	systemd
if your logging daemons wants to get access to all logging data then it should listen on run systemd journal syslog instead via the syslog.socket unit file that is shipped along with systemd

394041
daemons	systemd
on a systemd systemd it is no longer ok to listen on dev log directly and your daemons may not bind to the run systemd journal syslog socket on its own

394041
stdout	stderr
if you do that then you will lose logging from stdout stderr of services as well as other stuff

394041
daemons	systemd
you really need specific systemd support if you want to run as a syslog daemons under it

394041
stdout	stderr
this is definitely the least evil option because a it avoids fighting with journald over who owns dev log b journald will write messages to it from stdout stderr of services which are never written to dev log

394044
pulseaudio	mixer
alsa exposes all the hardware mixer volume controls while pulseaudio has a single volume control for each input device and output device which uses all alsa mixer volume controls in turn

394052
disk	ram
i have researched ram disk a bit but i m not sure if it s what i need or if i can just edit boot options

394054
mouse	joystick
i think your re trying to setup a ir radio device or mouse joystick

394063
unix	bsd
ps is especially hairy because it has totally different options if you use the - posix unix style or without bsd

394065
portrait	landscape
when i scan documents that are landscape oriented the output pdf files are portrait and so all the pdf viewers display the scanned documents in portrait

394080
folder	directory
we create a directory or folder for each client record in our database so documents can be saved into that folder for accessing by via the client record in other words a document management system

394083
bash	zsh
or bash zsh ksh

394083
gentoo	debian
so run debian derivatives rhel derivatives gentoo pacman -qi dash arch brew list dash homebrew and so on

394095
stdout	stderr
how can i capture stdout stderr in a file but still see it in my console

394115
ubuntu	debian
the debian and ubuntu people for example provide a hook in their own lib lsb init-functions.d subsystem that acts as follows

394115
ubuntu	debian
for example provide no van smoorenburg rc compatibility at all not providing a hook like debian s ubuntu s and even outright disabling the compatibility mechanism that comes with vanilla systemd

394120
filesystems	btrfs
now if you copy files lots of them by adding another clone snapshot of the filesystems in say btrfs the situation is different now you ve copied all files in the filesystems and any changes to them will be copy-on-write

394144
filesystems	btrfs
this works on filesystems which support copy-on-write reflink mainly btrfs at the moment

394185
jobs	cron
your system needs an mta to handle local mail for example to deliver output from cron jobs

394186
ubuntu	opensuse
i am swiching from ubuntu to opensuse on my system

394187
sysv	systemd
is etc init.d the default search path that the systemd generator uses to convert native sysv script to unit files and falls back to etc rc

394187
sysv	systemd
as far as i can tell the procedure goes in the following way systemd finds sysv scripts in etc init.d and depending on the runlevel systemd decides to start or stop the scripts according to the symlink name or from etc rc

394187
sysv	systemd
this makes sense because once the sysv script is converted into a native systemd unit file the decision to start or to stop the process has to be obtained from etc rc

394194
min	max
this approach allows you to do more sophisticated queries than max or min if you need to

394217
sudo	passwd
so i logout and try to use sudo with zypper command and it ask for the root passwd and not mine

394244
bash	zsh
those time format directives initially come from csh though bash contrary to zsh or gnu time only supports a tiny subset

394272
put	get
will get the first parameter argument you passed to the function by calling myfunc 08 and put it into variable which is pretty useless step you can directly use variable wherever you need into the function

394275
vim	gedit
i don t know gedit but in vim you may access environment variables with a shell-like syntax

394278
cpu	hyperthreading
in case of hyperthreading cpus there is an interesting side effect loading a cpu makes its hyperthreading pairs slower

394284
cpu	processors
this calculation based on processes placed in processors s queues but not on real cpu utilization which all are accustomed to see in percentage terms like in windows

394317
integer	unsigned
angle brackets denotes a 32-bit unsigned integer array and i believe they are often refereed to as cells

394327
min	max
count min max

394328
arp	udp
when linux receives a udp packet originating from a sender having a lan source ip will linux put the source mac address of this packet along the source ip address into the arp cache table

394356
ubuntu	openbsd
the system configuration variable arg_max which has the value of the symbolic constant _sc_arg_max has the value 2097152 on ubuntu and 262144 on openbsd getconf arg_max

394357
debian	linux
i am running a custom distribution of linux for arm architecture debian packages for arm can be installed in this distribution

394382
prometheus	grafana
the latest version of grafana in ports and pkg install is 1.9.1 which doesn t support prometheus

394402
kde	gnome
the kde and gnome and gnome desktop environments have filesystem wrappers that allow compliant software to access the shares

394405
post	get
i have read a few post about rebuilding gnome-settings-daemon but i can t get a clear tutorial on how to do it at least not for centos

394409
qmail	exim
look for packages for qmail postfix exim smail zmailer mmdf or sendmail being installed

394412
gentoo	linux
also be sure to try calculate linux and redcore as they include larger pre-built binary repositories while staying close to gentoo roots

394418
bash	zsh
some line editors like readline used by bash gdb ... zle used by zsh pdksh s when in vi mode behave like vi in that regard and when in emacs mode behave like the tty line discipline not emacs

394418
tcsh	dash
libedit used by bsd shells or optionally dash tcsh at t ksh in emacs mode behave like emacs where w deletes to the mark initially at the beginning of the buffer

394418
zsh	tcsh
in the tcsh school tcsh libedit zsh word motions are based on whitespace-delimited words so are consistent with the tty line discipline s w in that regard

394420
redhat	fedora
if the issue isn t as indicated by the accepted answer and or you re not on fedora redhat korora etc then this won t help you

394431
daemons	systemd
i have a c++ based application which i m running executable as a daemons with systemd

394433
centos	linux
on a linux machine at work centos 7 i am running into opengl errors when launching an gui based app

394650
screens	tablet
the emulator shuts down to a black screens but the tablet is still on

394650
switching	screens
i can t input any commands because the device does not have any hardware buttons other than a rocking power switching and the update button used to get to this screens

394650
screens	tablet
turning it off and on again after reaching this screens causes the tablet to boot normally

394681
zypper	yum
try installing the rpms with a package manager like zypper or yum

394696
freebsd	linux
if you are using node.js you can use this native add on to get block device size physical sector size and logical sector size with support for freebsd linux macos and windows

394709
kde	gnome
it is fine to provide specific solutions for different desktops environments gnome kde â but of course a cross-compatible solution is preferred

394715
ffmpeg	libav
i ve installed youtube-dl and ffmpeg and downloaded libav

394715
ffprobe	avprobe	ffmpeg	libav
i used to get an error that said i needed to download ffprobe or avprobe so i m not sure i have the ffmpeg and libav installed properly

while dnf allows me to work with the non-running system i can t figure out how to use rpm -v on a non-running system

394841
rpm	dnf
it seems like you are simply looking for the rpm --root option which is roughly analogous to dnf --installroot

debian or ubuntu may be the most obvious choices as these linuxes most closely resembles kali

394924
opera	google-chrome
while watching video bbc ipayer youtube on google-chrome or opera my system would freeze after 30 min of watching with a sound loop of 1 second length kept repeating

394926
lvm	btrfs
resize a btrfs partition inside a logical lvm volume

394938
int	double
note that in zsh like in many other languages operations involving floats are done in floating point arithmetics with your processor s double type while those involving int only are done in int arithmetics with your processor s long type

394947
daemons	systemd
option so that systemd can identify the main process of the daemons

394947
daemons	systemd
so when systemd activates a daemons process it waits for it before it activiates follow up units

394949
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
the linux mint 17.x is based on ubuntu 14.04 trusty so for example

394949

for simple cases you can use single-quotes to protect your command from the local shell or escape the double-quotes as

395008
udp	tcp
trying to emulate a game server but the game has the server ip hardcoded this needs to work for tcp and udp

395008
udp	tcp
for udp this doesn t really matter however with tcp this causes the handshake to fail

395009
children	parent
i need to scan all pages from this website - parent children and so on

395039
ubuntu	debian
keep in mind that i am a beginner to all this i used to be able to dual boot windows 10 and ubuntu but i wanted to change to debian

395039
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
i have tried opensuse debian and ubuntu

395041
filesystems	btrfs
note due to btrfs checksums a read error will be detected if you just mount the filesystems and try to use it

395075
tunnel	vpn
i installed openvpn pivpn to be more specific on a raspberry pi and i even think i was able to connect to the internet through the vpn tunnel after the installation but now it does not work anymore

395075

chown	mkdir	chown	sudo
then after a reboot i recreate the directory with sudo mkdir var run stunnel and then set the rights with sudo chown nobody nobody var run stunnel although this disappears after a reboot at least while it is running i can see the log in the background during testing and after startup

395188
hash	md5
i need to hash each line of second file md5 and compare it with the first file line by line like that

395197

395215
ubuntu	debian
replace with debian ubuntu etc

395226
centos	linux
after research i found this link that states how to compile files under linux to run in esxi it states it needs centos 3.9 machine which i currently don t have

395254
ubuntu	debian
assuming you are using debian or ubuntu that may work with the installation image for that distribution you can get into a shell or you can use something like systemrescuecd which besides the name can be booted from various media including network boot via pxe

395274
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to mount at boot a hfs+ core partition in linux ubuntu

395279
opensuse	linux
i have a linux system opensuse leap but it s not that important installed on a logical volume and the ext4 filesystem

395279
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade it to a newer versioning but to be on the safe side i want to create an lvm snapshot first in case something goes wrong

395279
versioning	upgrade
my current lv does not have enough capacity to hold both the old versioning of the file system on a snapshot and the new versioning after upgrade the lv has 12gb the files take 8 gb leaving 4 gb free

395293
mouse	keyboard
screen locks up audio repeats a short pattern no response to keyboard or mouse

395296
ubuntu	mint
as the mint is based on the ubuntu this howto should be usable for you too

395343
gentoo	linux
gentoo profile is default linux amd64 13.0 desktop

395349
jobs	cron
edit i m aware that i could disable anacron completely but there are other cron jobs that requires anacron

395351
jobs	cron
there is absolutely no issues with running both cron and anacron jobs on the same machine

395351
jobs	cron
just make sure that jobs handled by cron are not also handled by anacron and vice versa

395367
filesystems	fat
filenames that the original fat filesystems did not have

395383
postfix	dovecot
the problem here isn t with postfix but with dovecot

395383
postfix	dovecot
since dovecot doesn t know about the postfix recipient_delimiter it has to assume that a user query for doe-test example.com really does mean â œlook for user â doe-testâ on domain â example.comâ â

395383
postfix	dovecot
this solution to this is fortunately trivial simply tell dovecot what you told postfix

395383
postfix	dovecot
if postfix s lmtp is used for delivery a connection to the actual lmtp daemon dovecot will be established and the message with the finaly delivery address will be passed on using the lmtp protocol

395404
debian	linux
forgive my ignorance i ve used a dozen distros of linux debian and fedora derivatives but haven t yet wet my feet with bsd

395404
debian	mint
i m attempting to write the current trueos installer to a usb through the debian derivative mint v

395411

leaves the mktemp files for the system to clean up since by default they re created in the system temp directory - normally or tmp

395416
versioning	upgrade
during the upgrade i was asked a few times if i wanted to keep my local versioning of config files or use the package maintainer s

395439
ubuntu	debian
for your particular version of debian ubuntu add the respective line to your sources.list file

395439
ubuntu	debian
release name would be the codename for your release of debian ubuntu

395444
folder	directory
the gnome music app says it searches my music folder it says this in the message you see when the directory is empty

395446
ssl	https
it provides the digital certificates a website needs to enable https ssl tls for a more secure and privacy-respecting web

395460
ubuntu	debian
in 2015 the debian ubuntu people made the d-bus file in var default to being a symbolic link to etc machine-id in any case

395460
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
although vanilla freebsd trueos netbsd and openbsd do not provide a etc machine-id the nosh toolset provides portable tools that are also usable on linux for creating it that also know of the bsd-specific places that the bsds expect such ids and keep the twain consistent

395481
udp	tcp
been trimming down with a static ip disabling services from systemctl and i got my udp and tcp ports narrowed down

395496
fflush	gets	stdout	fflush
if you are looking for messages on stdout which by default is the journal for systemd units then you may have to wait a long time for sufficient data to be printed before it gets fflush out

395499
stdout	stderr
alternatively for stdin stdout and stderr you can use unbuffered mode using -u option for python described in the man page

395531
debian	linux
my problem is similar to this previous stackexchange question i connected my android phone to my linux computer running the latest version of debian with a usb cable which automatically initiated an mtp connection and tried copying some files to an sd card

395553
icmp	tcp
i want to scan their local network s for alive hosts too and i would do this with nmap both relying on replies to icmp and tcp syn packets

395555
vmware	virtualbox
i tried virtualbox and vmware

395561
ubuntu	debian
your system is thoroughly messed up youâ ve somehow got a mixture of ubuntu xenial and debian testing or unstable even

395572
dropbox	icloud
whenever i have heavy uploads dropbox hubic googledrive icloud smtp sftp etc. the downloads are just about non-existent

395618
folder	directory
i wish to download all the url files into their respective folder directory

395637
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade my ssh versioning to the current versioning openssh-7.5p1 if i am not mistaken without destroying my os

395659
versioning	upgrade
however i suggest you upgrade from 14.4 to the latest versioning of kubuntu not the best idea to use end of life os s

395662
daemons	systemd
su is commonly used by the root user on some unix systemd to start daemons service processes that need to run under particular user identities to protect them from accessing areas that they shouldn t have access to typically web servers ssh server and the like

395662
sudo	passwd
the sudo utility requires a bit more configuration as it allows a user to execute commands as another user by using their own passwd which means that a root passwd for example does not need to be shared and it also allows for fine grained control of who is allowed to do exactly what

395664
stdout	stderr
i would like to have the data sent through netcat but having the output messages both stderr and stdin sent to stdout or a file to parse it afterwards

395665
stdout	stderr
thankfully dd does not write that status message to its stdout otherwise it would be sent to which we don t want but it writes it on a separated stream stderr as it s a diagnostic message not part of its normal output

395665
stdout	stderr
assuming the shell s stdin stdout stderr go to i o e all would be the tty device open in read+write mode if run from a terminal in the above we would have

395665
stdout	stderr
or to have the stderr of dd and the stdout+stderr of nc go to grep but the stdout of dd still go to nc

395666
folder	directory
i backup some photo directory on my phone into a folder on a linux machine like this

395677
kde	gnome
the only similar question i found was this but it s kde related and i m using gnome

395686
bash	zsh
that also comes from ksh and is also supported by bash and zsh

395694
rpm	yum
does this mean that microsoft has specifically modified this rpm in their own way and because of this yum doesn t know how to handle it

395703
apache	nginx
not apache nginx but rather iptabes

395771
tunnel	vpn
i want to tunnel an ip port accessible from this vpn to another remote machine like this

395776
debian	linux
i have a linux debian based server which is configured to allow ssh session to the user admin but not the user root

395776
sudo	passwd
currently the server still asks for passwd when a command has uses sudo

395776
sudo	passwd
is it even possible to avoid having to type the passwd using sudo

395778
folder	directory
in a directory withmultiple subdirectories but only one folder deep containing tiff-files i d like to generate a md5 checksum that writes the filename with the corresponding checksum into a textfile

395780
sudo	passwd
the most simple way is to provide passwd from stdin if your sudo supports that -s key

395781
sudo	passwd
you can tell sudo to skip passwd for some command

395781
sudoers	visudo
be sure to edit etc sudoers using visudo command

395850
ubuntu	centos
same time i use this script with my local centos and ubuntu vms and script work fine so script commands 100 ok too

395869

395895
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	minix	freebsd	netbsd	netbsd	minix	solaris	minix	solaris	netbsd
note that this will likely only work with the gnu implementation of ls i know for a fact it doesn t work with the busybox freebsd netbsd or minix implementations and i m pretty sure it doesn t work with the solaris one either

395931
mouse	keyboard
i have two computers running linux i need to use the mouse and keyboard but just the mouse and keyboard with the x session from the other computer

395937
octal	binary
on a related note converting the 3-nucleotide tokens to 2-byte octal or binary from there would reduce the size of the data stream by 2 3 or 1 3

395966
bash	zsh
if not using rename here is how you can do with shell bash ksh ksh93 mksh zsh pattern substitution expansion

395976
rpm	yum	rpm	zypper	zypper	yum
i would hazard to guess that the repository mappings are handled by zypper just as yum does rather than by rpm

395976
rpm	yum	rpm	zypper	zypper	yum
although the metadata is part of the rpm package it s either being used by yum zypper independently or if the rpm tool does have that ability built-in the database info is not shared between yum -- rpm and or zypper -- rpm

note that both these options donâ t just repair broken packages they upgrade the system to the latest versioning of the packages available in whatever release is installed

396042
debian	linux
i m using a debian based linux system basically there are these interfaces

396043

jobs	cron
if you look in the directory usr lib cron there is a subdirectory there called jobs which i can only assume is the same as etc cron.d

396073
put	get	post	put	post	get
if the request is wrong jira sends a somewhat misleading allow head post get options even if the rest method supports put

396081
folder	directory
i needed a solution like giles from 2010 except i needed to preserve the folder structure not unzip everything into the top level directory

396100
logmein	hamachi
i have a server running on site with clients and i ve used logmein hamachi and autossh as a backup for probably 2 years now

396113
stdout	stderr
usr bin python and disable buffering for stderr and stdout but i kind of liked the idea of letting stdbuf take care of it

396123
mp3	ogg
i want to record the pcm sound output from a terminal and besides compress at the same time to mp3 or ogg instead of dumping a wave file

396131
switching	screens
both programs are primarily designed for quickly switching between multiple shells started from a single remote session in essence they replicate virtual terminal functionality but with different key bindings but they have another rather useful feature you can disconnect from a screens or tmux instance keep it running and reconnect later

396179
pulseaudio	mixer
right now i have pulseaudio uninstalled i purged it in an effort to get the alsa to load when i open the alsa mixer it is just a master channel that i can adjust pcm - it is detecting my cound card as

396180
bash	zsh
in this case you could check to custom bash and zsh including the same file

396181
x86	64bit
i m currently trying to setup an x86 64bit system to use a squashfs as its root mountpoint but i m being met with many issues

folder	directory
every folder here got about 1000 items and i wish to move the last 100 items to another directory by creating the same folder name and store it

396250
bash	subshell	subshell	dash
when i replace the command substition with a subshell then it seems to work in dash and bash

396260
sysv	systemd
i see an increased boot time of about 2 seconds with systemd when compared to sysv

396287
jobs	cron
as was answered in a comment the problem appears to be that your a1.php and b2.php scripts are not in your home directory which is where cron jobs will execute

396308
spaces	delimiter
if the text contains the text total set total to the second spaces delimiter field otherwise set the file name to the first delimiter piece

396314
ubuntu	opensuse
i have tried this in ubuntu fedora and opensuse all with the same results

396324
bash	subshell
bash run cmd2 in a subshell so changing variable won t be visible to parent shell

396342
bash	zsh
in bash and bourne-like shells in general zsh being the exception globs like that match no file expand to themselves your script uses ksh93 syntax also recognised by bash and zsh though in zsh you d get fatal errors by default for non-matching globs

396342
bash	zsh
here instead of use zsh or ksh93 or if using bash set the nullglob option with shopt -s nullglob so that the globs that don t match expand do nothing

396368
post	get
otherwise if i use the export display ccommand first i get the errors from the original post

396416
switching	screens
after i turn on the tv set which is connected via hdmi with my pc the pc screens becomes black and remains so till i switching the pc off because nothing else helps turning off the tv set pulling the hdmi cable

396418
put	get
i m writing a bourne shell script that get a user list from server by who command then put it into a file then it will check the name by read line and if the script found a duplicate name it will print out a warning msg with the username otherwise it will print out that no duplication found

396423
filesystems	hfs+
i m trying to recover my data files from a external 3.0usb 1tb hard disk hfs+ filesystems can be identified with the black color then i have another with the same characteristic to copy my recovered files with the gray color

396423

on ubuntu i can t write using hfs+ then i formatted the hdd destiny gray like ext4 filesystems

396423
filesystems	hfs+
i can t see my files on macos sierra my hard disk have hfs+ filesystems originally used by macos

396423
ubuntu	linux
now i m using ddrescue on linux ubuntu 17.04

396423
filesystems	hfs+
can i to do this process on macos sierra side with its ssd hdd - only i have 15gb free space using the two 3.0usb ports to connect the source black and destiny gray using hfs+ filesystems hdd s to improve the speed

396429
folder	directory
next change directory then you run testdisk you will have to place it somewhere assuming it is on your desktop in folder testdisk desktop testdisk testdisk make sure you select the correct source and target drives and let it run over the night

396444
kate	kde	kate	gedit
my office computer runs debian with kde and from what i have seen all gtk applications gedit firefox and only them not kate have emacs-like keybindings

396472
filesystems	fat
on the other hand if you need to store somthing else than just the boot sector on the floppy image you will have to create a fat filesystems on it

396476
spaces	delimiter
an alternative awk solution to roman s where we take each spaces delimiter piece of data in turn and then further split the data using the split function in the array arr based on the character we then build an array keyed on the abc etc string with the string of numbers to be printed

396490
ubuntu	mint
i am in the process of changing from a gui mint system to a headless ubuntu server system but i ve been unable to adjust the gpu fan speeds thus far

396493
filesystems	ntfs
more details filesystems ntfs mixed projects including php html javascript web and mobile apps using cordova but i don t think how could programming languages affect this

396496
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
i finally understood that the daemons is launchd via systemd

396500
sudo	passwd
it is also important that the script doesn t just run in the background but that i can interact with it - since unloading the modules and turning on off the gpu requires sudo so i will need to interact with a shell to put in my passwd

396501
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is not a primary filesystems for linux in general and it s supported via reverse-engineering in general

396504
xfce	gnome
they re for gnome and not for xfce but hope it s a beginning

396519
sudo	passwd
two issues with it it asks for my sudo passwd i d like it to run unattended and it uses the device name which could change instead of the mount point which i m trying to make static

396568
put	get
you would get a more manageable operation if you put the dump command into its own script and scheduled that

396611
bash	zsh
bash ksh and zsh

396638
daemons	systemd
as pointed out by don_crissti some units can be active even though nothing is running to provide the service units marked as â œremainafterexitâ are considered active if they exit successfully the idea being that they provide a service which doesnâ t need a daemons they configure some aspect of the systemd

396644
filesystems	btrfs
in some cases you can convert a filesystems there is a tool to convert etx4 to btrfs

396659
mouse	keyboard
and similarly vanilla stuff for card0 and monitor0 and keyboard mouse etc

396676
ubuntu	debian
i would say there is no debian equivalent to ubuntu s deadsnakes ppa

396676
ubuntu	debian
under debian using ubuntu packages or repositories is not recommended

396681
bash	zsh
if you don t have bash other shells that support that include ksh93 mksh yash and zsh

396687
unix	bsd
sips is a command-line tool to process images on mac os x and bsd unix

396687
tiff	png
however the image-uploading mechanism at stackexchange automatically converts tiff into png

396687
tiff	png
the following sips command takes a png and outputs an lzw-compressed tiff

396699
folder	directory
it is a file because the time difference between each city in portugal is not that much compared to cities in bigger countries like the u.s and or canada which would have subzones in the folder but portugal has no subzones therefore it is only a file and not a directory

396706
arp	icmp
i ended up changing the whole arp thing to use icmp instead since apparently the who has 0.0.0.0

396706
packets	multicast
my program now sends an icmp echo request ping packets with ip destination 224.0.0.1 layer 3 multicast to all hosts but it sets the destination mac layer 2 to the specific ones i m monitoring

396724
for-loop	loops
for-loop in which loops should be continuously executed with as many number of lines the file.txt has

396739
ubuntu	debian
mariadb on debian ubuntu by default authenticates via unix sockets and it checks the effective unix user id of the user calling mysql

396741
apache	nginx
an attacker can upload modify any file owned by the apache nginx user

396746
width	height
my framebuffer is set to 1280x1024 which i think is the correct resolution for my monitor but when running my kiosk kweb browser in x windows or anything else started with xinit i only use up about 2 3 of the screen for both height and width

396760
vmware	virtualbox
i want to clone the hard drive into an .iso image so that i can use it in vmware or virtualbox on a brand new machine

396762
ethernet	wireless
now plug the ethernet cord into the wan port of your wireless router and you have wireless across the house

sudo	passwd
to add to archemar s answer sudo asks for the passwd of the user running sudo not the user the command will be run as

396787
sudo	passwd
if you have come to this conclusion based on sudo accepting the passwd for the admin account and the passwd sudo accepts changing when the passwd for admin is changed this is normal behaviour for sudo

396836
debian	centos
are selinux firewalld and iptables preinstalled on debian - stretch 9 or 9.2 and centos 7.4-1708 or do i have to manually install them

sudoers	passwd
and i was told that if my username is part of sudoers group then i will not get passwd prompt

396869
sudo	passwd
the question might be why sudo does not ask for a passwd the invoking user s or root s

396869
sudo	passwd
or sudo has been invoked before and considers the formerly entered passwd still valid

396877
sudo	passwd
also you ll be prompted for the passwd of the user running the sudo command not the passwd of the account that you re trying to login to

apparently varnishd -v writes to stderr not stdout

397022

to get nohup to shutup stdin stdout and stderr all need to be explicitly directed from to somewhere

397065

if you re in a hurry something like strace or sysdig systemtap etc could be used to record the communication though strace will slow a process down a lot and the output will require post-processing

it should enter the if loop only if int are present after the underscore and not any other chars

397712
bash	zsh
bash zsh and ksh93 have a operator inside their construct though the syntax and the behaviour wrt quoting varies between implementations

397712
bash	zsh
zsh -o extendedglob and ksh or bash -o extglob or zsh -o kshglob that support a subset of ksh globs have glob operators that are functionally equivalent to regexps albeit with a different syntax

397888
bash	zsh
and the first one matches .inputrc in bash -o extglob but not in ksh where that syntax comes from nor zsh in ksh emulation as those are hidden files and dot files are not explicitly requested

397915
bash	zsh
zsh and bash are interpreters for two different languages you can t expect zsh to be able to interpret any code written for bash however you may be able to do

397915
bash	zsh
for zsh to enter a bash emulation mode for running that source command

397915
bash	zsh
that emulate will reduce but not eliminate the differences between zsh and bash

397915
bash	zsh
in any case the format for the prompt variable is completely different in bash and zsh so i don t expect a script written exclusively for bash would manage to define a prompt that also works for zsh

397952
bash	zsh
theyâ re not used together .bashrc is read by bash .zshrc by zsh so which one is used depends on which shell youâ re using

397955
bash	zsh
so if the user default is bash then bashrc is run but if you then start zsh then zshrc is run

398318
filesystems	btrfs	umount	btrfs
as with other linux filesystems ext3 ext4 etc the correct procedure for checking a btrfs root filesystems is to boot the system from a livecd or a rescue usb cd usb and check the target filesystems while it is umount using utilities provided by the livecd

with posix shells like bash - and also with others like fish - you can use command substitution using find 1 or even some ls piped into some grep like which is a bit useless and won t work in some cases like filenames with spaces or newlines since same as

398467
disk	ram
there are a couple of reasons 1 the os has to allocate memory for various data structures it does that by using ram not a ram disk

398467
disk	ram
2 access to a ram disk goes through at least the block layer of the os which - see point 1 - has to have its data structures allocated in ram which makes ram disk access slower than ram access

398467
disk	ram
the os could bootstrap itself as it does today until a ram disk is set up and then migrate all allocations to the ram disk but there is not much point in that it complicates the os and it makes things slower

398472
centos	linux
modern linux distributions like centos fedora set up a crash handling daemon systemd-coredump or abortd by default

398474
daemons	systemd
it tries very hard to output the message to a terminal and only if that fails does it log to the systemd log â so in practice youâ ll see buffer overflow messages in the logs for daemons and perhaps gui applications

filesystems	fat
you could alternatively mount a fat fs but not exfat which is not supported by a kernel module in the way the various older fat filesystems are with

margin	height
some references state that height can be used to set the line height but i could never get that to work for the folder view while setting a margin did

398739
fontconfig	freetype
xft is a library which depends on among other things the fontconfig library and the freetype library

398739
fontconfig	freetype
you can see that xft uses fontconfig for locating fonts based on patterns but uses freetype to actually load display or adjust scale etc a font

398739
fontconfig	freetype
fontconfig uses different calls to freetype to obtain information about a font the overall size the number of glyphs etc

398739
fontconfig	freetype
without freetype fontconfig hasn t any information fontconfig organizes information but is not a complete source of information by itself

399059
put	get
another way is using only printf command and generate the character padding pattern first by shell brace expansion you can put end with a number â formatting area you want to print in and get only every first character of it .1s which is s and then print only first 20 characters length area of that .20s

400041

this clones stdout to stderr and then redirects stdout to dev null leaving stderr to write through the pipe

technically that would exclude files created at the 2016-01-01 00 00 00.000000000 nanosecond and include the ones created at that nanosecond in 2017 i don t expect your clock would have that precision or that it matters anyway but it could matter on file systems that don t support subsecond timestamps for files created by cron jobs at 00 00 00 for instance

assuming you re still certain that you want to put some of your data on the slower device even if there is space on the faster one you can also achieve this with priorities by setting all the regions to the same priority higher than -1 but you will unfortunately need multiple files to do so in theory you could get really creative with loop devices or device-mapper targets but that really is more trouble than it s worth

i want to print the value of dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr

400852
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr are outputs you do not read from them you can only write to them

400864
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are streams attached to file descriptors 0 1 and 2 respectively of a process

400864
stdout	stderr
on linux dev stdin dev stdout dev stderr are symbolic links to proc self fd 0 proc self fd 1 proc self fd 2 respectively themselves special symlinks to the actual file that is open on those file descriptors

400864
stdout	stderr
they are not stdin stdout stderr they are special files that identify what files stdin stdout stderr go to note that it s different in other systems than linux that have those special files

400864
stdout	stderr
except in the special case of terminal devices open in read+write mode stdout and stderr are usually not open for reading

400864
stdout	stderr
on linux opening dev stdout or dev stderr for reading as in would work and would let you read from the file where stdout goes to and if stdout was a pipe that would read from the other end of the pipe and if it was a socket it would fail as you can t open a socket

400864
stdout	stderr
in our case of the script run without redirection at the prompt of an interactive shell in a terminal all of dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr will be that dev pts x terminal device file

400864
stdout	stderr
if as opposed to reading from dev stdin dev stdout dev stderr you wanted to read from stdin stdout and stderr which would make even less sense you d do

400864
stdout	stderr
for stdout and stderr cat fails because the file descriptors were open for writing only not reading the the expansion of and is empty

401568
bash	zsh
is the ksh93 syntax though strictly speaking rc with an otherwise non-bourne syntax supported it before that also recognised by bash 2.0 and above zsh yash and mksh based on pdksh but with some major differences between implementations

401568

daemons	launchd
the problem i m facing is that the daemons is killed 1m30s after beeing launchd because the forking is not detected

let s assume your data is spaces delimiter as you ve shown

401681
sudoers	passwd
this however is a non-working sudoers file on linux mint 18 in a sense it still asks me for passwd

401681
debian	mint
i guess there is some difference between debian and mint which makes the added lines non-working

401688

one solution on linux mint 18.2 which is based on ubuntu 16.04 is creating a separate sudoers file using visudo for example

401754
debian	linux
it works in debian linux

401762
for-loop	loops
but having been using c-style for-loop in case some of the users here don t know it is the type used in bash and ksh i recalled that while and for loops in c-like languages are interchangeable and can emulate one another

401767
ubuntu	linux
that s true in arch linux but in ubuntu the base path is set in etc environment

401791
gentoo	linux
i m using gentoo linux on my dell latitude e6530 laptop

401811
vim	emacs
it looks like vim and emacs caught a cve because the editors created temp files in the wrong place with too many file permissions

401819
pop-up	dialog
i pulled down folder and clicked subscriptions and got an empty folder subscriptions dialog box with a pop-up over it stating no public folders found. which makes sense

401824
umask	mount
fwiw my umask is 002 the filesystem is nfs and the options according to mount are

sudo	chgrp
for example if i repeat the same sequence above but i run the chgrp command under sudo then the setgid bit remains set at the end

401829

401838
ubuntu	linux
i just installed ubuntu 16.04 as i need a linux system for university studies

401855
debian	linux
i have always found the arch linux wiki a good place for guiding you through setting up vnc - although this guide uses tigervnc this available as a debian package you can use x11vnc or tightvnc instead of tigervnc

401869
jobs	cron
if your sysadmin is concerned about unauthorized people scheduling cron jobs point him her to etc cron.allow and etc cron.deny

i have had ubuntu 16.04 and windows dual booted on my laptop for the past 6 months and when i updated windows yesterday my boot option for the windows linux partition is no longer there but when i look at the allocated disk space in windows everything is still there

401956
versioning	upgrade
i m using usr bin bash on os x v10.11.6 el capitan. the command i m trying to troubleshoot is where brew is the homebrew package manager and the versioning of mailutils i m trying to build from source and to which i m trying to upgrade is v3.3 i currently have v3.2 but i deeply suspect that switching it out with an entirely different command that also produces block-buffered output when used as part of a pipeline which if i understand correctly would be any shell command as i ve seen it mentioned that setting up a pipeline may incur block buffering in and of itself would not solve my problem here

i know that on a terminal stderr usually goes to the same place as stdout

401983
stdout	stderr
i try to redirect stderr to stdout like

402003
mouse	keyboard
i read that you need to bind input devices to the serverlayout and in my case that would mean i need to have two serverlayouts setup like here how to lock one mouse keyboard pair to each screen

402005
jobs	cron
thus even if no users have user-specific crontabs there are still a number of places cron jobs can be specified on debian derivatives

402005
jobs	cron
anything in etc cron.d will be interpreted directly by cron but the contents of etc cron.monthly weekly daily and hourly are run by the corresponding instruction in etc crontab or by anacron if thatâ s installed for daily weekly and monthly jobs

402005
jobs	cron
the reflects the various roles of cron jobs

402005
jobs	cron
etc cron.d allows packages to drop cron jobs with cron specifiers and have them run

402007
width	height
most of the time when a new evince window is opened it has a convenient width 3 4 of the screen width or so but it s way too high like 120 or so of the screen height such that the bottom of the window is way off-screen

402014
for-loop	loops
my question is how we can write this script using a while loops instead of a for-loop

402018
rss	feed
create a file somewhere on your web root which contains a valid rss feed

402022
for-loop	loops
this would be one example of a while loops doing the same thing as your for-loop

402028
debian	linux
i use current debian linux 9 stretch with all software from the distribution s packages

402029
stdout	stderr
i m trying to append the output of a command stdout and stderr to an existing file

402030
debian	linux
on my gnu linux debian 9 i would like to run

402041
stdout	stderr
what you want to do is set up file descriptor 1 stdout to append to a file then redirect fd 2 stderr to simply do what fd 1 is doing

402044
for-loop	loops
the while loops above is just as reliable as the for-loop it will work with any file names and while the latter is - in many instances - the most appropriate tool to use the former is a valid alternative 1 that has its uses the above could process three files at a time or process only a certain number of arguments etc

402046
spaces	delimiter
then you have to consider that cut is just looking for spaces as delimiter and doesn t know how to ignore spaces inside of quotes so do it this way

402050
stdout	stderr
which you do with your that redirects the stdout and stderr of the subshell time is run in but a much simpler way to do it would be

402050
stdout	stderr
if you wanted only the timing output in and not the command s stdout or stderr you d do

402070
wav	flac
is it possible to retroactively add this data without decoding to wav and re-encoding the data the data is too large for a wav file and flac will gladly decode to wav but then throw an error and refuse to re-encode to flac afterwards

402070
wav	flac
for the curious this is what happens when i decode and re-encode a 7 day audio recording from flac to wav and back

402072
sudo	passwd
type sudo chmod 1777 tmp and the passwd for sudo

402109
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
with csh tcsh zsh or bash 4.0 or above you can also write it

402129
dpkg	apt
dpkg --configure -a apt update

post	get
in the post the talk about doing the following to get the values needed for the calculation

402277
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
other filesystems fat ntfs may not implement this concept or may have other ideas what constitutes a user

402277
chown	chgrp
you can apply chown and or chgrp to it but in many cases this may not be a good idea in particular for a filesystem that contains your linux system files and programs

402296
ubuntu	linux
can anybody please point me to a good pdf2doc package that supports linux or even better specifically ubuntu and free and downoadable

402301
rpm	yum
i ve python 2.7.5 installed in centos and wondering why i can find this using rpm -qa but not yum list installed command

402310
rpm	yum
when you grep from yum list installed you will not get the same format as you would with rpm -qa

402314
stdout	stderr
the -s option silently discards all output to stdout and stderr and just returns the exit status

402318
bash	zsh
but i don t find that particularly more intuitive nor useful see kevin s example in comments for instance there would still be some ambiguity as to the order in which the expansions would be done and that s not how csh the shell that introduced brace expansion in the late 70s while the form came later 1995 from zsh and yet later 2004 from bash did it

402434
folder	directory
i wanted to enable transmission to download torrents to a folder on it but discovered it was unable to create directory due to permission errors

402434
folder	directory
i tested it myself and verified that the daemon running as user transmission can t create directory in a folder it owns with 755 permissions

402456
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse issues have also developed

402474
ubuntu	centos
a good explanation on the meaning of this option and on how to change the grub boot command line with some small adjustments on centos can be found on this ubuntu forum discussion

402479
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
however debian s xterm and zsh as well as ubuntu s linux console disagree

402479
octal	decimal
executed in a console like xterm should be printing test with the default background color 033 is escape and make a csi control sequence introducer and 061 is octal which is 49 decimal but it actually prints test in bold and the 061 at the end seems to mean not bold anymore but is documented neither on wikipedia nor in the xterm color code documentation

402488
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to pair two bluetooth devices a mouse and a keyboard on fedora 26

402526
jobs	cron
you probably want to rely on the posix standard here since at some point in time you will probably care about not just user login managed by the login program but also cron jobs and the like

402526
jobs	cron
at least on my system ubuntu 14.04 the user environment variable is not set for cron jobs

402526
jobs	cron
instead you can use logname which is part of the environment for cron jobs

402531
filesystems	ntfs
i want to setup debian system with zfs as primary filesystems and some as secondary ntfs ext2 4

402536
chown	chmod
unless tells you that it is a shell built-in install shouldn t be some sort of wrapper to cp + chown + chmod

402536
chown	chmod
i m not sure that this can easily be achieved with cp + chown + chmod as this doesn t seem to be mentioned on any of their man pages

402538
folder	directory
i want to create a directory for example a and move mv some of these files which all start with a numeric timestamp into folder a until folder a is of up to a specified size

402552
chown	sudo
i get access denied and sudo chown does not change permissions

402575
ubuntu	mint
i have tried them on my hp pavilion laptop i use mint on my laptop s windows partition where they are recognised but as blank which they definitely are not on another two older hp laptops on an older acer laptop and on a hp desktop i have at work all these other 2 laptops + the desktop use ubuntu

ethernet	wireless
my mac doesn t have an ethernet cable and in confused how i can get my macbook to recognize my wireless card so i can use a wireless connection

402630
ubuntu	debian
you can easily create a live persistent debian usb through the mkusb ubuntu tool how to install mkusb in debian there is no dependencies problem

402657
folder	directory
this time likely varies with the amount of files and folder in a directory

402684
postfix	dovecot
the email msgs featuring the utf-8 subject line are now being processed by postfix and saved by dovecot without any problems

402690
stdout	stderr
the file information is written to stderr the real data is written to stdout as both should be

402701
lvm	umount
i needed to extend var lvm partition but i was not able to do this on debian 9 because there was no free space and i could not umount home to release free space in order to extend var

402705
debian	linux
the simplest option but the one which involves waiting the longest is to file a bug against the debian linux kernel package asking for those options to be enabled

402719
gentoo	ubuntu
which command will output current toggled layout for fedora which one for ubuntu kde neon arch gentoo etc

402740
redhat	fedora
that means that it is available on redhat centos and fedora

402745
daemon	cron
it aims to replace vixie-cron and anacron with a single integrated program providing many features missing from the original cron daemon

402745
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
the cron daemon runs every minute and checks all active cron jobs to see if any of the jobs have patterns which match the current time

402745
jobs	cron
there are several different ways to deploy cron jobs

402745
jobs	cron
there is a main crontab file and several subdirectories of etc which are intended for system cron jobs

402746
post	get
so then i looked at this stackexchange post and modified my command to this but i get a different problem this time with the ciphers

402748
switching	screens
i would like to block vt switching only when a screens locker slock is enabled

402751
bash	subshell
bash script while-loop subshell dilemma

402755
folder	directory
now i see only one possible solution of this task - write some script that will monitor any changes of the entire filesystem and copy all these new files folder to the tmp fakeroot directory

402766
mouse	keyboard
manually switching the three monitors and having a second keyboard and mouse

402770
daemons	systemd
i have some commands or processes that need to be turned into daemons in my systemd

402771
ubuntu	debian
and something else that ubuntu or debian has changed

402829
ubuntu	debian
i m running recent ubuntu which derives from debian + here s what i see.

402830
debian	linux
i currently have the problem that when starting my debian linux i get an oh no

402838
filesystems	ntfs
+150 something mb ntfs filesystems presumably the windows boot partition that destroyed the previous partition

402842
inherited	properties
system calls changing some changeable and inheritable properties of processes should be shell builtins like cd for chdir 2 ulimit for setrlimit 2 etc... because you might want to change the properties in the shell process itself and inherited by future command processes started by the shell

402842
fish	zsh
there are many of them zsh fish scsh es etc .... .

402856
fish	bash
i ve tried them successfully under bash and fish but expect them to work on all shells

402867
waitpid	pclose
in some it s the status straight as returned by waitpid or pclose in others it s that one divided by 256 even when foo is killed by a signal .

402881
folder	directory
recently i was learning ssh based authentication to connect to a web server.the post recommended certain file permissions.the .ssh folder of the local computer must have directory permission of 700 and the contents inside it for example the keys must have file permission of 640

402926
jobs	cron
do i think need to restart cron for my cron jobs to see these changes

402937
folder	directory
how it works is it first excludes anything in the node_modules folder then includes all directory and then includes only yaml files and then excludes everything else

402950
stdout	stderr
since this is tagged with bash you can use to redirect appending both stdout and stderr

402955
single-quotes	double-quotes
it looks like you re using single-quotes instead of double-quotes which suppresses parameter substitution in the string

402955
single-quotes	double-quotes
just use double-quotes instead of single-quotes and use backslashes to escape any double-quotes that you want included in the string

402964
xfce	kde
works fine when i use it at my laptop s native res 1920x1080 and briefly worked well on kde but not with kde+i3 xfce xfce+i3 or just i3 and no desktop environment

403025
freebsd	linux
during the porting of an application form linux to freebsd i came up with the following problem

403045
stdout	stderr
docker journald driver captures the stdout and stderr of the container process

403053
post	get
combining this with the grep command in your post we get the following

403112
debian	linux
if it s of any relevance i m using debian 9 linux 4.9.0-4

403152
filesystems	ntfs
as others have suggested it seems that the reason your file permission changes are not persisting may be because of compatibility issues between linux and the ntfs filesystems which is designed for use with windows

403152
chown	chmod
is ntfs under linux able to save a linux file with its chown and chmod settings

403159
mouse	trackpad
the most promising would be to use the touch screen like a trackpad relative mouse movement and clicking by tapping so i can use the mouse pointer in the traditional way with any application

403166
centos	linux
i have a linux system and i wish to install centos 7 alongside it

403166
centos	linux
can i install centos without the installation system or start the installation system from a different linux

403176
cifs	smb
this controls the smb cifs protocol version. see the man page for debian stretch

403177
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu if i do apt search i get a useful output of packages that match my search with results that look like this

403181
versioning	upgrade
i ve got a temporary situation where i m working with pre-release f27 and need to keep one package to a specific working versioning and not be upgrade until the subsequent versioning stop breaking something

403201
centos	linux
i m running gnome desktop on centos linux 7 all current

403214
rpm	dnf
you should be able to use dnf swap zfs-fuse zfs to replace the fedora rpm with your alternate one

403234
ubuntu	linux
first you fill with random data the example code works on ubuntu or other linux variants where administrative commands are to be run with sudo

403257
debian	linux
the latest version of kali linux is based on debian testing

403257
debian	linux
go the the debian -- package search results -- apt webpage and manually download the apt package that matches the architecture of your kali linux amd64

403278
debian	linux
i often run bash scripts in debian and in general in linux

403288
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd root - assign a passwd to root user

403341
jobs	cron
date is probably bin date and is in the default for cron jobs which is not the same as the set on user login

403380
installation	upgrade
in your package manager set a hook to replace the files after installation upgrade of the package which provides these files

403396
ubuntu	linux
so i am a linux newbie and i have my freshly installed ubuntu 17.10 with its standard unity desktop

403399
switching	screens
after using screens since the late 80 s switching to tmux seems like hard work though i ve been planning on doing just that for at least the last two years now -

403451
cpu	processors
the processors was at less than 10 before swapoff and when i checked in swapoff was using 70 + cpu

403464
debian	linux
linux vig-debian 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt25-2 2016-04-08

403485
folder	directory
3- with the current directory being the apache folder with the .deb call

403503
sudoers	passwd
this still isn t scriptable in its current form since it requires user interaction - specifically to set the passwd and edit the sudoers file

403508
ubuntu	debian
when i install debian packages on ubuntu systems i download only the one .deb file i require rather than setting up a debian repository as sometimes setting up debian repositories causes problems with co-mingled ubuntu + debian packages

403529
tunnel	vpn
the router has a static route added so the 192.168.0.0 clients can communicate with 10.125.141.0 address range via the vpn tunnel

403532
children	parent
if your big parent process creates all the children around the same time

403545
chmod	mkdir
chmod install and mkdir now preserve a directory s set-user-id and

403545
chmod	mkdir
for example openbsd 3.9 mkdir -m 777 d preserves d s setgid bit but chmod 777 d clears it

403565
ubuntu	centos
and it works on ubuntu and centos but doesn t work on suse

403590
versioning	upgrade
i ve updated my repositories on synabtics the upgrade firefox to newer versioning when i open it it crashes while this i was having my hard drive plugged

403591
filesystems	ntfs
i don t have a good understanding of what the fs mount options are or what they do and there is no entry under mount s man page for fs options like there are for ntfs and other filesystems

403598
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
so on debian ubuntu fedora centos and most other gnu linux systems you could use this command if it had a brew command 6 or replacing it with whatever command you want to run and log transformed output

403598
ubuntu	freebsd
i carried out the test the same way on freebsd as on ubuntu except that i used these commands to produce dirty.log

403598
ubuntu	freebsd
comparing the freebsd results with the ubuntu results the difference was the absence of any timestamps due to -q

403598
ubuntu	freebsd
i carried out the test the same way on my old tiger system as on ubuntu and freebsd except that i used these commands to produce dirty.log

403598
ubuntu	freebsd
besides that the results were the same as on ubuntu and freebsd except that the escape sequences to switch to and from cyan text were not fully removed with the system-provided perl

403598
ubuntu	freebsd
with each of the perlbrew -installed perls all escape sequences were fully and correctly removed and that line in clean.log looked like this just as it did with all perl interpreters i ran on ubuntu and freebsd

403610
mouse	keyboard
also the screen brightens back up as soon as i touch the mouse or the keyboard

403621
bash	zsh
exit to drop me back into my login shell bash exit to log out then ssh machine to log back in then exec zsh and then the lines above were working

403656
filtering	grouping
i was thinking about scanning output of who -a to filtering the ip address and update the iptables using a cronjob or maybe update the security grouping of aws using api

403687
ubuntu	linux
see for general security info recommendations and best practices for hardening an arch linux system that apply to virtually all linux including ubuntu

403693
bash	subshell
i believe it achieves that goal because in a pipeline of two or more commands bash runs each command in a subshell

403739
ethernet	wireless
from the ubuntu wireless troubleshooting if i use lspci -v it finds the network controller device name is â œintel dual bandwireless-ac 3168 802.11 ac 1x1 wifi + bt 4.0 combo adapterâ but nmcli dev shows only the ethernet controller but nothing wi-fi related

403752
versioning	upgrade
1 upgrade your kernel versioning to a kernel versioning 4.6+

403769
mktime	strftime
pass the full date and time to awk with the -v flag and then use the awk mktime to get a number representation of the date time adding 60 and then strftime to convert the representation to the required format

403788
bash	subshell
bash does make the pid of cmd2 or more exactly of the subshell as it does run cmd2 in a child process of that subshell even though it s the last command there available in but doesn t let you wait for it

403788
bash	zsh
though bash and zsh make cmd1 s exit status available in and respectively see also the pipefail option in a few shells so can report the failure of pipe components other than the last

403789
chown	chmod
so for example you want to chmod mnt lala lala4000 ugo rx and chown foo.bar

403789
chown	chmod
this would recursively chown and chmod the dir

403800
filesystems	fat
then figure out some scheme that lets user of this group actually mount the filesystems on the usb stick no matter if it s fat or something else

403811
x86	64bit
are there any benefits or downsides of running lxc containers with x86 linux distros on a 64bit host given that the applications inside those containers don t require a lot of ram

403813
folder	directory
so that when you add a new user you will get the preset folder s in your home directory

403819
folder	directory
xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage well known user directory like the desktop folder and the music folder

403819
translation	localization
it also handles localization translation of the filenames

403838
bluetooth	usb
i want to understand exactly what happens when i plug in a usb device or connect it via bluetooth

403848
for-loop	arrays
xquery - how to increment a counter variable within a for-loop how to convert arrays of string values into node

403892
move	drag
right-click and drag to move the window

403938
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux server ubuntu 16.04 which i access through vsphere client

403947
folder	directory
within each those directory you should see an applications folder

403952
xfce	cinnamon
i ve tried several distros elementaryos manjaro linux mint with cinnamon and currently with xfce all of them properly installed and updated

403989
mouse	keyboard
if for nothing else it s worth it to be able to tap r-ctrl in fullscreen in order to have your mouse and keyboard un-grabbed

403991
move	drag
in gnome 3 super + drag allows you to move windows without having to click on the title bar or drag handles

403991
mouse	keyboard
however super + click is trapped early and isn t correctly passed to fullscreen windows that have grabbed the keyboard and mouse

404007
debian	linux
i just updated to debian linux 9 stretch and am in the process of setting everything up

404036
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade apache to a latest versioning at least 2.4.26

404036
versioning	upgrade
what can i do to upgrade to a latest versioning

404053
versioning	upgrade
the apache2 2.4.10-10 is the latest versioning installed from debian repository through apt command when a new versioning is available it will be upgrade automatically through apt

404065
daemons	launchd
note that while the process is putting itself into the group in practice this is often done by a launchd shell or daemons monitor before executing the program it is done by code in the launchd between fork and execve in the child process

404066
udp	tcp
returning at client-a question i tried to log every new connection from tcp and udp ports from client-a in server side

404078
next	except
the security team tries to support a stable distribution for about one year after the next stable distribution has been released except when another stable distribution is released within this year

404079
tunnel	vpn
is there any way to encrypt the smb traffic without ssh tunnel or vpn server

404081
organization	naming
it s probably just a naming convention used to mimic namespaces for the purposes of code organization

404089
post	get
error connecting to node tcp 172.17.0.3 46657 to get chain id post dial tcp 172.17.0.3 46657 getsockopt no route to host

404102
min	max
use the following to find out your supported boost max and min clock speeds

404117
versioning	upgrade
this minimizes disruptions from versioning upgrade but it makes versioning sniffing such as tenable does meaningless

404124
rpm	yum
here are the paths for my yum and rpm commands

404133
min	max
with the array i could do some further calculation to extract the max value min value or sum value of the array

404133
min	max
besides sum i would also like to identify the max and min value in the 4th column for each cross_beam_property - hence the need of an array

404144
bash	zsh
dash bash and zsh all skip over non-executable files in when executing a command

404150
ubuntu	linux
i have tried installing ubuntu 16 with minimal cd and i m getting the text based installation but the thing is i want to install ubuntu only with text-based installation and after that i want to use ubuntu only with text-based same as ubuntu linux which is available in aws - no gui

404156
debian	linux
linux xorg crashes intermittently on debian stretch with a swap partition - display goes all black or leaves the background image

404162
ubuntu	debian
by cli i mean to either the clui i run from my gui-including-distro like the debian desktop clui or my other no-gui distro like the debian server clui or ubuntu wsl

404173
fish	bash
i m not to concerned with the terminator problem and tmux opening a bash shell when opened from fish is a secondary issue

404191
gentoo	linux
not even on arch linux and gentoo s wiki

404227
versioning	upgrade
i read an article that said to run tar --strip-components 1 -xzf in usr local but if i do this i cant see an simple way to remove everything when i want to upgrade the versioning later

404239
chown	sudo
sudo chown opendkim opendkim var spool postfix var run opendkim

404251
packets	multicast
now this obviously gets impractical when having to do this for hundreds of multicast addresses especially when when some of them send tens of thousands of packets per second load is at 5000 quicker than i could hit ctrl-c

404253
kde	kubuntu
kubuntu has the kde plasma desktop environment

404256
udp	tcp
first think to check for is leakage - tcp + udp + upnp

404258
ubuntu	debian
my understanding is that ubuntu is based on debian

404258
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
for example on the wikipedia page for ubuntu it states it is a linux distribution based on the debian architecture

404258
ubuntu	debian
how can i find out what version of debian a particular version of ubuntu is based on if any

404258
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
for example the current stable release of ubuntu is artful aardvark 17.10 which announces that it is based on the linux 4.13 kernel but does not seem to say anything about the debian version

404260
centos	linux
i m quite new to linux setting up raid and was tasked with setting up raid1 on centos system

404261
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu releases arenâ t based on debian releases

404261
ubuntu	debian
during the development of an ubuntu release packages are imported from debian unstable until the debian import freeze in the past lts releases imported from testing and this is what the linked wiki page still suggests

404261
ubuntu	debian
this means that a given ubuntu release will have non-ubuntu-maintained packages in whatever version was in debian at the time of the import freeze barring explicit sync requests

404261
ubuntu	debian
so trying to tie a release of ubuntu to a release of debian would just end up being misleading

404261
ubuntu	debian
youâ ll see from this that the same debian release feeds multiple ubuntu releases stretch which ended up being debian 9 fed xenial yakkety zesty and artful with quite different package versions each time

404304
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu normally imports packages from debian unstable until the debian import freeze

404304
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
for example at the time of artful s debian import freeze debian sid had linux kernel 4.12 but ubuntu artful shipped with 4.13

404323
ubuntu	linux
i experimenting with linux namespaces on ubuntu 17.1 distro

404329
centos	linux
the setting a remote linux server with about 10 users running centos 6.5

404346
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i use ubuntu 16.04 since 4 months but before that i was using linux mint 18 and before i used to have linux mint 17.3 the problem happened on all 3 os

404376
bash	zsh
fixed by switching from bash to zsh -

404376
bash	zsh
bash and zsh are both shells for your terminals

404376
bash	zsh
bash and zsh are bot undeniably powerful shells with even more powerful scripting support

404446
sudoers	passwd
but such sudoers does not prevent from changing for example root s passwd by this user

404447
sudo	passwd
then i opened the terminal and ran the command sudo ntfs-config and entered the passwd and it again shows this error

404458
folder	directory
now if there is a folder of 10gb in the server and 4 users are working in the project then during checkout it will accumlate 40gb s of data which is unnecessary since the users are going to use only certain files in different directory

404471
debian	centos
in openvz s vps log will not written into var log syslog debian or var log messages centos

404473
ubuntu	linux
i am running a amazon linux ami release 2017.09 but i have also tried with a ubuntu instance and got similar messages

404475
for-loop	loops
i would say that even in c a for-loop by its structure hints a bit at a counting loops but of course it s not exactly clear-cut.

404494
bash	subshell
while it would be valid syntax for bash it would fail to set the variable outside of the subshell

404505
versioning	upgrade
although i would not recommend it instead if that is the case you should upgrade auditd to a newer versioning

404547
openbsd	linux
this is common on system where some shell masquerades as both bin sh a posix shell and as itself bash on linux or ksh on openbsd and that switches to posix sh mode when invoked as sh or you might have a compiler that compiles both c and c++ code and switches mode depending on whether it s invoked as cc or c++ etc

404555
stdout	stderr
say that i have opened some program from the terminal and i have redirected its stdin and stdout and stderr to three files

404558
children	parent
the main difference in this one from meuh s is that i ve asked ps to print the parent pids so that we can specifically ignore any children of the current script

404565
sudo	passwd
i like to work in public on my laptop but i also like to use sudo without a passwd

404565
sudo	passwd
however i would prefer using a flash drive and using it just for sudo because 1 it is faster 2 easier than entering my passwd and 3 i am not concerned with people accessing my content nor doing nefarious things the laptop would be in public around other people and the only intellectual property on my laptop is a very basic angular project

404569
switching	screens
however if i try to switching very fast to x when i see the blank screens the pc simply dies and stops responding to ping requests

404569
installation	upgrade
the problem does not occur if i choose the old kernel the one installed by yum upgrade immediately after system installation at boot time

404574
fish	zsh
further more if you want to launch a custom-shell do it through set-option -g default-command fish or zsh or csh or whatever

404577
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have tried on ubuntu 14.04 linux mint 17.3 and windows 8

404587
post	put
for further discussion regarding where to put executable files see the following post

404592
chown	sudo
since borgfs is read-only i can t change the ownership with sudo chown -r myuser borgfs-mountpoint after the fact

404592
chown	sudo	chown	mount
second if i do sudo chown -r myuser myuser borg-repo data will my mounted borg filesystem be accessible by myuser the next time i mount it

404594
ati	nvidia
i keep seeing similar question regarding drivers on linux for both nvidia and ati that is impossible to keep at the same time but there is no solution for my problem

404598
solaris	bsd
documentation suggests that it s always been the case on bsd but it wasn t the case on early solaris later versions did implement this protection which matches my memory

404598
solaris	bsd
linux and bsd allow it but solaris and hp-ux don t

404610
versioning	upgrade
i m facing an issue when i m trying to upgrade my arch linux system the new versioning of the package cinnamon-translations-3.6.2.1 it gets stuck during an upgrade

404616
unix	solaris
the way i learned unix and linux inside out was by using one of my computers as a guinea pig. i would install sco linux and eventually solaris and then linux much later all the while joyfully experimenting as root so i could read and or explore the directory hierarchy and all files with unrestrained access also creating normal user accounts on my home-grown multi-user box even though i was the only user

404619
filesystems	btrfs
which number of bytes how much space is actually consumed by an individual inode on a btrfs filesystems

404619
filesystems	btrfs
even more background i suspect that minimal disk space is consumed by first rsyncing to a btrfs filesystems and for each hourly create a btrfs snapshot on the backup device and rsync the changes to that newly snapshot inplace

404620
solaris	aix
in solaris aix or hpux or unix-like including linux you can use scripts to monitoring logs or anything like that

404645
config	ini
sysvinit loads an interpreter shell and then uses init scripts while systemd uses ini like config files it calls units

404659
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
on gnu linux systems like fedora centos debian and ubuntu i often find it beneficial to install and run iotop to see disk usage

404675
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
if you have a gnu linux system such as fedora centos debian or ubuntu those are examples--there are many others try running this command

404678
debian	linux
that is why i went for uname since as far as i know this is a most basic tool that is present on all linux distros - debian red hat slackware arch etc

404696
switching	screens
i made an installation that works but i have to put more rpm in my kickstart installation so i rebuilded my custom iso putted this on another usb key same model... but when my installation is finished i can t boot on my hard drive i only have a black screens with a flashing underscore where i can t write anything or switching tty instead of the prompt for login password

404697
ssl	https
i installed owncloud and applied ssl on it later i create a virtual host for https

404711
mouse	keyboard
so is it possible to get the idle time of my own terminal session in linux to kick off some dummy script on the terminal that keeps my session alive and dies automatically once an input is read from the keyboard or mouse

404712
udp	tcp
there are many plausible reasons for using udp instead of tcp possibly the most important one of which is the use of an encrypted vpn in which case wireshark will not help you in the least and for using a system port it is easier to evade detection if you use an innocent port

404712
ubuntu	linux
if you do not wish to re-install the os because you have sensitive data then take any linux distribution running from a usb stick ubuntu is just fine boot you pc from it not from your hard disk install clamav rkhunter and chkroot on the usb key and set them to work on your hard disk

404712
post	get
also you may wish to read this post including the answers to get some more tips

404755
ubuntu	debian
this entire process is cumbersome + badly broken which is why debian ubuntu have switched to netplan

404759
dnf	yum
how package managers in linux systems specifically yum dnf in fedora like linux update any software when it s open

404781
debian	linux
i want to establish isakmp ike vpn connection using scapy to craft the frames on my own i am using kali linux as a host and debian 7.8 as my vb machine

404813
mouse	keyboard
is it possible to replicate mouse and keyboard actions to multiple devices

404813
mouse	keyboard
listen on ubuntu 1 then replicate the exact mouse and keyboard actions to ubuntu 2 ubuntu 3 ubuntu 4 and so on

404814
dpkg	apt
dpkg is a very low level apt tool and as you can see from its results in your tests it did not know about the apt database and dependency trees until it actually installed the .deb file

404814
dpkg	apt
nor would i expect it to i have done a lot of automated scripting for debian apt and dpkg and the two act and behave very differently

404815
subshell	ifs
the inline declaration of ifs in the read statement and inside a subshell will preserve the value of ifs for the rest of the script s execution

404818
sudo	passwd
if by sudoless you mean you want to be able to just write dmesg or such on the command line then the simplest solution would be to make a script that calls bin dmesg through sudo and configure sudo to let that happen without asking for a passwd

404841
debian	centos	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian
the following two commands aligned to highlight syntactical changes which differ only in the means by which commands are delivered to the shell work fine on receivers running a variety of linux-based operating systems debian centos opensuse etc.

404847
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs
linux prefer xfs or some ext filesystems whereas windows prefer ntfs

versioning	upgrade
i am having a trouble with a program that needs old versioning of openssl.the program does not have support to upgrade it to new openssl versioning

404869
subnet	packets
for example the rule replace the sender s address for all packets from the local subnet is much easier than if a client has sent something to a server then replace the receipient in the server s response by something

404874
ubuntu	linux
i am a newbie to linux and would like to run an ubuntu server 17.10 at home

404895
put	get
so problem is if i put on downloading a large file from tomcat directory and if internet fails the file get corrupted and download starts fresh again

404902
stdout	stderr
on stdin instead of as an argument which is easier because ssh normally passes through stdin and stdout and stderr transparently

404902
bash	zsh
or if your shell supports herestring bash ksh zsh

404904
ubuntu	debian
i recently installed debian 9.0 stable with kde in my notebook that already had an ubuntu and windows 10 installations

404904
ubuntu	debian
my intent was to create a new partition to debian s root and use the same home daniel partition as i was using in my ubuntu

404904
ubuntu	debian
though i forgot to use an equal user name and later created a new user with the kde s gui app in debian with my ubuntu s user name daniel

404922
sudoers	passwd
to clarify i wish that other db users couldn t login either from my system or outside with their passwd --- i m the only one who uses this machine but even if there where other machine users besides root sudoers i would still want them not to be able to login to mysql and i don t want anyone to login from outside the machine as well - in other words i don t want any other human besides me to manipulate the database

404927
ubuntu	debian
you need to ensure that on both your debian and your ubuntu the daniel user has the same uid

404927
ubuntu	debian
probably debian and ubuntu are using different uid-s gid-s for daniel

404927
ubuntu	debian
so first run the commands not gui programs in your case they are confusing you to understand what uid gid is used for daniel on both debian and ubuntu

404927
ubuntu	debian
then decide on a common uid and gid for both systems debian and ubuntu

404927
ubuntu	debian
it should be unused and you need it to be the same small positive number on debian and ubuntu

ubuntu	debian	vim	emacs
change the uid and gid by editing -as root- carefully with an editor like vim or emacs or nano etc the etc passwd and etc group files on both systems to share the same uid gid on debian and ubuntu for your user

404933
centos	linux
the server is a linux centos 6.6

404936
prepare	execute
first of all you need to prepare a text file with the commands you want to execute because we are going to use the console

404936
sudo	passwd
next we source our text file to execute the commands it will ask for your sudo passwd

404948
centos	linux
what is current the difference between centos and red hat enterprise linux as of 2017

404950
centos	linux
on my centos 6.4 linux bash this command works fine

404979
google-chrome	firefox
at the moment the easiest way to use skype without installing anything is to open via google-chrome firefox is not fully supported yet

405000
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
of course you can follow this manual if you re on ubuntu debian mint to build a new version of openssl and then use dpkg to install it but it may lead to dire consequences for instance your installed applications will either stop connecting using ssl or stop working altogether

405014
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am using linux mint rosa ubuntu 14.04 and recently i installed steam

405034
ubuntu	linux
generally linux via ubuntu 16.04 handles them well

405044
openssl	libcrypto
first of all you should remove the locally-installed libraries and binaries libcrypto libssl etc. and openssl

405047
packets	multicast
once i started wireshark on the mac i could see the multicast packets while on b no packets could be detected

405057
bash	subshell
when bash finds such a file while searching the for a command it spawns a subshell to execute it

405069
strace	systemtap
another way would be to use sysdig or systemtap which do require kernel modules but offer more efficient logging of what is going on without needing to insert strace between the usual steps

405085
mp3	wav
i have a load of files mp3 wav txt doc that have been created in ms windows and they have spaces in their names

405098
folder	directory
note that that will also fix the names of directory so do not run that on the users directory from a windows system otherwise you re liable to break things windows requires specific names for certain folder in the user directory and this will change those folder names

405100
filesystems	btrfs
the most notable modern examples of such filesystems are btrfs and zfs but most newer filesystems use dynamic inode allocation and many including btrfs have opted to just not report anything for inode usage because it just doesn t matter since running out of inodes means your out of space on the filesystems itself so you couldn t create a new file regardless

405118
apache	nginx
i don t have nginx installed and would rather continue using apache along with my other sites instead of nginx

405118
apache	nginx
i found this site use apache instead of built-in nginx in gitlab ce but when i try gitlab-ctl stop i get a gitlab-ctl command not found response

405133
ubuntu	debian
you might have copied only the high-level library libncurses.so or libncursesw.so but debian and derived distributions such as ubuntu configure it with two libraries libtinfo.so libtinfow.so etc.

405169
udp	tcp
tcp and udp port 7946 for communication among nodes

405185

i am an absolute starter on linux and i am operating on an opensuse leap 42.1 and here is my situation

405222
postgresql	mysql
unlike postgresql mysql and mariadb do not have single-username roles

405228
stdout	stderr
the nc call basically prints to stderr and you need to send the output to stdout as follows

405229
debian	linux
gnu linux debian 9.2 cinnamon 64-bit headless mode ssh

405237
cpu	processors
your processors is scaled by the system more demanding tasks will cause the cpu to rev up less demanding task will not

405241
ubuntu	linux
how does the linux os ubuntu realizes that a new hardware device is connected

405255
gentoo	linux
i triple boot arch linux gentoo linux and nixos

405255
gentoo	linux
if i set up the bootloader with nixos then the gentoo and nixos entries boot fine but the arch linux entries in the grub2 config actually boot nixos not arch linux

405255
gentoo	linux
if i set up grub2 from arch linux nixos isn t recognized but gentoo is os-prober is installed

405258
debian	linux
i am working on a linux debian server aws ec2 and i have a software that needs to run in a graphical environment

405280
kde	cinnamon

405316
xfce	kde
i recently removed xfce and installed kde on my hp chromebook

405326
bluetooth	usb
what alternative could i use to accomplish this without using bluetooth or a usb connector

405330
bash	zsh
is a korn shell glob operator also supported by zsh -o kshglob and bash -o extglob that matches 0 or more .

405330
bash	zsh
the answer you re linking to refers to another feature of the zsh shell again not bash the glob qualifier

405332
copying	overwrite
copying them will overwrite the data on the target system

405347
bash	zsh
if your script runs under ksh or bash or zsh but not if it runs under plain sh you can put the command in an array

405351
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
what would be the key deciding factors for me to decide whether to install ubuntu mate or linux mint mate

405356
cpu	processors
so yes assuming that the hardware is connected to a controller that detects external connections an usb firewire esata â controller or a graphics processors with vga-with-edid dvi hdmi displayport the controller will send a signal on a bus and that signal will trigger an interrupt on the cpu

405360
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is based upon ubuntu but does not adhere to the canonical standards thus cannot be called ubuntu and linux mint mate is a flavour of linux mint

405360
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
well if you ask your questions here there really is none but if you intend to ask questions on ask ubuntu about linux mint mate they will close your questions and tell you to ask your questions here if you use any variant of linux mint including the mate version .

405376
ubuntu	mint
a mint 18.x desktop looks better on first boot than an ubuntu 16.04 desktop even with mate installed on the ubuntu system

405377
disk	ram
ramdisk couln t find valid ram disk image starting at 0

405410
switching	screens
so programs that switching to the alternate screens buffer when switching to cursor addressing mode will not be affected by this

405410
switching	screens
programs that do cursor addressing without switching to the alternate screens buffer will be however

405413
filesystems	btrfs
a custom hook was created to be able to boot into a btrfs filesystems without udev

405445
stdout	stderr
how do i redirect stdout and or stderr to a path i have specified in a variable

405445
stdout	stderr
for example- a simple script that if the scp command fails instead of printing the failure message to stderr or stdout i m not sure to which it outputs when fail it outputs it to a specified log file

405466
google-chrome	firefox
if just browsers does it happen with google-chrome with firefox

405468
pulseaudio	dbus
i believe this has something to do with the configuration of either pulseaudio or dbus

405476
x86	64bit
for example a 64bit x86 kernel can also run 32-bit binaries with two abis the â œoldâ i386 i686 abi and x32

405500
ubuntu	mint
if they match exactly you can say that was the file you installed and that it came from ubuntu mint does not provide their own certificates package as you can confirm by searching here

405529
versioning	upgrade
the pkcon refresh force -c -1 solution didn t work for me since there was multiple fedora versioning in the wake in my upgrade path

405541
tensorflow	cudnn
the problem seems to arise because i have libcudnn.so.7 of cudnn and tensorflow wants version 8

405541
tensorflow	cudnn
i ve followed the instruction on the tensorflow website that states i should install cudnn v6.0

405554
kde	cinnamon
the command in julie pelletier s answer worked for 18.2 cinnamon but not 18.2 kde

405561
installation	upgrade
i have done an apt-get upgrade on the installation which worked but left me very short on storage space because the old files could not be deleted since they are in a read-only fs

405565
mouse	keyboard
xorg directly receives input from the keyboard and mouse drivers it does not receive keyboard and mouse input from the tty driver

405593
debian	linux
i have some linux debian machines that i want to prevent unauthorized devices from being plugged in

405593
mouse	keyboard
i would like to disable all the usb ports on the machine but then i would have no way to plug in a keyboard and mouse

405593
mouse	keyboard
in the old days the mouse and keyboard plugged into ps 2 slots which were separate from the usb but now all ordinary mice and keyboards are usb

405593
mouse	keyboard
is there any way i can allow just a mouse and keyboard and prevent all other access to the machine

405612
spaces	delimiter
if you only want whats between between john and the following spaces delimiter could be any number of digits and you don t need to know in advance

405616
udp	tcp
tcp udp hole punching with practical implementation

405622
ati	nvidia
then edit entry and add type radeon if you want to use nvidia card drivers or nouveau if you want to use ati card drivers

405640
debian	linux
edit i forgot to mention that headphones work well on a sparky linux based on debian testing live usb

405641
versioning	upgrade
i doubt you have systemd because systemd by default ignores rc.local unless you upgrade from a prior versioning that did not have systemd and even then not sure .

405674
filesystems	btrfs
the available filesystems are ext or btrfs if that helps

405674
gentoo	linux
when preparing packages for gentoo linux i need to know how much space is needed during compilation

405685
for-loop	loops
if you want to write your for-loop on a single line then you need to put a semi-colon after each command in loops body

405690
daemons	systemd
what you wanted to do instead was to use your init systemd s daemons control etc init.d dropbox and add that to your init daemopn s control and as you can see it should run in your graphical runlevels

405692
unix	solaris
are there limits with unix solaris tar or gnu tar

405700
disk	ram
3 290 bytes is the size a deduplication table entry uses on disk and 141 bytes is the amount of ram an entry uses

405724
linefeed	delimiter
the r ead line like all commands taking a file name requires the filename be delimiter by a linefeed

405729
debian	linux
i am using debian gnu linux 7.11 wheezy the default python is 2.7.3 and pip is 1.1 which i have updated to 9.x

405730
sudo	passwd
using sshpass sudo apt-get install sshpass i managed to type the passwd directly into the command

405741
chown	mkdir	chown	passwd
then latter on users are added by a combination of editing etc passwd and mkdir + chown adding in turn

405741
fish	bash
you might whish to have more than one login shell bash csh fish kde ... in this case you can use multiple entry like

405742
folder	directory
but when i enter the command ls it shows all folder in my home directory on my desktop

405742
folder	directory
i m using ubuntu. it creates a directory in my home folder not in the server

405748
folder	directory
it creates a directory in my home folder not in the server

405748
folder	directory
actually assuming you entered mkdir directoryname on the command line after providing your password to the ssh -x username i.p.address command you successfully created a directory in your home folder on the server.

405748
folder	directory
now if on your system you see a directory of the same name on your desktop that means your home folder is a network share which means that you can access all files in your home folder from the server cool hey

405748
folder	directory
note that this is not really required since you can already access your fortran code provided you store it in your home folder or directory within your home folder

405764
openvpn	iptables
i am trying to create a virtual network between some machines using openvpn but the moment i connect openvpn obvious all the traffic is routed through that i even tried using iptables to say some ports should go through the network interface but it still doesn t allow me to connect to that ip unless all machines are on the vpn

405767
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
after creating an extended partition and testing different linux systems like ubuntu gnome and solus i wanted to go back to the initial situation as i decided i preferred my original single linux mint stable and well customized system.

405779
acpi	vga
the os setup would halt due to a nmi watchdog error to the swapper task just like above linked if i did not add acpi off and vga ask to the kernel boot parameters but now that the os is present i want to be able to dismiss acpi off so i can power the system off unattended server is to be set up on an as-needed basis with wol physically placed in a basement

405781
packets	multicast
the problem was that wireshark is obviously not possible to show multicast packets on a linux machine if more than one interface is observed by this wireshark instance at the same time

405781
packets	multicast
once i sniffed only one interface with wireshark i could see the multicast packets

405781
packets	multicast
but i tried to scan the multicast packets because i am facing the following issue if a multicast packets enters interface x i am not able to see it on an outgoing interface y

405784
opensuse	debian
the string gimme gimme gimme can be found in rhel opensuse fedora debian and probably more so it s not really distro specific

405813
xfce	gnome
this problem is not ubuntu xfce or kernel specific i have seen it in the same terms in ubuntu gnome kde-neon and in solus gnome and budgie

405841
spaces	linefeed
in a regular expression you can often refer to these either with or s depending on the re engine which includes both horizontal spaces tab and some unicode spacing characters of various width if available for which you can also use and sometimes h and vertical spacing characters like linefeed form feed vertical tab or carriage return

405851
post	get
the report shows a specific domain and all requests are post and get

405851
post	get
so i would like to know if it is possible to find out which domain is doing those attacks and if i can log all outbound request post and get to make a search when i need

405877
debian	centos
so it s a toss up between centos debian and maybe something i m missing

405891
debian	centos
getting familiar with debian rehl and centos are a good starting point

405891
apache	nginx
in addition you will want to learn common software technologies like databases such as postgresql mariadb web servers such as apache and nginx as well as iptables for firewall as well as directory servers like openldap

405927
disk	ram
i intend to run this on an embedded system with limited disk ram

405927
disk	ram
let s say i have 100mb of ram avaible and 5mb of disk space available

405930
centos	linux
i am new to the linux and using centos 7 as my server os

405942
bash	zsh
you should change your terminal to bash first using usr bin chsh -s bin bash then simply remove all zsh related files

405946
integer	fractions
06d. d - output format specificator where 06d points to the size of the integer part of the number d size 6 with leading zeros 06 and . d - the scale of the number fractions part

405962
disk	ram
to minimize the ram disk usage i would recommend to use pipes like this

405963
debian	centos
i highly recommend you to have a look on tutorial books i m a debian and manjaro user so i read the debian s handbook which is very well written maybe an equivalent exist for centos

405965
sudo	passwd
i want to block the sudo users from changing passwd of root

405967
bash	zsh
with bash or zsh

405967
bash	zsh
or bash zsh

405970
bash	zsh
about your question 2 that s because bash contrary to zsh doesn t wait for commands started in process substitution causing this kind of problem

405975
sudo	passwd
in particular users don t need to be root to run the passwd command to change their own passwd so depending on your specific needs it s likely you don t need to give them the ability to run any passwd command as root with sudo

405983
hash	md5
it contains a list of the packages files including their compressed forms packages.gz and packages.xz and the incremental versions along with their md5 sha1 and sha256 hash which ensures that the files haven t been tampered with

406024
bash	zsh
other shells like bash zsh mksh or freebsd sh have copied and extended like the form added by zsh it since

406037
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r user www-data flash

406041
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
doing steps mentioned in microsoft docs applicable to linux mint 18.x which is based on ubuntu 16.04

406072
bash	zsh
with zsh instead of bash here assuming there s no other background job running

406073
spaces	delimiter
is it possible to use cut and delimiter only based on non-escaped spaces

406082
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu i try with an executable helloworld file compiled helloworld.c using linux gcc

406107
freebsd	linux
i m looking for something similar to lsblk for linux or camcontrol devlist for freebsd

406110
bash	zsh
also zsh which can emulate bash just call it as bash or run emulate bash actually supports multi-line commands

406119
folder	directory
compare the contents files and folder of the two directory dir1

406131
hash	md5
according to the manpage for debsums you should find a list of files md5 hash located at

406151
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
how do i accomplish the same in linux mint 18.1 based on ubuntu 16.04 xenial

406153
cpu	hyperthreading
likely you have one cpu that is a quad core cpu and have hyperthreading enabled so that each physical core presents itself to the os to the kernel as two logical cores able to have two threads assigned to that same physical core simultaneously

406182
tunnel	packets
the entire idea in doing is that when i write any raw packets on my tunnel device it will put that in my actual physical interface

406182
tunnel	packets
in order to do so i am creating a tunnel device so that i can write ospf hello packets on it

406182
tunnel	packets
my understanding is that all the packets received or sent on the actual interface 10.16.1.152 will be received by this tunnel device interface whose ip address is 11.11.11.2

406182
tunnel	packets
so i think my tunnel isn t receiving any packets

406204
filesystems	ntfs
you can use fmask and dmask mount options to change the permission mapping on an ntfs filesystems

406258
filesystems	ntfs
using the mount options uid gid fmask and dmask you can make the entire ntfs filesystems accessible to your regular user account and or one group

406258
filesystems	ntfs
but that is all-or-nothing as far as the ntfs filesystems is concerned it s like running as full administrator all the time in windows or like doing everything as root in linux

406258
filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs-3g ntfs filesystems driver can do better than that

406258
filesystems	ntfs
if you re using ntfs-3g you can use the ntfsusermap command to create a user mapping file for your ntfs filesystems s

406258
filesystems	ntfs
that way once you mount the ntfs filesystems with the user mapping file in place at you can use your regular linux user account to access the ntfs filesystems exactly as your windows user account would be able to access

406270
daemons	systemd
and then you could configure the syslog daemons to write those messages to a specific file or to send them over the network to some other systemd

406270
udp	tcp
for example if you need to map the server s network connections for some sort of handover of the administration responsibility then you could first use netstat -na -a inet and netstat -na -a inet6 to identify all tcp udp ports that are capable of receiving incoming connections

406270
uniq	grep
with a bit of scripting you could search the logs for messages indicating incoming connections grep pick out the connection source information with sed awk or whatever tool you prefer then remove duplicates with sort followed by uniq

406299
cpu	processors
grep cpu cores is telling you that your processors has four physical cores built onto it

406319
centos	linux
a linux system can be backed up and restored without image creation as mentioned in this article how to install centos 7 into a directory without booting an install system

406325
ubuntu	linux
the linux is a customized linux based on the stable ubuntu image available for the card

406339
versioning	upgrade
the current versioning of gnome-software was upgrade to on 2017-09-23

406343
bash	zsh
in bash like in ksh but unlike zsh the stdout of rev also is the pipe to sleep 1

406369
spaces	delimiter
however if you want to allow whitespace in the username and the password it might be better to use some other delimiter than spaces

406371
putty	winscp
also you can use putty as part of winscp

406384
hide	show
it will disable the right-click to show menu startx -- -nocursor hide mouse cursor not prevent you to right-click open menu

406403
rpm	yum
i would like to know if it is possible that a package be installed on a system but not found when using rpm or yum commands

406404
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
is it possible to do something to suppress the sudo passwd prompt without modifying the sudoers file environment or supplying a privileged account

406426
filesystems	btrfs
build is a btrfs filesystems

406429
stdout	stderr
using an extra file descriptor allowed me to capture the time command s stderr without interrupting the subcommand s stdout or stderr

406429
stdout	stderr
when the script is run its stdout and stderr are the same as the subcommand s which can be redirected as usual

406430
bash	subshell	put	get
i assume it would be like so - get each line and then put export in front of it and then run bash -e export x ...the problem is that probably runs in a subshell and wouldn t effect the current shell

406434
stdout	stderr
what i d really like to do is to have a way to run a single command as foouser have it block print out stdout and stderr to my shell as a command usually would and then return with me still logged in as myself and not foouser

406434
stdout	stderr
this could be encapsulated in a script so that as_foo bar runs the command bar as foouser prints stdout and stderr returns return code of bar and then puts me back in my shell

406438
debian	linux
i tried to change the etc default grub but this is used only from the current system let s say debian 9.2 xfce and so the other system let s say debian 9.2 lxde sees just debian gnu linux 9 stretch

406472
unix	bsd
if your unix box is running a traditional init system v or bsd you can look for the shutdown process using ps

406474
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
for that reason i often install graphicsmagick which retained the useful man pages when it forked from imagemagick

406483
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
i use abcde for a similar purpose but i use ogg or flac for my high quality recordings and mp3 for the low quality

406515
manjaro	archlinux
above comments offer no help because they don t know well about archlinux yes manjaro is based on archlinux

406545
openbsd	netbsd
on openbsd and netbsd

406545
openbsd	netbsd
openbsd and netbsd both lack any acl mechanisms

406568
debian	linux
1 i have a small pc a raspberry pi 3 rpi3 running raspbian os a version of debian linux with pixel gui

406575
pull	push	ansible	puppet
update if you have to push and pull a lot of files with some additional scripts running between these transfers almost any provisioning tool chef puppet salt ansible will do the thing quicker than plain ssh scp

406595
ubuntu	debian
in 2014 it was removed from ubuntu and debian

406620
bluetooth	usb
this finds that the 8087 0a2a by intel is a bluetooth controller so the informed guess is that usb bus 1 is the internal bus the other 3 devices on it are also built into your laptop and curiously there s no device with number 005 so possibly there s another device that has been turned off

406658
mouse	keyboard
my mouse is always located in the center an i am unable to move it and the keyboard doesn t appear to work

406658
mouse	keyboard
logging into root went fine desktop background appeared mouse and keyboard worked

406683
stdout	stderr
bin sh is running interactively and stderr is redirected to stdout

406685
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox only show 3 levels in the chain with the cert rooted at comodo rsa certification authority

406715
stdout	stderr
as showed in the command line i add to redirect stderr to stdout and use to redirect all output to null device

406720
stdout	stderr
therefor when redirecting with 2 1 this sets the current output of stdout to stderr which is the current tty then the following sets the stdout to dev null which leaves stderr set to the tty

406761
mouse	keyboard
problem with keyboard and mouse in gdm3 and lightdm

406761
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse do not function in debian

406764
ubuntu	opensuse
i am having ubuntu and i want to install opensuse in parallel is it good to keep both bootloader in mbr or i should keep opensuse bootloader in other partition which i allocated to it during installation

406764
ubuntu	opensuse
in which case i will see options to login into ubuntu opensuse

406777
move	drag
the second one is black it s somewhat working because i can move my mouse on it and see the pointer but i can t drag windows on it

406789
ubuntu	opensuse
the best idea is to install a ubuntu and then virtualize opensuse as an example with virtualbox

406809
spaces	linefeed
s means whitespaces including spaces tab linefeed

406849
freebsd	debian
the debian almquist shell the freebsd almquist shell and the busybox almquist shell are all the almquist shell

406858
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
the host is ubuntu 16.04 the client is linux mint 18.2 vm

406859
dpkg	apt
after performing sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite var cache apt archives vlc-data_2.2.7-1 deb8u1_all.deb as per a comment i tried to update and upgrade resulting in the following output

406859
dpkg	apt
removing all my sources in etc apt sources.list.d and running sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite var cache apt archives vlc-data_2.2.7-1 deb8u1_all.deb seems to have resolved my issue

406879
kde	gnome
a desktop environment gnome kde lxde lxqt is just a collection of software to provide a fully fledged desktop experience

406908
cpu	processors
a context switch just stops what the processors is doing a core or cpu saves its state to ram and then replaces it with another context

406914
ubuntu	linux
i want to get a wifi dongle with the 802.11ac or later standard that is compatible with linux 4.13 with ubuntu 17.10 for a desktop pc streacom fc8 mini unit 64 bit intel core i3-2130

xfce	gnome
those launchers work in both gnome 3.22 and xfce 4.12 by double

406957
xfce	gnome
i run a debian 9 stable machine with xfce 4.12 for a while and i am setting up a gnome desktop in parallel to try it out

406964
bash	zsh
in bash the -p option is only useful in conjunction with -e another bash extension which makes bash s read behave like zsh s vared where bash may need to redraw the prompt on some occasions like upon ctrl+l

406974
sudo	passwd
if the root passwd information is stored in shadow then all you need is to boot normally and run sudo under a sudo user

406998
disk	ram
the problem seems to be that i need a root filesystem most likely generated by the initial ram disk initrd generation technique

407007
disk	ram
swap is off with 8gb ram i don t need disk swap

407028
folder	directory
i made bash script to automate process of packing browser extension in .zip archives but for some reason beside content from the current directory public folder manifest.json and index.html it also packs mcm_extension folder upper folder along with current folder in it and whole content from it again

407029
folder	directory
whats the .local folder for in my home directory

407036
ubuntu	linux
i have just installed ubuntu 16.04 lts 64-bit os and everything has been working fine until i downloaded a 32-bit version .deb of visual code for linux and tried to install it in ubuntu software center caused it to crash

407043
bash	zsh
zsh is a broadly used shell that uses a language that is pretty much a superset of bash and designed to have a very customisable ui

407044
kde	gnome
i m not certain about the reason but switching from gnome to kde plasma fixed it very well and also fixed some minor lags

407054
centos	linux
i ve large text on linux centos 7 server and i would like to remove lines which is matching before first comma at all

407074
filesystems	btrfs	umount	btrfs
i would like btrfs filesystems sync to be run before the filesystems is umount

407101
folder	directory
i have looked into all the directory from root actually not all of them from parent to child as it wasn t necessary and found 3 folder contains about 90 of total data

407134
disk	ram
the high number of reads in experiment 7 is caused by the same problem - the system s anonymous pages took most of the ram and file-backed pages had to be repeatedly read from disk

407134
disk	ram
the main improvement of zswap in terms of disk writes is not the fact that it compresses the pages but the fact it has its own buffering caching system that reduces the page cache and effectively keeps more anonymous pages in compressed form in ram

407138
bash	subshell
subshell refers to a shell command that is a child of some shell such as child of the bash -i interactive login shell that offers you a prompt

407138
stdout	stderr
it sounds like this may be appropriate because you don t want its stdout stderr messing up the appearance of your progress bar and because you don t want the parent shell to report on or even notice the death of its child

407146
width	height
step two now create three files that contain the width and height of each pages and a default for the fraction of the split the left page will use

407153
versioning	upgrade
i need to upgrade gnome versioning 3.22 to versioning 3.24 in centos 7

407156
wan	lan
i can see this samba share from the wan ie outside the lan by using the modem router ip address and by traversing the modem router using port forwarding

407205
daemons	systemd
what i ve understood is that once an external drive is attached the kernel intercept this event and informs the udev systemd that is always listening thanks to the udevd daemons

407214
tunnel	packets
to figure out packets likely to be censored and tunnel them

407215
filesystems	xfs
that partition belongs to a single physical volume which belongs to a single volume group which exposes a single logical volume which is formatted to the xfs filesystems

407224
daemons	systemd
and informs the udev systemd that is always listening thanks to the udevd daemons

407254
bash	zsh
another option for that specific example would be to use zsh or ksh93 instead of bash

407288
kde	gnome
i tried it recently now debian 10 buster both kde gnome

407305
xfs	ntfs
it did work for an xfs system but not for ntfs and exfat

407330
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu and debian it would be by using

407344
spaces	delimiter
i m wondering if somehow spaces isn t your word delimiter

407353
folder	directory
hi i am currently working on a shell script project and i need to check if a folder say cat exists in a certain directory

407368
filesystems	btrfs
some filesystems like btrfs have integrated snapshots

407391
ubuntu	linux	xfce	gnome
i want to have a vnc access with my linux ubuntu server 16.04 lts dedicated machine but i don t want to install any xfce gnome or any kind of graphic interface no desktop no gui i just want to have a vnc access looking on a terminal

407417
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux still feels not proficient at linux although used ubuntu for several months writing and debugging some python code i have had a confusion for a time and hope to get some veteran s advice i had a miserable time configuring some software on linux caffe for deeplearning and gpu driver stuffs although finally succeed with searching and explore on google i feel not fully understand like why i need to run some command in case of a specific error message or only conceptually know that

407418
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux but i was trying to access my server using the command line tool terminal on ubuntu 17 but apperently you need open ssh to use ssh that requires a keygen

407432
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to get a usb-connected brother hl-2240 printer to work on linux ubuntu xenial with cups 2.1.3-4ubuntu0.3

407443
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for nipun

407444
ansible	puppet
when using config management software like puppet ansible chef etc. it s easier to just drop or remove a file in a dir and run apt update instead of parsing a file to add or remove certain lines

407455
stdout	fflush
i could modify the program to fflush the output but i thought an app should be agnostic as to what is being used with the output to stdout

407464
kde	gnome
we are using debian 8 and 9 with gnome 3 kde 5 kerberos authentification and an afs filesystem

407464
kde	gnome
kde programs dolphin and konsole have afs-rights gnome ones do not

407469
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon
if you use gnome cinnamon etc. make sure you specify what session gui you use otherwise above will log you into xfce and you may not have it installed

407495
min	max
rtt min avg max mdev 0.025 0.025 0.025 0.000 ms

407499
for-loop	loops
using a while loops will be better or a for-loop

407532
bash	zsh
i need this to work in both zsh and bash

407545
fish	zsh
and each glob expanded individually and if any glob doesn t match the command is cancelled as you d expect in zsh or fish

407545
bash	zsh
for a glob alternative that works in both zsh and bash you could use the ksh globs set -o kshglob in zsh and shopt -s extglob in bash

407550
ubuntu	linux
on a linux box specifically ubuntu

407554
dpkg	apt
whenever you install a package with dpkg and therefore apt it keeps track of which files on the system were created by that installer

407555
fastboot	adb
i have tinkered with udev before and successfully set popper permissions to use adb fastboot without the use of sudo each time

407555
folder	directory
right now it s a simple test script that makes a folder called test success in my downloads directory

407578
dpkg	apt
for openbsd flavor you can figure out location binary name with dpkg -l package-name googling yourself to find equivalent of dpkg l if yor package manager is not apt

407593
bgp	ospf
moreover one of the usual tactics in linux for creating virtual ips over bgp or ospf is assigning them to loopback dummy interfaces and making pathways to them via routing

407618
put	get
for example get rid of any non-printable characters and put into another file

407619
tunnel	packets
instead you d need to encapsulate forward packets including their source into something like l2tp and then forward that through the tunnel then decode it on the other side

407623
debian	linux
i m planning to boot and run a custom linux system based on debian built by me from an sd card and the 3.5 hard drives will be used for data storage and possibly log files

407648
centos	linux
this morning i decided to update my linux centos 7.2.1511 .but yum skip too many package because of dependency problem

407663
debian	linux
os gnu linux debian 9.2 64-bit

407687
rpm	dnf
if this fails with no package found install dnf from some rpm source

407687
rpm	dnf
google for dnf rpm download chose one for centos 7.x or rhel 7

407687
dnf	yum
then try to understand what those packages are and remove them one by one using yum or dnf

407691
filesystems	fat
in general newer filesystems like ext4 are better at recovery possibly with some manual input during recovery than older filesystems like ext2 or fat

407692
ubuntu	linux
boot the system using a live linux disk of either kali linux or ubuntu

407732
xfce	gnome
i d like to run xfce or gnome flashback on it but would like a way to test things before spending 2k

407748
for-loop	loops
in my test i have a while loops that will write up to the x bytes in variable block sizes one block at a time specified by a higher level for-loop

407753
crypt	hash
in the end you need to call the crypt 3 function from the libcrypt which on gnu systems like linux mint comes with the gnu libc with the password as first argument and the hash as second argument

407753
hash	salt
above can be either the full hash like or just the part of it up to the rightmost that is including the salt and optional round count

407787
put	get
get the comparison of duplicates from fdupes and put it in a file

407789
bash	subshell
very new to bash and pretty confused about local global variables subshell

407800
bash	zsh	stdout	stderr
is the csh syntax also supported by zsh and recent versions of bash to redirect both stdout and stderr to a file

407800
stdout	stderr
for completeness the syntax to redirect both stdout and stderr in various shells

407800
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
csh tcsh zsh and bash 4+ though in zsh and bash only when the file name is not a sequence of decimal digits otherwise it s the bourne redirection operator

407800
bash	zsh
bash and zsh 3+

407814
stdout	stderr
will give you a nice list of files that differ on stdout and a list of files that aren t found in one tree or the other on stderr

407838
ethernet	wireless
creating a software ap is independent from your own network connection ethernet wireless ...

407855
bash	zsh
with the gnu and ast-open implementations of ls in the c locale the output with the option is post-processable by zsh ksh93 or bash

407858
stdout	stderr
and i won t redirect wine -s stderr and stdout to dev null at least during the debugging phase

407863
sudo	gnome-terminal
hilarity ensues when people attempt to run gnome-terminal as another user via sudo and suchlike

407873
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
on systems where pipes are bidirectional netbsd freebsd svr4-derived unices all those where pipes use streams at least but not linux

407875
daemons	systemd
the systemctl command does not do very much - it just uses d-bus to talk to the systemd daemons

407877
daemons	systemd
may be it blocks on systemctl preset because in a systemd-controlled operating systemd that one tries to talk to the systemd daemons to execute the command

407877
daemons	systemd
however in a docker container there is no systemd daemons

407884
subnet	packets
please note that you don t need to turn off the reverse path filtering in that case because everything is legal - tun0 only receives and sends packets that belong to its subnet

407903
kate	kde
kate which whom i am also in love with besides atom.io was preinstalled so seeming there is a kde presence.

407910
vlan	packets
i am working to insert vlan tags for some client macs on outgoing packets via native vlan

407910
vlan	packets
can i either add the tag to the packets from client coming to native vlan and then send it via same vlan can i forward native vlan packets of some clients based on their mac to a tagged vlan interface

407913
ssd	sata
i have filled up a drive and i am thinking of buying another but i do not know if there is a free sata port on the system there are 1x ssd boot 2x 2tb in a raid 1 and 2x 8tb installed and i think the system had 5 ports

407914
postfix	dovecot
on a new test server which i set up rather than inherited i installed postfix for use with our drupal-based website and a local crm and all mail functions seem to be working just fine there without installing dovecot and the only difference in functionality between the test and prod servers is email but i think not even that because mx records to gmail so do i need to run dovecot on this server

407927
ubuntu	debian
all i managed to found was just manuals to how to turn it off entirely or how to-s for ubuntu that is unfortunately not proper for debian or i did not manage to apply them at least

407931
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
also note that with modern unices you could rename that non-empty-dir but on some like linux or freebsd but not solaris not move it to a different directory even if you also had write permission to that directory as i think and for linux as suggested by the comment for the relevant code doing so would involve modifying non-empty-dir the

407949
lvm	umount
in my case i was trying to modify the lvm as i wanted to make the var partition bigger so i needed to umount it

407994
ubuntu	linux
i ran this command on ubuntu 14.04 linux while trying to install a package

407997
stdout	stderr
we have an sql script that we execute while redirecting stdout and stderr to two separate files

408008
jobs	cron
edit 1 i checked var log syslog and ignored several types of lines using grep -v and what i saw that when i was kicked off each time it looks like some resource-greedy cron jobs were running

408008
jobs	cron
now my question is now can i limit the memory and swap space these cron jobs use so the memory is not used up and my terminal doesn t get killed

408024
kerberos	ldap
i have a task to do i have to find out how to be able to login through sso to an app behind the sso and ldap or kerberos from a linux machine

408024
kerberos	ldap
how it looks on the sso side there is sso ldap kerberos and windows active directory

408026
filesystems	xfs
is it possible to recover files that have been rm ed from an xfs filesystems

408034
debian	linux
i m new to linux and i decided to install debian 9 i installed it in my hdd in uefi mode with a usb stick and the dvd 1 iso found here

408034
debian	linux
i also tried to install nvidia drivers as shown here how to install the latest nvidia drivers on debian 9 stretch linux but i got black screen with blinking cursor again

408035
centos	linux
os centos 7 linux

408048
jobs	cron
now my question is now can i limit the memory and swap space these cron jobs use so the memory is not used up and my terminal doesn t get killed

408052
debian	linux
i have a deepin linux debian based installed on my notebook and i m trying to share folders from this computer with a w10 computer so i tried to share the folder and on windows type the user and password from deepin screenshot

408052
folder	directory
but i have no results the funny weird thing is that if i share some subfolder from user directory like uaimax documents it works like a charm but i m not being able to make it work when i share some folder from my ntfs partition secondary hard drive

408059
spaces	delimiter
comma or spaces delimiter doesn t work

408079
bash	zsh
the second syntax uses the conditional construct which exists in bash and ksh and zsh but not plain sh

408116
vim	emacs
text editors vim emacs etc get cut off as well

408124
ubuntu	debian
the code doesn t work in bash 4.1 but works in bash 4.4 in multiple distros arch ubuntu and debian

408141
sudo	passwd
2 in both console do sudo cmd to save passwd and console don t ask passwd every time

408141
sudo	passwd
3 in first console do sudo passwd user01 and change passwd

408141
sudo	passwd
4 in second console do sudo passwd user01 and change passwd

408156
jobs	cron
you can find your cron jobs from the log if once it has executed before

408171
bash	zsh
it s a good idea to avoid bash here anyway as it doesn t wait for processes in process substitutions zsh waits for them ksh93 can be told to wait for them

408187
portrait	landscape
i have 2 screen monitors one in landscape and one in portrait mode

408187
portrait	landscape
the webcam is on the portrait monitor the landscape monitor doesn t have a rotation capability so i cannot switch them

408200
icmp	tcp
and after trying tcp test-netconnection then tries ping icmp and that also fails

408219
rpm	yum
once you transfer the data rh extras rpm data to the air-gapped system with minimal installation you will need to install the some back-end tools yum yum-utils and createrepo

408252
for-loop	arrays
usually i store the pids in a bash arrays and then the pid checking is a for-loop

408340
centos	linux
i have worked with my vnc remote on my vps linux centos 7

408349
hash	md5
another approach is to download the public key to a system which supports both md5 and sha256 hash

408386
debian	linux
software kali-rolling linux x86-desktop-1 4.12.0-kali2-amd64 #1 smp debian 4.12.13-1kali2 2017-10-03 x86_64 gnu linux

408399
sudo	passwd
but if i lock the screen and want log back in it doesn t let me in tried first with the code and first with the passwd too always incorrect but it s working with sudo

408402
kerberos	ldap
if you use password authentication and don t have centralized auth like ldap kerberos etc. you need to consider etc shadow which contains the password hashes for every user

408424
ubuntu	linux
some processes seem to eat up the disk space on linux ubuntu 16

408445
disk	ram
ram is much faster than disk

408454
titlebar	window
is it possible to change button-layout in gtk window titlebar

408499
ubuntu	opensuse
distros latest opensuse ubuntu or cubes os with default settings

408514
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
both bash and dash do this as does tcsh but zsh doesn t

408519
gentoo	linux
after the upgrade from gcc-5.x to gcc-6.4 all gentoo linux users were advised to run

408521
ubuntu	openbsd
i am using ubuntu server 16.04.3 it comes with the openbsd version of netcat

408531
ubuntu	openbsd	ubuntu	debian	openbsd	debian
this is happening because the debian ubuntu version of netcat-openbsd is not in fact the openbsd code

408531
ubuntu	openbsd	ubuntu	debian	openbsd	debian
it is the openbsd code significantly patched with debian ubuntu changes which have not been sent back to the maintainers of the original software

408578
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash	ash	tcsh
what are the similar techniques for ksh bash ash dash csh tcsh zsh

408581
mktime	strftime
you could use gawk which has the strftime and mktime functions

408588
int	chars
for bash that can be scalar sparse arrays associative arrays with keys restricted to positive int or associative arrays with non-empty keys neither key nor values can contain nul chars

408588
bash	zsh
in bash or zsh or yash though beware array indices start at 1 in zsh and yash and only zsh can store nul characters you could always return one array per column by having awk generate the code to define them

408618
folder	directory
say i have a folder dot containing some files and directory such as

408622
for-loop	arrays
it s like an operator that is applied implicitly to arguments also in for-loop words arrays and with some shell the target of redirections and a few other contexts for the parts of them that are not quoted

408624
folder	directory
ensure you have created a folder called backup in your root directory as a mount point and use following command

408624
folder	directory
this will then copy all files and folder from the root directory excluding the mount point backup

408646
comm	grep
the same thing goes for the grep and comm commands

408658
chown	chmod
i have even tried to chmod and chown files on my usb and even so multisystem only works with mbr not with an gpt-efi usb

408667
ubuntu	linux
however as already stated this already exists for most linux os systems have confirmed this myself through kali linux and ubuntu where tab will function the same way and keying tab twice will function like the

408719
ubuntu	linux
they both have exactly the same system installed ubuntu 16.04.3 lts gnu linux 4.4.0-87-generic x86_64

408746
sudo	passwd
using sshpass sudo apt-get install sshpass i managed to type the passwd directly into the command

408791
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
i ve looked into gnome kde xfce and tcl tk but it s hard to tell which are the best for a single app rather than an entire desktop

408794
sudo	passwd
i try to open terminal as admin with ui and i can change root passwd with passwd and i can set new passwd after than i remove sudo and reinstalled it

408798
put	get
works if i put diskio instead of cpu i get an empty bar while conky s diskiograph clearly shows disk io

408813
daemons	systemd
so your etc bashrc which i think is the equivalent of etc bash.bashrc on macos and maybe other systemd is only read by interactive non-login shells and remote shell daemons

408838
spaces	delimiter
i m caught between the mac xargs interpreting spaces in filenames as separate arguments and not being able to set the delimiter to only newlines not spaces

408858
unix	bsd
writevt dev tty# text at least on linux maybe bsd and unix its currently party of the console-tools package

408860
cpu	processors
processors intel r core tm i7-7700 cpu 3.60ghz

408871
bash	zsh
with zsh instead of bash

408873
versioning	upgrade
you could have put firefox on hold beforehand but now as you have been upgrade already to the newest versioning you should look into ways to downgrade it or alternatives

408877
daemons	launchd
i would suggest looking at lingon x by peter borg for creating managing launchd jobs daemons etc

408878
zsh	tcsh
while which cmd returns the command that zsh would run which is a builtin in zsh like in tcsh but unlike most other shells

408881
debian	linux
i m trying to setup linux debian 9 on a microsoft surface pro 2

408884
vmware	virtualbox
i want to know if it is possible do something like this by the shell i have no desktop environment can i create an iso of the entire system that can be run into a virtual machine environment on my local pc for example using vmware or virtualbox

408897
fastboot	adb
as we know recently google released binaries of adb fastboot which now can be downloaded separately

408937
symlink	dotfiles
note .bash_completion is actually a symlink to source dotfiles bash_completion

408950
ubuntu	debian
see what is the format of the apt search output on debian ubuntu

408952
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i have been using various flavors of linux ubuntu debian and kali under vmware workstation running windows 10 as the host and have been experiencing the file systems of the guest os s going read only intermittently - i think it happened 2 times yesterday and once today

408952
ubuntu	debian
at first i thought it was just a bad install as it was happening under kali only to start - however then it began affecting ubuntu and debian as well

408954
ubuntu	debian
common distributions like ubuntu and debian are usually conservative and backward compatible in their package offerings so the versions won t change very much over time

408955
ubuntu	debian
you can enable these capabilities on ubuntu or debian by following

408955
ubuntu	debian
1 log into the ubuntu or debian host as a user with sudo privileges

408975
filesystems	ntfs
i have been looking at ext4 and ntfs as two possible filesystems but seem both come short on some counts

408977
bluetooth	usb
i just found my solution in fedora 26 using plantronics legend and pluggable bluetooth usb after a lot of searching

408982
prerequisites	uninstaller
installing wpa_supplicant should use nm as prerequisites and uninstaller nm should uninstaller wpa_supplicant

409010
disk	ram
os actually transfer data between paging space hard disk ram back forth in case of high memory utilization

409013
disk	ram
the management of memory pages in ram or on disk is handled by the virtual memory manager vmm

409016
disk	ram
copying data to from the hard disk takes longer than copying it into out of ram

409016
disk	ram
therefore it seems reasonable to conclude that if your system is having to use 35 of your page space because there is no more ram available then there will be some performance overhead due to the hard disk read writes

409025
post	get
i tried with sed reading a few post here but couldnâ t get it

409040
filesystems	ntfs
in any linux os you can check the version of ntfs filesystems in a drive using

409040
filesystems	ntfs
in windows use open cmd as an administrator and use the following to check ntfs filesystems version and other details of your disk

409068
width	height
i can resize the width and height of the terminal with following command control sequence introducer csi

409071
bash	zsh
it is one of several expansions done by bash zsh and ksh filename expansion being another one of them

409075
sudo	passwd
however when i logged in as tom it asks for permission and when i sudo something it asks for passwd and i don t have a passwd for him so i use my root passwd so it warns

409075
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for tom

409075
sudo	passwd
tom should run stuff like sudo npm install or sudo composer install with his ssh passwd and maybe he shouldn t even know root passwd

409076
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
since this makes changes to the etc sudoers file unnecessary you can revert your changes there unless you want to remove the security layer of asking for a passwd for sudo commands

409076
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if you want however the usual way of having a passwd request for sudo command you should leave the etc sudoers file alone and simply add the user to the sudo group

409078
sudo	passwd
based on a second reading if you still want the passwd prompted for tom to use sudo you would want

409078
sudo	passwd
if you want tom to be able to run sudo without a passwd at all use the below answer

409078
sudo	passwd
tom is the user this line applies to the first all is which hosts this applies to nopasswd is a tag that specifies a passwd is not required and the final all specifies what commands tom can run via sudo

409082
daemons	systemd
on session login the script will be called importing everything into the systemd user daemons

409092
chown	chgrp
i am a bit confused with chown and chgrp

409096
folder	directory
to make this apply by default to any new files directory created within the music folder you want to add the -d flag for default and to apply recursively to all existing files directory you want to add the -r flag for recursive

409125
disk	ram
how to get network and disk usage and ram and cpu utilization per process in simple command

google-chrome	firefox
when i change my standard browser to google-chrome or firefox it works

409143
put	get
as we are commonly working multiple days on the same module the alias should also get an entry in the .bashrc file this is the main feature so whenever they close the bash they dont need to put in the whole command on reentering

409151
chown	chmod
for foo files you could chown foo teambar teambarfile s and teambardirs and then chmod 600 personnal_files

i use the command above to capture packets to a 5mb pcap file on an ubuntu machine

409249
mpfr	mpc
i compiled gcc and dependencies gmp mpfr mpc in specific folder to get backup of these folders in other not repeat the compile process and pass to another machines

409249
mpfr	mpc
how can update make gmp mpfr mpc and gcc the another machines with these folders

409268
put	get
0.9 and 1.0 put the superblock at the end of the device so they are the ones you can get into issues

409285
filesystems	fat
while it was originally designed to provide a way to get posix semantics on fat filesystems it should work just fine for this too barring any possible issues from stacking fuse modules on top of each other

409285
cifs	smb
alternatively if your storage provider offers smb cifs access see if they support the cifs unix extensions though only do this if you are talking over a secure network and trust both endpoints cifs is a variant of smb 1.0 and it includes all the potential security issues that that entails

409367
ubuntu	centos
this is ootb functionality as of at least rhel centos 7 and ubuntu 16 lts

most of the time we do get head and post

409420
solaris	bsd
this is how it works on solaris there might exist specific caveats on other systems like linux or bsd

409422
fish	tcsh
tcsh fish and yash are three other shells that can complete user names for instance when completing arguments but it doesn t look like they let you obtain that list of user names programmatically

409429
children	parent
oom_score_adj is inherited on fork so you can set its initial value for new children by setting the desired value on the parent process

409438
versioning	upgrade
as you can see here microsoft decided to force people to upgrade to newer skype versioning and the old ones cease to work since a few weeks already

409449
debian	linux
the static hostname from which the dynamic hostname is initialized during bootstrap is stored in etc hostname on debian linux

409454
freebsd	linux
i wrote one such utility for the nosh toolset in 2016 that knows the mechanisms for both linux operating systems and freebsd trueos

409461
debian	linux
this is how it reads on systems such as debian linux

409461
debian	linux
on systems such as debian linux the pager command is part of the alternatives system and can map to one of several actual commands jdebp update-alternatives --list pager

409485
unix	bsd
the long answer tries everything so it will work on pretty much any unix system regardless of whether it uses the newer etc nsswitch.conf both gnu linux and bsd come with getent the traditional unix passwd flat file macos s directory servicesâ¹ dscl or even the older cat-themed macos x releases and nextstep nidump

409493
spaces	delimiter
the chief problem is that the spaces character 0x20 is used both for the delimiter between records and may also appear within a record

409500
kate	kde
i m using kate version 16.12.3 with the kde framework 5.31.0

409569
ansible	puppet
puppet not quite as easy to set up as ansible it requires software running on all the managed systems as well as the system doing the managing but still very popular

409571
bash	zsh
bash ksh zsh etc have the substring expansion and if you need to do it recursively enable globstar and use instead

409626
disk	ram
given the fact virtual memory might be present in ram on disk files or swap or nowhere you cannot reliably compare ram and virtual memory usage

409629
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
the only other postings on this topic i could find relate to ubuntu debian but the config seems different for centos

409637
bash	subshell
the tty command returns the device path of your current terminal enclosing it in has bash execute it in a subshell and the kill command sends a signal to the current process that will have bash re-print its ps1 prompt

409648
filesystems	btrfs
there are several filesystems such as ext4 f2fs btrfs

409648
filesystems	btrfs
if you don t need consistency supported by a filesystems you can use ext4 with journal option off f2fs when a program that use tmp generate frequent fsync btrfs if you need snapshot fucntions

409663
sudo	passwd
more importantly perhaps it also contains logs of sudo commands which could easily contain sensitive information and is also one of the reasons you should avoid specifying passwd on command lines

409677
uptime	reboot
but it holds uptime values just from last reboot

409685
uptime	reboot
as pointed out by jdebp last reboot might give you a longer list of boots with the associated uptime

409689
ubuntu	debian
debian s ubuntu s lib systemd system-generators openvpn-generator will make the service units to match

409704
punctuation	words
punctuation symbols are considered as a words

409705
punctuation	words
where words are defined as either sequences of alphanumerical characters or sequences of punctuation characters

409728
bash	zsh
with ksh bash zsh or yash you can use

409753
versioning	upgrade
this works nicely because apt-listchanges is run with the list of packages which apt is about to upgrade and can thus compare the current installed versioning with these

409755
innodb	myisam
this is my solution how to create an zfs snapshot while keeping the global lock so that myisam and innodb data files are consistent

409763
children	parent
as you can see the children are listed before the parent

409763
children	parent
in a more complex find command the actions would be applied to children before parent

409763
children	parent
then their parent will be processed and in turn if theyâ re empty which might be the case since their empty children have been deleted deleted too and so on all the way back to the current directory

409768
kerberos	ldap
no kerberos ldap etc

409821
children	parent
is there an easy way to stop the parent pid and all of its children

409832
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
to find the block address of a file it is much more convenient to use the filefrag -v command which works with commonly-used linux filesystems these days ext4 xfs btrfs f2fs etc.

409850
children	parent
possible reasons it might not work include that the children are nested that is the children have children or if the children actually belong to some global parent for example the init system

409856
comm	grep
the grep is to remove unneeded bindings and the sort is so i can compare these emacs bindings with the vi ones using comm later

409859
cifs	smb
while that s far slower than the smb cifs solution it works perfectly

409886
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade that shell to it s highest versioning 4.4

409898
debian	centos
centos 7 has even older software than debian stretch especially gcc 4.8 which is too old for our work

409898
ubuntu	debian
it is not much worse than with debian or ubuntu lts but then i don t have â œenterpriseâ experience either

409928
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
arch is linux pam which is different from solaris pam and freebsd pam and linux pam has means to skip rules so one way to do this would be along the lines of

409955
bash	zsh
bash csh zsh etc are shells

409964
spaces	delimiter
with awk you can also print various fields from the above output awk default fields delimiter is white spaces

409964
spaces	delimiter
or you can even ask awk to use a customized fields delimiter like spaces x and +

409990
stdout	stderr
you can redirect both stdout and stderr using aka

409990
stdout	stderr
another approach is to redirect only stderr leavng stdout where it pointed so try something like

410042
mouse	keyboard
you could also try where is the windows linux key on your keyboard and mmb is the middle mouse button

410044
google-chrome	firefox
1 make sure that you have . google-chrome userchrome.css under your user mozilla firefox profile directory and that it includes this line to suppress the navigation bar

410047
solaris	bsd
for example do operating systems like bsd macos solaris use the fsuid and the fsgid

410052
chown	sudo
however i accidentally ran sudo chown myuser -r

410085
ubuntu	linux
i was able to see the files on my linux ubuntu 16.04 machine but after sticking the usb into a windows machine i can no longer even see the files on my linux machine rather worried it may have auto formatted the usb or something

410086
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
the ping utility uses icmp internet message control protocol not udp user datagram protocol or tcp transmission control protocol

410097
pop-up	dialog
as a result of that click a new dialog window will pop-up showing the window properties for the firefox addon window

410106
folder	directory
this question has parallels to question touch all folder in a directory

410113
freebsd	netbsd
note that -h implies -c to avoid creating the file if it didn t exist with netbsd freebsd but not with gnu or busybox touch though with gnu touch it wouldn t create files either and print an error message so adding -c here for increased portability

410113
freebsd	netbsd
note that if is a symlink with gnu touch and with -h the modification time of the symlink will be used that of the target would be used without -h while with netbsd where -h comes from and freebsd touch the modification time of the target is used with or without -h

410113
bash	zsh
bash doesn t have the equivalent of zsh s zargs or ksh93 s command -x to split command lines so as to avoid the arg list too long issues

410125
ubuntu	linux
i m not very experienced with ubuntu or any other linux distributions so there might be obvious things that people have stated in comments which i haven t tried because i didn t understand what they meant

410127
wan	lan

i am trying to install multiple versions of python on my machine using the deadsnakes ppa on debian not ubuntu

410149
stdout	stderr
i would like to ask what the output of time statistics for command execution belongs to which file description since it is neither 1 stdout nor 2 stderr

410151
stdout	stderr
it belongs to neither stdout nor stderr of date

410170
ubuntu	debian
no non- udeb package should have a dependency on a udeb and indeed as far as i can tell none do in debian and ubuntu

410183
versioning	upgrade
now i want to upgrade example.rpm to versioning 2 and make sure that the same prefix is used

410210
ubuntu	centos
cdpath by default on the distros i work with ubuntu centos the variable is empty not set but the same logic applies if it s set then this has been probably done in one of the files sourced during login as explained above

410216
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	ocaml	rust
if you are not happy with bash you can use another shell zsh or fish etc... and you can write your own shell probably in some compiled language like rust c++ ocaml c go ....

410220
bash	zsh
don t know if shorter but rather straightforwardly in the shell bash and zsh quickly tested

410230
width	height
that assumes identify can identify the width and height for all the files and you wouldn t use that approach for file types that can contain several images like animated gif s

410255
ubuntu	debian
see how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

410264
debian	linux

410269
debian	linux
i am wondering if it is theoretically possible to build a linux distro that can both support rpm and debian packages

410271
hash	md5
the -e option allows you to set the hash as either md5 or sha256

410271
hash	md5
the colon separated hash is the md5 form

410325
cat	tee
do cat fifo1 2 1 | tee file.txt done readfifo.sh

410326
ubuntu	linux	jobs	cron
i was bogged with an error â œauthentication failureâ for all of my cron jobs in linux ubuntu

kerberos	ldap
now if that also does not help then you would need to check the authentication module you have configured in the system kerberos pan ldap which ever

410370
freebsd	linux
see the freebsd handbook information also valid for linux

410376
bash	zsh
the login shell as the name says is the shell bash zsh etc that is given to an user when they logs in and where they type commands

ubuntu	linux
i had an external hard-drive with a fat32 partition which i used for exchanging files between ubuntu and windows some unallocated space and a ext4 partition which i used to backup my linux system

410474
stdout	stderr
in other words everything that do_something do_something_else and wrapper send to stdout and stderr i want in one log file that shows the daily run of this script so i can grep for errors

410495
filesystems	hfs
the filesystems type hfsplus can be used by linux systems if the appropriate hfs filesystems tools and filesystems support kernel modules are available

410495
filesystems	ntfs
regarding the choice of filesystems type the external disk probably had originally a fat32 or ntfs filesystems fat32 is the most universally accessible but has an maximum file size limitation of only 4 gb which can be annoying on modern systems

410495
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs would have been a good default choice for large disks in a windows ecosystem and most modern linux distributions can access ntfs filesystems fairly easily

410507
gentoo	debian
debian and gentoo make this really easy however debian has tools for the initial setup and can reliably run updates in a chroot gentoo is just trivial to do stuff like this with and doesn t even need a chroot for updates because you can point emerge at an arbitrary directory to treat as a root directory

410516
packets	multicast
so that kernel was filtering out all the multicast packets from reaching user space

410516
packets	multicast
hence smcroute was not able to route the multicast packets

i reinstalled linux parrot security 3.9 kernel version 4.14.0 86_64 over an installation of kali 2017.3 ironically same kernel version of debian right now 4.14.0 86_64

410551
debian	linux
would it be a good idea to install debian linux into it and how fast that would be considering the processor is not up-to-date

410558
rpm	dnf
discord doesn t provide a fedora package rpm that would normally be managed by dnf

410585
centos	linux

the search criteria is that from a given directory i am in when connected from the server i want to search all sub directory from that folder and look for files and apply a search criteria which looks for the following strings

410597
freebsd	debian
i ordered a vps with debian 9 stretch from ovh but they don t support freebsd so they told me to use kvm to install freebsd but for some reason i m failing at mounting the iso file

410599
freebsd	linux
when you want a portable bash csh perl whatever script which runs under most linux distributions and freebsd you should use #

at some point i needed to upgrade kernel versioning to 4.4 and add some modules support so i ve built a new kernel from vanilla sources using make rpm method

410688
cpu	processors
processors intel core i5-2467m cpu 1.60ghz x 2

410696
freebsd	debian
but from what you have been doing with virt-install it looks like you try to use the debian 9 to act as hypervisor host for a freebsd guest

410696
freebsd	debian
you should not try to mount the iso image from within debian 9 as this will not help you boot into freebsd

some gnu linux distributions for example ubuntu provide amd64+mac isos in addition to the regular amd64 isos

410767
freebsd	solaris
the freebsd initial commit mentions solaris was already doing it at that time

zsh	tcsh
shells like tcsh or zsh will add an extra prompt when trying to call rm with a wildcard tcsh not by default

410794
for-loop	arrays
finally at end after each line has been processed we use a for-loop to print out the value of each element inside arrays a which in our case is the count number for each unique index

starttls	smtps
these commands give me information about whether their ports are properly encrypted if they have null ciphers if ports 143 587 25 are running starttls when they should if the ports are unfiltered if the imap and smtps certificates match and if our connection is outright rejected. that s about it

410948
freebsd	linux
your client machine or router is linux freebsd or macos

410967
bash	zsh
in bash ksh93 and zsh you can use the q escape for the printf builtin

410971
versioning	upgrade
the exact kernel versioning may change over time due to upgrade but basically the currently running pae kernel need to be replaced with a kernel without pae

410972
folder	directory
inside there are per-user folder that are readable by any user and a shared directory that is readable and writeable by any user

410977
daemons	systemd
when this command is checked and confirmed to works well you can add daemons -fnt params and autostart it with systemd

410977
udp	rtp	udp	tcp
so if you need finite number of tcp ports and not using some specific sip-phone or rtp application with udp port-range demands reverse tunneling should be enough for most situations

411004
versioning	upgrade
you can either upgrade you system to a more recent versioning of centos recommended for security updates etc.. or change your current repos urls from to

411006

jobs	cron
i want to schedule jobs with at but i m not sure what happens if the computer is suspended at the specified time will the command be executed as soon as the computer wakes up again like with anacron or will it not be executed at all like with cron

411036
sudo	passwd
in my case sudo is always passwd protected without exception and i want keep it this way .

in all cases it runs daily weekly and monthly cron jobs in

411062
sudo	passwd
the y from yes is be passed into command and should go into sudo and sudo shall ask for passwd normally

stdout	stderr
i tried adding -fprintf dev stderr p n to the find command but now it looks like stdout is gone because no grep results are printed

debian	mint	debian	linux
also sometimes i work on a debian system and other times on linux mint

411136
tunnel	vpn
define a host route via 192.168.1.1 to the public ip of the vpn server and point the default route to the remote end of the tunnel 192.168.99.2

411136
tunnel	vpn
based on this classification you can then use an alternate routing table for routing which for example defines a default route through your vpn tunnel

411158
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
anyway just to throw this out there there are zero references to chown chmod or chgrp in my plugin code

411161
filesystems	ntfs
that statement was added because of specific build issue on ntfs exact reason was not diagnosed but two candidates were problem with the ntfs max path length and can t make symlinks on the ntfs partition both are examples of difference in filesystems semantics unix vs

411170
stdout	stderr
or you d have to redirect the stdout and stderr of the command with some ipc mechanism would probably have to be a pseudo-tty pair so as to minimise the impact on the command behaviour and insert the output when something is receivedâ¹

411191
pthreads	fork
pthreads mandates certain behaviours when the handle can be accessed from both processes after a fork but explicitly notes that

411191
lseek	fseek
if any previous active handle has been used by a function that explicitly changed the file offset except as required above for the first handle the application shall perform an lseek or fseek as appropriate to the type of handle to an appropriate location

411192
cpu	irq
for the other part of your question irq interruptrequest is a type of message sent to the cpu to get its attention and both irq and pci scanning is a way to find out the above said components for acpi to function

411193
post	get
most of the other post with similar issues have had this issue be due to having incorrect file directory permissions but i don t think this is the exact problem because when i do ls -ld etc ls -l etc sudoers i get

411200
sudoers	visudo
ps i find weird is that your sudoers file has write permissions remember you should only edit the sudoers file with visudo

411250
disk	ram
if you have modern development box with 12+gb ram and 8tb disk space you might run 5-10 test environments at the same time and store 800 snapshots which is plenty

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	xfce	gnome
so - after seeing this problem in linux mint 18.2 xfce ubuntu-gnome 17.04 if i m not mistaken kde-neon ubuntu-16.04-based i think and in solus gnome and budgie a rolling release i can confirm that ubuntu 16.04 proper ubuntu desktop aka unity is not affected by this

do note that on debian ubuntu you currently late 2017 need the kernel firmware from the testing repo not the stable one since the patches for the broadcom sdio devices have only been added recently

411315
put	get
-- get a list of all directory s on the source hard drive and put into a text file

411345
ubuntu	debian
after several failed attempts to install a 64 bit version of ubuntu i used a 64bit version of debian and just changed the repos to point to

411378
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
shells where that has been fix are zsh csh tcsh and recent versions of fish well in effect it was ok in earlier versions of unix but was broken in the bourne shell in the late 70s and then fixed again in some shells

elasticsearch	kibana
take a look at the configured data directories in the respective files under etc elasticsearch logstash and kibana

411410
debian	linux
i m new in linux freshly installed a debian jessie 8 os and need to work with mysql

411416
free	malloc
the kernel does not know anything about malloc or free these are library functions in libc

411416
free	malloc
a call to malloc does not necessarily result in a call to sbrk or mmap depending on how libc implements dynamic memory allocation to expand the mappings if a call to malloc can be satisfied by reusing previously free memory areas

411434
binutils	bfd
binutils-2.29 configure --help and readme in binutils-2.29 binutils-2.29 binutils and binutils-2.29 bfd

411448
uefi	multiboot
i am trying to do multiboot using uefi

411469
filesystems	btrfs
i say about because it is a btrfs filesystems but i m no where close to being out of space.

411482
debian	linux
i am using debian gnu linux 8 jessie and lxde

411508
systemctl	cgroups
no systemd which systemctl is a part of is a service manager designed specifically for linux and uses interfaces and constructs specific to it such as cgroups

411519

ksh zsh bash

411526
srt	subtitle
but now i want to only remove pgs subtitle and keep all srt files no matter the language

411531
centos	linux
linux distro centos release 6.9 final

411551

but in a split tunnel configuration instead of doing that by default the vpn client offers a socks proxy for specific applications

411555
srt	subtitle
to select only srt subtitle using sed

411561
ubuntu	linux
i m not even close to a linux expert but i ve recently moved from win7 to ubuntu because my win7 crashed and i needed an easy and ready to go solution and only had a live ubuntu 13.04 available

411595
dpkg	apt
install this package with dpkg -i or add to a local apt repository etc reload your keymap and you re in business

411617
debian	linux
i have video 4 linux 2 v4l2 installed and running default kernel comes with debian stretch and updated to the latest through apt

411625
installation	upgrade
these are of course not the newest but we would update them immediately after installation with the usual apt-get upgrade run from a sudo d script

411631
filesystems	btrfs
if you use btrfs raid-5 6 the question isn t will my filesystems die

411631
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is claimed to be production by the authors and it is used as such by a few people but please remember that redhat has removed btrfs from their future releases and made xfs their default filesystems

411634
subshell	ifs
which temporarily overrides ifs to be a comma all in a subshell so that s2 sees the output of s1 broken up by commas

411634
subshell	ifs
the subshell is a short-hand way to change ifs without saving the previous value or resetting it

411634
subshell	ifs
or run the ifs bits in a subshell as before

411643
versioning	upgrade
my problem was that i had foolishly manually installed python 3.5 system-wide before the upgrade to stretch and that versioning of python was masking the default stretch python 3 install

411658
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu came off it the day i got it and it s been an arch linux machine since

411674

411688
bash	zsh
i was looking at the fzf keybindings for bash and zsh

411688
bash	zsh
one difference between the bash and zsh script is that the bash one further pipes the output of but zsh just captures it inside an array

411688
bash	zsh
now i m mostly wondering why 2 has a problem for zsh but not for bash and why 4 and 5 fixes the problem for zsh

411711
versioning	upgrade
the only real reason to upgrade to a newer versioning of php is for the language features or if an application needs it but you miss out on security or other distro-specific patches this way

411723
centos	linux
we were following how to install or upgrade to php 7 on centos 7 linux server

411735
centos	linux
on centos 6.9 linux kernel 2.6.32 it takes about 10â minutes

411735
centos	linux
on centos 7.2 linux kernel 3.10.0 it takes about 16â minutes

411737
rpm	yum
though i don t quite see from the link you give that rpm -e remi-release or yum remove remi-release shouldn t work

411740
ubuntu	linux
same spec file works on ubuntu and other linux distributions

411741
versioning	upgrade
-u upgrade mypackage to this versioning

411788
sudo	passwd
at my then level of understanding it seemed that having the same passwd for sudo and my user account was less strong than having different ones

411788
ubuntu	mint
i now understand that root is disabled by default on ubuntu mint intentionally

411788
sudo	passwd
now when i sudo from the terminal it requires the root passwd

411788
sudo	passwd
after a bit of searching around the following magic was suggested sudo passwd -dl root which is supposed to disable the root account

411788
sudo	passwd
will that leave me able to sudo with my main account passwd

411790
sudo	passwd
sudo by default asks for the calling user s passwd but it can be configured to ask for either the passwd if root or the target user which is also usually root

411790
sudo	passwd
if that was what sudo was configured to do it means you have a passwd set for root and the passwd can still be used to log in as root or change to root using su not sudo

411790
sudo	passwd
to disable lock the passwd you d need to use that sudo passwd -dl root

411791
ubuntu	linux
os linux 4.4.0-104-generic #127-ubuntu | ubuntu gnome 16.04.3 lts 64-bit

411803
folder	directory
the file ftd2xx.h exists in the parent directory and before trying the loopback directory the make has entered and exited other folder with the same command includind this file and no error occured

411803
debian	mint
i ve tried this on two different linux-64 distributions debian and mint and the error is the same

411804
ubuntu	linux
don t begin with van smoorenburg rc if you are doing new stuff on ubuntu linux

411804
ubuntu	debian
your rc script does not properly respond to the various subcommands that such scripts are called with for starters or source the debian ubuntu standard functions library

411804
ubuntu	linux
on the principle of not beginning with stuff that is more than a decade out of date on ubuntu linux in the first place throw this away

411813
stdout	stderr
i m running a simple rsync script where i log stdout and stderr to two different files rsync_stdout.log and rsync_stderr.log

411816
google-chrome	firefox
but firefox and google-chrome would not be able to act as desktop_user

411823
ubuntu	debian	filesystems	btrfs
sys fs btrfs does t list all btrfs filesystems e.g not mounted one tested on debian ubuntu 4.14.0-1 4.10.0-42

411830
spaces	linefeed
unix used a single character linefeed from the beginning to save spaces and standardize to a canonical end-of-line using two characters was inefficient and ambiguous

411873
filesystems	btrfs
consider in future setting up the filesystems in a way that allows o 1 or similar accounting of disk size using smaller partitions or using things like btrfs subvolumes which also have o 1 accounting

411886
filesystems	xfs
starting with fedoraâ 22 xfs is the default and recommended filesystems on fedora server

411894
cifs	smb
also if you re planning on sharing out a cifs smb share you can do it directly via the zfs commands

411899
gentoo	linux
if your goal is to learn how linux works and build it from the ground up i would suggest reading linux from scratch or getting started by installing gentoo

411899
gentoo	linux
the gentoo project is a distribution aimed at building live from source linux systems where you get to fully configure every piece of software you bring into the system

411899
gentoo	linux
it is a package-based linux distro where they basically started with the linux from scratch principles then compiled a large collection of software with minimal options as you might do with gentoo and then provide these packages for you to download with a package manager

411901
unix	bsd
another example this time from bsd a unix os

411926
filesystems	btrfs
that may not have been the case in the very distant past but it would be way before fedora 25. this is also the case with other popular filesystems on linux such as ext4 zfs btrfs and tmpfs

411949
sudo	passwd
if your sudo user passwd is disabled you can edit the etc passwd directly find the line where your user is and change the shell path into bin bash

411950
ubuntu	debian
the 2nd machine must have old debian etch release v4 the 1st and 3rd machines have ubuntu 16

411986
stdout	stderr
â¹ unless read is configured to implement a line editor by itself like with read -e in bash or by setting the emacs gmacs or vi option in ksh93 and stdin is a terminal device but then read would output the echo on stderr not stdout

411991
versioning	upgrade
the list of upgrade packages if any with the previously installed versioning and the versioning upgrade to

411991
versioning	upgrade
you could parse that to determine changes made in the last 48 hours and for upgrade use the versioning information to extract the relevant portions of the changelogs and news

411997
ubuntu	debian
is there jitsi sip-client for ubuntu or debian which has command-line interface

412001
disk	ram
on linux how can a ram disk be created and attached without being mounted

412001
disk	ram
moreover how can the device name like dev sdb assigned to the ram disk be found

412001
disk	ram
finally how can the ram disk which is not mounted be detached

412001
disk	ram
i would like to create and attach a ram disk but i do not want to mount it

412001
disk	ram
on mac os x the following command creates and attaches a 100mib ram disk without mounting it

412001
disk	ram
finally on mac os x to detach the ram disk no matter whether it has been mounted the following command as well as the gui application disk utility works

412001
disk	ram
one of the reasons that i do not want the ram disk to be mounted is that i want to run some experiments on the dd command reading and writing directly on a disk or device bypassing the filesystem

412001
disk	ram
on linux the following mount command creates attaches and mounts a 100mib ram disk

412001
disk	ram
by the way for those who want to know how to mount in addition to creating and attaching a ram disk on mac os x here is the command

412006
disk	ram
when files are read from disk the backing store the data is cached in ram

412056
freebsd	linux
if you are new to freebsd but previously have been used to working on a gnu sytem linux there are some subtle but important differences

412062
debian	linux
since about a year ago linux debian has been spamming me with messages like the following

412065
ubuntu	opensuse
the local os is ubuntu 16 and the server is opensuse

412079
gentoo	ubuntu
some versions of readlink return a path with a trailing slash for a symlink which is refused by find tested with ubuntu not reproducible on gentoo

412116
stdout	stderr
as far as vs they both act to direct stderr to the same place that stdout is being directed to

412116
stdout	stderr
compare this to the second version where the combined stdout and stderr overwrite the log file and do not get displayed on your screen terminal

412118
folder	directory
have folder named debug and would like to move contents to parent directory

412128
mouse	keyboard
at some point during my quick and maybe somewhat tortured typing the window stops responding to any keyboard and mouse input

412137
debian	mint	debian	linux
i recently grabbed a live iso image of a desktop distribution linux mint in this particular case but i ve seen it on debian kali and others and there is this madness

412144
mouse	keyboard
but gnome s keyboard shortcut settings don t let me bind the scroll wheel and xbindkeys doesn t let me bind any mouse button

412163
debian	linux
i am working on the integration of linux debian 8 server in a active directory windows server 2012r2 domain

412168
stdout	stderr
added stderr redirection to stdout to capture any error that may be

412177
centos	linux
software collections scl are used on red hat enterprise linux and centos to provide updated versions of common programs

412206
disk	ram
so you re setting it to the same size as your ram primarily to support suspend to disk

412217
ubuntu	linux
i have a bit of experience with linux mainly with ubuntu

412239
vim	emacs
after all of the things that people say about exiting emacs exiting vim and exiting vi it is very amusing to see the solution to exiting nano presented as being to restart the entire virtual machine

412255
ubuntu	centos
i ve tried to found document with the keyword centos 7 live-usb save settings but i can found nothing only thing i found is with the same case but on ubuntu you can use persistence mode even i don t know what is it but can t figure or found documents that tells you how to do it on centos 7

412312
debian	linux
i have a problem with amd64 debian gnu linux 9.3 stretch virtualbox vm

412320
pull	push
git pull or git push where the remote is an ssh repository address fails

412321
ubuntu	centos
i ve noticed this in ubuntu sles and centos i think

412353
bash	zsh
also note that even with scalar variables whether the variable ends up being exported within the function that is passed to commands being executed varies from shell to shell it is in bash yash mksh zsh but not in ksh ash

412354
folder	directory
only recently delving into permissions and acls to this depth i understood that i needed to set the gid and some default acls for this folder to ensure that my nagios user was able to write to this directory and that my alert user could read and write to files created here

412365
debian	linux
we have a linux server with debian stretch installed

412392
spaces	delimiter
in file2 with spaces as a delimiter then col 1 brown and col2 149 456 foo

i should also note that i am on funtoo gentoo linux with a squashfs root backed by an ext4 overlayfs

412470
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
the timestamp_timeout parameter in the sudoers file affects how often you must enter your passwd when using sudo

412480
filesystems	btrfs
how to select a non-default zstd compression level to re-compress existing btrfs filesystems

412480
filesystems	btrfs
note btrfs filesystems defragment on snapshots might result in much larger disk space consumption

412491
sudo	chgrp
sudo chgrp adminaccess home user1 data

412499
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu apt with acquire http proxy

412499
kerberos	ntlm
however this only works with ntlm where i need kerberos

412511
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
in some distributions traceroute use udp you can give it -i so it will use icmp or -t for tcp

412512
hash	salt
this method would generate sha-512 hash after prompting for the password and would use a random salt

412516
for-loop	arrays
i have managed to create a for-loop printing them but when i try to create the arrays it just contains the last lo interface but not the other

412557
ubuntu	linux
consider the same system as there ubuntu linux server lts version 16 with bespoke systems comprising compiled binaries running as systemd services without any end user or indeed administrator login

412558
ubuntu	debian
over a decade ago the debian and ubuntu communities worked hard to eliminate the dependencies of various parts of the operating system upon extensions provided by the bourne again shell even in its posix mode

412558
bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash	ash	tcsh
one removes packages such as ash bash posh mksh pdksh tcsh dash and so forth

412558
ubuntu	debian
thanks to the work of the debian and ubuntu people there are now scripts that explicitly declare #

412581
ubuntu	linux	filesystems	ntfs
to mount ntfs filesystems in linux you need ntfs-3g driver which usually comes inbuilt with ubuntu

412592
ubuntu	centos
on ubuntu and centos systems i d use ps aux instead of ps alone

412613
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux and maybe other flavors of linux the reset command actually resets the terminal so that you can t scroll up or see previously input commands by scrolling

412631
spaces	delimiter
bash will construct an array from any white-space delimiter spaces tabs newlines list you give it

412635
ubuntu	linux
then install a linux os like ubuntu into a new vm

412678
pull	push
i have setup a private registry in docker accessible thru a domain â œmakdom.ddns.netâ i can login push and pull images locally no problem even from slave kubes node i can do this thing

412688

this will loop through every spaces delimiter string in myfile

412733
centos	linux
i launched rstudio using fastx on rivanna cluster centos linux release 7.3.1611 core

412738
fish	zsh
rc es and fish do that implicitly zsh s is actually inspired from rc s

for-loop	arrays
i would like to know how can i change between arrays inside a for-loop in scripting

412767
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
perf is a performance analyzing tool included in the kernel under tools perf and often available to install as a separate package perf in centos and linux-tools on debian ubuntu

412773
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r -v u u . profile1

412773
chown	chmod
also dolphin file manager is able to do read writes without having to do any chown or chmod so i don t understand why thunderbird is having issues

412775
vpn	lan
i need to run a tor relay outside my vpn traffic which is used for all packet going outside my lan

412800
mouse	keyboard
kde have clicking problem sometime i can click only items on taskbar and can t click on program window like in firefox but i can navigate with keyboard without any problem sometimes i can only click inside program window and can t click on taskbar funny thing is that when i logout and click on several buttons on login screen and login to kde then everything is back to normal also i noticed that this problem occurs after kde popup notifications like new updates available or mouse low on energy

412828
xen	raid
for hp raid controllers and disks on some virtual machines may show up as xen or kvm virtio drives

412828
disk	ram
other than that the most common ones are probably ram disk

412852
gentoo	linux
i got a new gentoo linux install running great on my new alienware 13 r3 laptop

412870
for-loop	arrays
printing the elements in reverse order without reversing the arrays is just a for-loop counting down from the last element to zero. this is a standard swap first and last algorithm

412884
versioning	upgrade
some other people in the comments suggested that i upgrade to a newer ubuntu versioning which i tried also sudo do-release-upgrade but at the end it says

412885
mouse	keyboard
every once in a while the keyboard freezes for a bit but the mouse still works fine

412885

the keyboard and mouse are connected to the computer via a single wireless dongle

412904
centos	linux
i was trying to learn linux and a guide told me to use virtual box and centos since centos is similar to red hat

412936
sudo	passwd
and when i use sudo passwd user1 simple passwd is applied

412945
bash	zsh
would work with all the bourne-like shells with array support ksh zsh bash yash

412960
sudo	passwd
note that the command you re running with sudo is usr bin passwd not usr bin passwd.shadow

412960
sudo	passwd
even without sudo each user can change their own - and only their own - passwd by using the passwd command with no parameters

412960
sudo	passwd
when it is used in this way any passwd quality checks configured in pam cannot be bypassed by typing the new passwd a third time like root or someone running passwd as root via sudo can do

412960
sudo	passwd
if the passwd command is working normally you should only need sudo to allow user1 to change user2 s passwd like this

413004
debian	linux
hi i installed debian on my computer to dual boot but when i try to boot into linux it doesn t output anything and says input signal out of range

kubuntu	gnome
iâ ve recently installed kubuntu 17.10 am came from gnome 3

413014

that is set the filesize limit to 0 for the update of the timestamp file to fail but as long as we don t let that limit kill sudo we re still able to tell if a passwd was required or not

413015
ubuntu	linux
over my ubuntu gnu linux machine i try to build the images from my project

spaces	delimiter
the line is split in tokens using spaces as delimiter

413099
openmpi	mpich
a server has two packages of mpicc installed namely openmpi and mpich at usr local openmpi and usr local mpich respectively

413099
openmpi	mpich
is there an easy way of making usr local mpich bin mpicc as default until i complete my work and later change it back to usr local openmpi bin mpicc

413103
openmpi	mpich
a more permanent but still reversible solution is to add the mpich location to your path before the openmpi location

413106
debian-based	linux
if you are on a debian-based system install telnetd if you are on a suse redhat oracle linux system install telnet-server

i even tried to execute the command without hiding the output of either stdout or stderr and the result was the same but no error was displayed

413168
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
sh bash csh tcsh and zsh were the only possible shells installed on that workstation and i most likely ran it in bash

413188
lvm	xfs	filesystems	xfs
it is a lvm and is xfs filesystems

413188
filesystems	xfs
but the filesystems cannot be altered because it is xfs

413198
udp	tcp
check a list of tcp and udp port numbers go high and stay away from known ports

413201
sudo	passwd
perhaps i could create a small post-login script to automatically run the mount command - but i believe this would require a sudo passwd prompt or maybe i should try the autofs tool

413201
filesystems	ntfs
since this layer is persistent it exists through boot - but i can t imagine what would happen from attempting to mount an un-encrypted ntfs filesystems there

413225
freebsd	linux
one can see them indirectly in proc on linux operating systems or via the fstat command on freebsd and the like fstat -p |head -n 5

cinnamon	gnome
otherwise if using radeon rather than fglrx is more complicated would installing another desktop environment than gnome like cinnamon would make my life easier

413228
cinnamon	gnome
now i ve tried to use cinnamon but it seems that it doesn t support that driver just like gnome

413244
777	tmp
as tmp directory comes with 777 permission by default any user can read write and index through the directory and root access is not mandatory to list it s contents

413247
hash	md5
i want to find the md5 hash of the string a but running echo a | md5sum gives me another hash than what i get if i search the internet for example using duckduckgo or the first search result i found

413287
bash	zsh
assuming you have the version of split from gnu coreutils and a shell like bash ksh or zsh is available for the process substitution feature being used here you could modify the previous accepted answer to handle the header lines and sorting

413302
folder	directory
this will search for folder within that directory and run the rm -rf command on each found

413311
gentoo	linux
i want to compile a new kernel 4.14.8-gentoo-r1 on gentoo linux

413315

chars components of that int joined by dots

413325
vim	emacs
those who use vim or emacs s evil-mode appreciate the significance and convenience of having control key at your home row by hitting capslock and enter

413353
mouse	keyboard
using lsinput does not show the wifi adapter only the keyboard and mouse

413371
ubuntu	linux
attach usb to another linux machine like another kali or ubuntu vm

413396
factors	matrix
i couldn t find exact information about the coefficients of this matrix but as it is similar in practice to dolby s earlier pro-logic format which simply adds the center channel to both left and right after decreasing it by 3 db factors 0.5 in first approximation i d try the same for the back channels using the ffmpeg pan filter encode this as ac3 and see if the result is acceptable

413420
versioning	upgrade
as mentioned in the bug report you can either set in your genkernel.conf or upgrade genkernel to the unstable versioning the thread also suggests setting in your .config file but verify if that s something you want to use. you probably will want to take note that as of 4.14 linux no longer has in-kernel firmware which is why you are getting that error message genkernel was trying to make something that no longer exists

413484
dnf	yum
both apt and dnf yum the two most popular package management schemes for linux distributions to my knowledge only support system-wide installation of packages files owned by root binaries go in usr

debian	centos
i think lshw lspci hwinfo all use a pci.ids file maintained collaboratively by volunteers if you re using one of the stability-uber-alles distros debian stable or rhel or centos maybe i guess that file could be far enough out of date that those id s aren t registered yet

413506
rpm	yum
assuming the yum cache does not contain a copy is there any way to retrieve or reconstruct an rpm package after it has been installed through yum

413522
filesystems	ntfs
if the filesystems is ntfs consider using disk management on windows instead

you also need to double-quote your variables when you use them again all of them - selection height width dialog_cancel dialog_esc and any other variable you use

413592
hfs+	ntfs
hfs+ partition on the external drive mounts just fine i can browse that with no issues just for some reason mounting ntfs and exfat partitions got messed up somehow

413605

this is the init program used on debian 9 linux

413626
daemons	systemd
systemd and storage daemons for the root file systemd

413631

what i m wondering is assuming the basic setup cannot be changed i.e- no passwordless sudo etc. is there a way to combine both commands so that i can only have to enter my passwd once

413640
namenode	hdfs
and i do hadoop namenode -format again i cannot find hdfs in my shell

413645
pull	push
my initial solution was to install git on the pc but then i would have to push - then pull using github from my windows pc everytime i wanted to view a change

413649
ubuntu	linux
the system runs ubuntu linux 17.10

413658
folder	directory
ok now there is some sort of very deep directory tree on the slaves containing a lot of folder each called final slave mnt top dir1 ... final or slave mnt top dir1 final in final there are only files no folder

413658
folder	directory
on the other side on master there is the same directory tree - but without the final folder

bluetooth	usb
this package contains the binary firmware for usb wireless network and bluetooth cards supported by the ar5523 ath3k ath6kl_sdio ath6kl_usb ath9k_htc or ath10k drivers

413728
kde	gnome
the vdirsyncer docs offer a few suggestions for using pass or keyring but i got a few steps into the keyring setup process and realized i m going to have to do some troubleshooting just to get it working i m using gnome it is defaulting to a kde wallet...

413731
single-quotes	double-quotes
it is important that the expression be inside double-quotes rather than single-quotes so that the shell will expand

413749
spaces	delimiter
in the first example there are two tokens produced by a spaces delimiter echo and xyz

413749
spaces	delimiter
in the third example the semicolon is escaped so there are 4 tokens produced by a spaces delimiter echo x

413752
filesystems	ntfs
previously the filesystems had a ntfs filesystems of about 3tb and at the end an 1 tb ext4 filesystems containing my personal backups

413790
sudo	passwd
this is needed only when the root passwd is lost and there is no sudo root access or similar available

413794
spaces	delimiter
then word splitting will happen using the spaces delimiter and not the comma delimiter and so the two arguments generated and passed to echo will be hello hi world and bye

413798
ubuntu	linux
from a live linux and the other way is using gparted in ubuntu try ubuntu

413800
sudo	passwd
configure sudo with the rootpw option to require root s passwd instead of the initiator s passwd

413835
filtering	grouping
specifically it does not handle grouping id filtering as us humans expect it to

413835
filtering	grouping
it appears the iptables extensions code does not filtering the grouping id literally is user in this grouping yes or no

413835
filtering	grouping
so you decide it would be more efficient to use grouping id filtering instead --gid-owner

413853
udp	tcp
you can configure port forwarding on the host for certain tcp and udp ports

413862

my old distribution used the gtk+ icon set debian my new distribution uses the mint-x icon set linux mint

414135
versioning	upgrade
the interesting thing was it was a re-installation of the same versioning not an upgrade - v0.8.6

414158
bash	zsh
either in bash or zsh

414171
stdout	stdio
that s the default behaviour for stdio when stdout is a terminal

414171
octal	decimal
then it reads the backspace character code 0177 in octal or 127 in decimal and outputs the backspace character octal 010 decimal 8 which moves the cursor back and outputs the control sequence for clearing the end of the line

414186
typedef	struct
this is visible in the definition of struct variable the shell_var typedef and in the function make_variable_value which explicitly translates integers to strings for storage

414196
ubuntu	debian
a decade ago the debian and ubuntu people went to quite some lengths to take the bourne again shell out of the system bootstrap process wherever it was possible replacing it with the almquist shell which had far less initialization overhead in non-interactive mode which sped up bootstrap markedly

414202
folder	directory
i have a parent directory users me desktop songs in which i manually drag drop-sorted a bunch of reference material into folder

414209
filesystems	ntfs
you might need this for those ntfs volumes that are locked or corrupted for example or when mbr vbr etc are corrupt or locking the filesystems

414239

on kernel 4.9 my sys class power_supply directory is empty but on 4.14 it is populated with my logitech wireless mouse and keyboard

414299
jobs	cron
have look to sbackup sbackup is a simple solution for automatically backing up your linux desktop without having to pull out the command line and figure out cron jobs and rsync commandsâ it s easy to use especially for recent linux adopters

414322
jobs	cron
after reboot grep cron var log syslog should return a cmd line for it after the line saying cron info running reboot jobs

414341
ubuntu	linux
both are running linux suse and ubuntu

414341
redhat	fedora
none are centos redhat or fedora

namenode	hdfs
i have tried hdfs reformatting the namenode and rebooting the servers

414368
for-loop	arrays
after the for-loop will run through the index values of the a_username arrays it could have been any of the arrays and act on them to create users

414373
cifs	smb
if it s the performance of nfs you want without a more tricky setup then your only other real option is cifs smb by mounting a samba share

414398
xfs	glusterfs	filesystems	xfs
is my understanding of filesystems wrong or is there something special about the mergerfs glusterfs systems which distinguish them from ext3 or xfs

414424
sudo	passwd
as a user on the text console the command sudo passwd should allow you to set a root passwd after which you should be able to do a gui login as root

414468
apache	nginx
the most likely cause is that you have another web server already listening on port 80 - perhaps apache or an older version of nginx

414468
apache	nginx
another alternative would be to configure nginx or apache to listen on a different port

414476
postfix	dovecot
i have installed postfix and dovecot mail server

414477
stdout	stderr
usually you d of course have 0 stdin 1 stdout and 2 stderr pointing to something sensible or dev null if you re a daemon

is usually what i use when i want to copy the contents of a directory to another folder

414534
bash	zsh
when i try to execute this command in bash or zsh it works as expected

414538
cpu	processors
processors intel core i5-2520m cpu 2.50ghz x 2

414552
ubuntu	mint
this guide might also work for an ubuntu install but in meantime mint seems to have no drawbacks as compared to ubuntu

414571
portrait	landscape	width	height
1920 is the width in landscape mode so becomes the height in portrait mode

414571
portrait	landscape
notice the starting x positions are multiples of 1920 -- you d expect that in landscape mode but not in portrait where the widths are smaller

414581
for-loop	loops
the top loops was the one i got from the example i saw online and the second for-loop is my own code from another example i saw

414601

ubuntu	debian
one computer has a wifi connection it s a nvidia jetson tx1 running ubuntu 16.04 the other one let s call it embedded only has ethernet and is running debian stretch 9.2.0

414646
bash	zsh
traditionally shells like bash csh and zsh are located in bin - because a shell is needed even in single user mode or other times when usr may be unmounted usr is often on a separate partition and may even be mounted through the network - thus not readily available in singe user mode

414653
width	height
but there are some windows which have minimum width and minimum height defined and this is bad

414653
width	height
i use sheltile which is great except that it fails to set proper height and width on a small resolution monitor because minimum width and height are set

414653
width	height
is there a way to disable all window s minimum width height restrictions in gnome 3.22

414654
debian	mint	debian	linux
i had linux mint on dualboot but i was having problems with the audio so i deleted the partition using disk manager on windows 10 and was going to install debian but when i try to boot debian from the usb it goes to grub and i am unable to get past this

414669
folder	directory
i m looking for a more efficient way to check what directory and files exist midway through typing the path for a cp or mv command without having to cd to the folder and running ls then returning to my cp or mv command

414674
post	get
you can also get some info from using tty or who w edit i see it s now list above in another post

414680
hex	binary
then you d need to find a way to record the input on your serial and parse it with a script to take the hex bytes and output them in binary into a file

414681
centos	linux
i have a hp dl360 g7 running centos linux release 7.4.1708 core and suffering from kernel panics at random intervals and to my eyes random reasons

414687
rpm	dnf
i have used both rpm dnf and apt package management systems

414687
ubuntu	debian
it may depend on command line options when compiling but answering the behavior for the apt shipped in the default debian and ubuntu repos should be enough

414693
mouse	keyboard
in tweak tools go to keyboard mouse section press the additional layout options button and expand alt win key behavior

414694
filesystems	btrfs
which software and commands are required to undelete a file on a btrfs filesystems

414705
postfix	dovecot
i have installed mail server with postfix and dovecot

414715
ready	each
referring to the manual page for systemd.service 5 specifically the section about type each service type has a different way for systemd to determine that it is ready to offer functionality to other services

414715
daemons	systemd
if its communication channels should be installed before the daemons is started up sockets set up by systemd via socket activation

414715
daemons	systemd
if it is expected that the daemons acquires a name on the d-bus bus at which point systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units

414736
ubuntu	linux
any solution on how to correctly set up the external display directly from ubuntu or any linux

414752
spaces	delimiter
with the default value of spaces tab and newline is meant to pass to cmd1 the list of files that match the list of spaces tab newline delimiter patterns output by cmd2

414770
ubuntu	debian
sysdig available in debian and ubuntu s repos with sysdig-inspect ui look very promising providing extremely fine-grained details along with cpu utilisation and rss but unfortunately the ui is unable to render them and sysdig can t filter procinfo event by process at the time of writing

414773
bash	zsh
maybe you d like something like with zsh instead of bash

414790
put	get
for example if i want to use a message queue that can simultaneously hold n messages when i use msgsnd i put a message to the queue and when i use msg rcv i get it from here and delete that message

414835
ansible	puppet
if you want to keep multiple systems in sync you re probably better off using a configuration management tool such as chef puppet ansible saltstack cfengine etc

414859
filesystems	ntfs
it s an ntfs filesystems so you must pass the right type of filesystems to the mount command

414864
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
in the past when i was fixing problems with booting ubuntu debian and mint alike creating boot partition and enabling bootable flag on it was enough

414895
versioning	upgrade
this will upgrade the packages that have newer versioning available and install any new dependencies which are required to do that

414899
gentoo	debian
preferably as a list like on one line when i last booted my debian installation one another line when i last booted my gentoo install on another line when i last booted my pclinuxos install etc

414903
ubuntu	debian
the closest and fastest way i know is configserver s csf-lfd but it s not in the repositories and if i m going to use a utility i would most prefer something in the repositories it seems i cannot create a debian ubuntu repository for it because of licensing legal reasons

414903
ubuntu	debian
thus i wonder if there is a smoother way maybe manually via ip tables maybe via some utility i could install directly from the debian ubuntu repositories that could prevent bfas besides the issue of using ssh keys

414913
freebsd	linux
i am trying to install linux compatability on my freebsd 11.0-release-p9 #0

414940
debian	linux

414983
cat	tee
cat can not both output text and pass the text along but tee is a perfect match for what you are asking for

414998
apache	nginx
i m used to the windows permissions or the directives you can specify inside apache nginx and so on so i m a bit lost with vsftpd config

415021
postfix	dovecot
i have debian 8 on it is running postfix with dovecot

415023
fish	bash
to try it from your bash shell just type fish

415044
jobs	cron
i am moving our jobs out of cron and into a 3rd party scheduling product automic

stdout	stderr
see portability of dev stdout and unix systems without dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr

415104
unix	bsd
sh cannot have always been a symbolic link as symbolic links were only introduced in 4.2 bsd 1977 and the older sixth edition of unix has

415107
fish	subshell	fish	bash	bash	subshell
in bash contrary to shells like ksh93 or fish using command substitution implies forking a subshell

415107
zsh	subshell
you can use printf -v here to avoid the subshell also available in recent versions of zsh for print and printf print -f which also supports printing into arrays

415107
bash	zsh
in bash contrary to zsh is subject to word splitting so needs quoted to avoid the dependency on

415107
bash	subshell
in ksh93 doesn t fork a subshell so is as efficient as bash s printf -v

415111
debian	linux	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
i am interested in this for all major linux flavors but especially debian based distributions and gentoo

415126
udp	tcp
dns uses both port 53 udp and tcp

415176
versioning	upgrade
the os versioning often are not that well designed maintained or not specific to the device and doing the required security update upgrade can often led to some surprises

415187
stdout	stderr
that says point new fd at the place stderr points to point stderr where stdout points point stdout to where stderr originally pointed ...easy right

415187
stdout	stderr
or in other words now the stderr from cmd will go through the pipe like stdout while the original stdout has been redirected to stderr

415187
stdout	stderr
update though you accepted the answer above your wishlist included the ability to manipulate stdout and stderr simultaneously

415187
stdout	stderr
a simple swapping of stdout stderr won t do anything useful

415202
ubuntu	linux
i guess there is a reason why it is not packaged in the ubuntu and arch linux repositories

415217
mediainfo	mkv
as for the bitrate i tried with a sample mkv which contains aac audio but neither mediainfo nor mkvinfo give any bitrate purely for audio in the first place

415246
folder	directory
so far i have created a directory fonts and unzip oregon fonts into this folder

415246
folder	directory
i have also created a new folder oregon in this fonts directory

415249
folder	directory
create a folder in your home directory called .fonts

415255
filesystems	xfs
perhaps grml and vmware converter are creating a xfs filesystems or other filesystems type that includes some newer features that cannot be handled by the squeeze kernel

415274
icmp	tcp
you re saying that the .1.6 client has icmp connectivity to the .100.1 vm but cannot send a tcp syn port 80 packet there

415302
versioning	upgrade
the reason you are seeing a negative upgrade size is that due to some changes in either upstream or in packaging one or more of the packages to be upgrade is of a smaller size than the currently installed versioning s

415323
disk	ram
if the ram disk driver is compiled as a kernel module you can modify the number and size of devices by using module parameters

415323
disk	ram
you could create a partition table on them but there are no standard device numbers allocated for ram disk partitions

415323
disk	ram
should you need a partitioned ram disk you could use the kpartx command to easily work around this the resulting partition devices for dev ramx would typically be named like dev mapper ramxpy

415333
stdout	stderr
to convert stderr to uppercase without changing where stdout and stderr go to

415333
stdout	stderr
note that now that stderr goes through a pipe that can affect the relative order of stdout and stderr messages as the stderr messages are now being delayed

415333
stdout	stderr
can i configure my shell to print stderr and stdout in different colors

415344
folder	directory
while the current directory is your current folder lets the shell do the wildcard expansion and therefore only adds matching files in the current directory

415350
tunnel	vpn
of the network-manager only shows the point-to-point tunnel protocol pptp although strongswan vpn is installed

415356
bash	zsh
in another case you could you could use the string substitution expansion in bash or zsh to add a suffix to each positional parameter but it s rather difficult to get that to work with a glob

415376
geany	gedit
for example for geany and gedit

415376
geany	gedit
how do i change the color of the spell checker squiggly red line for gtk applications or specifically for geany and gedit

415381
udp	tcp
this tells you that the ntp protocol uses port 123 in both tcp and udp

415420
bash	zsh
however the annoying part is that all my zsh or bash history is gone as well

415420
bash	zsh
solutions for both bash and zsh are welcome

415426
bash	zsh
you can save your bash history with this command i am not familiar with zsh

415430
mp4	h.264
what route can i follow to go from png frames to a web-friendly video file that i believe is a h.264 mpeg-4 mp4 that gives me the ability to tune compression

415438
folder	dir
you could also change dir to the folder be for running the code

415458
debian	linux
that s the one typically found on gnu systems like debian linux or kfreebsd kernels cygwin or fedora

415473
put	get
make sure you don t put the archive in any folder you are including or you ll get some recursion a partial backup also included in the backup itself

415487
ubuntu	linux
i downloaded ubuntu s linux 4.4 patchset from the arch wiki for snapd it downloaded as a tar ball and after extracting it i go a directory name linux_4.4.0-21.37.diff with a files inside named data debugfs-aufs namespace.txt and sysfs-aufs according to the arch wiki page for snapd the patch is required for the reason shown below

415487
ubuntu	linux
full confinement relies on an apparmor enabled kernel with ubuntu s linux 4.4 patchset applied and a related profile for the snap

does this mean it s the xfs filesystems

415567
filesystems	xfs
xfs filesystems can be on-line extended but not reduced

415567
lvm	xfs	filesystems	xfs
to on-line extend the root filesystems or any xfs filesystems located on a lvm logical volume the procedure is

since only joey has access to the directory no one else can create or delete files in that folder

415601
ubuntu	linux
after i installed ubuntu 17.04 32 bit in my intel 2.4ghz and ati rv 350 video board the monitor goes black every 3 to 4 mints i have not experienced such action before on the same computer with ubuntu 16.4 nor with kali linux

415606
dnf	yum
if it is fedora yum and dnf are usually present with preference to the latter one

415615
daemons	systemd
i have a simple python snippet managed by a systemd service which logs to the rsys l ogd daemons hellip

centos	linux
i m new to linux and i want to connect from my terminal to centos that i installed in virtualbox but it take too long and i have to stop it

415683
folder	directory
i saw variations of this question posted mostly attempting to modify different folder and the above command was the recommendation to alleviate the issue but is the proc directory different

415684
sudo	passwd
i hope that you can help me to build a script to do that thing the complexity is that i have to use sudo and send the passwd in order to connect on the remote server as root

415684

mutt	thunderbird
port 993 is related to imap which implies email clients mutt thunderbird ... connecting to their mailboxes on your server

415762
bash	zsh
if you forbid sudo su it still allows sudo env su sudo sh -c su sudo totally not su where totally not su is a symlink to bin su sudo bin ls where bin ls is a shell script that runs su sudo bash sudo zsh sudo python sudo vi followed by shell .

415809
versioning	upgrade
i understand the the configuration files for unattended-upgrades in which you determine if you want only security upgrade or other upgrade as well are located in a bit dynamic locations that could change between specific debian distros and their versioning

415810
uniq	grep
here is small script which sort s both files grep s for later dates than file1 and then counts wc -l if there are more than 1 uniq line should be only 1 which comes from file1

415853
fish	bash
i think you are using fish instead of bash in this older installation

415853
fish	bash
then you can change your default shell in etc passwd from bash to fish

415862
disk	ram
hence in my opinion your init ram disk is too big

415862
disk	ram
with this i ve reached 0.9s to from grub to sysv init on hp envy 14 amd apu on 1.8ghz if you are interested in optimizing your process you can find a great guide to minimizing the kernel and the init ram disk size here

415867
bash	tcsh
however i was unable to find any details in tcsh documentation on how to do the same thing as in bash if the command in postcmd fails and returns non-zero rc don t execute the command typed at the prompt

415889
put	get
if i just put a wrong password without a i just get a authentication failed which i can understand

415940
udp	tcp
the simplest command is to list out all connections is the ss | less but to view only tcp or udp or unix connections use the -t that is

415945
hash	md5
also possible in linux is an md5 based hash which starts with a 1 and is half way in between in length

415946
folder	directory
can i make shortcut like in win which will be visible in folder from almost every program cli like mc and gui - any open file dialog that will move me to specific directory not related to location of shortcut

415960
freebsd	linux
connecting via ssh from another freebsd or linux machine would also use that default .bash_profile

415971
debian	linux
i have several machines at home running debian linux and i ve been wanting to make a partial mirror of the packaging system

415975
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
you can do this by putting a proxy in between your clients and the mirror servers and there is a well a few but latest is proxy webserver combo all in one apt-cacher-ng that you can point your local debian ubuntu mint etc machines at

415983
mouse	keyboard
i like using menu s as long as i used mouse and keyboard

415990
bash	zsh
is there a parameter substitution than can expand to nothing in bash zsh or the like

415996
rsa	dsa
the genpkey command can create other types of private keys - dsa dh ec and maybe gost - whereas the genrsa as it s name implies only generates rsa keys

416014
bash	zsh
with some printf implementations including gnu printf and the printf builtin of ksh93 zsh bash and lksh but not dash nor yash on gnu systems and assuming your system has a french of france or canada at least or swedish or slovenian or macedonian or kyrgyz locale and a few more that is those that have space as the thousand separator

416020
dns	spf
so even if you registered ilmn-qm.bi.technion.ac.il to public dns it would probably fail a spf check

416039
sudo	passwd
number of minutes that can elapse before sudo will ask for a passwd again

416063
dpkg	apt
i am trying to remove both packages and reinstall from scratch only ntp but for every cleanup of openntpd using apt and the related dpkg i get the same error

416072
ubuntu	linux
is there a build your own ubuntu linux wizard

416095
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and other distros that can use the debian installer can work with approach 2 or approach 3

416095
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
for the second approach yuu have to do an expert mode text-based install and there s a point during the install where you can select an option that will pull up aptitude a nice ncurses-based text ui for apt and dpkg to manually specify what packages to install

416106
filtering	grouping
second it doesn t use grp.getgrnam but fetches all grouping and does its own filtering

416110
bash	zsh
we need sed to get an actual newline to start and terminate the i command so i used the ansi-c quoting to make one supported by ksh zsh bash

416114
tail	zcat
however on some cpus skylake zcat | tail doesn t ramp the cpu up to full clock speed

416114
tail	zcat
tl dr zcat | tail -c is cpu bound even on a fast cpu unless you have very slow disks

416142
ubuntu	debian
if the package would be accepted by the community anyone who does sudo apt-get install example could install it from any debian distro whether debian ubuntu or anything else

416155
zsh	tcsh
tcsh zsh

416155
zsh	tcsh
tcsh and zsh prompt expansions also have m for the machine name up to the first

416169
versioning	upgrade
i understand that sudo apt-get update only updates the package list whereas sudo apt-get upgrade will install the newer versioning of the package

416175
versioning	upgrade
upgrade upgrade all installed packages to the latest versioning listed in the package indexes available locally following the pin priorities this might fail for the same reason as install

416175
versioning	upgrade
if you install a package with out-dated indexes then update and upgrade youâ ll end up with the same installed versioning as youâ d get by updating before you install as long as the older versioning is still available in the repositories

416203
ubuntu	debian
if ubuntu uses the same naming scheme as debian the firmware package name should be firmware-brcm80211

416223
bash	zsh
bash ksh and zsh support arrays and associative arrays they re made just for indexing

416238
bash	zsh
posix is ambiguous about exactly what should happen in that case and bash and zsh made different choices there

416238
bash	zsh
bash invokes the script using itself while zsh uses sh whatever that happens to be

416239
put	get
when a program is started with the syscalls they don t really get to know the name of the binary file containing the program but instead the calling process is free to put whatever it wants in there

416241
bash	zsh
add this line to your script to detect if any bash ksh or zsh version is running it

416255
filesystems	btrfs
i ve got a server with a four-disk btrfs filesystems the data is spanned with the btrfs raid0 mode

416255
filesystems	btrfs
many months ago i had to grow the btrfs filesystems and added a new disk encrypted it saved the bootkey etc

416255
filesystems	btrfs
is there any chance that the boot key file contained in my now 25 missing btrfs filesystems could be located on one of the three disks i still have access to

416289
freebsd	centos
i wrote a bash-script in centos but now i have an issue with this script in freebsd

416289
freebsd	linux
so the problem is in difference between read function in linux and read function in freebsd

416313
folder	directory
the google backup and sync client doesn t offer a way to do this directly so i thought to have the workspace outside of google drive and use a cron job or similar that would run relatively frequently to copy the workspace into a directory in my google drive folder excluding build directory

416338
versioning	upgrade
if you re ready to upgrade to the new system versioning then do that

416340
uniq	grep
using only perl no need for grep cut sort or uniq

416368
cifs	smb
on rhel 5.9 the cifs client module is definitely using smb protocol version 1.0 by default

416371
ubuntu	centos
it came from dell with ubuntu installed but i ve wiped this out and installed centos 7.4

416371
mouse	keyboard
i ve notice that sometimes both my keyboard and mouse stops emitting - light like the usb stopped providing energy but the leds of the pc itself are still on with the cpu and gpu fan on

416371
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse are emitting lights but the desktop xfce4 still not responds

416371
google-chrome	firefox
one other thing is that this happens almost always when i get idle while browsing firefox quantum or google-chrome or using android studio

416432
installation	upgrade
i recently upgrade my postgresql installation and intended to run the command

416433
chown	passwd
you can get back with chown commands on directories with informations you know from usernames from etc passwd their group from etc groups

416461
ubuntu	debian
i am not familiar with debian based systems or ubuntu so it could be the same commands with a similar package

416461
centos	linux
centos 7 how to use the linux auditing system

416466
put	get
syncing twice made it much less likely that you d have to get out the bit tweezers to put your filesystem back together so it became part of the ritual

416490
pull	push
scp is a very nice tool using ssh to copy files in both a pull and push way depending your situation

416491
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
an any procedure of how can i fix the spectre and meltdown issues on ubuntu and redhat linux 6 centos

416493
filesystems	fat
just a note on the previous answers -- if you find rsync repeatedly reporting the same file s as changed it is most likely a timestamp issue -- some filesystems most notably fat store timestamps with less precision so rsync may fail to set the same timestamp if syncing between different filesystems

416498
putty	winscp
open 2 putty sessions when i am trying to open 3rd session from the filezilla winscp connection disconnected automatically working fine with ssh user

416498
putty	winscp
-is there any difference in putty client and winscp filezilla

416509
bluetooth	usb
the bluetooth function is exposed via an usb device

416514
jobs	cron
but as has been mentioned before itâ s an awful lot easier to manage cron jobs by manipulating files in etc cron.daily etc cron.d etc

416519
folder	directory
you can simply look for a folder named in the top directory of the device or something similar

416556
libc	ldd
bin bash depends of course on libc ld-linux libdl etc. you can use ldd bin bash to see which libraries it requires

416583
spaces	delimiter
the shell parses that line in its own syntax where spaces is a word delimiter and calls cmd1 with cmd arg1 and arg2 as arguments

416583
fish	zsh
it s been fixed in some other shells like rc es fish and to a lesser extent zsh

416600
ubuntu	debian
i m using a minimal debootstrapped debian on that system with a kernel that is taken from one of the official ubuntu images for that sbc

416605
xfce	gnome
i now have four options gnome gnome gnome on xorg and xfce

416654
daemons	systemd
opensuse appears to no longer install a syslog daemons by default instead relying on the systemd logging and journalctl

416709
disk	ram
3gb ram 100gb disk

416709
disk	ram
512mb ram 32gb disk

416712
versioning	upgrade
if you have upgrade mysql versioning recently and or still got mysql errors run now the upgrade operation

416713
rpm	yum
i am building a yum repository to install rpm packages

416713
rpm	yum
i am creating a folder mkdir -p yum el7 x86_64 and moving rpm file to it under same path given above

416721
gentoo	linux
i can finish the initial installation of windows 2016 server essentials with qemu and libvirt on gentoo linux

416730
unix	solaris
this can be useful on for example solaris where the default sh is not posix-compatible but a compliant sh is provided and accessible in that way because solaris is a certified unix

416762
ocaml	rust
you might also use the libcurl library perhaps from some scripting language like guile python lua perl etc ... or from a program written in a language implemented by compilers rust go c++ c ocaml ....

416773
umask	mount
indeed umask option is not part of accepted ones for ext4 fs see man mount

416782
udp	tcp
bash uses to identify tcp ports and alike for udp

416782
ubuntu	linux
the answer above is based on ubuntu lts 16.04 other linux unix versions may have different ways of indexing these objects

416783
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
the following should work for any distribution derived from debian gnu linux which includes what the questioner asked for ubuntu

416796
openbsd	freebsd
but this is not the case with even most other programs on openbsd and freebsd any more and certainly not with the almquist shell on freebsd hellip

416803
mtu	icmp
i would make sure you are allowing icmp for mtu path discovery inside of the vpc

416803
mtu	icmp
if there is a there is a difference in the maximum transmission unit mtu size in the network path between the two hosts with no pmtu discovery due to blocked icmp you will see these types of pauses

416816
dpkg	apt
to provide this option when dpkg is invoked by apt you need to add it to the apt settings for example by adding the following line to etc apt apt.conf

416827
ubuntu	debian
i deleted the debian partition and installed ubuntu to make sure if it was an issue with debian kernel itself as suspected ubuntu partition is bootable and functions correctly

416828
centos	linux
i upgraded the kernel for linux centos 7.2 today and rebooted the vm

416837
openbsd	freebsd
it affects freebsd and openbsd too for instance

416873
bash	zsh
with zsh or bash

416878
debian	linux
i would like to create a debian sid chroot from my arch linux system

416891
ubuntu	linux
after adding a boot option at the end of the linux line these two messages disappear but the problem still remians -- cannot boot the ubuntu

416918
cat	tee
since the grep will gobble up everything from fd1 i tee the stdout of cat explicitly to fd3 and then pipe the stdout to grep

416919
sudo	passwd
can i configure pam_mount to only ask for the passwd on login and not when unlocking the screen or doing sudo

416928
filesystems	xfs
for xfs filesystems you would use a xfs_growfs tool instead

416928
implements	extends
that made it possible to implements the fsadm resize command which provides an unified syntax for extends several filesystem types

416954
jobs	cron
cron jobs for example daily emailed backup run at reboot time making single core spike to 100

416954
cpu	processors
cpu was slightly higher because it was a weaker processors but frequency would bounce between low and high all the time with most time spent in the middle

416963
base	fractions
no matter how many base 2 digits youâ re willing to use the decimal value 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a base 2 fractions

416963
base	fractions
this is a representation error because often decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary base 2 fractions

416969
versioning	upgrade
when the upgrade to a new snapshot will take you to a new versioning number like from 6.2 to 6.3 which will happen rather soon booting bsd.rd and following the prompts will only allow you to download the new bsd.rd ramdisk

416991
dnf	yum
an alternative is to create a local repository see this is for yum but applies also for dnf

416995
sudo	passwd
the problem here is that i need sudo privileges inside the script and that once the process is running i don t see the request for the passwd

416997
sudoers	passwd
add the script to etc sudoers with the nopasswd flag so you can run that particular command without entering the passwd every time

417005
filesystems	ntfs
i turned off fast startup recommended in windows 10 according to unable to mount windows ntfs filesystems due to hibernation

417017
for-loop	loops
i originally assumed that one for-loop works with one argument so if i would have myvar_0 and myvar_1 with arg0 and arg1 then myvar_0 will work with arg_0 and myvar_1 will work with arg1 but i further tested and i was wrong --- all for loops worked with all arguments

417022
for-loop	loops
the for-loop in bash posix shell is similar to the for-loop in python loops variable takes the listed values one-by-one and loops body runs once for each value

417054
bash	zsh
does a tool exist that will automatically generate completion files for both bash and zsh

417054
bash	zsh
i d like to be able to specify one source of truth for my completions instead of maintaining a separate completion file for bash and zsh

417062
ubuntu	linux
i am running a dual-boot with parrot linux 3.9 and ubuntu 16.04 lts

417064
versioning	upgrade
there appear to be two upgrade paths pg_dumpall and pg_upgrade but both require the the previous versioning of postgresql be installed which it isn t

417066
rpm	yum
your client yum 8 has its own idea of the rpm characteristics so ask it to check their repo value again

417119
centos	linux
i built a server on aws using amazon linux 4.9.75-1.56.amzn2.x86_64 compatible with centos and went through guides here and here to build the vsftpd server and create users and attempt to restrict them to the directory associated with their group s respectively

417126
stdout	stderr
sponge accumulates its input and only displays it on its stdout which has been redirected with to the same resource as stderr after it has detected eof on its stdin assumed to be when fff terminates and has already written all its output on its stdout

417132
ubuntu	debian
provides a list of supported versions for a small set of language runtimes on a few distributions debian ubuntu rhel sles

417143
bash	zsh
if you want something more powerful define bash completions and use zsh s bash compatibility mode

417143
bash	zsh
users must call bashcompinit in their .zshrc then they can call complete -f _myprogram_bash_complete myprogram in zsh as well as bash

417143
bash	zsh
zsh only emulates a subset of bash so test your completion function to ensure that it doesn t require features that zsh doesn t emulate

417159
cpu	hyperthreading
if this pc has an intel cpu then the thread s per core most certainly indicates hyperthreading

417188
bash	zsh
that split+glob operator gets in the way and causes so much harm the rest of the time that it would seem only fair that it be used whenever it s needed though i ll agree it s very cumbersome to use especially considering that posix sh has no support for local scope neither for variables here nor for options noglob here though ash and derivatives like dash are some of the ones that do together with at t implementations of ksh zsh and bash 4.4 and above

417188
bash	zsh
it strips everything past the first occurrence of a newline character so it can t be used with arbitrary strings unless you use -d in zsh or bash and the data doesn t contain nul characters but then note that herestrings or heredocs do add an extra newline character

417188
bash	zsh
in zsh where the syntax comes from and bash here strings are implemented using temporary files so it s generally less efficient than using or split+glob operators

417199
ssd	sata
if you are talking about an equipment that has a prober pci bus and a sata ssd disk usb will be the bottleneck for an external disk and far slower

417199
ssd	sata
anecdotally i have an iot arm device with an external ssd disk over sata

417207
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse were always left permanently plugged into the usb 2.0 hub and that worked fine -- when powering up the pc both devices were always immediately recognized

417207
mouse	keyboard
but after replacing the 2.0 hub with the 3.0 hub keyboard and mouse no longer working quite so fine but anticipated disk speedup was indeed achieved

417210
dnf	yum
as pointed out by weijun zhou yum and dnf do manage package changes as units which can be undone in some circumstances

417210
dnf	yum
iâ m not sure yum or dnf can be used properly instead of apt on debian-based systems

417215
ubuntu	centos
should run on ubuntu and centos

417220
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux	sudo	passwd
say for example on a debian based system like ubuntu or linux mint you can use the command apt to install and you just enter your user passwd which will temporarily elevate that user s permissions to install remove and update packages whereas doing apt-get requires sudo at the beginning which is what i want to avoid a the user from using

417235
ubuntu	linux
the tools available are going to vary between linux distributions but with a ubuntu 16.04 lts live iso booted from a usb stick on a 2011 macbook pro nvram variables are readable in the filesystem

417243
sudoers	visudo
you can modify your etc sudoers file using visudo and acheive this goal

417243
sudo	passwd
this would allow username to run sudo apt-get and sudo aptitude without any passwd but would not allow any other commands

417261
google-chrome	firefox
but recently something went wrong maybe with an update i don t know and my browsers stopped playing flash files google-chrome offers to download it and firefox just shows white screen

417261
google-chrome	firefox
edit it is not a duplicate of the mentioned question as in that case firefox still worked and the issue was with google-chrome only

417263
tunnel	packets
i have 2 tunnel of ikev1 with overlapping in leftsubnet and rightsubnet how the packets that send know to which tunnel it forward to tunnel first_4a010003 whay is that and how i decide i nwhch tunnel the packets will forward

417263
tunnel	packets
when is send packets to 30.30.30.30 to which tunnel it will go

417288
cpu	processors
processors intel core i7-8700k cpu 3.70 ghz x 6

417307
range	max
the following list represented the tokens between sdb and while max range could be c - z

417319
filesystems	btrfs
i d like to use dm-crypt with btrfs because of the bitrot protection of this filesystems

417326
btrfs	vfs
there has been talk in the past on the btrfs mailing list about adding support for the vfs encryption api the same thing used by ext4 and f2fs for their transparent file encryption but that appears to never have gone anywhere

417327
jobs	cron
other important differences are that not all distributions support etc cron.d and that the files in etc cron.d have to meet a certain number of requirements beyond being valid cron jobs they must be owned by root and must conform to run-parts â naming conventions no dots only letters digits underscores and hyphens

417330
filesystems	xfs
the following will have the same net effect as truncate but uses a different calling sequence and only works on ext4 and xfs with files that are a multiple of the filesystems block size

417330
xfs	btrfs
and this will make the file a sparse file of the same apparent length as the original file but only works on ext4 xfs btrfs and tmpfs

417330
filesystems	btrfs
based on what you re saying though it sounds to me like they re using btrfs for backend storage which they should probably not be doing if they need to use quotas quotas on btrfs work differently than they do on most other filesystems and have some pretty significant scalability and usability issues right now

417332
folder	directory
i will copy all the directory first to a temp folder so while deleting it doesnt delete hidden system files

417337
ubuntu	linux
so commands in linux ubuntu 16.04 give

417341
nas	qnap
the network share is available on local nas server qnap configured to suspend disk storage within 15 minutes of inactivity

417347
daemons	systemd
the unix systemd account that owns the postfix queue and most postfix daemons processes

417356
uninstall	upgrade
mb uninstall your aur packages so you can properly upgrade

417365
lapack	ceres-solver
the problem was that opencv needs both lapack with the normal blas and cblas if you are using the ceres-solver

417393
ubuntu	centos
with ubuntu i was using gksudo but as far as i can tell this is not a option with centos

417424
folder	directory
my guess is i would have to pretend somehow that this is not a mounted directory but just another native folder on the nas

417431
openvpn	iptables
i recently enabled an openvpn server on the router enabled logging changed the iptables to allow traffic to flow from the tun interface to the bridged wifi connection and vice verse and enabled ssh into the router

417456
debian	linux
to build an old program for use in my debian gnu linux box i need either gcc 4.9 or gcc 5

417461
bash	zsh
if you re willing to change the name of your variables and make your code bash-specific -s is available in zsh and bash

417461
bash	zsh
-p for prompt is bash only zsh uses read var

417481
gedit	nano
gedit and pluma are gui based editors whereas vi editor and nano are lightweight editors terminal based

417487
bash	zsh
this version should work with all posixy shells tested bash dash ksh and zsh

417505
rpm	yum
additional info it s more interesting to install rpm with yum then with rpm command

417516
clang	llvm
in particular i would need to always have the latest version of llvm clang and the stability of the stable version of the os

417529
ssd	sata
i have a disk ssd samsung 500 gb sata iii 6gb s - model 850 evo

417529
debian	linux
i used linux debian 8 jessie 64b with ext4 file system

417542
folder	directory
if you also need a shared documents folder as well as each users private folder then create a unix group add all users to that group use chgrp to set the shared directory s group-owner to that group and on the directory to enable all group members to read write cd into list files etc

417543
centos	linux
we run a centos linux release 7.4 lamp stack with apache 2.4

417607
bash	zsh
but what i want is if zsh or even bash

417607
spaces	delimiter
kind of like this but of course this plugin won t work on spaces delimiter shell arguments either

417614
stdout	stderr
but the stdout stderr are not

417618
ubuntu	linux
i m running a linux box ubuntu and every few months it freezes and i m left with no choice sysrq-f and other keyboard shortcuts are not working but to reboot it losing all the data

417627
daemons	systemd
watchdog daemons which monitors processes in the systemd as well as

417627
daemons	systemd
i would also advise configuring the syslog daemons for sending logs to a remote syslog server to have logs to peruse whenever the systemd is working properly or not

417628
ethernet	wireless
wireless is quite different from wired ethernet

417662
spaces	delimiter
edit the cat wasn t necessary and i changed the delimiter to a spaces to fit your table

417671
debian-based	linux
some packaging systems arch linux put in symbolic links to those so usr include ndbm.h points to usr include gdbm ndbm.h while at least some debian-based systems omit the directory and rename ndbm.h to gdbm-ndbm.h so they have gdbm.h dbm.h and gdbm-ndbm.h

417671
put	get
one way to get around such issues especially if you don t have permissions to modify the system directories is to create your own directory compat put in a link from compat ndbm.h to usr include gdbm-ndbm.h and then tell the compiler to search your compat directory -icompat

417678
debian	linux
i have the following directory listing on a debian linux system

417690
getter	setter
use a korn shell discipline function basically a getter setter to wrangle the path into the form you want

417708
mouse	keyboard
gnome tweak tool keyboard mouse additional layout options ctrl is mapped to win keys and the usual ctrl keys

417711
filesystems	fat
this partition needs to be tagged with efi system see fdisk s t command for all options and also needs to be formatted with fat filesystems

417719
debian	linux
both are available packaged for debian and other linux distros

417731
daemons	systemd
of course you could kill all user processes and most systemd daemons unmount other filesystems remount the root filesystem read-only check it then restore the systemd to a working state but doing all that for the sake of a dogma is inefficient

417748
bash	zsh
bash s doesn t zsh s does

417748
bash	zsh
also works in bash and zsh

417748
bash	zsh
that should keep you fine except that bash can t handle nul bytes 0 at all zsh can

417749
stdout	stderr
your stdout and stderr in addition to your stdin

417765
debian	linux
i am trying to run i8k on my debian with linux 3.16 amd64

417768
bash	zsh
it uses ksh93 s form of quoting now also supported by zsh bash and a few other shells to give you that representation

417768
bash	zsh
to remove it with ksh93-like shells ksh93 zsh bash or mksh you can do

417768
bash	zsh
as a side note also a ksh ism also supported by zsh and bash is a pattern matching operator not an equality testing operator except in zsh when not emulating ksh bash you need to test for equality would return true for instance and would return false

417772
centos	linux
we have amazon aws instance with centos linux 7 core

417794
bash	zsh
typeset -p ksh zsh bash yash might give you an unambiguous output for some strings

417794
bash	zsh
printf q with gnu printf and the printf builtin of ksh93 zsh and bash

417865
post	put
other post related to this subject typically call attention to the need to put escaped brackets around non-printing characters especially text colors

417877
debian	linux
i have 14 distributions including two different branches of debian stable and unstable installed on my pc and only 10 of them including arch linux are detected by arch linux s grub bootloader

417877
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux

417877
filesystems	btrfs
i should mention every one of them except deepin uses the btrfs filesystems

disk	ram
it s arguably better to leave them on disk rather than in ram though any performance gain is probably tiny

417878
disk	ram
limiting the kernel to physical memory may mean that you either a allocate more ram than the vm needs wasting server resources which could go to other vms or b cause the kernel to reduce the amount of buffers in order to retain unused or rarely used allocated pages with the resulting increase in disk activity decreasing overall performance

417881
debian	linux
i had the exact same problem on two servers a linux running debian stretch and on a nas synology ds715

417914
ubuntu	linux
is it possible for me to do it in ubuntu linux

417929
vmware	virtualbox
can i create it using some virtualization software similar to vmware or virtualbox

417951
openbsd	freebsd
at least gnu grep as well as grep on openbsd and freebsd also support the -h flag to always print the filename even if only one file is given

417956
mouse	keyboard
i disabled most of my entries in proc acpi wakeup to make sure only the power button and the laptop lid can resume my system not the mouse or keyboard

417961
stdout	stderr
the scripts were ran under bin sh and relied on dev stdout dev stdin and dev stderr

417969
sudo	passwd
you could configure sudo to allow you to run that command without entering your passwd

417969
sudoers	visudo
add an appropriate entry in etc sudoers the sudo configuration file which is edited by running visudo as root or through sudo

417972
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox vmware etc.

417996
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr respectively

418000
filesystems	ntfs
what filesystems are safe for this is ntfs unsafe inherently compared to ext4

418003
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs and ext4 are both pretty resilient filesystems types but neither can survive indefinitely if the physical storage media is not reliable if a failure happens at the location of some critical filesystems metadata entire files or directories may become inaccessible

418031
centos	linux
i am trying to figure out an event log in linux preferably centos that can tell about the amount of capacity left for a specific hard drive or partition.so that i can set alerts on our monitoring system whenever the hard drive reaches 95 capacity it can generate an alert

418064
opensuse	linux	opensuse	centos	centos	linux
get yourself some free linux distributions like opensuse fedora centos or others

418064
rhel	suse
if your register with redhat or suse i believe you can download the enterprise versions redhat enterprise linux rhel and suse linux enterprise server sles for trial or development and you can play around and observe first hand how and what encryption schemes are available

i have a mailserver for testing with dovecot and postfix

418169
ubuntu	linux
i don t think i can use the normal ubuntu software update program for this because it looks on standard linux repositories and i want my software to look on web pages for the updates

418170
pop-up	dialog
a dialog should pop-up asking if you allow the remote connection if you have set it so in the vino-preferences

418195

in the following the directory containing the home folder are shared using the users share name

418230
stdout	stderr
now the sort check command produces no stdout or stderr meaning the file is properly sorted

418230
int	chars
it seems that the first chars is being used to know if the file is sorted instead of the entire int

418242
switching	screens
you should switching to the nvidia in bios and run all of the screens from nvidia

418247
bash	zsh
or you could switch to zsh where ranges like are based on character code points so always only include abcdefghijklmnopqstuvwxyz or with bash 4.3 or newer use the globasciirange option to have the same behaviour in bash

418253
sudo	passwd
for that i have configured my server that i can launch pppd with sudo without the need for a passwd and on my client i run something like

418254

i m interested to know which process in linux actually gets information from the network layer on the receiving side applies all the tcp-related logic tcp-level error check segments acknowledgement etc. and puts it into receive buffer of the waiting connection

418315
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
packages from backports are never valid installation candidates for an upgrade from the main repositories only for upgrade from a previous versioning of a backported package

418323
udp	tcp
the tcp udp ip stack is then aware of these link devices and is further abstracted to linux unix level concepts such as sockets

418350
filesystems	btrfs
note that the filesystems is on a btrfs raid1 array and one of the devices is inside a luks container for historical reasons

ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu use dash as bin sh it s somewhat faster than bash

418409
ubuntu	debian
changing bin sh to dash instead of bash in debian and ubuntu was greatly because of performance

418416
subtraction	addition
note bash can format numbers with decimal points but it cannot do addition subtraction or other arithmetic on such floating point numbers

418428
ubuntu	debian
you could install dash and use that but youâ d likely run into lots of scripts which assume bin sh is bash and fail with dash â it took debian and ubuntu quite a long time to identify and fix all the issues

418443
centos	linux
everything ran smoothly until i tried to connect to my centos linux server from host windows 10

418472
mouse	keyboard	google-chrome	firefox
specifically what happens is that the system runs fine without noticable performance drop while i have many tabs in my browser happens with both firefox and google-chrome but sometimes the opening of a new tab or the launching of the other browser causes the hdd to make constant noise and the mouse keyboard input response lags so heavily that i rather cold reboot

418472
google-chrome	firefox
the kernel should not allow any processes not even buggy malicious not to mention firefox google-chrome to cause unresponsiveness to such an extent that the quickest way out is a cold reboot

418478

418492
freebsd	linux	freebsd	centos	centos	linux
there is a workaround for the thrashing problem to automatically limit system ressources per process user you can utilize the pam_limits module via limits.conf on linux centos and similar or login class capability database on freebsd via login.conf

418532
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
when running the for loops in ilkkachu s answer from an interactive bash shell with zsh or fish as my login shell the bin bash loop takes about 13 seconds

418532
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
i presume this is because bin bash inherits its environment from the login shell either bin zsh or bin fish but i am not exactly sure

418532
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
in any event i solved the issue by changing my login shell to bin bash and setting up my terminal to run bin fish or bin zsh as an interactive shell

418536
stdout	stderr
probably not even this works if the app notices that it does not have a controlling terminal and thus does not use stdin stdout and stderr the usual way maybe even has closed them and used them for different purposes

418548
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs

this is a new lenovo laptop and with the big deal with ubuntu 17.10 corrupting bios chips on many lenovo computers it has certainly crossed my mind that that could be the culprit but i can still read and write to my bios i updated it to the latest version and saved settings such as the time and i can still boot some things from usb like puppy linux as well as a windows 10 iso

418705
stdout	stderr
must log stderr and stdout to journald with different priority levels and prefix-tags

418705
stdout	stderr
i m not sure how to redirect stderr and stdout separately to my logging function

418705
stdout	stderr
my current approach appears to run the logging function exactly twice once for stderr and once for stdout

418707
stdout	stderr
this is one way of capturing stdout and stderr to different command pipelines

debian	linux
i m running debian stretch and am having trouble running a program that needs 3d unity3d for linux a beta release

according to the answer here it may be that more modern system have this directory although the question and answer in the link is about ubuntu i think it is safe to assume that the same is true of centos systems since my installation doc for centos mentions this directory

subnet	packets
for example a packets addressed to 30.30.30.1 will use the sa created for the second_4a010001 connection as long as the source address lies in 20.20.20.0 28 because 28 subnet will result in a higher priority than 24 subnet

versioning	upgrade
if you mean a full upgrade to a new versioning of mint

418862
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	mint
otherwise if you just mean updating the packages in your current mint versioning to the latest packages for that versioning it can be updated like ubuntu with apt-get update to refresh the packages available from the repos and apt-get upgrade to install any upgrade that are available

fish	zsh	fish	bash	fish	ash	bash	zsh

my guess is that these applications create so many different processes and then kill the parent so strace stops tracing the children

419023
ubuntu	debian
the length of that list and the fact that one usually wants all of these commands to employ the same jvm is why debian ubuntu has update-java-alternatives

419023
ubuntu	debian
in the debian ubuntu system it is possible to have different commands invoking different jres by using update-alternatives to set individual commands rather than by using update-java-alternatives to set them all in one fell swoop

419023
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	debian
when creating service bundle run programs that use the nosh toolset either one can rely upon the fact that the system administrator has provided a universal java command that picks the right jre using something like debian s ubuntu s alternatives system or using something like the freebsd trueos javavmwrapper system hellip

419023
ubuntu	debian
debian s ubuntu s alternatives system does the former

419023

the debian ubuntu alternatives system does not

419049
stdout	stderr
as mentioned in answers to stderr redirection not working in csh the operator works in t csh to redirect both stdout and stderr

419049
stdout	stderr
is the standard way to redirect stderr to the same place as stdout but t csh doesn t support that

419049
bash	zsh

419127
sudo	passwd
you shouldnâ t have a usr local bin sudo thatâ s whatâ s breaking things not the passwd change

sysv	systemd
if postfix had a native systemd service unit file i would just make it require docker.service but postfix has sysv script which systemd translates into service unit during boot

419135
sysv	systemd
and there is an all keyboard which according to documentation should mark this service as being started after everything else but is this everything else all the systemd services or services that only have sysv scripts

419148
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
i know that bash has word splitting but zsh doesn t and i m not familiar with others csh tcsh ksh etc but i was wondering if it is part of any standard

419189
versioning	upgrade
should you use rpm -i to perform an upgrade you would likely end up with two packages of the same name and different versioning installed at the same time with the earlier ones being broken half overwritten

use the visudo command to add the following to your etc sudoers file

ubuntu	debian
most of them start with bionic main which is curious because i don t have ubuntu and i have read that ubuntu packages are not really compatible with debian

419218
bash	zsh
this is a bash prompt so a bash setting has somehow leaked to zsh

419218
bash	zsh
since ps1 has different meanings to different programs it should never be an environment variable only a variable in each program that uses it bash zsh etc.

419218
bash	zsh
because ps1 is being set in a way it s shouldn t zsh ends up picking a stray bash setting

419221
ubuntu	linuxmint	ubuntu	mint
replace ubuntu with linuxmint and in a new twist in 17.50 remove the after this appears to be for sending switches given to the script to apt but it truncates the command line instead i don t know enough bash to figure out why and may be a bug in mint s apt or a bug in this script

versioning	upgrade	daemons	systemd
to determine whether systemd really needs to be restarted you can check the output of lsof -p1 | grep deleted systemd uses a library libsystemd-shared which is shipped in the same package and is thus upgrade along with the daemons so if systemd needs to be restarted youâ ll see it using a deleted versioning of the library

the problem is that when creating a new file or directory the id group of the content is set to pluto or pippo depending by whom the content has been created and not to foo even if i ve changed the group of the foo folder and its subdirectories and files to foo

419568
chgrp	chmod
of course if you re creating a new directory you just have to run the chmod chgrp commands without using find

419586
centos	linux
our os is centos linux 7

419596
folder	directory
then change the directory to the extracted folder cd path to the extracted folder

419602
chown	chmod
also take care to not run recursive chown or chmod on directory or other system directory

419603
ansible	puppet
you can also install those scripts with puppet or chef or ansible and just add the single line entries in the crontab to run those scripts

419618
folder	directory
so i use tree so i can get only the folder set and avoid the nightmare of having all the files set as executables the option for tree is -d list directory only

419618
chown	chmod
using chmod or chown recursive on root directory or system directories will destroy your os actually anything recursive on directory or system directories is dangerous

419646
post	put
the blog post i linked in my original message says i should create a file named 50-mtrack.conf with the content provided as an example and put it in usr share x11 xorg.conf.d

419660
wan	lan
with following config i can reach wan lan using eth0 but i cant reach not even my gateway with tap0

419670
debian	linux
this is happening on a debian stretch machine in a bash shell with the term variable set to linux

419675
lvm	xfs	filesystems	xfs
i would like to migrate standard root partitions centos 7 with xfs filesystems to the lvm partition unfortunately every attempt fails and after reboot the system won t start i suspect problem with grub2

419704
umask	passwd
kill newgrp passwd read true umask unalias wait

419723
folder	directory
this directs commands to your bin folder in your home directory and then searches through the rest of your path

419745
spaces	delimiter
cut is a bit annoying in that even if you set the delimiter to a spaces it takes all spaces as delimiter

419745
spaces	delimiter
you could use cut -c n - m with appropriate values to pick a fixed-width field or to print the fifth field awk takes multiple spaces as as one delimiter

419747
ubuntu	centos
firefox rightly says that google s anchor root pem contains aocvmm but openssl can t find it btw same behavior in centos 7.4 and ubuntu 16.04.3 lts

419754
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
openbsd and netbsd have vnode disks managed by vnconfig 8 and freebsd has memory disks managed by mdconfig 8

419786
post	put
you could also try to enable legacy mode in your bios or put the efi files mentioned in that post from the above link to your usb drive which you probably used to install kali and then reinstall

419821
spaces	delimiter
spaces as delimiter by default for exact matching 22696 from start position to end position and invert result

419850
bash	zsh
in ksh bash zsh yash you could use the built-in substitution operator to remove anything but the slashes and then take the count of characters

419894
debian	linux
uname -a prints the output linux debian 4.9.0-3-686-pae #1 smp debian 4.9.30-2+deb9u5 2017-09-19 i686 gnu linux

dpkg	aptitude
for example bash is requested implied i386 and bash amd64 is installed works but aptitude thinks it s broken while dpkg -l seems ok

419943
folder	directory
it may be easier to symlink the folder you are trying to zip to the current directory

419952
folder	directory
maybe ecryptfs but i m not sure if that works well for directory other than the home folder

419964
heredoc	herestring
both the heredoc and herestring are aimed to replace this heavy sed operation

419971
dpkg	aptitude
aptitude and apt-get are broken as is dpkg

419971
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
aptitude upgrade apt upgrade or apt-get upgrade appear to be broken due to dpkg being broken

419971
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
so i can t reinstall necessary packages to restore the system because dpkg and therefore aptitude apt-get apt are broken seemingly because sh is not in my path

419971
dpkg	aptitude
i m assuming that fixing this issue with sh would allow dpkg and aptitude to work again but i m wondering what precisely is the problem with sh

419971
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
i ve also tried executing various aptitude apt and apt-get and dpkg commands as root using sudo -i which suggests that my issue is different

419996
int	chars
which formats the number as a left-justified 15 chars wide int

419997
stdout	stderr
which lets me see the stdout stderr write commands of the parent process

419997
stdout	stderr
my question is how to strace all write calls to stdout stderr from all child processes inside a docker container

420038
filesystems	hfs+
it s on hfs+ ssd drive journaled same filesystems on the destination hard drive so not related to nfs

420044
udp	tcp
this option can be employed with both tcp and udp sockets

420052
opensuse	linux
i tried installing python 3.6 on opensuse linux 42.3 leap

420059

is that iptables output from your ubuntu or from the centos vm

420098
tunnel	lan
server with dhcp iface eth0 172.5.1.1 24 gives internet via openvpn tunnel iface tun0 10.8.1.6 to lan clients

420098
tunnel	vpn
the question is how to catch connection markers from source ip 172.5.1.123 on vpn server s tunnel interface 10.8.1.1

420117
bash	zsh
the use of is valid only in bash ksh and zsh better use

420117
bash	zsh
to show how that works try this script note that the script is sh it works the same in dash bash ksh and or zsh

420124
daemons	systemd
then i searched for relevant systemd services but only found ssh.service which is and therefore is not run on login and well that s obvious since this is the ssh server daemons

420132
width	height
you can set height and width to a large value so that it will cover your entire screen

420176
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu 16.04.3 linux 4.4.0-112-generic

420184
debian	linux
immediately after installing debian 9 stretch the avahi-daemon has already been installed so it is working to send a ping between linux with avahi-daemon installed on each of them

on debian ubuntu to build kernel modules against a packaged kernel you ll normally need to have the package installed

420235
tunnel	vpn
its purpose is to be dropped on a network and tunnel out to the vpn server

420235
tunnel	packets	tunnel	vpn
i tunnel into the vpn server using my laptop and the packets sent from my laptop flow to the pi zero letting me into the internal network the pi is connected to

420235
tunnel	packets
packets squirrel remote access and openvpn client tunnel

420260
folder	directory
is it possible to have bash guess what i meant to type by for example when wanting to change directory to documents and then mistyping given no other folder beginning with ocum is present bash interprets it as cd documents since it is the closest possible action to do

420292
cpu	processors
try restricting cpu usage to 80 for a start - in vm settings you can set this in processors settings

420294
ubuntu	mint
i have a fresh install of mint 18.2 however this mint install replaced ubuntu 14.4 and the identical issue happened with ubuntu

420294
ubuntu	mint
as i mentioned this happened on my install of ubuntu 14.4 i was running that for years until i just changed to mint and exactly the same problem happens

420294
ubuntu	mint
i have used the nvidia drivers and the non nvidia drivers on ubuntu to the same result but only the xorg drivers on this mint install and its still happening

420294
ubuntu	mint
the fact its happening on ubuntu and carried over to mint the only things i can see in common are the underlying ubuntu software on both and the nvidia video cards but those have used at this point a number of different drivers to the same result

420300
disk	ram
the underlying hardware effectively includes a disk cache within the the host s ram potentially growing to multiple gigabytes

420302
icmp	udp
it could be udp and icmp too

420302
vpn	lan
i assume that 10.0.2.2 is your lan router so this is telling your client that all traffic for the vpn endpoint is to be sent out via eth0 to your router and onward

420304
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am running linux mint 17 ubuntu 14.04

i see the mysqldump created with the permissions -rw-r--r-- 1 root root which seems correct to me however as the script continues to the md5 hash i get this

420320
debian	linux
i m using a debian linux os

420349
zypper	yum
best use a package manager such as yum or zypper who will manage those dependencies for you

420375
tunnel	vpn
then there are full vpn tunnel and split vpn tunnel

420375
tunnel	vpn
in the past we did not have strict security requirements and for no-so-trusted people we gave them split vpn tunnel

420375
tunnel	vpn
for the people we trusted we gave full vpn tunnel that allowed them to reach the internet

420375
tunnel	vpn
again bear also in mind a full vpn tunnel might be configured to block the internet access and only give access to corporate assets it might prevent you using the internet by design

420400
ubuntu	linux
ps the linux box is actually linux backbox an ubuntu based os in case it matters

what would cause the basic shell prompt in bash csh tcsh whatever to not come up in a terminal windows

420418
freebsd	linux
is it possible to build a chroot environment which is running freebsd inside of linux if so how would i go about build a chroot environment from within linux

420421
freebsd	linux
freebsd and linux are two different kernels well freebsd users will argue with me here but the core of freebsd is a different kernel so you canâ t run one on top of the other without some sort of emulation or virtualisation layer

420421
freebsd	debian
if youâ re really keen you might be able to run a pure freebsd chroot on a distribution with a familiar set of tools debian gnu kfreebsd

420421
freebsd	debian
you can apparently do the opposite run a debian gnu kfreebsd chroot on top of freebsd

420421
freebsd	linux
in both cases youâ re using the freebsd kernel thereâ s no linux kernel involved

420428
bash	zsh
that should work in ksh93 where that operator comes from bash mksh and zsh though of course in zsh there are much simpler approaches

420428
octal	decimal
that assumes contains a valid quad-decimal representation of an ipv4 address though that would also work for quad-hexadecimal representations like 0x6d.0x60.0x4d.0xf and even octal in some shells but would output the values in decimal

420428
bash	zsh
bash mksh zsh have copied ksh93 s operator but not that capture-group handling part

420428
octal	decimal
that same typical ipv4 address of the loopback interface can also be represented as 0x7f000001 or 127.1 maybe a more appropriate one here to say it s the 1 address on the 127.0 8 class a network or 0177.0.1 or the other combinations of 1 to 4 numbers expressed as octal decimal or hexadecimal

420428
bash	zsh
if you don t mind the side effect of setting an arbitrary temporary variable here in bash or ksh93 or zsh -o octalzeroes or lksh -o posix you can simply convert all those representations back to a 32 bit integer with

420438
sudo	passwd
sudo is an application that is designed to ask you for a passwd hence the requirement for a tty

420466
stdout	stderr
i want to send both stderr and stdout to a log file but keep the console output nice and clean with just stdout

420475
disk	ram
ram is huge enough to not worry about and also we don t mind having common hard disk some kind of gpu virtualization

420475
mouse	keyboard
time though it requires one set of keyboard mouse and video card

420482
switching	screens
you can then use tmux or screens on vttys those you can switching to with ctrl+alt+fx

420516
centos	linux
ancient redhat 7.3 to centos 7.4 essentially redhat enterprise linux 7.4 is staying in the same distribution family so will likely have better portability than going from some random linux from scratch install from 2002 to some other random linux distribution in 2018

420516
ia-32	mips
amd64 or ia-32 is vastly different from arm or mips so the binary from one of those would not be expected to run on another

420518
ubuntu	linux
taking for instance your code for which ldd reports the following dependencies when compiled with gcc -o exit-test exit-test.c on a debian-derived ubuntu linux host

420546
cpu	processors
more specifically intel processors with proc cpuinfo model code 79 and original microcode the update process was unreliable if sys devices system cpu microcode reload was used while the system was running in normal smp mode

i would like to know why there are two differently named configuration files within clamav on linux some set-ups mention etc clamd.d scan.conf as in the case for centos and for others its called etc clamd.d clamd.conf - both are identical

420645
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	traceroute	packets	udp	tcp
you can do as pretty much a traceroute based in tcp or udp packets besides icmp if icmp is being blocked

420652
tunnel	vpn
the problem is that if you set the default route into the tunnel without having a more specific route to then vpn s endpoint you are also changing the route that openvpn uses to connect to the remote endpoint of the vpn

420670
spaces	delimiter
set the res variable to ok from the outset and then check the first spaces delimiter field in the file against the prev variable

420688
ubuntu	linux
is a bug already reported with a shot solution as explain in know issues netlogo won t start on ubuntu 16 and various other linux systems

420693
x86	64bit
for removable media there is another uefi convention if there are no applicable uefi boot variables or the system is told to boot in uefi mode from a disk it has never seen before then the uefi firmware looks for a partition with a fat32 filesystem that would contain a file named efi boot bootx64.efi for 64bit x86 hardware

420697
stdout	stderr
dd output is actually printing to stderr not stdout

420698
ubuntu	openbsd
the openbsd manual for dd explicitly mentions this but the ubuntu manual seems to omit this fact but mentions it in the more complete info page

first of all dpkg-checkbuilddeps prints out the error to stderr not stdout

420871
stdout	stderr
here is how to redirect stderr and stdout in bash

420902
pthreads	fork
there are two reasons why pthreads programmers call fork

420911
x86	64bit
that s the highest positive signed 64bit integer 2 63 -1 rounded down to multiples of 4096 2 12 the most common page size on x86 systems

420918
strtol	strstr
what i advise as the simplest solution is intercepting strstr and strtol in which you write code in strstr that when it founds tracerpid it will activate a flag that makes the next strtol invocation return 0

420918
strtol	strstr
i already double checked the binary and indeed strstr and strtol are dynamically loaded

420960
spaces	delimiter
taking account of multiple entries on each line awk looks from the first spaces delimiter entry in the file on each line to the last entry nf if then pattern matches against regular expressions with and increments a count accordingly

420983
daemon	cron
also the proper way to edit it is to run crontab -e -- it s entirely possible that the cron daemon doesn t notice you ve changed the file directly

420987
folder	directory
i ve been using cmake and creating a build folder for my cmake code and i want to easily cd to the build directory

420991
bash	zsh
in ksh bash zsh

420997
icmp	tcp
now all tcp connections to 127.66.66.66 will get a tcp rst packet in response and everything else gets an icmp rejection

420997
icmp	tcp
tcp rst will generally refuse a tcp connection even faster than icmp in my experience.

debian	linux
i am having issues installing virtualbox on my kali-rolling dist linux kali 4.12.0-kali1-amd64 #1 smp debian 4.12.6-1kali6 2017-08-30 x86_64 gnu linux

421020
bash	subshell
according to this and this a subshell is started in bash by using parenthesis â

421028
pthreads	fork
traditionally in the bourne shell or ksh88 on which the pthreads specification is based that was done by fork a child process

421028
pwd	chdir
upon cd save the previous working directory typically on a file descriptor opened with o_cloexec save the value of the oldpwd pwd variables and anything that cd might modify and then do the chdir bar

421028
bash	subshell
bash however only does it if that command is the only command of the subshell

421053
getter	setter
some standard shell tools are obviously a stream-filters like awk sed or lets say tr or sort but others work only with parameters like date this is setter getter but anyway

421070
daemons	systemd
if the init systemd is deterministic then it is highly likely that daemons started by that init systemd will start with the same pid across reboots as the same code will be run each boot though with randomization from the occasional fsck or selinux relabels or other such not-on-every-boot code

421070
jobs	cron
once the system is up and running process creation order will randomize itself as not-at- reboot cron jobs fire users login and run various different commands etc

421070
daemons	systemd
so yes it is statistically conceivable that a daemons will come up at the same pid on a redhat systemd that uses systemd

421081
openssl	gnutls
no because there is no centralised tls configuration on linux intentionally and on top of that you probably have at least two tls implementations on each system openssl or libressl for certain and most likely gnutls as well

421096
777	tmp
the tmp and all sub directory are owned by www-data www-data and tried setting everything to 777 to no avail

opensuse	linux
how to download python 3.6 for opensuse linux

421162
ubuntu	linux
to find the relative path to the etc passwd file you may use the realpath command on linux this utility may not be available on other types of unix systems and it s available in at least ubuntu

421197
centos	linux
i have set up a linux server centos 7 running centos web panel

421199
elf	coff
for the most part linux uses elf but older versions used a.out or coff

421201
bash	zsh
read -t 3 a ksh93 extension now also supported by zsh bash and mksh is meant to read one line logical line in that lines may be continued with a trailing backslash as you don t use the -r option from stdin into with a 3 second timeout

421201
stdout	stderr
it redirects stdin to dev null and stdout and stderr to nohup.out

421226
versioning	upgrade
the correct answer is upgrade to versioning 2.2.x or later that fixed this problem first time

421245
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to get a backup system functioning as efficiently as i can - most of the systems i need backed up are some flavor of linux and we currently dump them to an ubuntu 16.04.3 server and store them on the disk

421245
lvm	btrfs
am i looking at a btrfs implementation or perhaps an lvm implementation here

421258
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
you ve got the two common enough filesystems that support snapshots btrfs and zfs and device-mapper lvm snapshots

421293
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint 18.1 serena is based on ubuntu 16.04 so it s normal if it still doesn t work

ubuntu	debian
i mostly use debian sometimes ubuntu and the repositories only have one or two major versions so i am unable to get the version the source requires

421345
clang	llvm
require clang 3.9 and llvm 3.9 but if you are using 3.9 version to compile pyside2 it would cast a error

421345
clang	llvm
you need upgrade clang 5.0 and llvm 5.0 to compile pyside2

421379
versioning	upgrade
my question frankly is how do i upgrade sbcl from 3.1.7 to the latest presumably 3.3.1 versioning

421379
versioning	upgrade
a upgrade this configured asdf to a newer versioning

421397
folder	directory
theuser s home folder contains a .ssh directory 700 permission containing an authorized_keys file 600 permission

421412
sysv	systemd
i tried using systemd and sysv but while i am quite familiar with sysv it does not let me pick my own execution order anymore i guess because systemd is replacing is and anyway i would like to switch to systemd completely because sysv is being phased out in debian

421422
folder	directory
maildir format dictates that sub-folder directory start with a dot so when you see trash in your list of folder in your imap client the files are stored in a directory called .trash etc

421443
apache	nginx
see how etc hosts works on your server a webserver apache nginx ... will serve your site to any incomming requests

421457
cpu	affinity
set or retrieve the cpu affinity of all the tasks threads for a given pid

421544
subshell	ifs
for processing the ip address portion we can take advantage of ifs and word-splitting in subshell hence unquoted and printf s ability to process variable-length arguments to fit into format string

421568
xfce	kde
it appears that this issue is gnome-specific since i don t experience this issue with kde plasma or xfce

421582
switching	screens
nothing appears on the screens after trying to switching modes

421593
ubuntu	debian
the audio recording levels can be saved for ubuntu debian users using a command from the package alsa-mixer

421646
16-bit	64bit
bios is 16-bit environment efi is 32 64bit environment

421680
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
clients are centos and ubuntu linux with recent kernels

421687
hid	keyboard
i have implemented a test hid keyboard using an stm32 microcontroller

421700
debian	linux
the other one is rpitc work as i read flawlessly with linux debian

421715
traceroute	packets
what traceroute does is use the option fields as it sends internet control message protocol icmp packets

421715
traceroute	packets
in order to find which ip address is a specific distance away traceroute will send packets with the options of time to live give me a response when it times out

421717
debian	linux
i think that the problem is connected to networkmanager and to the firmware when i used the same computer and usb sticks the same linux distribution debian 9.3 but used wicd instead of networkmanager then the long non-standard device names were working and this fix was not necessary

421765
ubuntu	linux
i ve got a problem with my linux pc it is running bodhi linux which is based on ubuntu so here s what i think provoked the problem

421765
bash	zsh
a few days ago i installed zsh and made it my default shell but not long after that commands like mv ls would display something like mv command not found so i thought i would change the default shell back to bash

421777
bash	zsh
the shell whether bash or zsh does not have access to the terminal scroll back buffer

421783
bash	zsh
is there a way to search bash history similar to zsh history search with percol

421806
ubuntu	centos
i have tried centos 7.4 and ubuntu 14.04.5 lts

421813
mouse	keyboard
it does not deal with physical display keyboard or mouse at all.

421839
debian	linux

yes is unix and is certified unix like macos x aix hp-ux and one linux distro for mainframes called inspur k-ux

421844
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	unix	sunos	sunos	bsd	solaris	bsd	solaris	sunos
solaris is an historical unix derived from sunos and it take some things from unix bsd and many others from unix sysv

421846
hex	binary
it can also convert a hex dump back to its original binary

421849
debian	mint
i downloaded the package unison-gtk_2.48.3-1_amd64.deb from debian packages repository and install the new binary by hand extracting the files at the correct places and using debian alternative to let the mint unison and the debian unison co-exist

421849
debian	mint
there may be a smarter way to install a debian package on mint but this was a fast proof-of-concept

421854
openbsd	linux
i can surprisingly reproduce your issue on openbsd with term set to linux or rxvt

421860
bash	zsh
bash and zsh shell history suggest box - easily view navigate search and manage your command history

421860
bash	zsh
easily view navigate search and use your command history with shell history suggest box for bash and zsh

421869
centos	linux
by the way this has nothing to do with linux centos or vmware

421887
mouse	keyboard
i just bought a wireless mouse and keyboard combo

421887
mouse	keyboard
totally common devices keyboard a4tech gk-85 mouse a4tech g3-200n

debian	linux
my debian linux debian 4.9.0-4-amd64 and kde plasma

421945
sudo	passwd
but when i use sudo command the passwd typed in turns out to be incorrect

421962
spaces	delimiter
this assumes that the string in is space-separated change the spaces in the above variable substitution to whatever delimiter you re using

421962
spaces	delimiter
change to a regular expression that matches the delimiter before the last column if your data does not use tabs or spaces as delimiter

421965
debian	linux
i have a strange issue with my debian linux system

421969
ssl	https
i need to download a ssl cert in pem format from a https website

421969
google-chrome	firefox
however when i visit the website via a browser google-chrome or firefox and inspect its certificate it shows me a different one

421986
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade uuid to newer versioning

421996
bash	zsh
this is the case with bash dash zsh and pdksh but not with ksh93 with which b.sh terminates immediately

422004
xfs	btrfs
refer to filesystem-specific man pages such as btrfs 5 ext4 5 and xfs 5 for more filesystem-specific details

422011
bash	zsh
it s already supported by ksh93 zsh bash mksh busybox and freebsd sh at least as of february 2018

422030
udp	tcp
protocol i created 2 lines one for tcp and the other for udp

422047
versioning	upgrade
let s say one has only remote access ssh to an embedded linux device and the goal is to upgrade the os to a new versioning

422049
disk	ram
i can t think of a proper way to boot only into a ram disk as the init ial startup of the system still comes from the media

422053
debian	linux
gnu linux debian 9.3 with openssh version 1 7.4p1-10+deb9u2

422055
for-loop	loops
first i have used for-loop in for-loop i have mentioned all the file extensions then in loops i have used awk command to rename the file as per requirements

422057
min	max
i want to plot the mean of column 13 last column with the confidence interval and use gnuplot yerrorlines which need data in four columns x mean min max

422057
min	max
the formula of min and max values uses the stats_mean stats_ssd and stats_records of column 13 with equal value in column 9

422057
min	max
i have tried to write the values x mean min max in a file with this

422077
for-loop	loops
in order to loops through all the values 0.1 to 1.7 you can use a for-loop going from 1 to 17 then dividing by 10

422120
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and i need help to fix this i want it to get updates from the ubuntu server not the xandros server because it doesn t work

422121
ubuntu	debian
if my memory does not fail me xandros was based in ubuntu or debian with a lightweight x interface

422121
versioning	upgrade	freebsd	debian
at the end i prefer to go instead with the latest versioning of freebsd 32-bits as it will get more support in the future offering the path to upgrade for new versioning than going to a dead end with debian 8

422123
decimal	ieee
we d need to keep 17 significant decimal digits to not lose information stored in a ieee 754 double-precision number

422123
decimal	ieee
if an ieee 754 double-precision number is converted to a decimal string with at least 17 significant digits and then converted back to double-precision representation the final result must match the original number

422123
x86	64bit	128bit	64bit
in practice depending on the compiler and architecture they re most often either ieee 754 double-precision 64bit like double s ieee 754 quadruple precision 128bit or extended precision 80 bit precision but often stored on 128 bits like when ksh93 is built for gnu linux systems running on x86

422127
short	base	base	fractions
short answer is the 1 10 is not a simple fractions in base 2 and it can t be represented by finite number of base 2 digits

422132
folder	directory
if i trash-put a file on the ntfs partition it is correctly moved to the .trash-1000 directory in the root folder of the ntfs partition

422134
sudo	passwd
if you cannot log in as root on the remote system but you have say the ability to run sudo without it prompting for a passwd you can mangle the command line like this

422157
cat	tee
- cat reads and pipes it to tee

422157
cat	tee
- tee writes input from cat to and pipes it to sed

422201
fflush	gets
once the buffer is full it gets fflush to the file system

422235
debian	linux
gnu linux debian 9.3 with openssh version 1 7.4p1-10+deb9u2

422250

422251
debian	linux
i have a productivityscripts project on github and when i install linux debian 9 i add this folder to path for ease of use

422272
ubuntu	debian
i have tried this in an ubuntu 16.04 and a debian stretch docker container the result was the same

422275
jobs	cron
i have a website on a hosting provider which allows cron jobs to be set up via cpanel

422276
debian	mint
i thought that s a success so i ve rebooted both machines and now my gnome keyring is empty on both mint and debian with me being unable to manually import the private key i tried it

422276
ecdsa	rsa
i don t want to switch back to the ecdsa or rsa keys

422278
debian	linuxmint
i ve also used older version of linuxmint in recent pass 18.2 as well as debian earlier from squeeze wheezy jessie

422309
debian	linux
the linux version is debian stretch

422310
filesystems	fat
useful on filesystems like fat that do not support symbolic links

422310
git-clone	git-init
the default is true except git-clone 1 or git-init 1 will probe and set core.symlinks false if appropriate when the repository is

422316
stdout	stderr
then search that output for either standard output or standard error and you ll be able to find the ids of any processes that are using the console for stdout or stderr

422322
strace	perf
you can then find out who s is doing writes using a tracing program like strace perf trace or by using ebpf

422352
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux

sudo	passwd
if i start i3lock as sudo i can then properly type in the root passwd to unlock the screen

422425
arp	dhcp
from the point of view of fundamental skills i understend not only dhcp dns too arp too

422432
ubuntu	linux
i use vmstat to get io stats from ubuntu linux

422434
ubuntu	mint
the issue is that you are mixing repos for different versions of ubuntu yes you say mint but mint is 93.44 ubuntu.

422434
ubuntu	mint
if it is anything like the regular mint ubuntu package you ll want the virtualbox-dkms and virtualbox-qt packages and it may not show in your main mint menu until you log out and log back in

422470
mouse	trackpad
i often dock this meaning i have 3 mouse input devices external microsoft mouse trackpoint and trackpad

422475
openbsd	linux
i can t speak for the linux kernel developers there is additionally no indication that it s the linux kernel you are talking about but i m assuming it is but on openbsd which i m more familiar with even moving to a new version of the same compiler is not something you d like to do just like that

422487
wordpress	joomla
i m running several clients on my server with different kind of cms solutions wordpress joomla prestashop etc

422529
sudo	passwd
i m just trying to cache the passwd for sudo

422562
solaris	irix
also for multi-processor environments if irix mode is off top will operate in solaris mode

422562
solaris	irix
you toggle irix solaris

422575
ubuntu	debian
this is using ubilinux based on debian stretch but the same behavior happens with ubuntu 16.04 and probably others

422575
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
i can easily enough configure regular sudo to asks passwd only every three hours by using visudo

422582
daemons	systemd
you ve bypassed systemd losing any advantages the daemons will inherit various attributes from whatever shell you ran appctl start from

422582
daemons	systemd
systemd s own daemons programs encourage this by being installed under a subdirectory of usr lib instead of usr bin or usr sbin

422608
kde	gnome
i tried gnome wayland and kde wayland and didn t see that bug over there

422614
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint

422696
mouse	keyboard
the gparted live iso allows for mouse and keyboard interaction with mounted volumes and has a very extensive manual available here

422712
bash	zsh
i installed zsh and changed root shell bin bash to usr bin zsh

422721
bash	zsh
is ksh syntax also recognised by zsh and bash though when used as the target of a redirection it s only supported by zsh and bash

422737
children	parent
tools like htop or top can show you processes displayed as a tree of parent and children

422749
ubuntu	debian
i have tried this on both ubuntu mate 16.04 and debian 9 with mate

422751
free	malloc
i imagine youâ re writing in c using malloc and free

422756
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i have tried ubuntu 17.04 and 17.10 and debian kali linux

422774
punctuation	words
there is also a regex class for punctuation characters in case the words is preceded sometimes by one of them

422834
restrict	shared
in order to restrict shared users moving around environments i implemented denyusers userid host

422836
bash	zsh
with the gnu implementation of xargs the one typically found on systems that also have an apt command and a shell like ksh93 zsh bash with support for process substitution you can do

422839
disk	ram
an error happened during dracut phase init ram disk

422844
cpu	irq
there are many knobs that would need tuning to achieve that from bios level disabling cpu power save some smi interrupts etc. to system level cpu partitioning irq balancing etc. to application level

422854
centos	linux
but you can also succeed by just installing the centos perl-uri package no need to go to cpan except if you need a specific version different from the linux distribution package

422865
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
if you don t have sgdisk installed you can find it in the gdisk package debian ubuntu centos etc.

422875
lte	traffic
my goal would be to make all my traffic go through my lte connection except for my gaming traffic specifically cs go so a rule with a destination port range of 27000-27050 should be good enough to split them

422878
x86	64bit
it is largely up to the kernel however there is a good reason to use the chosen calling convention on 64bit x86 it matches the chosen user-space convention

422882
x86	64bit
so from the userspace perspective 32-bit x86 system calls are defined in asm unistd_32.h 64bit x86 system calls in asm unistd_64.h

422884
bash	zsh
or simpler in ksh bash or zsh

422885
mediainfo	mkv
now many a time when running an mkv video file under mediainfo i get the info

422895
temp	tmp
as fox point outs the classical vi creates a temp file on var tmp so the alternative to see it should be not tested

422898
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	kde	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
examples of alternative desktop environments include gnome kde cde xfce and lxde pantheon sugar cinnamon mate enlightenment and budgie

filesystems	btrfs
filesystems specific tools xfsdump btrfs send snapshot ...

422910
lvm	btrfs
lvm snapshots but not with btrfs

422943
stdout	stderr
this applies whether or not the parent shell is still running. if stdout stdin and stderr are redirected this won t matter

422962
cat	tee
with process substitution the stdin stdout of the process is provided as a file so becomes as if you d used and cat some file and becomes as if you d done tee some file and

422997
bash	zsh
some shells bash zsh pdksh do support it mostly by accident

423033
libxml2	libxslt
xmlstarlet is written in c and uses libxml2 and libxslt

423041
lvm	btrfs
i have experience with full-disk lvm actually encryption so this time i only need to look at some btrfs specific questions

423041
lvm	btrfs
i have found this article on archlinux wiki and find this method is just the same as the previous encryption way i used some time ago except for the fact that they are using btrfs subvolumes instead of lvm

423052
uniq	comm
we then comply with comm s requirement by sort ing numerically -n and getting rid of duplicates with uniq

423054
opera	firefox
my system is porteus 3.2.2 and my browser is usually either pale moon firefox or opera

423077
opensuse	linux
is it possible in linux specifically opensuse to have an ssd and a hdd set up in such a way that they appear as a single filesystem yet data is always written to the ssd until full and then overflow to the hdd

423107
centos	linux
i am trying to build a project called ramcloud on centos linux release 7.4.1708

423121
debian	linux	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
i know that macos is a unix operating system but i don t know whether macos could be called an unix distribution in the same way gentoo or debian are gnu linux distributions

423121
unix	solaris
also this question applies to solaris hp-ux and other unices are they all unix distributions

423123
unix	solaris
similarly other mentioned oss are posix compliant and are certified unix systems but again they differ in kernels and variations on underlying system calls which is why there exist books on solaris system programming and it s a worthy subject in its own right

423123
unix	solaris
sun s solaris hewlett-packard s hp-ux and ibm s aixâ are all flavors of unix that have their own unique elements and foundations

423138
ubuntu	mint
mint version of firefox will be replaced by ubuntu version

423169
ecdsa	rsa
note that from version 1.11 you can have multiple ssl_certificate and ssl_certificates directives to cover different certificate types rsa ecdsa etc

423182
unix	solaris
also this question applies to solaris hp-ux and other unices are they all unix distributions

423182
tvos	ios
it is also used as the kernel for the ios tvos and watchos operating systems

423182
bsd	xnu
xnu combines the functionality of mach and bsd with the i o kit the driver model for os x

423182
unix	solaris
q also this question applies to solaris hp-ux and other unices are they all unix distributions

423182
unix	solaris
solaris unix svr4

423184
for-loop	loops
with the redirection of the file into the for-loop all reading from standard input in the whole loops will read from the same file

423203
ldd	glibc
i decided to check which versions of glibc i have in my machines with help of ldd --version command

423203
ubuntu	centos
why centos cmplains regarding glibcxx_3.4.21 while ubuntu owns glibc version 2.23

423210
filesystems	hfs	filesystems	hfs+
or is this not possible since the filesystems is apple hfs hfs+

423219
versioning	upgrade
as an additional complication the official modules have to be re compiled each time the kernel is upgrade to a new versioning

423239
spaces	delimiter
sort -n -r |head -1 | cut -f2 - date orders the directory and outputs the entire name of the most recently modified even if containing some spaces as cut default delimiter tab

423242
shadowing	named
this is somewhat similar to shadowing a binary with a custom script of the same named like it s usually done with wrapper scripts

423252
debian	linux
i m not on debian or linux at all so i can t say that this would definitely be the correct solution to your issue

423264
kde	gnome
i try with kde gnome xfce4 none works totally

423293
disk	ram
for to give virtual cpus disk space and ram to a vm in virtualbox you have got to have the physical free resources to match in the host computer you are using

423334
stdout	stderr
however when i run it as a systemd service it seems as though the application isn t capturing the stdout or stderr

423341
sudo	passwd
each terminal that opens asks me for the sudo passwd .

423341
sudo	passwd
so my question is how do i type in sudo passwd once and have all the windows run using that permission rather than typing it in per window

423343
daemons	systemd
on my openbsd systemd the only process that is running with an elevated scheduling priority is ntpd the time keeping daemons and sndiod the audio midi server on openbsd processes that needs to be able to run in real time or close to it without having to wait for other processes to do their job

423344
sudo	gnome-terminal
each sudo command you re running is being executed in a separate gnome-terminal and thus a separate tty and a different parent pid

423344
sudoers	passwd
one other option is to edit etc sudoers so that your user can run iftop without needing to enter your passwd

423346
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh it is easy to generate a range of numbers

423346
sorting	grouping
sorting such a large grouping of characters in a pure c locale is not possible as the printf generates the characters as pairs of bytes in utf8 and sort with a plain c locale will try to sort bytes

423353
debian	linux
using openmediavault v3.x nas server debian linux snapraid with raid6

423353
debian	linux
do i need the debian linux socket files which were backed up together with the system

423353
debian	linux
how can i safely delete socket files from a backup with one command in debian linux

423354
ssl	https
since i wanted ssl https i putted this instance behind aws alb using aws certificates

423383
debian	linux
installed on partitioned hdd alongside windows 10 my debian 9.3 with linux 4.9 64-bit also tried backported 4.14 and no sound

423383
google-chrome	firefox
in my new debian i have tried playing youtube videos from firefox esr and google-chrome then attempted to play wav files with aplay and used speaker-test with no luck

423388
filesystems	ntfs
as a result ntfs filesystems are left in open state which makes them unmountable in linux unless you first use ntfsfix

423388
filesystems	ntfs
on dual-boot systems it is probably best to disable windows fast startup if you want to access the ntfs filesystems from the linux side

423388
filesystems	ntfs
running ntfsfix on the whole dev sda disk instead of just the ntfs partition dev sdan where n is a number is not advisable and might cause filesystems corruption issues

423413
google-chrome	firefox
it was kind of treacherous that both browsers google-chrome version 64.0.3282.140 64-bit and firefox 58.0.1 installed in usr local firefox were nicely running side by side for a few days until a reboot made the change in ld_library_path effective for google-chrome

423414
xfce	kde
so i decided to purge kde plasma and switch back to xfce

423418
bash	zsh
i think zsh does it but i m only interested in bash

423436
folder	directory
inside var are files and folder from one user almost completely intact with correct directory structure and filenames just files missing on at least one place

423437
ethernet	wireless
i also wanted to enable it on all my ethernet ieee802 interfaces wired wireless

423444
spaces	delimiter
assuming input is spaces delimiter

423456
xfce	kde
for some reason both xfce s thunar and kde s dolphin file managers both show an 8 gb device in the devices list in the panel at the left of the file manager which for example also shows the cd-rom drive

423459
sudo	passwd
but whenever i run a command with sudo the second box asks for passwd where as first one does not obviously i never provided passwd for it and works as expected

423468
xfce	kde
this causes the device to be ignored by the hal and to no longer show up in the xfce or kde file managers

423502
subnet	packets
packets forwarded from that subnet reach internet destinations

423513
lapack	openblas
dlib will use cuda or using openblas s built in lapack

423517
subtract	add
if you add n you should subtract 4 or______5 from cols

423542
debian	centos
i have debian installed currently but could switch to something like rh or centos if needed

423561
ubuntu	linux
i was using ubuntu until about 3 days ago when i switched to arch linux

423561
ubuntu	linux
before i installed arch i had kali linux ubuntu and windows triple booting

423562
sudoers	passwd
this command super user do allows users who are listed in etc sudoers to run commands as root as the super user using their own passwd

423562
sudo	passwd
so sudo uses your regular user s passwd

and yes you could use bash or zsh instead of sh just be aware that sh loads much faster and when you re processing many files that could add up

in bash ksh zsh you can use something like to get the 3rd to 9th parameters as distinct words or to get them concatenated with the first character of ifs as joiner

dns	spf
gmail spam filter will not be an issue if you have a valid spf in your dns or just add the email address to your contacts and add a not spam filter

424540
udp	tcp
udp and ip packets would get silently dropped because there would insufficient room to store the packet and from what i gather tcp connections wouldn t work because the minimum transfer window size would be larger than the buffer

424542
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i know i can use lxc s post-stop hook to run sudo poweroff at the host level but that would mean i d have to allow a non-root user to shutdown the system without root passwd by editing the sudoers file which is not desirable

i guess this is about some linux distribution that is part of the debian ubuntu family as update-initramfs is part of debian initramfs-tools

restrict	shared
this function exists because after i install phpmyadmin pma i restrict it by chmod usr shared phpmyadmin 000 -r for security reasons and the above function uses me to temporarily permit pma for 2 hours 2 hours is usually more than enough for me to do my changes in the database

vpn	lan	wan	lan
when an authorized device contacted my server the server would set up the device to send all wan traffic to my vpn provider without passing through the server and create a virtual lan so my devices can communicate with each other preferably in a p2p manner without needing to send traffic through the server

when you go to run the installer for almost any major distribution including fedora opensuse linux mint debian and ubuntu it will detect any existing swap partitions on the system and add those to the configuration for the distribution you re installing except possibly if you select manual partitioning and in most cases this will result in the system being configured in a sensible manner

the process is very straight forward however it refers to arch linux but you can substitute the changes near the end to ubuntu or pretty much any other operating system instead of arch

425500

if you are new to linux operating systems i suggest you simply run ubuntu on your computer as opposed to using qubes os but the documentation should answer most of your question and the archlinux template building instructions is very comprehensive and will show you step by step what you need to do to have an ubuntu vm template for your qubes install

i m not sure if the mechanisms stallman mentiones without even knowing how accurate he was still exist in ubuntu in 2018 but do they exist in debian

425555
stdout	stderr
here is what i am using to redirect separately stderr and stdout to a function

425558
lseek	fcntl
i guess the question does not have a simple answer as there are hundreds of various linux syscalls and just considering a program calling open mmap lseek fcntl socket setsockopt ioctl clone shmat ... it does not seem to be an easy task

425567
puts	gets
i found that .profile gets loaded last and that puts .local bin and bin in the front of the path

openvpn	iptables
i am using openvpn and iptables on debian

425580
versioning	upgrade
after i upgrade my kernel the next time i start my machine several versioning of the kernel will be listed on the boot screen and i can use up and down arrow keys to choose what kernel i want to launch

425580
versioning	upgrade
each versioning of the kernel will take some hard drive space and each time the kernel is upgrade more and more space will be taken

425584
ubuntu	debian
it was removed in ubuntu 17.10 and was never available in debian

425595
init.d	pid
fyi after going through some of the init.d scripts i think the best place to put the pid files is var run without creating any extra directory

425597

ps - to actually use plain old vi you d have to be working on a legacy unix system solaris sorry guys it s going that way

ubuntu	centos
i have mounted a windows shared folder on my centos and ubuntu servers

425674
daemon	cron
it s evident that the cron daemon is working with the old timezone while the rest of the server is working with the new timezone

425674
daemon	cron
how can i fix the cron daemon s understanding of the new timezone

425674
daemons	systemd
you should also consider restarting any other long-running systemd daemons that may record timestamps like sendmail

425680
folder	directory
i verified that the data -size is being seen as part of the total used spacec on my root partition by checking the folder s size inside my root directory using du

425722
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i have an old linux software running occasionally in an ubuntu 8.04 virtualbox virtual machine inside my debian 9 host

425723
putty	winscp
i use winscp off windows because it understands putty credentials

425744
openbsd	linux
after reading through linux drivers net tun.c and openbsd s sys net if_tun.c i have come to the conclusion that they both use queues for the packets

425744
openbsd	linux
specifically linux uses a queue within the tun tap driver and openbsd uses the preexisting network stack s queue

425745
folder	directory
here s a bash friendly one liner that copies any folder that have a jpg in them into a folder called backup while maintaining directory structure

425745
folder	directory
first it creates an empty backup folder then the find command looks for all the files in the current directory that end with .jpg

425750
ubuntu	debian
are any such parsers available as command-line tools preferably on the debian ubuntu repos

425753
gdk	xcb	gtk	gdk	gtk	xcb
for example it s be nice to be able to copy an area from an xcb pixmap into a gdk or gtk pixmap or window any other gtk or gdk object

425753
xlib	xcb
i m pretty sure this is because i must use a separate display variable for xlib and xcb_connection_t variable for my xcb calls

425753
gtk	gdk
there are kludges i ve thought of which could allow me to get image data from one realm to the other but i m hoping to find out that gtk or gdk have a way for me to directly call xlib-xcb and share the same connection which i just haven t been able to find

425773

bash	zsh
i m on os x in iterm2 in zsh but i think i ve even had this problem in terminal and bash

425789
packets	multicast
those packets you are seeing are regular multicast services and while the process is similar to broadcast packets they are not broadcasts per se

425789
packets	multicast
as for seeing packets that are not for you you are supposed to listen to broadcasts and multicast packets announcements as they are normally sent to all stations

425789
backgrounding	multitasking
linux is a multi-user multitasking system and there is a lot of housekeeping functions happening on the backgrounding

425792
kde	gnome
when i attempted to use dde the system became practically unusable for anything but it occurs on gnome on xorg kde and gnome on wayland as well

425797
daemon	cron
if you have a cron daemon this feature automatic hourly snapshots should start automatically

425797
daemon	cron
however in my case i do have cronie installed cronie is a cron daemon

425797
daemons	systemd	jobs	cron
if you prefer to use systemd timers but keep a cron daemons for some odd jobs snapper is going to favor the cron daemons

425797
daemons	systemd
assuming one needs to keep the cron daemons installed as i do but wishes to manager snapper timers with systemd the solution thanks to jasonwryan is as follows

425797
daemon	cron
the solution works for me with cronie but if you use a different cron daemon your paths may differ

debian	linux
debian linux gnome terminal with the system configured as as en_us.utf-8

425913
mouse	trackpad
i checked and installed but it also doesn t work because i figured out that the root cause is that the trackpad is not recognized as touchpad but as simple mouse thus not using synaptics driver but evdev see x11 logs

425913
mouse	trackpad
the problem is that inside the file there is one section defined with matchdriver synaptics and as i said the trackpad is not registered as touchpad but as mouse so the driver is evdev

425913
mouse	trackpad
so i m investigating on why the trackpad is recognized as mouse

425913
mouse	trackpad
my question if anybody can help me with this or at least which component is responsible for determining if an input device is a mouse or a trackpad

425919
folder	directory
for clarity sakes caseit function looks up a mime type of the file passed to it by vacatetmp and unzips the files into the target folder - since archives can contain multiple directory hierarchies i have no way of knowing how deep the files will be created which is the reason for using recursive function

425923

centos	linux
i on on a linux server centos and am trying to open up a few ports for my apps with iptables

425944
bash	tcsh
switching to bash or back to tcsh which i happily used at my old job is not possible

425946
folder	directory
the idea is to separate the newly unzipped files and directory for each single source file in its own temporary folder

425984
put	get
if you want to get into other parts of the data you can put that in there too .clouds will look into the clouds field or you can read the wind speed with .wind.speed - always a dot before the name like you were writing javascript

426018
ubuntu	mint
if you wish to prevent sudo from being used on a system that has it somewhat integrated ubuntu mint etc then configure it properly via visudo i recomend actually and appropriate group membership for users

426101
versioning	upgrade
now i want to upgrade to versioning 3.31

426117
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
as mentioned earlier apt apt-get aptitude and even dpkg can be used to manage installations of software packages on debian systems

426121
bash	tcsh
and switching to bash or tcsh is not an option

426127
mtu	icmp
rarely you have to change it for lower temporarily when dealing with communications problems when firewalls are blocking icmp packets which do not allow mtu to be negotiated

426147
bash	zsh
what would be useful here is if bash supported the common like in zsh as a place-holder for the matched string in expansions

426170
filesystems	btrfs
this can be the case if you are using either zfs or btrfs for your filesystems

426170
filesystems	btrfs
for btrfs run btrfs filesystems show and see if you have any volumes that list more than one device such volumes should be treated like raid for what you care about here

426307
folder	dir	folder	directory
the solution was to rename all other files and folder in the parent directory of said dir that also started with ein by prefixing them with a 1_ and then go in the terminal type in sudo rmdir ein and hitting tab to let the autocomplete-fuction do the rest for me

426318

in order to make your server visible tu ubuntu clients in the debian avahi daemon config file change

426330
bash	zsh
can i combine ksh zsh and other shells with bash in the same workflow shell session

426330
bash	zsh
i am used to bash but i might need some behavior available either in ksh or zsh

426333
bash	zsh
ksh93 and bash and possibly zsh as well but i m not too well versed in that shell do offer a fair bit of commonality in their extensions to plain sh but there are situations where even though the syntax and semantics are seemingly in agreement strange issues arises from other differences

426361
mouse	keyboard
when i try to run sway everything looks fine but mouse and keyboard do not work

426369
freebsd	solaris
gnu locales seem to follow that some others like freebsd solaris don t but i won t blame them as that doesn t seem to make much sense to me

426369
spaces	delimiter
â¹ i believe the rationale is that the non-breaking spaces figure spaces zero width spaces etc are not included in the spaces category on the ground that they should not be used as delimiter iso30112 defines them as characters to be classified as white-space

426384
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu 16.04 xenial with kernel x86_64 linux 4.13.0-36-generic

426399
ubuntu	debian
this is definitely not supported as ubuntu and debian software do not mix and most likely the source of your installation woes

426460
bash	zsh
in ksh bash zsh you could do that whole loop in the shell

426462
daemons	systemd
for daemons and other processes started at boot-up the init process whether a traditional sysvinit or one of the new replacements like systemd may apply its own default path or just pass through the kernel default value

mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse delay while using linux mint 18.3 64 bit with the xfce user interface

426575
mouse	keyboard
the windows 10 partition does not have a discernible amount of mouse and keyboard lag

426575
mouse	keyboard
in linux mint 18.3 the mouse and keyboard have an unacceptable amount of lag

426575

this will be used only with a touch screen in a kiosk-like set-up although at this moment it still has a keyboard and a mouse attached

426641

alternatively you could use the slice notation on should work in bash ksh zsh

on most systems it s more or a lot more than this but you should be prepare to get the error message argument list too long when trying to execute commands like the 16 kb command line in the question

since kali linux is based on debian some of the tips could apply to your scenario

xlib	xdotool
since both xdotool and pyautogui use xlib i suspect that a solution that bypasses xlib altogether is needed

427002
versioning	upgrade
if you cannot find them on any of those repos then you will need to install the aforementioned packages manually or upgrade to a newer versioning of debian

427002
versioning	upgrade
debian 7 is reaching the end of support here soon so it is recommended you upgrade to a newer versioning of debian but that is another issue separate from this

unfortunately the graphical installation gui doesn t provide any such information and switching screens in virtualbox to the anaconda shell hasn t revealed anything useful either

it feels wrong to throw everything in my home directory but it also feels wrong to put something this trivial in my etc folder

ubuntu is upstream to linux mint and with that i saw linux mint is lightweight since it has unnecessary bloatwares removed which we had in ubuntu

427277
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	cinnamon	gnome
ubuntu gnome takes 780mb of ram in idle usage while linux mint with cinnamon takes around 440mb ram in an idle state. please note these are rough figures just to convey an idea i want to know out of curiosity what are the things removed that makes linux mint so lightweight

427282

switching	screens
and it only does so because your terminal description in terminfo either does not include capabilities for entering and exiting cursor addressing mode at all or includes enter exit cursor addressing mode capabilities that do not employ the decsm decrm private mode sequences that command saving restoring the cursor position in addition to commanding switching to and from the alternate screens buffer and do not explictly make up for that deficiency by including decsc decrc as well

note that the terminal emulators that are built into the linux openbsd netbsd and freebsd kernels themselves denoted by the linux-16color pccon and pcvt25 terminal types do not have alternative screen buffer mechanisms and so do not have terminfo capabilities for entering exiting cursor addressing mode and this is the only behaviour that you will get from any full-screen program on such terminals

and if any errors occurred as determined by the exit status of the command it sends the entire output stdout and stderr to stdout again in proper interleaved order

427569
stdout	stderr
stderr to command-substituted tee -a and stdout appending to same file

427570
spaces	delimiter
however when moving forwards or backwards fish will only recognize spaces or underscores as word delimiter not periods

427595
redhat	fedora
in fedora centos redhat

427658
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have two computers running linux mint and when i try to ssh from computer a to a remote server running ubuntu server 14.04 mc displays the interface correctly with lines but when i do the same from computer b mc displays characters

427676
google-chrome	firefox
i am on ubuntu 17.10 and firefox 58 can someone confirm it with google-chrome

427696
spaces	delimiter
to set a single spaces as a delimiter - add -d option paste -d file1.txt file2.txt

427710
daemons	systemd
i want to start a ptp daemons on systemd start

427729
centos	linux
i want to change the hostname of a running centos 7 server which is running mysql mysql ver 15.1 distrib 10.0.33-mariadb for linux x86_64 using readline 5.1

427733
ubuntu	debian
i am installing systemd units from a debian package that i am making myself onto an ubuntu 16.04 box and even though i have overridden dh_systemd_enable dh_systemd_start and dh_installinit my systemd services only start on reboot or if i manually start them

427733
debian	linux
because debian flavored linux automatically enables and starts systemd units they should be started on install right away

427736
google-chrome	firefox
move to hdd and create symlinks for downloads videos music .config .cache .thunderbird .mozilla .googleearth .acestream and others that you know or find out write frequent caches always find where your specific browser cache is and move it to hdd google-chrome and firefox are covered with these ones i believe but check for yourself

427773
subtract	add
also i am looking to assign each of these symbols characters a secondary value that will add subtract or do nothing to a running count

427792
rpm	yum
before you begin either yum remove docker-ce-selinux-17.03.0.ce-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm or rpm -e docker-ce-selinux-17.03.0.ce-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm as they may conflict with container-selinux-2.36-1.gitff95335.el7.noarch.rpm

427813
debian	linux
i m trying to do this booted from the sd card running debian 9 linux beaglebone 4.4.84-ti-r120

427828
debian	linux
the operating system is debian 8 kernel version 3.4 bananian linux

427828
wan	lan
since the routerâ s network card uses an internal switch i have to use vlans to separate the lan from the wan i achieve this via the tool swconfig

427828
vlan	packets
i have tried a few things including increasing the sizes of packets queues for my vlan interfaces as they were zero this changed nothing

427855
mktime	strftime
you would have to convert the time to a unix timestamp using mktime and then to the wanted format with strftime

427895
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
after it is installed it is in apt for debian ubuntu mint etc open a terminal and do

427898
mouse	keyboard
keyboard mouse- mouse click emulation

427931
xfce	cinnamon
i am using regular devilspie to do this in cinnamon not xfce but my understanding is that it does this the same way across wms that support the same protocol so this should work for you too

427944
translation	transliteration
its name is short from translation or transliteration

427949
stdout	stderr
isn t there some way to interpret the control chars coming from stdout stderr of child processes in the parent

427953
dpkg	apt
i would install those using dpkg -i but if you really want to use apt you could either add the 17.10 repositories with suitable pinning or create your own repository with those three packages using apt-ftparchive or reprepro

427967
disk	ram
during development of ml applications i often need a tmp directory for debugging and other stuff that does not fill up my ram but is stored on hard disk

427976
openbsd	freebsd
i deployed both a freebsd 10.3 and a openbsd 6.2 vm in vmware fusion 10 + vagrant + high sierra

427993
spaces	delimiter
assuming you have white spaces as a delimiter

427994
punctuation	words
i used to use pwgen to generate 16+ digit passwords until i wrote my own passphrase generator that randomly selects a number of words from usr share dict words and joins them together with randomly-generated 1-3 digit numbers and or punctuation

427994
punctuation	words
the random digits and punctuation and capitalisation increases the search space for brute-force cracking and helps to ensure that the password s strength isn t compromised by the predictability of the words dictionary

427995
ubuntu	centos
after that i installed centos 7 and it replaced ubuntu s loader with it s own

428001
installation	upgrade
using apt-get upgrade on debian left me with the decision to update to kernel 4.9.0-6 but the installation never finishes

428018
wav	flac
the original wav files are in music and the output flac files could go into music_flac

428021
filesystems	btrfs
this breaks any hard links and snapshots on cow filesystems like btrfs or zfs and anything else dependent on a file s inode number

428042
ubuntu	centos
i got the task to migrate a server form centos to another machine either with centos or ubuntu on it

428054
openbsd	netbsd
-i support was added much later to some other sed implementations like busybox netbsd and openbsd but they all aligned with gnu sed on both points

428057
ubuntu	centos
are all different between ubuntu and centos redhat

428057
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
note that even the apache2 config files differ in location and structure between debian ubuntu based systems and redhat centos etc tbh the debian way is easier to grok

428061
xfce	gnome
few hours later i ve installed xfce which didn t replace gnome dunno why but fixed the problem with x-session paranoia

428065
mouse	keyboard
i can not move the mouse cant use the keyboard or the touchscreen after waking up

428075
kerberos	ldap
now i want to enable some ms windows hosts access to a nas in such a way that user credentials stay in my ldap and kerberos infrastructure

428075
kerberos	ldap
at this point the only integration option that seems valid is setting up samba in ad mode which comes with its own ldap and dns but should integrate with mit kerberos and then work out the integration of my ldap and dns information with samba via synchronization scripts

428078
mtu	dhcp
the dhcp client daemon was not applying the mtu setting received from my dhcp server on my private network i have set the mtu to 9000

428089
ubuntu	debian
i have just had the same problem and it turns out that my version of unzip that is available from ubuntu repositories unzip 6.00 of 20 april 2009 by debian

428122
unix	bsd
i maintain a few pieces of software on a diverse collection of unix systems both on various linuxes and on bsd

428137
centos	linux
this is being run on centos linux release 7.2.1511 core using 2 x intel xeon e5-2660v3 with 2.60 ghz

428152
mouse	keyboard
i installed ubuntu 16.04 17.10 and i have the problem that the keyboard and mouse work only through the login process

428152
mouse	keyboard
after entering my password the mouse and keyboard stop working and the system shuts down after 2 minutes

428158
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu 16.04 with bash and mysql ver 14.14 distrib 5.7.21 for linux x86_64 using editline wrapper

428174
ubuntu	centos
how to find out it in my centos 7 or ubuntu 16.04

428203
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer 4 bytes which is relatively compact

428218
ubuntu	linux
if you are running ubuntu in the windows subsystem for linux you need to run some x server before you can forward any x client connections on your rasppi to it

428235
cat	tee
your more general question looks like a duplicate of or variation on tee + cat use an output several times and then concatenate results

428268
centos	linux
i am very new to linux and i am having trouble with mysql on centos

428283
jobs	cron
i m working on a redhat server with a lot of cron jobs

428303
filesystems	ntfs
mkntfs is used to create an ntfs filesystems on a device usually a disk partition or file

428303
filesystems	ntfs
how do i get it to accept the share1.dat file as a file and create an ntfs filesystems on this file that i can later mount and share

428312
spaces	delimiter
according to the posix documentation xargs should run the given utility with arguments delimiter by either spaces or newlines and this is what happens in the two first examples of yours

428312
spaces	delimiter
this is due to the implementation accepting spaces as argument delimiter with -n even though -i is used

428347
daemons	launchd
the most common argument that is passed to the init process is the word single which instructs it to boot the computer in single user mode and not launchd all the usual daemons

428353
filesystems	ntfs
does this problem has anything to do with the ntfs filesystems of the external drives

428368
ubuntu	debian
the ufw command u ncomplicated f ire w all a simplified front-end for iptables initially for ubuntu now also available for debian and other distros accepts cidr range specifications for instance

428377
ubuntu	debian
it s available in debian ubuntu

428430
pull	push
as you push pull images occasionally it gets stuck at one layer and the hash keeps changing

428447
centos	linux
i have some issues with unity gtk on centos linux release 7.4.1708 core with gnome 3

428529
bash	zsh
in zsh you can use the special associative array that maps to the content of the file named as the key note that it s not related to and predates bash s mapfile builtin which doesn t map files by a decade or so

428551
bash	zsh
in bash ksh zsh you could use the

428563
switching	screens
but then i removed wingpanel to switching to another version of it but now the screens is still black yet i can access another tty

428595
folder	directory
i would like to browse a folder in the home directory with desktop settings menu to select the folder containing the wallpapers

428616
udp	tcp
sidenote if you really want this reliably for any openvpn client you could also specify a proxy server inside the .ovpn file and implement a quick one yourself with something like nodejs openvpn does support http 1.0 connect proxies for tcp and socks5 for udp however socks5 is harder to implement quickly especially the udp part of that

428616
openvpn	iptables
there you would get the ip address reliably as soon as openvpn connects and you could run your iptables command before you open the socket to the remote host

428643
disk	ram
take the simple example of using pv to pipe a large file from a ram disk to stable storage on a usb flash drive which has slow write speeds

428652
minix	linux
you won t probably miss the xiafs minix filesystem and the old extfs old linux filesystem .

428658
sudo	passwd
i am searching for a way to configure sudo to not ask for a passwd e.g

428659
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
for the no passwd sudo it sounds like you have already found the solution but you need to uncomment the following line in your etc sudoers file

428664
cat	tee
the less obvious way is to replace the pipe to with a pipe to a function call that makes the decision to either tee its stdin to mailx or just cat it

428673
opensuse	debian
using apt-pinning i gave my opensuse build service obs repository the highest priority of 1003 where 1000 is given to the official stretch repositories and specified the packages i want from it yet for some reason debian 9 is using an older version of my vim-related packages namely 8.0.1520 vs the latest i ve packaged at the time of writing 8.0.1587

428689
rpm	yum
i had to use this rpm because i am forced to do yum localinstall due to company governance

428692
spoofing	traffic
while this works as intended i d like to be able to spoofing the client source address so that the http s requests captured match the tcp packets and other traffic also coming from the client

428703
bash	zsh
sure we could do this purely in bash ksh zsh too since it also supports associative arrays but it would be uglier slower and more prone to accidents with funny values

428705
solaris	aix
i want to get the last update date of kernel in aix solaris

428705
solaris	aix
i need same replacement for aix solaris as well

428709
ubuntu	linux
where advanced options for ubuntu is the parent menu ubuntu with linux 4.13.0-26-generic is submenu

428713
single-quotes	double-quotes
the single-quotes in that string are inside the double-quotes so do not prevent the variables from being expanded by the shell

428713
postgresql	mysql
you can usually write code using these libraries so that they require few if any changes to work with other databases such as postgresql or mysql

428717
spaces	delimiter
-w - use whitespace one or more spaces and or tabs for field delimiter

428748
centos	linux
i have the following centos install linux fqdn 3.10.0-693.17.1.el7.x86_64 #1 smp thu jan 25 20 13 58 utc 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux

428764
width	height
how it works the resize command measures the height width via some cursor movements and then sends those values to the terminal via escape sequences

428769
unix	aix
for the aix part instead of hard-coding the bos.adt.base fileset and instead of asking for all of the updates -- applies and commits -- but instead just the commits i would ask for the history of the fileset that owns the unix symlink which points to the kernel

428771
vim	sublimetext
for example sublimetext and vim on linux

428771
notepad++	sublimetext
or notepad++ and sublimetext on windows

428784
centos	linux
all machines clearly installed centos linux release 7.3.1611 core

428802
filesystems	xfs
root filesystems is xfs type

428807
put	get
i put in b43.blacklist yes and also nomodeset and those were able to get it to finally boot successfully

428817
sudo	passwd
the passwd that sudo asks for is your unprivileged user s passwd not the root passwd

428817
sudoers	visudo
see the sudo and visudo and sudoers manuals

428838
debian	linux
i have a two-level supervisord system on debian linux

428855
openbsd	freebsd
openbsd grep seems to be different from macos and freebsd grep in that adding the -w flag which requires the matches to be delimited by word boundaries makes return each word separately

428860
mouse	keyboard
user 1 i in my ubuntu machine with a keyboard mouse and monitor

428876
spaces	delimiter
for gnu xargs words are delimiter by sequences of spaces tab or newline character and with single quotes double quotes and backslash recognised as quoting operators for those delimiter and for each other

428876
spaces	delimiter
for words to be treated like in your approach where on bash they are by default unless was modified delimiter on spaces tab and newline and also subject to filename generation you d do something like

428916
debian	linux
linux version 4.13.0-kali1-amd64 devel kali.org gcc version 6.4.0 20171026 debian 6.4.0-9 #1 smp debian 4.13.13-1kali1 2017-11-17

428973
ubuntu	linux
by the way my main linux os is ubuntu 16.04 lts

428975
ubuntu	mint
i have tried fedora 27 mint and ubuntu 17.10 and the issue is the same in all versions

428979
folder	dir	folder	directory
i want to copy those folder from one directory to another say from dir xxy to xxz

429004
passwd	visudo
but i m going to be running this from capistrano so i don t want to be asked to enter the passwd so i added this to visudo like this

429012
sudoers	visudo
with the visudo command you edited the file etc sudoers which only applies if you prefix your commands with sudo in your case sudo service nginx start

429044
int	boolean
in most programming languages that are able to treat int as boolean a non-zero value not just 1 is true and the value zero is false

429044
int	boolean
so there is a subtle difference between the discussion about how int are interpreted as boolean in programming languages and in the shell and how error conditions are reported these are two related topics

429109
postfix	dovecot
i m having trouble understanding how postfix relays data to dovecot and looking for a minimal as little deviation from distro config files as possible but complete example on how to accomplish the following

429109
postfix	dovecot
so the way i see it i should have postfix accept mail for user mydomain1.com understand that it s destined for the user named someuser and relay precisely that to dovecot

429109
postfix	dovecot
however postfix always relays user mydomain1.com to dovecot which is definitely not what i want because i may have other email addresses pointing to the same user say

429109
postfix	dovecot
should i have separate password tables in postfix just for that or will postfix somehow consult dovecot and allow said user to send mail

429117
ubuntu	linux
i want to replace ubuntu linux on my current set up

429118
cpu	processors
for that configuration you will need to use a 32-bit virtualized os or change your vm s virtual cpu to be a 64-bit processors

429131
ubuntu	freebsd
ubuntu raspbian and freebsd offer the user to choose editor on first crontab -e execution so i selected nano editor

429138
filesystems	xfs
mkfs.xfs dev md6 appears to contain an existing filesystems xfs

429147
tunnel	lan
i ve found this routing lan traffic through ipsec tunnel but is already a bit advanced

429147
put	get
for instance how do i install on both machines generate and get both of the fingerprints and put them into each other

429151
xfs	mdadm
mdadm is also useful if you don t want to go to the trouble of having your rootfs on zfs - you can partition the 2tb disks to have an mdadm raid-1 ext4 or xfs rootfs and or boot and or swap partitions while giving the remainder to a zfs pool

429152
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
many docker base images start with a minimal install of an existing distribution alpine debian ubuntu centos etc and then you add whatever packages you need to it

429165
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout so it ends up in the log file and not in the terminal

429193
google-chrome	firefox
i need a headless browser for webscraping.recently i tried 3 different headless browsers phantomjs firefox google-chrome

429193
google-chrome	firefox
so that i moved to google-chrome headless browser with chromedriver but it also shows same errors as firefox

429209
dlsym	dlopen
a process is generating some c code in a temporary file tmp emittedcode.c compile by fork ing an appropriate process running some gcc -o -wall -fpic tmp emittedcode.c -shared -o tmp emittedcode.so that file into a temporary plugin tmp emittedcode.so and dlopen -s that temporary plugin of course later dlsym -ing appropriate symbols there

429215
spaces	delimiter
we just swap the columns around awk uses spaces as its standard delimiter so we say print column 1 then a tab then print column 3 followed by a space...then 2 etc.

429220
tunnel	vpn
this is vpn tunnel configuration for currently working tunnel

429245
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu 16.04 does not use firewalld by default such as rhel centos which is why firewall-cmd --reload will not work

429253
centos	linux
what is strange that it does not mention any linux installation just the volume names tells us it was centos

429267
versioning	upgrade
my current config above will break at the very least every time i upgrade to a new versioning of fedora

429269
16-bit	64bit
in the case of bios the 16-bit bios disk access routines become unusable as the kernel transitions the processor to full 32 64bit mode

429286
ocaml	rust
i would then code a shell-like process preferably in c or in some other language - go ocaml rust c++ python etc.

429299
put	get
so using your information you need to get the private key file from the laptop probably .ssh id_rsa and put it on server b call it something like .ssh laptop_id_rsa

429319
folder	directory
i want to delete all .xx files within the directory tree except where the files lie within a specific folder will always be the same title in the example called yyy

429319
folder	directory
i suppose i could use grep to remove any yyy folder from the output into a temp file use a while read loop then pushd and popd to move in and then out of the folder using a simple within each sub-directory then using the -empty switch within find to clean up any empty directory left as a result

429319
ubuntu	centos
final note i cannot add additional shell commands to the system and the systems used are a mix of ubuntu and centos so where possible it would need to use the pre-existing command set assume no other modules are installed except tree which i do know about

429353
gtk	motif
they ve added the + when they redesigned the original gtk the gimp toolkit based on motif to be object oriented meaning something like gtk on steriods i guess...

429357
ssl	https
if you re on macos there is also charles proxy app gui which allows view all of the http and ssl https traffic between the hosts

429359
freebsd	linux
is there a way i can do this under linux or freebsd

429372
next	except
restarting i3 in place mod+shift+r fixes the i3 elements - except the issue is guaranteed to happen again on next wake

429388
disk	ram
if you enabled hybrid sleep then this is backed up by saving ram to disk

429403
bash	zsh
see man bash man zsh or help command

429403
bash	zsh
may be a solution i have no zsh installed so my example uses bash instead

429436
int	chars
in the shell you may use just s as a placeholder for virtually anything in the formatting string unless you want things like left right padding 20s to use 20 chars for a right-justified string or -20s for a left-justified string a certain number of decimal places in floats .3f for three decimal places or zero-filling of int 08d for eight digits zero-filled etc

429439
folder	directory
i am trying to write a bash script which will copy a directory s content to a backup folder which will be created without using the -r switch

429439
folder	directory
i placed in some echo s at the script and i have noticed that the for-loop takes the first and only argument to be the path of the current folder - it absolutely ignores all files in the directory

429468
unix	bsd
also read this somewhat old informit article dragonfly bsd unix for clusters

429493
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
let us assume we have a linux distribution .iso image officially supported by either debian ubuntu fedora or centos like for example the one in the first link as the input

429497
rhel	suse
if you want that then you ll have to go with rhel or suse enterprise linux and both are more than what you need

429513
switching	screens
most display managers lightdm gdm kdm xdm etc can be configured to start up a second login screens on the same monitor allowing you to switching back and forth between user1 on tty7 and user2 on tty8 with ctrl - alt - f7 and ctrl - alt - f8 without having to log out
