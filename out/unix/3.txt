107510
ubuntu	centos
the log files var log messages var log syslog ubuntu or var log secure centos will typically have this

107515
mouse	keyboard
the x11 or just some parts of gnome like panels and partially windows details described below are frozen which doesn t allow to do anything with mouse although the cursor can move but clicking anywhere brings no results - panels are frozen the clock is standing etc and windows minimized but generally the system all processes obviously except gnome shell and hardware are working right - all leds main hard disk external swap disk network are blinking from time to time and there is a power supplied to usb ports so for example a keyboard is working and also some shortcuts like super+d minimizing and maximizing all windows but all i can see is only one blank window with plain surface and no contents displayed the other windows i probably moved to another workspace with a shortcut or they are not showed due to the problem but unfortunately not and i don t know the reason but i assume it probably never have been working before i just had no opportunity to use it in the past and check if it works even when it s pressed on external usb keyboard

107515
disk	ram
i m looking for even extreme solutions - the point is how can i execute even small piece of code in such a case to execute chvt or xdotoll or eventually hibernate processes and copy ram contents to external disk to secure unsaved data

107526

107753
chown	chmod
i tried chmod and chown but the permission stay the same

107777
rpm	yum
you don t need yum to install rpm packages you can simply do

107778
rpm	yum
you can use a command line tool such as curl or wget to still download the packages necessary to install them either using yum or rpm directly

107784
stdio	fflush
you will see the only difference being reliance on the modern stdio assets basically so i ve stripped the source of its references to inbuf fout dup and fflush and replaced it with what pwb unix does - but this in no way should alter the behavior as the algorithms remain untouched

ubuntu	debian
i have ubuntu and debian computers on my lan

107818
joystick	keyboard
it seems easy to bind a keyboard to a script but not so easy to use a joystick input instead

107824
ubuntu	debian
the articles on changing mouse acceleration in debian and adjusting scroll speed in ubuntu provides some input

107826
ubuntu	debian
i do not have a debian installation available but ubuntu also has the same package joystick

i want some of my programs to be in standard debian repository to be available for users of debian ubuntu first in sid then if eveything will be ok eventually available for just apt-get install

107855
disk	ram
also generally small refers to the install size hard disk space used and much less or not at all the actual amount of ram required etc

107855
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
probably you want to avoid the most feature rich ones like gnome and kde and opt for one such as xfce or lxde

107856
stdout	stderr
the default non -i interactive is to output to separate directories for stdout stderr which it does by outputdir hostname

107861

107940
sysv	systemd
if you re using the old sysv init systemd

107947
freebsd	linux
the following is based on reading not experience -- i am just starting out with freebsd so i have almost no real experience with it i m coming from mostly linux

107953
filesystems	btrfs
the target filesystems is a btrfs subvolume with no snapshots

107957
kate	kde
i m running standard debian wheezy with kde 4.8.4 and kate 3.8.4

107983
filesystems	fat
another comment here - don t use the external drive with a fat vfat filesystems the default for most usb devices

107983
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
otherwise you ll run into problems with permissions and filename handling linux filenames are case-sensitive while fat vfat are case-insensitive

108014
octal	decimal
the ascii escape character octal 033 hexadecimal x1b or or in decimal 27 is used in many output devices to start a series of characters called a control sequence or escape sequence

108061
postfix	dovecot
i also use it at a mail server running dovecot and postfix

108101
folder	dir
so when you create a new user the skel folder is copied to and after the first login you ll have your mail dir

108126
bash	zsh
there s no shopts in sh syntax shopts is bash specific nor which is a ksh construct also available in zsh and bash nor local nor let

108126
bash	zsh
for the same reason you cannot use bash s globstar though you could use zsh or ksh93 equivalent which don t have the same problem unless your bash is version 4.3 or above

108130
profiler	nvvp
for example the nvidia visual profiler will not start up when ran with optirun optirun nvvp but will run when executed normally by simply running the nvvp command

108135
folder	directory
you can t completely disable the feature mutt wants + to mean something but you can change the location to something that exists like or your home directory by setting the folder option

108158
perforce	cvs
support is available for the following types of d vcs subversion cvs git mercurial perforce vss starteam wikiswarm darcs

108165
filesystems	btrfs
think of them as fancy set of copy-on-write hardlinks that are consequently limited to the same btrfs partition that you will be able to mount as a seemingly separate filesystems in future you will be able to use different mount options for each subvolume snapshot

108167
filesystems	btrfs
apparently btrfs snapshots are actually read write making them more similar to zfs filesystems clones but that does not change their relationship to file copies

108167
filesystems	btrfs
this works because both btrfs and zfs are so-called copy on write filesystems

108170
minix	linux
then proceed to go through the next few dialogs selecting linux and an os that is as similar as possible to minix specify how much diskspace to allot it etc

108177

they show me the emergency screen ask for root password but after this re-login i still unable to umount my btrfs fs says it are in use

108197
umount	btrfs
but i m still not able to umount my btrfs fs..

108215
ubuntu	linux
for the gpos i believe you can use something like likewise to authenticate linux users into the ad see this article authenticating active directory users on linux with likewise open and this one titled likewise open - ubuntu documentation

108215
ubuntu	centos
i d hands down suggest using either ubuntu or centos in this scenario

108283
asterisk	pbx
the box is always on running a pbx asterisk

108283
jobs	cron
i have not been able to find any cron jobs that reads the hardware clock

108289
gtk	pygobject
if you want the python bindings for gtk 3 you need to install pygobject

108300
bash	zsh
beware that unlike the corresponding feature in ksh and zsh and unlike your find command bash recurses under symbolic links to directories

108301
stdout	stderr
what you cannot rely on with type is the output format or whether the output will be on stdout or stderr

108317
ubuntu	linux
i ve been using ubuntu linux for a couple years now but i still have trouble with permissions

108318
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
sox works on ubuntu in the ubuntu universe repo was installed on the live linux mint xfce 16 disk

108321
vim	geany
does anyone know what means where it came from and why vim has no problems with reading the file whereas geany can t read it at all

108337
unix	bsd
when apple switched to using osx which is based on bsd they switched to also using lf given bsd is rooted in unix

108345
ubuntu	mint
i built firefox 26 on mint 16 because the ubuntu 10.04 build utilities are too old to build it

108345
ubuntu	mint
so my question is which libraries do i need to move from mint 16 to ubuntu 10.04 into opt var to make firefox run on 10.04

108352
daemons	systemd
a lot of the desktop frameworks make this a little harder by running various user or systemd level service daemons - and sometimes these will be started on demand by a when the first program that needs them starts - look at the command line options of the programs you re running there are quite likely options to stop this behaviour and run the application in bare mode

108377
ubuntu	linux
then i did find out about mame version 0.145 available on my linux ubuntu machine and about running ms

108383
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux box ubuntu server 11.10 inside a windows active directory domain and is joined the domain using likewise-open

108409
opensuse	linux	opensuse	mint
the same error happens with other linux distributions opensuse 13.1 linux mint 16

108428
debian	mint	debian	linux
linux mint debian edition lmde is a semi-rolling distribution based on debian testing

108428
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
unlike the main edition of linux mint it is not derived from ubuntu and in fact is not compatible with the ubuntu repositories

108429
debian	mint	debian	linux
use this tag for issues specific to linux mint debian edition as distinct from debian

108440
filesystems	btrfs
on modern linux these days there s which de-duplicates on a btrfs filesystems but 1 without as much of the scan overhead 2 files can diverge easily again afterwards

108451
daemons	systemd
most of them are systemd daemons and can t actually log in they represent processes started by the init systemd

108451
daemons	systemd
the notable service daemons in unix-like systemd section of that wikipedia article contains some things from your list

108453
octal	binary
the chmod binary that i m using on android only supports the octal numeric notation though

108468
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux portage relies on use flags to customize compiling options for software

108494

switching	screens
when i switching between them use a key shortcut i see the new workspace move in while the old workspace moves out of the screens

108499
debian	centos
this is on my centos system buy your debian system likely has these as well

108506
daemons	systemd
daemons are typically started from init scripts which are executed by the init systemd running with root privileges

108512
folder	directory
it will also show the content of hidden directory and if that is not wanted will omit the contents of hidden folder

108520
fish	zsh
with zsh fish pdksh and at least some of its derivatives like mksh posh

108525
ubuntu	debian

108526
ubuntu	linux
you can boot using any livecd linux like ubuntu systemrescuecd ..etc

108528
vim	emacs
i am a vim user learning emacs commands for use in bash

ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	redhat	fedora
for example you mentioned redhat + centos + fedora rpm+yum support and debian + ubuntu deb+apt-get

108535
opensuse	linux
not to mention other rpm-based distros that don t use yum like suse opensuse mandriva linux rosa linux or mageia

108535
rpm	yum
i would also suggest you use the rpm system directly rather than yum why limit yourself to the 6 rpm-based distros that use yum

108540
sudo	passwd
if you have another account on the machine and still can do sudo in there sudo asks for the accounts passwd and not root passwd

108545
daemons	systemd
is mostly for systemd daemons account

108559
ubuntu	linux
using a livecd linux such as ubuntu you can open gparted gnome partition editor to organize your hard disk

108567
daemons	systemd
this is common for systemd users which are used to run daemons but are not intended to be used directly by a human

108568
ubuntu	linux
i use cylon linux which uses the updates from ubuntu 12.04 basically

108599
arp	icmp
i try with statics arp entries but the icmp request has the same problem it is not forwarded to pc2

108615
daemons	systemd
you have to add which users you want dropbox to start for to the init script easy enough and when the systemd boots it will start the dropbox daemons for each of those users

108662
ubuntu	debian
how to make a non destructive installation of debian 7.2 over ubuntu 13.10

108663

the double-quotes turns on quoting a form which has some magic and the backslash is capable of quoting a single character following it

108677
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	centos	debian	mint	centos	mint
the best advice i can come up with is install any easy distro fedora centos debian ubuntu or mint and use it for your day to day life

108682
debian	centos
it s available in debian wheezy or newer probably in redhat centos too

108690
sysv	systemd
you can learn various init systemd like sysv systemd etc

108697
daemons	systemd
having written several small daemons or web applications for my personal use i like to manage them using systemd i am using arch linux if that matters

108725
gentoo	linux
i have a non-uefi gentoo linux system and i am preparing a hard drive for another system

108746
hash	md5
i downloaded debian cd-1 and checked its md5 hash then i created a bootable usb using unetbootin

108746
debian	linux
i searched about this issue and found a solution to add nomodeset at the end of line that starts with linux when i edit the boot commands in grub using e this time it worked but debian was booting only in text mode

108780
xfce	gnome
xfce is a fast and light alternative and especially suited if you were using gnome 2 and find gnome 3 disappointing

108780
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
for older computers consider using lxde or xfce because they are less resource-hungry than gnome or kde

108788
mutt	msmtp
i use msmtp together with mutt on particular accounts for flexible smtp

108799
bash	zsh

ubuntu	linux
when a typical pc with linux like fedora suse or ubuntu boots up the steps will be as follows

108906
disk	ram
initial ram disk is loaded

108906
kde	gnome
14 on user log in the display manager will start a desktop environment like kde gnome or xfce4

108906
kde	gnome
the root process for a user s kde session will be called startkde the root process for gnome will be called gnome-session the root process for xfce4 will be called xfce4-session

108937
filesystems	fat
you can make a view of the fat filesystems with posix semantics including supporting file names with any character other than or a null byte

108959
versioning	upgrade
i m using the current 8.028 versioning of the kmod-r8168 package in centos 6 and i m experiencing random kernel panics during boot that may be caused by the recent upgrade to the 8.028 versioning no hard evidence yet

108964
mouse	keyboard
however there is a degree of consensus that clipboard should be used for windows-style clipboard operations while primary should exist as a quick option where text can be selected using the mouse or keyboard then pasted using the middle mouse button or some emulation of it

108988
stdout	stderr
runs my_long_running_proc and any console stdout stderr messages go into a file called nohup.out in the directory from which the command was started

109001
post	get
in lots of online post regarding how to rotate your iptables log files for example here rsyslog config files get reloaded by the postrotate option of logrotate presumably in order to stop rsyslog from writing to the old now compressed or renamed logfile and to the new logfile

109018
sudo	passwd
you can run root command like sudo command then it will ask for passwd

109037
stdout	stderr
redirect the command s stdout and stderr to a file save its exit value and then run it in nohup or better under a terminal multiplexer like tmux or screen

109041
x86	64bit
to my horror when i ran this loop and called ls i noticed a lot of files with random-looking filenames in my current directory tested on fedora linux on 64bit x86

109050
freebsd	linux
the file system is ufs it s an old freenas 0.7 installation but since ufs write support doesn t appear to be included in any linux distro i figured i get a live cd of freebsd to mount it

109076
versioning	upgrade
i was recently prompted to upgrade the virtualbox and did so to versioning 4.3

109089
versioning	upgrade
since 11.10 is unsupported this will not happen and you have to see if there are non-official maintainers for your versioning of firefox you might have to upgrade firefox to the latest versioning outside of using packages

109091
centos	linux
how is this done on linux centos 6.5 i686 i686 i386 gnu linux in terminal please

zsh associative arrays which predate bash ones by decades are different again

109151
rvm	bundler
having the resolved command would really help me debugging weird rvm bundler issues

109156
stdout	stderr
we call type -p on the first part of that up to the first space character with type s stdout retdirected to the shell s stderr via fd 3 so that the xtrace output is redirected to dev null

109184
folder	directory
note this does sort of mean it would be useful for all the stuff to be in a folder like tempfiles inside the home directory as you cannot really do this stuff to the actual home directory folder

109202
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
every linux distro is a gnu operative system with kernel linux and an x window system on top of x window you have the window manager gui such as xfce gnome kde that let you easily use your system

debian	linux	debian-based	linux
lethe is a deep freeze-like partition freezing software for debian gnu linux and lihuen gnu linux may work on other debian-based gnu linux distributions

109236
disk	ram
lethe makes the partitions behave like a live cd all changes made on the file system will not be saved on the disk but in ram and when the system restarts all the content saved in the previous session is forgotten and lost and the disk partitions are restored to their original state

109236
ubuntu	linux
there s also a video on youtube titled freezing a linux ubuntu system with lethe which demonstrates how it works

now i want xfce4-terminal my terminal emulator to use fish instead of bash

109341
fish	bash
i found that it supports a -e command line parameter for that but if i run xfce4-terminal -e fish from a gui application launcher 1 then i don t get the environment variables from bash

109341
fish	bash
its much simpler than what i was trying to do before and it avoids some undesirable effects of running fish inside bash such as having the environment variable set to bash

109342
fish	bash
a workaround i found was to tell the terminal emulator to run bash in interactive mode with the -i flag and then immediately run fish inside of it

109347
fish	bash
if you re aim is to get bash to read these variables and then launch fish you can change the switching slightly

109349
ubuntu	linux
a friend of mine who likes programming in the linux environment but doesn t know much about the administration of linux recently ran into a problem where his os ubuntu was reporting out of disk space on xxx volume. but when he went to check the volume there was still 700 gb left

109350
rpm	yum
i could use firefox vi in terminal yum rpm etc

109350
rpm	yum
i checked few solutions that suggest installing glibc but neither yum works nor rpm

109353
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
note that filesystems like jfs xfs zfs and btrfs allocate inodes dynamically so do no exhibit this issue anymore

109366
fish	bash
i recently noticed 2 features in fish and was wondering if anyone knew if these were also available in bash

109368
lvm	mdadm
in older versions raid was not supported and so one would have to set up raid mdadm together with lvm

109388
put	get
or to put it in another way where do the windows partitions get mounted to when mounted via the gui

109403
chown	chmod
i need some way when i will be not need to chown chmod or whatever my files after each transfer same as it works on shared hostings

109410
sudo	passwd
if you want to be able to become root with user s passwd bela in your case use sudo

109424
rpm	yum
when i use the command rpm -qa | grep yum

109442
debian	linux
i have used debian 7 wheezy - 3.2.0-4-amd64 smp debian 3.2.51-1 x86_64 gnu linux

109452
rpm	yum
given you already have yum installed you cannot do a rpm -ivh

109452
rpm	yum
to upgrade the yum package or remove it first rpm -e yum

109462
icmp	udp
reject incoming udp packets with an icmp message port unreachable

109462
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
if you re looking for more detail about udp tcp packets icmp you need to dig into networking docs and perhaps the man iptables too

109465
cinnamon	gnome
gnome terminal i think linux mint with cinnamon uses gnome terminal has two command line switches for that

109487
symlink	777
although the symlink is executable symlinks are always 777 it is the mode of the file it points to that counts

109490
stdout	stderr
when running ordinary services with systemctl start some.service i can find the full log for this service including what it has printed to stdout stderr as i understand it by running sudo journalctl --unit some.service

109513
ftp	telnet
i need to somehow re-enable telnet and or ssh in a device where i currently only have root ftp access

109513
ftp	telnet
i figure that i may be able to get in through the root ftp access monkey with an init script or something else then possibly gain telnet access or maybe set sshd to run later in the boot process

109514
put	get
when you re limited to ftp access only on a system your only real option is to get put files onto the device

109557
children	parent
a great deal of control of prm is maintained through a number of ignore options ability to configure soft hard kill triggers wait recheck timings and to send kill signals to parent children process trees

109561
daemons	systemd
instead of having such servers started at systemd initialization time and be dormant until a connection request arrives xinetd is the only daemons process started and it listens on all service ports for the services listed in its configuration file

109576
folder	directory
there is several ways to go about this you can link the directory to something you like as dopeghoti suggest but what works for me is set the default machine folder using oracle vm virtualbox manager go to menu file rarr

109583
wan	lan
are you sure to authentify against the same deamon on you lan and on the wan

109590
versioning	upgrade
if you run yum update or yum upgrade without any other parameters all packages on your system including yum will be upgrade so there really is no need to upgrade yum on its own unless you are upgrading fedora or centos versioning

109622
bash	zsh
this works with prompts using gnu readline such as bash ksh mysql python zsh and many others

109638
centos	linux
i m a linux newbie and i ve just installed centos 6.4 on my desktop machine

109639
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
to make your user able to run these commands without entering a passwd run sudo visudo to edit etc.sudoers and add these lines assuming your user name is martin

109657
unix	solaris
please keep in mind that some unix linux software that in principle should run on solaris might actually only be tested on linux because the developers do not have access to a solaris machine

109684
daemons	systemd
i didn t notice any change i was running it as systemd daemons and per-user from .xinitrc

109695
bash	zsh
in zsh and bash the command

109695
bash	zsh
nevertheless you should check your bash or zsh or ksh dot files for trap int invocations

109701
dpkg	apt
that s the point of having dpkg apt to your service

109701
dpkg	apt
if you need to remove something use apt dpkg instead and leave stuff done by hand as last alternative

109701
dpkg	apt
by this point you should have told dpkg apt to remove the old kernels too

109703
dpkg	apt
i m not sure whether the problem is that apt is letting the system get into a state where it can t recover dpkg is letting the system get into a state where it can t recover the package maintainer used a combination of dependencies which isn t supported or my limited understanding doesn t cover this case

109723
chown	chmod
so basically i want to know how changing ownership and permission with chown and chmod work from portability point of view

109733
daemons	systemd
if you run the rsync daemons as root on the server you can use the -o | --owner option to retain the same owner as on your local systemd

109733
daemons	systemd
on some systemd this may be possible even if the rsync daemons isn t being run as root

109734
emacs	gedit
but this does not seem to work emacs gedit and also tried xedit

109734
emacs	gedit
clearing with --clear worked in gedit but not in emacs

109792
stdout	stderr
usually cron will e-mail the user with any output wether stdout or stderr

109803
daemons	systemd
abrt consists of a daemons that monitors logs systemd crashes and triggers events based on the type of crash

109805
jobs	cron
one such bug in debian is covered here titled cron reboot jobs are not run

109805
jobs	cron
it s titled thread cron - reboot jobs not working

109805
jobs	cron
re cron - reboot jobs not working

109805
jobs	cron
jul 15 20 07 45 ravenwing cron 1026 cron info running reboot jobs

109814
children	parent
note that signal masks are passed from parent to child through fork exec so once a parent process has a corrupt one all the children it spawns from that point forward will too

109819
put	get
it s odd that you didn t get the freebsd boot code though as the install would normally put it there for you if you use the guided partitioning tool

109882
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
a bit of research on the net tells me to install synaptic package manager from the ubuntu software center to the above mentioned linux mint version

109885
debian	centos
take a look at the ispmail tutorials their are made for debian releases but it s easy to modify them for centos

109894
spaces	delimiter
rev reverses its output so the last field is the first cut with delimiter spaces to print it and rev to reverse the text back to normal

109906
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i have two linux distributions installed debian and ubuntu

109915
bash	zsh
or using gnu ls and gnu bash instead of zsh

109920
ubuntu	debian
if you are on debian and want to run some programs on ubuntu and assume you have a kernel which works on both then you can easy chroot to it

109944
sudo	passwd
i had hoped to avoid doing this throughout the day by typing su root and providing the same passwd i usually do for sudo

109945
sudo	passwd
it is configurable but by default sudo asks you for your passwd

109945
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if targetpw in etc sudoers is false default sudo asks you for your passwd

109945
sudo	passwd
if it is true then sudo asks you for the passwd of root or if you specified some other user with the -u option the passwd of that user

109950
sudo	passwd
as for what you were trying to do just sudo su root or even more simply sudo su and type your regular user passwd

109950
sudo	passwd
also systems that come pre-configured with sudo access typically have the root account disabled no root passwd you can enable that using the passwd command after becoming root via sudo su

109994
ubuntu	debian
i am trying to create python script that automates updating of pure python packages for debian or ubuntu systems

110014
debian	linux
i m still new to linux so i m still trying to understand where executables and their libraries are and how to install packages so i have debian wheezy 7.3 which has these python versions

110014
versioning	upgrade
on the python download page there is the source tarball how can i use that to install it separately like having another folder in usr lib like python2.7.6 and make the python link in usr bin point to the new executable or maybe upgrade the current versioning if it won t break anything

110016
pyenv	virtualenv
you probably are looking for virtualenv or pyenv or some other non-system-wide method to install python

110016
dpkg	apt	pyenv	virtualenv	pyenv	dpkg	pyenv	apt
the method using apt advance package tool and dpkg ensures that all parts of the system are working in harmony so you maybe want to install python in a separated path hidden of all the other programs that you can call at will which is the purpose of pyenv virtualenv

110039
stdout	stderr
each command inside the parentheses will have access to the same stdin stdout and stderr

110041
folder	directory
on the ubuntu server you can delete the contents of the .vnc hidden folder in your home directory

110074
vim	gedit
i ve added my local user to the www-data group and if i edit the file with gedit vim etc

110108
bash	zsh
also note that bash doesn t implement zsh globbing qualifiers so you won t get all the features of find there

110114
ubuntu	debian
install easily on debian or ubuntu

110117
sorting	filtering
i added this sed filtering to delete empty lines and 1 to 2 character words before you start sorting and counting

110137
spaces	delimiter
it takes a list of arguments often split by spaces newlines can be split by other delimiter and repackages them as a single argument optimizing the arguments so that they fit within a arg_max s worth of spaces

110139
bash	zsh
this works both in bash and zsh

110153
bash	zsh
in bash and most shells contrary to zsh

110153
bash	subshell
bash does not optimise by executing cmd2 in the subshell process which is why you see two processes the bash and cmd2 process

110155
solaris	sunos
i need to know what is the best way to measure memory usage on solaris and linux how can i see how much os uses and how much is used by app is it vmstat sunos and proc meminfo linux ok for that

110169
ubuntu	debian
on other distros debian ubuntu this file is typically called var log syslog

110183
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
presuming that the ubuntu package is compatible with debian that would be the safer bet as debian and ubuntu both use .deb package management while centos uses red hat s .rpm packages

110196
folder	directory
i want to use the mailutils app on a install of ubuntu 12.04.3 lts with a maildir format but every time i run the mail command the system looks in var mail user instead of the maildir directory in the home folder

110199
ubuntu	debian
of the list ubuntu 12.04 is likely to be closest to debian wheezy

110202
stdout	stderr
first the text you re trying to grab is on the command s standard error but a pipe redirects the standard output so you need to redirect stderr to stdout

110217
ubuntu	debian
some distros debian ubuntu include the command rename

110230
uptime	reboot
i save in my database the uptime of the machine so i am sure there was no reboot

110247
ready	each
i know some services depend on each other but to make an easy example during probing the network devices it shall take care of the audio too instead of waiting 10 s until the network is ready

110289
debian	mint	debian	linux
the easiest way would be to take the package for linux mint debian edition lmde and install that instead

110289
ubuntu	debian
lmde is 100 compatible with debian not ubuntu this solution works for debian but may or may not work for ubuntu

110294
ubuntu	linux
i have a notebook with ubuntu linux

110300
filesystems	ntfs
it has already been stated that ntfs can t have permissions changed but these permissions can be set on mounting the filesystems

110319
ubuntu	linux
does anyone know of a linux distro other than ubuntu which i can install from windows

110328
folder	directory
i don t understand the difference between var www path and usr local path on linux command because for instance at the moment i can see my red5 server folder is in the latter path and within that folder is webapps root demos path and has me wondering why it is there and why red5 directory is not in the first path

110338
kde	gnome
ie gnome and kde

110342
folder	directory
if i run the command cp -r foo bar the bar directory now contains a foo folder containing the two text files

110399
ubuntu	mint
but since mint and many other distroâ s is built from ubuntu maybe the correct answer should be ubuntu

110406
freebsd	linux
gnu and freebsd find also support looking at the birth time but note that that time refers to when the inode was spawn link count went from 0 to 1 it doesn t reflect the age of the content or when that file was available by that name in the directory it is linked to and not all operating or file systems support a birth time or a way to query it linux still doesn t as of 2014-01

110414
bash	zsh
caveat emptor this only works in zsh and bash

110422
hid	keyboard	mouse	keyboard
by the time udev is running to handle creating the device it s too lateâ the kernel has already attached the hid driver to the mouse keyboard etc

110435
xfce	cinnamon
well it s not clear what mint eye-candy exactly you re after and i don t know how to restore exact linux mint 15 xfce settings into an existing linux mint 15 cinnamon installation

110448
versioning	upgrade
when you later ran pkg upgrade pkg looked at the package data for vim and found that gtk2 support had been enabled in the installed versioning whereas it is not enabled in the pre-compiled package

110467
jobs	cron
you may run some cron jobs and ping some ip s when they do not answer then go to sleep

110482
freebsd	linux
but that s on linux dhcping dhcpdump and i don t have these on my freebsd i won t be able to install them

110513
apache	nginx
with nginx or apache on host

110515
rpm	yum
to uninstall the official version of java jdk you could use the following commands yum or rpm

110515
rpm	yum
i would recommend always trying to use yum if you can it does dependency checks that rpm does not

110518
apache	nginx
the typical approach is to setup a web server such as nginx or apache on either the router switch box or have the router switch box redirect ports 80 443 to a internal host that s running nginx or apache

110521
folder	directory
ps i have a solution and that s putting the icons and gtk+ in a folder that is in my home directory

110529
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian distros

110543
processors	hyperthreading
this means that with hyperthreading enabled the maximum number of processors cores is 2048

110546
filtering	grouping
if we want to filtering out a grouping patterns that come from error_log we d wrap our rules using the same logprefix regex

110549
centos	linux
on linux centos 6

110597
chown	mount	chown	chmod
dsl give me a cannot - as readonly filesystem so i try a chmod 777 dev hda1 and a chown 777 dev hda1 and a mount -oremount rw mnt hda1 none work although the remount rw does remove the readonly filesystem message but then just gives a cannot complete this operation

110597
filesystems	ntfs
so basically how do i move a file from a ntfs filesystems win xp from a live cd

110611
strcpy	strncpy
given that the arglist and environ are at the bottom of the stack this kind of scenario can happen if you ve got a bug in your code that makes you write on the stack past the end of what it s meant to write for instance if using strcpy instead of strncpy

110613
debian	mint	debian	linux
i am running linux mint debian edition essentially debian testing and the cinnamon desktop environment

110613
google-chrome	firefox
in those files i replaced all occurrences of firefox my previous default with google-chrome

110631
jobs	cron
each user s cron jobs are run with that user s permissions so you cannot set up a job as the user joe and access fred s files notwithstanding explicitly granted permissions or shared groups

110633
ubuntu	debian
i just checked on a debian and ubuntu server and a suse machine and only the ubuntu seems to add sbin to a normal user s path and it does so in etc environment

110640
x86	64bit
intel s 64bit architecture was called itanium ia64 not compatible with 32-bit x86 architecture i386

110735
rss	feed
i tried to do that by downloading an rss feed xml file from my vps provider which contains all the failures down states etc

110774
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	opensuse	centos
it s developed by canonical so it s been in ubuntu for quite some time and was part of fedora as well as rhel centos and opensuse for a time before they switched to systemd

110774
sysv	systemd
both these systemd make marked improvements over sysv init especially in the area of being able to start services in parallel

110812
installation	upgrade
i have a turnkey linux 12.1 installation that i would like to upgrade to turnkey linux 13.0

110824
bash	zsh
with ksh93 or bash or zsh

110837
pop-up	dialog
the problem with this approach is that at least on my system it pop-up an annoying graphical dialog asking if i want to link or embed the image

110841
sudo	passwd
when the sudo -i command finally starts it prompts me for the root passwd but immediately fails as if i had pressed enter but i didn t even touch the keyboard

110841
sudo	passwd
i don t have direct ssh access through the root user only through a normal user with access to sudo using the root passwd

110842
put	get
how can i get two files a and b and out put a result like this

110847
spaces	delimiter
it adds a spaces to the fol string which can then used by sort as a delimiter the second sed removes the spaces again

110850
sudo	passwd
the second sudo shouldn t need a passwd

110850
sudo	passwd
also sudo uses your passwd not root s

110852
rhel	archlinux
i am looking for the equivalent of rhel s yum -y in archlinux s pacman so that i can install packages with a shell script without asking the user questions

110854
division	modulo
we then calculate by calculating modulo division of the current value of and the number of lines in filea.txt

110866
zsh	tput	bash	zsh
using the zsh shell i ve noticed a difference in the behavior of the tput command compared to bash

110866
zsh	tput
for instance with zsh if you have many things output to a terminal emulator window and you re at the bottom if you do tput cup 1 you go back up and everything below is cleared

110882
xfce	gnome
therfore i would like to install gnome but also to know how to go back to my xfce desktop

110882
xfce	gnome
so what should i do after installing gnome to go back on my minimal xfce system delete all installed gnome related packages

110887
kde	gnome
installing multiple de s and such shouldn t alter the system in a way that affects any of the others much -- installing gnome will not step on kde s toes

110921
zsh	subshell
the shell gave me a job number 1 and 2 process ids t csh pdksh and zsh gives all the process ids the behaviour varies in other shells one for a subshell one for sleep 101

110931
sudoers	visudo
so i added this entry to my sudoers file with visudo

110975
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
do any common processes in distros like ubuntu linux mint debian use other ports that i need to allow

110983
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you may want to tell slim to call sudo shutdown -h now and sudo to not ask passwd for that command in your etc sudoers

110990
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs filesystems show for example just hangs presumably waiting for the balance operation to finish before it displays any information about the mirrored fs

110991
ubuntu	linux
by the way my linux is ubuntu 13.10 and gnome-terminal is 3.6

111009
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu studio is the most widely used multimedia orientated gnu linux distribution in the world

111018
disk	ram
basically if your ram is 60 full it will start swapping writing to disk and this will greatly slow down your system

111052
rpm	yum	dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
we re drowning in package managers now and don t need any additional ones at the distro levels rpm dpkg yum apt aptitude pacman portage etc.

111052
pyenv	virtualenv
take a look at tools such as rvm pyenv virtualenv virtualenvwrapper perlbrew renv r etc..

111057
ubuntu	debian
i am running ubuntu and i want to be able to boot into debian wheezy .iso which i just downloaded how can i set this up

111058
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	dpkg	apt
on debian ubuntu mint and other distributions using dpkg and apt to manipulate packages

111068
centos	linux
this is for centos 6.4 32bit on linux vps and actually i ended up reinstalling my system trying to figure my mistake but there was nothing wrong with my system set up

111070
folder	directory
create a temporary directory and move all the files that start with the character to this folder

111077
debian	linux
here s a video that walks you through how to do this titled installing debian gnu linux wheezy with gnome 3

111079
ubuntu	debian
i changed my os from ubuntu to debian but i found that fonts do not look as beautiful as they used to anymore

111081
ubuntu	debian
i m just leaving ubuntu for debian so i m not so familiar with it

111082
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i ve been using linux ubuntu debian and salix for a few years but have never been able to create a bootable usb drive from within linux

111094
mouse	keyboard
i found for example on askubuntu this somewhat similar question about keyboard and mouse problems

111094
debian	linux
in this thread in a linux debian user group one person had similar problems to mine but on very different hardware and observed the problems with debian but not with archlinux

111153
folder	directory
this will iterate through all letters convert them to capitals check if any file begins with that letter and if so create the directory with the capital letter as name and then move all files starting with the letter in question both lowercase and capital into the corresponding folder

111166
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	mint	centos	mint
android devices are generally incapable of wifi access and when i ran ubuntu centos and mint they all had similar problems

111192
ubuntu	debian
i m newcomers from debian ubuntu suse but i real like this clean distro

111195
sudo	passwd
simply asked to reset the passwd and subsequently they can use it only for sudo

111203
bash	zsh
or in ksh93 zsh or bash use the quotes where echo -like escape sequences are expanded

111219
google-chrome	firefox
both chromium and google-chrome do this but firefox my preferred browser doesn t do this at all

111227
bash	zsh
in ksh bash zsh this doesn t work if the variable is read-only

111230
redhat	fedora
on fedora and all redhat based distros the packages are named like so

111234
nas	qnap
a nice nas from synology my recommended choice qnap or drobo provides easy access over smb

111242
daemons	systemd
partitions get mounted daemons get started and the systemd boots

111248
sudo	passwd
it does not work because you are cating blah.png into sudo which is not a valid passwd

111261
bash	zsh
or with the ksh93 quotes also found in zsh and bash allowing x escape sequences

111272
folder	directory
the www directory is shared between the ubuntu vm and my windows os using virtualbox s share folder facitility

111305
freebsd	linux
you might want to try cream - a modern configuration of the powerful and famous vim cream is for microsoft windows gnu linux and freebsd

111316
children	parent
later edit and caution proceed with caution when killing processes their parent or their children because they may leave files opened or corrupted connections unfinished may corrupt databases etc unless you know what kill -9 does for a process use it only as a last resort and if you need to run kill use the signals specified above before using -9 kill

111321
switching	screens
how to switching to a screens using ctrl+a n where n 9

111333
bash	zsh
assuming you use a recent version of zsh ksh93 or bash and the filename doesn t contain newline characters

111341
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	debian
the free operating systems include the best known the various operating systems that run on top of the linux kernels popularly known as linux distributions the various bsds like openbsd and freebsd and over hybrids variants like the various debian os projects that run on top of kernels other than linux

111341
freebsd	debian	gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	debian
in summary debian fedora gentoo and freebsd for example distribute quite similar amounts of software so debian is not particularly unusual in this respect though it is likely that debian distributes the largest amount of software of any operating system though i have not crunched the numbers to find out for sure

111347
filesystems	btrfs
and home and home are created by btrfs when it is installed on your hd as the filesystems

111352
umask	mount
since umask on mount point applied on ntfs or vfat partition i had created block device using dd command then formatted with mkfs.vfat and mounted with command as mentioned above

111397
spaces	delimiter	for-loop	arrays
the only way i could think of was to store the keys in a variable delimiter by spaces so i could use a for-loop to iterate over the arrays

111405
bash	zsh
some modern shells provide associative arrays ksh93 bash â 4 zsh

111406
ethernet	wireless
i have been attempting to install arch linux on my macbook pro but the wireless and ethernet drivers don t work

111410
cvs	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn
you ll find cvs snapshots svn subversion snapshots git snapshots mercurial hg snapshots bazaar bazaar snapshots etc

versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
i did a fresh installation of fedora 20 in the free space of my hard drive after failing to upgrade from the older versioning

111425
ubuntu	mint
if you really want to get the version from the webpage remember that mint is based on and completely compatible with ubuntu so you can use the package for the version of ubuntu that your mint is based on

111429
profiling	debugging
both of these profiling are unfortunately in usr share pulseaudio alsa-mixer profile-sets and thus you can t really edit them i filed debugging bug 736708 about this. according to the documentation you could disable udev-based autodiscovery and manually configure everythingâ that let s you specify the full path to a profiling

111460
bash	zsh
i installed syslog-ng to use on my desktop gentoo 64bit upgraded to systemd was openrc before with openbox and slim only with my normal user to log all commands i type in the shell bash first then eventually zsh

111460
bash	zsh
aside from built-in options that are native to bash can we expect implementing a similar solution for zsh

111485
ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora
this is built in for redhat and fedora however you can install it on debian and ubuntu

111509
ubuntu	linux
thanks to music and exif metadata information in nautilus list view nautilus columns extension - ppa web upd8 ubuntu linux blog i learned about the nautilus columns python plugin and it was relatively easy to modify it to show a summary field from the first few bytes in a file

111524
ethernet	wireless
this would not be a problem except that i want to set up one client my laptop with its wired ethernet interface as lower priority than its wireless interface which will connect to my ap

111525
ffmpeg	libav
i don t have ffmpeg in my distro to test with but this has been verified with avconv from libav should still be the same in this respect

111544
bash	zsh
the next bit has nothing to do with awk the symbol is for output redirection and is used by the shell bash or zsh or whatever you are using

111553
bash	zsh
there is no out of the box feature like this in the current version of bash you can do this using zsh it s there by default

111561
zsh	tcsh
mac os x also ships tcsh and zsh for example mdash

111562
bash	zsh
alternatives to bash are zsh ksh csh etc

111564
bash	zsh
i d like to make a setup bash script where i install all the needed vpn zsh cmake python numpy ffmpeg libsvm opencv qt and send me a report via mail when finished

111567
bash	zsh
i d like to make a setup bash script where i install all the needed vpn zsh cmake python numpy ffmpeg libsvm opencv qt and send me a report via mail when finished

111576
fontconfig	freetype
freetype and fontconfig can be used by applications other than x11 for example for printing

111591
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu

111636
children	parent
the kernel will not terminate init 2 meaning its filehandles are closed its memory returned to the system pool its parent receives sigchild its orphan children are inherited by init etc just as if it had called exit see man 2 exit

111639
bash	subshell
bash doesn t have globbing qualifiers or any way to affect the sort order of globs or any way to turn nullglob on a per-glob basis or have local context for options other than starting a subshell hence the instead of above afaik

111651
daemon	cron
another solution would be to start the daemon using cron

111659
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
if you are using systemd as of today only slackware ubuntu and debian among linux distributions are using anything else you can set the user group in its .service file see systemd.service 5 systemd.exec 5 and browse through the copious documentation here

111663
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
and of much of the really-not-optional software comes in several alternative flavors desktop environments like gnome kde xfce ..

111664
stdout	stderr
otherwise change crontab and redirect stdout and stderr to a tmp file

111680
redhat	fedora
this is what the package looks like on redhat based distros such as fedora

111680
ubuntu	debian
i would assume that on debian ubuntu there is a similarly named package probably libreoffice-pdfimport

111686
installation	upgrade
assuming this is a real hard disk installation it can also be full because deleted files are not yet seen as free space for example if you just upgrade some packages used by programs actually running then the file --eg libc6.so-- is replaced by the new one but the inode of the old one is still in use

111726
bash	zsh
i have tried creating the symbolic link in bash and then switching back to zsh but zsh will still always remove the link and copy the file instead

111752
versioning	upgrade
usually you have to wait until the next release of your distribution to get new versioning of packages beyond incremental upgrade

111764
hash	hmac
it s the strongest hmac supported by my servers and admittedly it is weaker than sha256 but if i rely on ssh s own mechanisms to ensure message integrity in principle it should be enough to not have to spend a long time calculating and then verifying file hash when transferring stuff

111776
ubuntu	linux
the only issue i had when installing peppermint was the same one i had with several ubuntu based linux distros when installing on a machine with multiple partitions

111781
bash	zsh
in bourne-style shells such as bash and zsh the command set is a builtin which does two things

111793
sudo	passwd
i have sudo access but i don t remember the sudo or root passwd

111794
sudo	passwd
the sudo passwd is your passwd

111800
filesystems	xfs
grow the filesystems on dev sda1 exact command depends on the filesystems for xfs it is xfs_growfs otherwise you will see only 8gb as available capacity though the disk you created is larger

111804
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
if i want to make my own gnu linux distro based on ubuntu such as linux mint how should i start which code can i modify at first

111806
debian	linux	openbsd	linux	openbsd	debian
free- net- openbsd and some linux distributions debian only come with usr bin env

111811
ubuntu	linux
example of this in ubuntu linux

111811
solaris	sunos
example in solaris sunos

111833
ubuntu	debian
for instance for debian and derivatives such as ubuntu is what you need see here for instance or man apt-get source or search engine

111833
ubuntu	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux
get used to linux distros such as archlinux and gentoo once you are comfortable with fedora ubuntu you should learn a lot from them

111851
folder	directory
chroot sftp users who require access to multiple directory under same parent folder

111864
stdout	stderr
if i merge stdout with stderr as devnull sais it displays the lines well but i need to press ctrl - c

111865
stdout	stderr
the difference is that gzip --version outputs to stdout while bzip2 --version outputs to stderr

111865
stdout	stderr
merge stderr into stdout and you d see the expected

111867
pop-up	dialog
combining both answers works better in my case as i wanted the message to disappear after a short interval similar to a pop-up dialog box in a gui but keep everything contained in a single file

111879
debian	linux
i m using postfix mutt procmail on a linux debian and i ve some trouble filtering cron emails with procmail i just want to move them to the cron maildir directory but no lucky till now

111879
daemon	cron
rule below with noop nested block and else e seems like is the cron daemon part of the address creating the problem

111890
ubuntu	debian
see tex live and debian ubuntu integrating vanilla tex live with debian .if that doesn t work for you tex - latex stack exchange is probably a better place to ask than here

111902
mouse	keyboard
i have found others with similar issues that seem to believe it has something to do with vmware s mouse and keyboard driver that allows seamless integration of desktops

111939
sudo	passwd
if an attacker gains access to your unprivileged account he could alias sudo to send him your passwd or he could use a possible root exploit to gain root permissions

111947
centos	linux
but enterprisey distributions rhel sles oracle linux centos etc prefer not to bump up version numbers ever their users are extremely against even minor inteface changes

111956
jobs	cron
after doing the manual configuration setting up the cron jobs and restarting the otrs service i was able to log into localhost otrs index.pl using the default root credentials

111972
tunnel	vpn
i ve a remote server which is not connected to the internet but i can connect from via ssh to it through a vpn tunnel

111984
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
ubuntu and linux mint stores xmodmap settings in usr share x11 xkb symbols pc

111995
stdout	stderr
what is the faster way to launch any gui program from the terminal without waiting for its completion and stdout stderr logging

112003
jobs	cron
i run a few cron jobs where python processes are doing things with a postgresql database

112003
jobs	cron
i don t need help in solving the actual problem i can increase the memory reschedule the cron jobs turn off overcommitting of memory tune the postgreåšql settings change how the python programs work but first i would like to know exactly why this happens to make the correct fix

112014
wan	lan
realize that the performance of either of these is ok in a lan setting but less than optimal in a wan setting but both completely usable

112019
tunnel	vpn
what you could do is look into some sort of vpn encrypted tunnel solution

112024
spaces	delimiter
the following assumes a spaces delimiter separates a list of match spaces replace pairs occurring one-per-line in the file patterns.txt

112034
debian	linux
i m quite new to linux but i need to install wordpress on a debian wheezy machine

112085
folder	directory
sometimes new folder in the ntfs partition could not be created using the above way in evince for the reason of error creating directory permission denied and alternatively i have to create new folder under nautilus before i can save copies of pdf files into them under evince

112091
dpkg	apt
if you want to install something with yum verify 3 or 4 times that whatever yum will do is not in your system provided by apt dpkg

112139
solaris	bsd
it s also used on solaris and at least some forms of bsd

112155
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i know in etc sudoers one can put defaults rootpw but then sudo asks for the root passwd for all commands

112155
sudo	passwd
is there any way i can have sudo ask for the root passwd for some commands and the user passwd for others

112198
sudoers	passwd
you can turn turn off root passwd for specific commands and specific users by adding this line to etc sudoers

112209
bash	zsh
another way using ksh syntax works also in bash and zsh is to use arithmetic expressions and 1 or any non-zero value to mean true

112215
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems i currently have is ntfs but it would be good to have for ext2 3 4 as well

112216
debian	linux
my own linux machine at work actually a virtual debian 5 machine that runs via vmware player on my windows machine is set up by default to use a us-ascii terminal encoding

112229
manjaro	archlinux
previously i was using htop on 32-bit manjaro and it worked fine then i switched to 64-bit archlinux when starting htop it shows a blank screen and any key press does nothing

112236
udp	tcp
open the firewall ports udp 1900 tcp 65530

112240
daemons	systemd
note that the next release of redhat rhel7 which is already in beta and will almost certainly be out later this year changes how files are started up at boot time using a technology which i feel makes managing daemons services a lot easier called systemd .

112271
sudo	passwd
you should of course also setup firewall use the autologin with an account with low privileges require passwd when using sudo etc etc.

112343
lvm	mdadm
i never had much luck with the abstracted configurations mainly due to my lvm + mdadm setup and not updating my kernel the distro way

112345
unix	solaris
i m pretty much a novice when it come to solaris or unix when it comes to administration

112346
ubuntu	linux
my question is about linux in general but lets suppose my ubuntu isn t working property booting in tty or whatever

112358
debian	linux
the keryx project started as a way for users with dialup or low-bandwidth internet to be able to download and update packages on their debian based distribution of linux

112371
kerberos	ldap
my guess is that winbindd is using ldap as well as kerberos

112383
plesk	mediatemple
i m not sure if my question is specific to mediatemple plesk or linux in general

112401
kate	kde
as a side note since kde 4.10 kate has a mini map that can be enabled instead of the scroll bar through settings configure kate appearance borders

112404
rpm	yum
you can use rpm to determine which rpms have been impacted i d focus on rpms that are related to installing .repo files to start as well as packages related to yum itself since i suspect your etc yum.conf file or the lower level .repo files are at fault here

112404
rpm	yum
you can get things back into shape using rpm and yum

112409
tiff	pbm
it needs djvulibre-bin library for ddjvu decode to tiff format cjb2 because i don t know how to directly convert tiff to djvu djvm for insertions deletions of pages in djvu file tools and imagemagick library for convert for splitting page and converting to mystical pbm file format tool

112409
tiff	pbm
file.djvu --. ddjvu-- bifold tiff --. convert-- single page tiff --. convert-- pbm --. djvm-- out.djvu

112409
tiff	pbm
it works slow because of generating many tiff pbm djvu files

112410
bash	zsh
is there a way to switch bash or zsh from emacs mode to vi mode with a keystroke

113421
gentoo	linux
i have installed gentoo linux on a thinkpad t42 and an earlier version acer laptop

113421
gentoo	linux
i even planned to go further to install funtoo linux which is written by the original gentoo founder

113421
ubuntu	linux
so many things have forgotten even its trends and new linux distro ubuntu arch puppy c

113421
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux	gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
looking at linux distro from wikipedia the timeline based on initial release over 10 years are slackware debian freebsd gentoo

113424
gentoo	linux
currently gentoo sits at number 42 which is one of the lowest scores i ve seen for it since i started using linux

113424
ubuntu	mint	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	mint
ubuntu mint are essentially the opposite of gentoo where installs are almost always done from binary and everything is handled automatically for the user and just works

113424
debian	mint
i personally find debian is a good balance between the two but also run mint and an arch flavor called manjaro

113429
vmware	virtualbox
i install the virtualbox guest additions from the vmware dkms both host and guest build-essentials both

113435
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i configured the sudoers file so my user wouldn t have to type in a passwd to run halt and reboot with sudo

113450
bash	zsh
the zsh equivalent of bash s read -e is vared a lot more advanced as it s using zsh s zle zsh line editor

113450
bash	zsh
in other shells you can use some wrappers around readline or other line-editing libraries like rlwrap or you can invoke bash -c read -e... or zsh -c vared...

113461
folder	directory
in the nautilus file manager files 3.6.3 when dragging and dropping a file into a directory the behaviour appears to be dependent on the file-system location of the target folder

113461
move	drag
i am aware that i can force a move action using a and drag and also that i can force a move using the mv command line

113461
move	drag
however i wish to configure nautilus to attach the move action to the drag and drop of a file to a remote directory

113469
freebsd	debian
the problem is mod_deflate which is enabled by default on debian but is not used on freebsd by default

113471
daemons	systemd
a real world example of this would be systemd p spawning openssh s sshd q as a daemons which then spawns other instances of sshd r to handle each opened session

113474
move	drag
drag files to copy or move

113491
hex	binary
i would like to generate a raw binary packet from hex in the command line for the purpose of testing a protocol

113522
debian	linux
i m new on debian gnu linux and i installed filezilla but i don t know how to run it

113527
debian	linux
therefore i decided to upgrade libc6 on my debian linux nn15.project.org 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.46-1 x86_64 gnu linux

113527
debian	linux
description debian gnu linux 7.1 wheezy

113546
rpm	yum
what i would to assuming you don t have another package that depends on that specific version is to temporary delete it rpm -e libxml2-python then re-install both libxml2 and libxml2-python with yum

113546
rpm	yum
or grab the version of libxml2-python from your yum repo that matches the libxml2 package you are trying to install and use rpm --force to force a downgrade of it

113575
rpm	yum
on systems with package managers like apt or yum you can use them to list installed packages yum list installed and with rpm rpm -q myfavtool

113577
bash	zsh
with ksh93 zsh or bash

113579
rpm	yum	dpkg	apt
no when you install applications on linux distros ones that make use of package managers such as dpkg apt rpm yum pacman etc. as part of the software being installed the package manager has a scripting feature similar to those found in windows that can add scripts create scripts add users to the system and start services after they re installed

113595
ubuntu	debian
the one that comes with debian ubuntu is different but cpuid above can be compiled on other distros if their isn t a pre-built version already available

113641
tar	gunzip
note that it s what gnu tar actually does internally except that it will also report gunzip errors in its exit status

113672
lzma	lzo
i m using buildroot to generate my images and for sure there is the option of compression with the help of different methods lzo lzma gzip ...

113750
bash	subshell
there are numerous examples how this can be done on a single line in the interactive mode however i am doing it in a script in which i would like to use that array manipulated by awk outside the awk subshell in bash itself

113767
unix	solaris	centos	solaris	centos	linux
work has a linux stock erp custom system that uses the unix system v solaris sco hp-ux lpsched program that someone who used to work here compiled for rhel centos 5 i686 i have no idea why or how

113777
debian	linux
i am using arch linux and other users told me that it use the debian package which contains the certificate list compiled by mozilla spi and cacert

113777
debian	linux
i am doubt that other linux distro use the ca-certificate from debian too

113791
ssl	https
but it does not have ssl to include so its unable to make https

113791
ssl	https
2 therefore we needed a ssl proxy to that http so that the user always get https even behind the screen they are attached with http

113810
filesystems	hfs
i can t tell you how to operate on hfs filesystems because i ve never used it

113822
bash	zsh
should work in zsh ksh93 and bash is special an alias for in zsh like in t csh

113831
stdout	stderr
in read loop printf s stdout is duplicated with stderr so in 2

113833
put	get
and you can put any get in background to start another one with also ctrl-z to put a download in background when using it interactively

113837
trash	tmp
i just found out on fedora 20 that neither with thunar nor nautilus i m using xfce4 here i can t move file from var tmp to trash

113875

113910
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
the sudo command is configured in the file etc sudoers which determines who can use that command and what passwd is required of them theirs or their target user

113910
sudo	passwd
sometimes su and sudo have special behavior configured for users in certain system groups wheel that may allow sudo without a passwd

113915
clang	llvm
you can get clang 3.0 from elrepo or clang 3.4 from the clang llvm homepage

113927
vim	emacs
any serious editor like vim or emacs will be able to open and search through a 100mb file

113943
vim	emacs
my problem was for some reason vim was aliased to emacs

113953
filesystems	fat
while this could be done as almost anything you might be better off by introducing one step in between create a fat16 filesystems i would be rather surprised if your drum kit supported fat32 - see wikipedia article on fat for more details more likely it understands vfat on top of fat16 yet that s not that important here on r-pi and export it over usb

113956
chgrp	mount
chgrp the mount media data and media backup to created group

113966
apache	nginx
so can a whole host of other reverse proxy technologies such as varnish nginx apache haproxy and others

113981
debian	linux
does anybody know where to look for them in a debian linux server

113996
folder	directory
i entered .wine folder of my home directory there deleted the program named notepad

113996
folder	directory
how come this run on wine as the program name wine i deleted from the directory tree under .wine and there is no other program named notepad under this folder

114031
pop-up	dialog
if you do it netshade will pop-up dialog box telling you there s a discrepancy between ips the proxy you choose and the vpn

114034
zsh	tcsh
see zsh or tcsh for more advanced features

114037
filesystems	fat
is it possible to mount the root filesystems if it uses a different filesystems type such as ext2 or msdos fat

114043
solaris	aix
on os x like on many systems bsds solaris aix irix... the functionality of gnu tac is available in tail with the -r option

114057
freebsd	netbsd	mouse	keyboard
when running headless without monitor keyboard mouse attached freebsd versions 8.2 8.3 9.0 and netbsd version 5.0 has known issues freebsd pr 156596 netbsd 46596 to generate extremely high interrupt rates

114076
mouse	keyboard
the built in mouse and keyboard do not respond and i have to unplug and replug them before i get any response

114086
kde	gnome
the freedesktop group which has worked out standards used by kde gnome and others has tools for inspecting and launching apps based on their mime types

114092
chown	chmod
then you chown all of the directories to the new group and chmod them to allow members of the group to read and write there

114094
ubuntu	debian
i explained that if you install the motion package via either debian ubuntu or fedodra repos the installation would be done so that everything you needed to run motion as another user motion in my cases was done out of the box by default

114146
dpkg	apt
result of dpkg -l libstdc++6 apt libapt-pkg4.12

114151
dpkg	apt
download the apt package s to a local directory and install them directly with dpkg --install

114164
vmware	esx
i need only the values like vmware esx sccm etc to store in an array

114178
folder	directory
i created a folder on my home directory call junk and let s say i want to move all .cpp and .h files to it

114182
stdout	stderr
i ve read that when redirecting stdout and stderr to the same file using stdout is usually block buffered while stderr is unbuffered

114182
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stderr	fflush
if a very long line is written to stdout requiring two separate fflush of the buffer could it happen that a line from stderr slips in the middle

114188
debian	linux
i want install argos 0.5 to debian 3.12.6-2 2013-12-29 x86_64 gnu linux

114195
versioning	upgrade
in order to move up to this newer versioning of util-linux this dependency needs to be upgrade and the other package cannot move up to this new dependency

114201
dpkg	apt
therefore the obvious remedy is to manually download since apt is currently broken a squeeze apt packages for the poster s arch and install it using dpkg -i

114201
dpkg	apt
note it is possible that just step 1 + running a dpkg --configure -a will suffice to install apt but it will still be the wrong apt for squeeze so the preceding steps are preferable

114210
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried from google-chrome and firefox

114224
kate	kde
for example i use kde and the default .txt reader is kate then i want to execute kate test.txt and the terminal is disabled until i terminate kate

114236
rpm	yum
first head to and download the yum for linux yum rpm

114265
ubuntu	linux
i set up an nfs server on ubuntu server 12.04 for my linux based dvb-s receiver spark 7162

114277
put	get
try putting a -x at the top of the service script this will put the shell into debug mode so that you ll get any output that s being generated by the script

114291
unix	bsd
it runs on many platforms like linux unix bsd gnu hurd mac os x and windows cygwin

114296
ethernet	wireless
connects virtual machines to the internet through their host machines dial-up connection ethernet adapter or wireless ethernet adapter

114299
stdout	stderr
i run the shell script and redirect stdout to a file named out.txt and redirect stderr to a file named err.txt

114299
stdout	stderr
now from within the shell script i can tell if stdout or stderr is being redirected or not

114299
stdout	stderr
but once i know stdout or stderr is being redirected how can i tell where it is being rdirected to

114380
jobs	cron
do_machine_backup is one name for people to use run add to cron jobs etc

114391
openbsd	linux
i mostly do openbsd so a solution that s capable of running on openbsd is highly preferred but i d be happy to learn about the state of the art for these kinds of things in linux too as well as general advice of what s the best way to create something like this

114402
bash	zsh
in case there s a difference i m interested primarily in the answer for zsh but also in the one for bash

114403
bash	zsh
the above works for bash and zsh and most other shells

114428
ubuntu	debian
i cannot recommend sharing the apache server unless you are really in a tight spot regarding disc space the debian and ubuntu distribution would have to be very close for that to work as apache depends on each of the distros on other libraries

114428
django	web2py
if you can install apache on ubuntu then it is very doable to share the content between the different implementations and that could also be true if that content is dynamically generated with software like django or web2py

114428
ubuntu	debian
for the content to be shareable you have to mount the debian disc in ubuntu

114428
ubuntu	debian
and then have the configuration of apache on ubuntu point to the debian partition

114428
ubuntu	debian
this in general can be done by editing etc apache2 sites-enabled 000-default on the ubuntu system and have the entries match those of the setup on debian except for all the paths which should be prefixed with the location where the debian partition is mounted on the ubuntu system

if this is not possible because of hardcoded paths in the dynamic content software you can try to make soft links from the ubuntu directories to their equivalent on the debian partition

114428
ubuntu	debian
if you don t want to make the links you can try to mount -o bind the apache content directory on the debian partition to the equivalent directory on your ubuntu installation

114428
ubuntu	debian
i have not done this between ubuntu and debian but i have between versions of ubuntu 8.04 10.04 and 12.04 in the process of gradual upgrading with the possibility of switching back to the old software

debian	linux
some linux distributions have a program called mmv debian

i have a raspberry without screen keyboard mouse that does nothing else than launching a radio stream at startup

114446
ubuntu	mint
recent years partly owing to the popular ubuntu fedora mint and

114452
disk	ram
you should benchmark the throughput of kryptd without involving any slow disk to see what the upper bound really is on a ram disk using iozone

114473
ssd	sata
you can run either of these tools on sata and ssd hdd s

114475
stdout	stderr
add it to whichever startup script you want but redirect stdout and stderr to dev null and start it as a background process

114476
debian	linux
it is not quite official but it looks like systemd is coming to debian and after reading some of the heated mailing list discussion on that decision i am curious about the polarizing nature of systemd among linux users

114476
gentoo	debian
i run debian sysvinit and gentoo openrc systems and know nothing concrete about systemd though it looks like it is coming my way

114478
daemons	systemd
systemd has a very clever solution to the problem of tracking daemons

114478
sysv	systemd
probably the biggest caveat to switching to systemd over upstart or sysv init is having to embrace a lot of new complexities

114478
sysv	systemd
where sysv init was fairly trivial to learn how to manage and navigate in a few hours to days upstart will likely take you a week or more to get up to speed while systemd will likely take you much longer i m anticipating taking several weeks to gain enough cursory knowledge about it where i ll be able to both produce my own .service files to stopping starting services with the same ease that i now enjoy with sysv init

114486
filesystems	xfs
for example there s no type for an xfs filesystems -- people just use linux 83

114498
jobs	cron
this is most useful for cron jobs where you don t care about the output or input as the commands will not be running on an interactive terminal or where you want only the exit status of a command without any output

114523
jobs	cron
running sudo crontab -l shows the daily cron job above while running crontab -l shows that no jobs are installed for the regular user

ubuntu	linux
i have several linux machines all of them running the same kernel ubuntu 12.04 3.5.0-45-generic

114678
cpu	hyperthreading
unless the cpu is hyperthreading one should run one thread per cpu for optimized performance

114678
cpu	hyperthreading
this will make sense for computers that have hyperthreading as two jobs running on one cpu with hyperthreading will run slower than two jobs running on two physical cpus

114687
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp

debian	linux
how could i configure raspbian which is basically debian - but info for any linux would do as i will be able to figure it out how to adjust this to raspbian so that on boot it will just start my program that will display stuff on the monitor

114705
filesystems	btrfs
i need a tool or a script for two-way synchronization in place something that will work like bigsync except it will first test which file is more recent by inspecting the modification date and whether the contents changed after last use btrfs filesystems has nice features to test that and - unlike bigsync will work efficiently both ways afaik bigsync works efficiently only one way from source to destination

you might run into problems with cut if you have multiple spaces as the delimiter

114854
unix	aix

114885
stdout	stderr
why does redirection + pipe 2 1 | merge both streams instead of moving stderr to stdout

114946
mouse	keyboard
i encountered something that may be related where when vmware was configured to grab and release the keyboard mouse when the cursor moved in and out of the vmware window

114946
mouse	keyboard
while poking around trying to find evidence proving gtk at fault i used strings on the binaries to find a poorly documented configuration statement to increase mks mouse keyboard screen logging

114949
installation	upgrade
sometimes during the installation upgrade process some services need to be restarted or new files opened during the short window when my is mounted read-write these files are opened with write permissions

114949
installation	upgrade
after the installation upgrade is complete my post-invoke hook returns error because it cannot remount back to read-only

folder	directory
i need to write a shell script that traverses a given directory structure in multiple levels recognizes the video files scattered in the folder and copies all of them to another single folder

115076
daemon	cron
this is the cron daemon informing you that it has detected that etc cron.d mycron was modified and loaded the new version of the file

115076
daemon	cron
errors from the cron daemon itself will be in the same logs probably unless you ve reconfigured logging

115078
gmail	hotmail
most email servers can do it and were already doing it before gmail and hotmail existed and copied that feature

115078
ubuntu	debian
this is in the default configuration as shipped by some distributions such as debian and ubuntu

115096
versioning	upgrade
kernel upgrade downgrade is an option but i d rather get the correct perf versioning

115097
kerberos	ldap
googling about has lead me to believe that it s a cryptic way of telling that the kerberos schema hasn t been loaded into the ldap server yet

115099
opensuse	debian
i just don t understand why i cannot see my fedora 20 having it planned to triple boot it with debian 7 and opensuse 13.1

115223
folder	directory
for top 3 files and folder in the current directory

115231
ubuntu	debian
i ve been using systemd for a while in my debian installation just that to make it possible i had to add a boot parameter to the etc default grub file to make it work which is added to ubuntu boot parameters

folder	directory
i want to copy this file to another directory etc test which has the folder permission of 744 rwx r-- r--

kerberos	ldap
krb5_ldap_util is indeed cryptically trying to inform me that i haven t added the kerberos schema to the ldap server

115276
sudo	passwd
now if i execute this script for instance with sudo post-install.sh will i only be prompted for a sudo passwd once or will i need to enter the sudo passwd on each invocation of a command inside the script that needs sudo permission

115276
sudo	passwd
or will the initial sudo passwd entrance last for the complete duration of whole script

115279
sudo	passwd
q#1 will i only be prompted for a sudo passwd once or will i need to enter the sudo passwd on each invocation of a command inside the script that needs sudo permission

115279
sudo	passwd
note when you provide credentials to sudo the authentication is typically good for 5 minutes within the shell where you typed the passwd

115279
sudo	passwd
or will the initial sudo passwd entrance last for the complete duration of whole script

115279
sudoers	passwd
the default passwd prompt timeout for the sudoers security policy is 5 minutes

115290
folder	dir
i just wanted to comment that the easiest way to avoid the problem your having by only accessing the home folder of the user you log into is to log in as root as long as ssh.sshd_config file in etc dir is set up to allow this you will have access to your entire file system

115294
lvm	mdadm
in some brief exchanges on irc i have also received conflicing advice that mdadm the lvm tools and even fdisk are clever enough these days to take this into account and that i shouldn t worry

115299
vmware	virtualbox
i was using virtualbox and facing this issue but when i tried with vmware it worked perfectly fine

115305
ubuntu	mint
most things you will ever need are available in mint s and ubuntu s repositories and you can install them using either apt-get or aptitude from the command line or you can use synaptic or the software center for a graphical interface

115308

kde	kubuntu
i ve scoured the internet for the past hour or so trying to find anything similar and the closest i could find was mention of kubuntu and an issue with kde but that solution doesn t work for me

115338
solaris	bsd
the benefit of this command is that it is portable across linux solaris bsd

115339
ubuntu	mint
so i use mint a lot but wish to switch to ubuntu due to trivial updating ubuntu offers

115339
ubuntu	mint
i wish to get a list of packages to install on ubuntu that are pre-installed on mint even just the gui based ones would be great

115339
ubuntu	mint
note i am not trying to get ubuntu looking like mint just the gui packages that make life easy

115339
ubuntu	mint
i am also not asking opinions on what are the best gui packages out there just what mint has ubuntu doesn t

debian	linux	debian-based	linux
is there an easy way to boot a debian-based linux system from a read-only medium say a live linux read-only dvd and then use debian s .deb checksums signatures

115427
sudo	passwd
generally at the top of the script you assume it hasn t been run with sudo permissions and instead call sudo -v yourself which will prompt the user for their passwd to set up a sudo session

115427
sudo	passwd
then in your script you should be fine to call sudo on the commands that require it and only those commands that require it without further passwd requests

115427
sudo	passwd
if the sudo session does happen to expire during the script the user will simply be asked for their passwd the next time you issue a sudo command in the script

115432
ubuntu	mint
i then ran the ubuntu boot-repair tool on my mint 15 setup which detected and added mint 16 to 15 s grub menu

solaris	sunos
if you want to try this on a solaris sunos system change awk at the start of this script to usr xpg4 bin awk usr xpg6 bin awk or nawk

115595
chown	chmod
looking at the screenshot you not only did a chmod 755 on home kellogs you also did a chown 755 thus making that directory not owned by user kellogs

115614
bash	zsh
the notation being used there is a special form of quoting a string recognised by a few shells like ksh where it originated zsh and bash

ubuntu	linux
for linux ubuntu 12.04 the following works

115666
kerberos	ldap
for example microsoft ad relies on both ldap and kerberos to operate

115667
kerberos	ldap
in an ad domain the typical service records srv records published in dns are the ones pointing to ldap and kerberos servers

115667
kerberos	ldap
those allow you to use dns for the discovery so you don t have to configure explicit host names to use the ldap and kerberos services giving you more flexibility to add and remove servers in your ad topology

115667
kerberos	ldap
you find the ldap and kerberos servers in the ad domain by looking for the and srv records

i went to my lib modules 2.5.0-17-generic kernel drivers input tablet directory and noticed that there already was a wacom.ko file but it s older than the wacom.ko file in the input-wacom ... folder

115710
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
a really ugly way to do the latter that springs to mind is to put the man page directories under versioning control and add a hook to your package manager so that a commit is automatically done after every run of the package manager installation upgrade removals

115715
xen	openvz
the answer here is no you cannot run vm technologies such as this on top of xen or proxmox openvz

115724
bash	subshell
instead of using bash process substitution you may - from bash 4.2 on - use shopt -s lastpipe to avoid the subshell issue variable assignment in child process is not visible in the parent shell

115729
bash	zsh
you need a shell where one can trap sigchld excludes bash where the sigchld handler is executed straight away not blocked during a wait excludes ash yash where the sigchld handling interrupts the wait excludes ksh93 and zsh

115757
folder	directory
i also have shared directory home shared where i store my shared files this folder is also owned by user dbz

115763
sudo	passwd
using sudo is a better route to take it s more flexible you can configure it to allow only particular commands or even certain users to run a program script with or without using a passwd man sudo

115777
cpu	processors
processors intelâ coreâ i7-3537u cpu 2.00ghz ã 4

115778
sudo	passwd
you can also allow various commands to be run via sudo without a passwd by particular users by using the nopasswd option in etc suoders

115778
sudo	passwd
however now that you are aware of the risks it is possible to use sudo -ks to have sudo read the passwd from stdin

and hopefully that the horizontal separator line is draggable so one can readjust the height that the inner windows take up respectively readjusting the width through the master bounds goes without saying i guess

i m looking in debian wheezy for a way to split screen in two windows just like you can do in ubuntu or windows7 8

i m attempting to install centos 6.5 and ubuntu 13.10 via virtualbox and i seem to be getting conflicting issues

116231
folder	directory
what you can try is extract the content from the tar files one at the time and look at any files in the directory what you indicate as folder and use file on that extracted data to see if you find something that is some archive type

116231
folder	directory
make sure to rename each extracted output directory folder since they all have the same name

as sudo prompts for my own passwd i am wondering if i upgrade myself to super user or do i switch to superuser odiadmin

116308
sudo	passwd
using sudo means you only have to know your own passwd which makes life simpler for you but requires the sudo service to be configured to allow you to issue the su command so there are potentially security implications if that isn t done properly

filesystems	ntfs
see my answer to this q a where i cover it a bit more if you re interested titled fdisk -l shows ext3 filesystems as hpfs ntfs

116341
folder	directory
this is notably different from the way that maildir works where each e-mail is a different on-disk file with folder being implemented by way of separate directory

rpm	yum	dpkg	apt
probably the biggest caveat would be if you re system is having packages managed by some sort of package manager such as rpm dpkg apt yum pacman pkg_add etc

116510
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
most distros now provide another tool called alternatives fedora centos or update-alternatives debian ubuntu which you can also use to loop into the tools which might be outside the bin

i would like to know how i can do the same for as many as possible other desktop environments unity kde lxde mate cinnamon gnome2 gnome3 ...

116549
sudo	passwd
what may have happened is sudo is caching your passwd

116549
sudo	passwd
so after you ve correctly completed the implementation of sudo on your system you have to enter the passwd for the first command and after that it s cached for some time

116550
hex	binary
note that i would not like to search the binary using a hex editor unless this can be automated

116585
sudo	passwd
according to the man page the -n parameter will suppress a passwd prompt for the sudo command

116585
sudo	passwd
i assume root to be in group sudo and since the sudo line is after the root line no passwd should be required

sudo	passwd
you can do this by typing sudo apt-get install application which will then prompt you for the root administrator passwd

116744
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
the code should work with gnome 3 kde 4 unity and xfce

116777
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
tested on linux mint 13 i believe it should work on ubuntu and other ubuntu s derivatives and i hope it will work on any nix system with udev

many image viewing programs can load a color image in popular bitmap formats to the root window for example the xsetbg utility from xloadimage or the display utility from imagemagick or graphicsmagick

116808
ubuntu	linux
now when i run my usb from the boot menu the first screen shown is the options for linux try it for free install ubuntu and so on

116811
rpm	yum
i believe what s going on here is yum makes use of a wrapper library written in python that integrates it either to the rpm commands but more likely it s a library to rpm functions and so you won t find a direct one for one list of rpm commands coming out of yum as it performs various tasks

116816
debian	linux
linux debian

116825
undo	yank
then you have to use vim s undo redo functionality to go back to that editing state yank the text then redo the changes

ubuntu	debian
edit the suggested duplicate is for debian 7 and ubuntu and does not work on debian 6

116844
put	get
i think you are trying to run a process in the background if this is the case then is the character you put at the end of the line to indicate run in background and you will get your terminal prompt back

116845
switching	screens
i have a konig rs232 serial to usb adapter no ftdi chip but when i try to connect to a cisco switching router via putty screens minicom.... sometimes it just shows nothing but it is connected because when i remove the usb it says disconnected and sometimes it show garbage

centos	linux
rhel and centos as a clone keep a stable linux kernel version and backport all sorts of bug fixes and ocassional new drivers to it and ship the result

116880
ethernet	wireless
when i use wireless with 192.168.1.x and then i plug into ethernet port for example my rasbperry with 192.168.0.x address mind the 3rd octet i always loose network connection

116911
sudo	passwd
command sudo su - someuser works without passwd

116913
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
it s possible to remove sudo passwd prompt for non-root users by adding or uncommenting existing line in etc sudoers file

116917
sudo	passwd
if command sudo su - someuser works without passwd then you should be able to do this

116923
centos	linux
just off the top of my head while not the most cutting edge rhel centos scientific linux etc etc are quite a few years away from eol and run a 2.6 kernel

116927
sudo	passwd
so you are permissioned to run only one command ie bin su - someuser as root so this avoids su prompting for a passwd and the nopasswd means sudo will not ask you for a passwd to do it

116928
put	get
i then put bin false in for users who shouldn t get any of those and use pam_shells on the services where i want to use the shell to switch things

116931
debian	linux
i m testing a cdma modem on my debian embedded linux system

116946
ubuntu	linux
this is the one i used ubuntu howto compile linux kernel 3.8 3.x in ubuntu 13.04 12.10 12.04

116974
switching	screens
if you want to run emacs matlab or other commands in text mode in a putty window and switching between them run screens or tmux in the remote shell launched by putty

116974
switching	screens
screens and tmux are terminal multiplexer applications they provide multiple windows where you can run separate applications and let you switching between the windows

116981

117006
filesystems	ntfs
since ntfs is a proprietary filesystems created by microsoft how did the ntfs-3g developers manage to create an open source version of the ntfs drivers without referring to the ntfs source code

117018
folder	directory
- and then make install which will probably propagate firefox in the folder usr sbin or usr bin or any directory you will have setup during the . configure

117019
daemons	systemd
done to avoid filesystem fragmentation and to allow systemd daemons such as syslogd 8 to continue to function correctly after non-privileged processes are prevented

sudo	passwd
without asking for sudo passwd

117075
unix	solaris
i am running attachmate reflection for unix and logging into my solaris system

117089
xfce	cinnamon
it seems to be specific to cinnamon i tried on mate and xfce and it worked fine

117089
cinnamon	gnome
terminator is a fork of gnome-terminal and cinnamon is a fork of gnome

117089
cinnamon	gnome
the latest versions of cinnamon have become completely independent of gnome and in fact you can no longer have both gnome and cinnamon installed on the same system

117099
children	parent
you determine the pid of the display manager which is the parent pid of xorg determine the pids of its children and determine the user of all processes which have one of them as parent

117103
debian	mint
on debian i suspect mint is the same it appears that the password prompt comes from usr share initramfs-tools scripts local-top cryptroot

117108
bash	zsh
careful that assumes simple file names with no spaces if need to deal with something more complex go for assuming ksh93 zsh or bash

117109
stdout	stderr
can i configure my shell to print stderr and stdout in different colors

117109
stdout	stderr
show only stderr on screen but write both stdout and stderr to file

117125
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
so i compile this and then use sudo chown root and sudo chmod 4777

117139
cifs	smb
for example for windows compatibility network layer for cifs smb netbios for early versions aka as window shares the samba project developers used a network sniffer and a packet analyzer in such a way that they documented what those network packages contained for certain operations like sending a request to the port to list shares and then simulate the same operation but with their own code implementation as long as the network packet data send was compatible with what the windows server was expecting

117148
sudo	passwd
i have read allowing a user to use sudo without a passwd and followed the suggestions but it still doesn t work for me

117148
sudoers	passwd
here is my etc sudoers but it still asks for a passwd

117148
sudo	passwd
but sudo ls still asked for a passwd so this seems to be a general problem not specific to reboot

117152
sudo	passwd
you can then run it with sudo reboot without entering a passwd

117162
debian	linux
available key combinations on a 101 pc keyboard attached to a pc running zsh under xfce4 under debian linux i don t know who s in charge

117165
mouse	keyboard
so you won t escape having to run the command again unless you use a terminal-specific manual mechanism such as copy-pasting with the mouse in xterm or with the keyboard in screen

117170
stdout	stderr
note the notation will redirect both stderr and stdout to the .txt files

117172
debian	linux
i m using debian linux on an embedded system we use ppp to connect to the wan via a cdma modem

117208
sudo	passwd
however now when i run the script it asks me for my passwd for every instance of the sudo tee command examples shown above about 50 of them

117208
sudo	passwd
have to enter passwd again for echo blah blah | sudo tee opt file3.txt and any similar statements of the form given at the top of this question

117233
folder	directory
does anyone know of a program or even bash script that can take photos from various folder and then consolidate them into one place and organise them into a directory structure by date in the way that shotwell and simliar can if using a gui

117236
sudo	passwd
if you in normal user if you need to root privilege we need to use sudo it will ask sudo passwd

117248
disk	ram
similarly when there is a pressure on ram less used pages are swapped out to disk to free space

117254
daemon	cron
note that it s possible your cron daemon might not have etc cron.d

117254
daemon	cron
i do not know which cron daemons have it but vixie cron is the the standard cron daemon on linux and it does

117274
unix	aix
ok in our environment most users including myself as one of the unix admins don t actually have admin rights directly on the aix servers

117274
unix	aix
is there a way in an aix unix environment to just somehow share the logs folder out so the users don t have to drill down to the logs folder and possibly get lost or access something they shouldn t access

117275
versioning	upgrade
upgrading our versioning of evince is not an option as have to use the versioning that comes with solaris 11 which at the time we upgrade to solaris 11 was versioning 2.30.3

117277
bash	zsh
while some advanced features of other shells such as programmable configurable tab completion are not available and some design choices have been made to keep it small many features of other contemporary unix shells gnu bash at t ksh93 and zsh are available

117280
integer	unsigned
if someone arbitrarily changes the value of the unsigned integer maximum in limits.h then recompiles bash what can we expect will happen

117416
ubuntu	linux
i m going to replace ubuntu with arch linux on my laptop and i want to reformat it

117419
folder	directory
that gives you the size of each folder in your root directory

117448
afp	smb
the answer from dedmoroz is sadly the reverse of what is desired wanted enabling samba+netatalk in avahi should hide afp shares actual enabling samba+netatalk in avahi hides smb shares

117448
afp	smb
these days you want smb in preference to afp because since mavericks apple prefer smb 2 to afp

117454
manjaro	archlinux
i use archlinux and manjaro

117469
dpkg	apt
one downside of var log apt history.log is that it only logs packages installed via apt command line or package manager not those installed directly with dpkg

117474
ubuntu	linux
i am very new to linux ubuntu 13.10 and having difficulty understanding the file system particularly with regards to installing applications

117483
int	chars
this should be an int specifying the number of chars in an output line for numbers

117493
ubuntu	debian
the good thing is that you don t care that s all controlled by the package manager dpkg in debian based systems like ubuntu

117534
titlebar	window
| window titlebar n m x|

117557
folder	directory
in the tester user chroot directory create the following folder and copy the libraries

117592
sudo	passwd
if there would be no passwd on linux then i will still need to use sudo and click yes when any program asks for root privileges

117606
stdout	stderr
all errors are sent to stderr while all output is sent to stdout

117613
stdout	stderr
by default it would capture the stdout of the command into the variable and the stderr is printed to the console

117663
dnf	yum
starting in f20 users are encouraged to use dnf which is an off-shoot of yum that was forked in 2012

117665
ubuntu	centos
most of distro i used are centos ubuntu fedora etc

117665

117701
spoofing	traffic
is there anything missing so i dont have to stop and run the communication in host a everytime i try to spoofing and redirect the traffic

117709
subnet	vlan
it s a common implementation isolate layer2 with vlans and layer3 ip and routing with different subnetworks although a vlan can have multiple subnet inside of it

117709
vlan	packets
this allows one phisical interface to pass multiple vlan packets

117727
ubuntu	centos
i also checked in an older install i had 0.4.9 on centos 5.9 which does not have this switch but in ubuntu 12.10 which has 0.8.6 it does include this switch

117730
chown	chmod
perhaps doing a chown or chmod to the directory afterwards would set the permissions the way you want

117737
profiler	perf
it s possible to create a bitmap or a vector image out of the data collected by the perf profiler under linux

117756
hide	show
which show how to hide the icon portion

117820
debian	mint	debian	linux
you could also use a 64-bit firefox package from linux mint that will work on debian wheezy

117833
bash	subshell
fd 4 the temp file containing our here string is duped to fd 0 stdin this is where a process -- in this case the bash subshell -- would act on stdin

117836
kde	gnome
consider this example i ve installed fedora suse and i want to adapt kde gnome as my primary de but the default configuration provided in precompiled packages is very buggy and fail prone

117837
ubuntu	linux
for example suppose you re running ubuntu and you ve installed arch linux on another partition which is currently mounted at media arch

117837
udp	tcp
the kernel the tcp udp ports etc

117839
debian	linux
i would strongly reccomend getting into linux environment debian based one preferably since it is free

117839
vmware	virtualbox
if you want to really get hang of the things i would also suggest you to install virtualbox or vmware in windows and try your hands on in ubuntu guest operating systems

117840
centos	linux
1 there is a scientific linux distribution that is a repackaging of redhat much like centos

117840
ubuntu	debian
but usually what they really say is that they ve set the server up with ubuntu or debian lol

117840
ubuntu	debian
i m mentioning all that just to make it clear i don t have a strong prejudice and i have a lot of experience with at least fedora debian and ubuntu

117840
kde	gnome
i ve installed fedora suse and i want to adapt kde gnome as my primary de but the default configuration provided in precompiled packages is very buggy and fail prone

117840
redhat	fedora
fedora redhat differs from ubuntu canonical in that they focus their resources less on the desktop -- there s no parallel to unity for example

117840
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu generally stays more or less as up to date as fedora perhaps complicated by its relationship to the more conservative debian

117858
bash	zsh
in bash ksh and zsh but not in plain sh you can also use double brackets

117876
aspell	enchant
in dependencies it installed enchant and enchant had the option for some dictionary hspell aspell ...

117879
debian	linux
i know that for example in debian one could use dpkg-reconfigure tzdata to change the timezone of the system but i am wondering how one could change the user timezone if linux unix supports such an idea at all

117888
centos	linux
i want to use vlc on my website which resides on my vps set up with linux centos so i can play videos

117891
fossil	git
linux does not commit changes to a file unless one is using a version control system vcs like git or fossil

117897
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu the new debian 7.4

117906
for-loop	loops
the outer loops can be anything a for-loop with a glob as above a list of files or even a find command piped into while read

117909
unix	solaris
further to the above i have discovered that this only works on my unix box and not on solaris

117940
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
unfortunately touchpad doesn t work on any linux distribution tried mint ubuntu 12.04 ubuntu 14.04 mint 14 mint 16 also mint 16 with recent 3.13.5 kernel

117971
ubuntu	mint
so far this happens with mint fedora fubuntu and ubuntu while puppy mageia and dragora appear to work

117999
fish	bash
i m trying to add the following bash scripts to fish yet am having trouble getting the syntax in fish right

117999
fish	bash
the minion command works fine if i run fish after starting bash

118009
cat	tee
i included the unbuffered cat call because i m unclear about the current stdout direction but its probably redundant almost certainly it is as written anyway and the pipeline can probably end right at tee

118020
daemons	systemd
increase the verbosity level of cron add this line to etc default cron at least on debian based systemd and restart the cron daemons

118027
post	get
one useful trick to that end is to capture your network stream while communicating with the server in your browser then when your browser sends the post that gets you what you want send it again as a get instead and have a look at the results

118030
vmware	virtualbox
the workaround is to use virtualbox s bridged interface or if feasible use vmware or if you have the cash vmware workstation or a dedicated server running openvz or another more reliable virtualization technology instead

118039
bash	subshell
note bash is smart enough to not run a subshell for a single simple command thus the true .

118049
bash	zsh
check man bash and info zsh to compare what options they accept and what the defaults are

118049
bash	zsh
it is default on bash but apparently not in zsh

118066
unix	solaris
the main problem is that my script works in unix using gnu but not on solaris

118072
stdout	stderr
processes have two outputs one called stdout â for normal messages and one called stderr to output error messages

118072
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to the same place than stdout

118075
folder	directory
so i have a directory with multiple svn projects and i would like to search through all recent files in trunk folder by content in all projects

118077
gentoo	linux
on several linux machines some old custom variant of gentoo i have huge wtmp files up to gigabyte in size

to make a long story short and simple the story of bsd is the story of unix breaking free more than once up to 4.4bsd lite of at t s source code and licensing

118131
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
multi-platform network basically explain the differences between freebsd and netbsd or openbsd

if you want to quickly browse them there is a freebsd and linux kernel cross-reference

118143
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
this is specific for freebsd but the method and organisation are the same for openbsd and netbsd this cover the main 3 free bsd systems

and yes maildirs are a better idea as long as you have enough inodes to store a bunch of small files because they are more reliable than bsd mbox files and because we don t have to do that ugly workaround much maligned in the unix haters handbook of needing to add a before a line that begins from

mp3	wav
i was under the impression that the mp3s are written before the wav in which case the script would work fine since it wouldn t proceed until both wav and mp3 were present

118519
mp3	wav
audio machine processes audio files and spits out a wav and a corresponding mp3 with same name

118519
mp3	wav
my script below finds both wav and mp3 generates a hashsum for the wav and moves both to the output

if you don t have sudo permission you should boot into single user mode by editing boot option if you use grub or using a live cd then editing etc shadow file not etc passwd to remove pair of exclamation mark

118782
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this with iceweasel i am positive it will work for firefox as well but i don t know if it works with google-chrome or any other browser.

118789
bash	zsh
are there any ides targeted at shell scripting specifically bash and zsh scripts

118796
daemons	systemd
systemd promises to simplify most of that and thus reducing the room for mistakes that lead to security problems see the daemons manual

118806
folder	directory
instead this quite happens when in the working directory there are folder text files and symbolic links

118832
mouse	keyboard
the x11 server is not a library but a program handling at least a mandatory frame buffer and usually input devices like a keyboard a mouse or a touchscreen

118832
mouse	keyboard
some of them are not directly handling a physical display mouse keyboard combination but are purely software like xnest xephyr xvfb xvnc

118832
xlib	xcb
most of the clients are directly or indirectly using xlib at the lower level but there are alternatives like xcb

118838
ubuntu	linux
now you ll need to decide how much space you want to give your new ubuntu installation â i gave it about 40gb â plenty of breathing room and way more than basic system requirements but if you want to use gnu linux full time give it as much space as you can afford

118848
filesystems	btrfs
there are filesystems that have snapshot possibility zfs or btrfs but that doesn t copy any data at first

probably some ouputs is printed to stdout some to stderr

118870
stdout	stderr
so you can save all outputs by redirect stderr to stdout then write stdout to a file

118882
dpkg	apt
dpkg and thus apt honor this identification when removing packages and also on upgrades

118882
dpkg	apt
by default apt dpkg will not remove config files on package removal

118882
versioning	upgrade
on upgrade it will ask you to choose between the current versioning and the new versioning if they differ before overwriting config files

118882
versioning	upgrade
if the versioning of the package you are trying to re install has config files that conflict with the configuration files that are already installed it will again ask you before overwriting as it does on upgrade

vmware	virtualbox
i ve been using virtualbox and sometimes vmware for years and i ve never had any problem with the virtual network adapters no matter if the physical ones were wired or not

118891
vmware	virtualbox
how come they say that most wireless adapters do not support bridging if it works in virtualbox and vmware just out-of-the-box

118895
vmware	virtualbox
how come they say that most wireless adapters do not support bridging if it works in virtualbox and vmware just out-of-the-box

118895
vmware	virtualbox
i believe this is often why when you install virtualbox or vmware there are typically kernel modules that are getting installed and these products provide their own wrapping around doing this to facilitate making it easier

118895
vmware	virtualbox
i ll also highlight that neither virtualbox nor vmware could do this either at least not until more recent versions

118895
ethernet	wireless
under these products if you want to run virtual machines on a host that uses wireless ethernet adapters you must configure your virtual machines to use nat or host-only networking

daemon	cron
and like mentioned in this answer by terdon the cron daemon would check every minute to see if any job is to be run and trigger those which it has to

119192
folder	directory
mount points are just folder like any other so rsync is doing exactly what you told it to there is no error because you gave it a directory that it can see so it attempts to write to it

119193
folder	directory
make a directory xyz in the mount-point folder and change the permissions using chmod 000 xyz

119210
dpkg	apt
then you can download debs to the system to first reinstall dpkg and then reinstall apt

119210
dpkg	apt
apt and dpkg don t seem to depend on other stuff in usr bin so they might run

119210
dpkg	apt
once you have dpkg working you can get a list of packages you have installed using dpkg -l and then run apt to reinstall them

119365
ubuntu	centos
there s the contents of a livecd of centos that i mounted in the fedora 19 laptop and was able to mount it as a block device of the network on ubuntu

daemons	systemd
automatic restarting doesn t usually work even for systemd daemons

119462
daemons	systemd
however in this systemd you have very little control over individual daemons

119467
freebsd	linux
freebsd is not like linux

119468
bash	zsh
extrapolating from the zsh solution a bash solution

119470
daemons	systemd
this is a standard feature of a cron daemons which should be on your debian systemd

119491
jobs	cron
for all cron jobs that should be executed under a user s account you should use crontab -e

119500
ubuntu	linux
kali does not include any software that is not easily available for any normal linux distro so if its limitations are a hassle for you you might want to consider switching to a normal recent ubuntu

under the share there are folder corresponding to each username that are their home directory in windows

119524
starttls	smtps
quoting rfc 2487 smtps service extension for secure smtps over tls section 5 the starttls command

119524
starttls	smtps
if you want to connect to a smtps server that requires starttls then you can use openssl s ssl tls client for that purpose rather than telnet

119524
starttls	smtps
that will be something along the lines of openssl s_client -starttls smtps -crlf -connect smtp.example.com 587 for smtps starttls

119649
stdout	stderr
the above would redirect the stdout and stderr to dev null

119649
stdout	stderr
it works by merging the stderr into the stdout

119650
stdout	stderr
because using will redirect all your command output both stdout and stderr to dev null meaning no outputs are printed to terminal

119657
freebsd	solaris
freebsd and solaris 10 are examples of systems that do not come with bash installed by default

119675
bash	tcsh
based on this i m 99 sure that the failure of osx to supply an appropriate default .bash_profile is because when they switched from tcsh to bash the folks at apple simply didn t notice this little wart in bash s startup behavior

119679
bash	zsh
how can i configure bash zsh or tmux to complete the last matching identifier on the screen

119679

not a posix solution but gnu sort offers the -g option which supports a wider range of number specifications including infinity

119747
mp3	wav
if you want to send a wav or mp3 over the network then you have some digging to do

119758
tunnel	packets
even if you have authorized and established an ssh connection and maybe a tunnel the connection will break as soon as you unauthorize because then your packets again get filtered or dns or http redirected

119763
jobs	cron
as a solaris user i want cron jobs generated emails for the localuser server to be forwarded to my myuser sample.com email account so that i read only one inbox

119771

on redhat systems and those running related distros such as fedora or centos the crash driver can be loaded to create pseudo-device dev crash for raw physical memory access via command modprobe crash

119783
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
you should use the nsuserdefaults or cfpreferences apis or the defaults 1 command to interact with the preferences system

119799
gif	png
i know that it s possible to configure lynx to pass images png gif jpeg jpg to xloadimage xv or zvg and i ve looked online description of lynx configuration

119812

119815
centos	linux
i m wondering and searching a calendar for linux centos

119845
backslash	dollar-sign
the first pass expands to two and strips the first level of quotes so bye-bye backslash but the quoted dollar-sign remains and so becomes three on the second pass

119852
daemons	systemd
worry about what happens later use systemd to speed up boot by paralellizing configure to not run useless daemons .

119858
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if i have a script that does some root actions called sbin root_stuff and i wanted user bob to have this script run as his shell when he logs in via ssh i know i can set his shell to a script that runs sudo sbin root_stuff and then edit sudoers to allow this without a passwd for user bob

119864
nautilus	fstab
ok the summary is that nautilus uses gvfs and you need to tell udev to use gvfs too when reading the fstab entries you can do this using

119864
ftp	smb
nautilus uses gvfs as backend to mount ftp smb block devices among other things into the file system

119864
nautilus	fstab
nautilus ignores anything that it wasn t mounted using gvfs like using fstab and gives you a very rudimentary control over this using udev nautilus doesn t ask gvfs to unmount or mount devices that were not manipulated using gvfs that includes udev fstab mount and any other blob such as just unmount and mount

119867
kde	gnome
it also uses kde i think gnome 2 or mate might be more light weight

119875

chgrp	chmod
this can be done using chgrp and chmod to give the directories and files the appropriate groups + permissions

119948
ubuntu	mint
you could then look for a package from a different version of mint ubuntu or the backports for your release may be a good place to start looking if the release s version is older

119948

i aim to prohibit dhclient from updating my ntp config with servers received via dhcp as it is the default on debian ubuntu

i have 100s of folders with flac and mp3 copies of the same tracks

cifs	smb	xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
the attributes as handled by lsattr chattr on linux and some of which can be stored by quite a few filesystems ext2 3 4 reiserfs jfs ocfs2 btrfs xfs nilfs2 hfsplus... and even queried over cifs smb when with posix extensions are flags

120049
filesystems	hfs+
for instance the simmutable flag as stored by osx on hfs+ filesystems is mapped to the corresponding immutable flag in linux chattr

120051
jobs	cron
you might find that after 16 hours idle time you are swapped out anyway due to cron jobs starting at night changing entirely your active passive memory page footprint

debian	linux
debian 6 linux psb1 2.6.32-5-686 #1 smp mon sep 23 23 00 18 utc 2013 i686

opensuse	linux
having no idea how to deal with ipv6 and unable to find the answer on the internet i thought i would try a different linux so i have installed opensuse but it appears to have the same problem

120098
hide	show
f9 just hide and show this left pane i don t want

120100
processors	hyperthreading
it is better to specify the actual number of cores since there may appear to be more due to the processors having hyperthreading

120110
init.d	pid
in addition there was not only one command but a pipe of commands. because i wanted to stay with the etc init.d scripts i wrote a small tool pipexec this restarts the child if it terminates and can easily integrated into the etc init.d scripts because it also supports pid file handling

120112
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am running linux mint 16 but my experience has been consistent across other ubuntu derivates including xubuntu on a lenovo w540

120116
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
about why some users are in the wheel group that is a totally different story as freebsd like openbsd or netbsd users have to be part of the wheel in order to su root

120119
chown	chgrp
note the primary purpose you ll often times see root in other groups is to allow root to create files within these groups directly without having to do a chgrp or chown after creating files in directories that are grouped to one of these groups afterwards

120122
debian	linux
so i was wondering if you had any idea of a place i could get a pre-made iso of any preferably debian based linux distro with bash aptitude python 2.7.6 and crontab installed and with no xorg or xvesa or whatever

120150
sudo	passwd
and can x then call sudo -v without a passwd

120150
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i m trying to figure out what should go into the etc sudoers file to allow a user on ubuntu user id 1000 who has sudo privileges to execute a pre-configured full backup without entering a passwd

120150
passwd	visudo
i tried several approaches with visudo but regardless of what i tried i was still prompted for the passwd when running the script

120150
sudoers	visudo
i expected that adding a final line to etc sudoers using visudo like the following would work

120170
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
in addition to the unusual tcp udp and sctp host discovery types discussed previously nmap can send

120229
stdout	stderr
if in a script all descriptor is closed stdin stdout stderr because is called as daemon then you need find any exists file which not produces output

120234
gmail	hotmail
the idea is to send and receive emails messages between two computers with known ips and eventually with dynamic dns so that each can monitor the work of the other and that without connecting through an email provider like yahoo.com gmail or hotmail

120242
ssd	sata
i saw in this question that it is possible to place both a ssd and a standard sata hard drive into a single lvm volume group vg

120242
ssd	sata
is there a way to force the os to be on the ssd while the data is on the sata drive within a single volume group

120260
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you can tweak etc sudoers to have that sudo working without a passwd

120260
sudo	chgrp
in ubuntu if you are able to use sudo you are in the sudo group so you can use chgrp sudo sys.

120273
rpm	yum
yum is just a package manager over the rpm package system

120273
rpm	yum
so if you want to remove an installed package yum remove is the answer or in some extreme cases rpm -e

120273
rpm	yum
if you want to known more about rpm or yum man rpm or man yum

120281
hash	md5
adding remember 24 to pam_unix stores the old passwords hash with md5 which i find unnerving

120283
stdout	stderr
one thing that might go wrong is that pacaur might print progress data to stderr instead of stdout in which case the second line will probably need to be

120293
filesystems	btrfs
it |pipes its info to sed which strips off everything before the leading quotes the filename builds the btrfs filesystems defragment -verbose -flush-to-disk -compress-lzo filename command and hands it over a |pipe to sudo sh to execute

120298
redhat	fedora
there are 2 methods for installing and removing packages on redhat based distros such as centos fedora or rhel

120298
rpm	yum
it s true that you can make use of rpm s erase switch -e to remove a package but i often encourage new comers to use yum because yum has a more high level perspective of the system and can determine if the removal of a given package will impact other packages and yum can also remove other unnecessary packages when you direct it to remove a given package if they re no longer required

120298
rpm	yum
note so the bottom line is yum is just smarter about package management then rpm

120299
put	get
this should put an icon in your menu somewhere you can run it from there though i m not sure how you get it to have root permissions

120304
pull	push
you ll typically use one of the following methods when you need to push or pull files over ssh using tar

120312
filesystems	btrfs
some filesystems such as btrfs and zfs support general-purpose compression

120312
filesystems	btrfs
two major features of very modern filesystems such as zfs and btrfs make the relationship between file size and disk usage significantly more distant snapshots and deduplication

120312
filesystems	btrfs
traditional filesystems up to and including ext4 but not btrfs reserve a fixed number of inodes when the filesystems is created

120318
cinnamon	gnome
i don t know what cinnamon is built on though i ve a pretty strong hunch it s gtk since it started with linux mint after gnome 3 hit scene and was supposed to be the new gnome 2

120327
jobs	cron
i have some cron jobs set up to run some of them each minute

120341
bash	zsh
zsh ksh93 bash

120352
post	get
however -- and i think this is what some of the objectionable comments to your post are trying to get at although they do not formulate it clearly -- neither xml or html are turing complete and hence cannot possibly be used in place of programming languages

120381
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	redhat	fedora
gnu linux systems usually use either glibc fedora redhat family arch or its close cousin eglibc debian ubuntu family

then you can remove ubuntu from dev sda5 you could launch a live linux that contains gparted and remove the partition for example

120431
ubuntu	centos
essentially i would like to have centos 6.5 require authentication for privilege escalation operate pretty much exactly like ubuntu unity has for some time now

it showed up when mounting a cf card on ubuntu linux

120465
debian	linux
i have a debian embedded linux system that uses an sd card as the rfs

120473
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this can be done in httpd.conf or in .htaccess

120498
gnu	uclibc
in the interest of compatibility uclibc may also define the gnu glibc macros as used above it currently pretends to be glibc-2.2

120498
g++	gcc
fwiw over several years with software using autoconf i ve had more problems with unchecked-for gcc and g++ requirements than with checked-for glibc features.

120499
folder	directory
ideally it wouldn t be triggered if there is another completion available such as an already existing nm directory and only trigger if there is a node_modules folder that exists and complete if it is a part of a path such as - cd node_modules moment

120501
switching	screens
note if you can t disable graphics switching the above may not work and might cause you to boot to a black screens

120516
bash	zsh
tail writes 4096-byte chunks which bash reads 128 bytes at a time and zsh reads 4096 bytes at a time

120516

bash or zsh writes 4096-byte chunks which grep reads as fast as they re produced

120526
ubuntu	linux
i have triple boot system with win7 ubuntu 13.10 and fedora 20 installed.how to quad boot with kali linux

120531

also the above will work as expected presuming at least halfway-sane shopts anyway in both bash and zsh

120534
manjaro	archlinux
my laptop lenovo x230 did not load in uefi mode when i used archlinux or manjaro installation medias i see black screen when image started to load

120536
folder	directory
now what i need to do is whatever file number i have in primary_partition i need to go and find out those files in the machineb directory if the files is already there then copy it to primary folder in machinea but if the file is not there in machineb then it should be there in machinec so go and copy the files from machinec now and put it in primary folder in machinea

120548
folder	directory
i have a lot of files in my folder and sub directory like

120556
bash	zsh
not exactly what you were looking for but in order to import from bash to zsh you can use this node.js script

120561
unix	aix
these are portable among various unix flavors hp-ux aix etc. and among linux distributions

120565
sunos	bsd	solaris	bsd	solaris	sunos

120575
spaces	linefeed
in my gnu bash version 4.2.8 ifs has a default value of spaces tab and linefeed by default

120595
crypt	salt
if salt is a character string starting with the three characters followed by at most eight characters and optionally terminated by then instead of using the des machine the glibc crypt function uses an md5-based algorithm and outputs up to 34 bytes namely where â ¹stringâ º stands for the up to 8 characters following in the salt followed by 22 bytes chosen from the set

120679
folder	directory
edit i have since found that by using a folder in the root directory things get a bit further - i can list the subfiles

120684
hash	salt
in fact technically a password hash function isn t a hash function but a salt key stretching algorithm taking two inputs the password and the salt whereas a hash function takes a single input the data

120684
hash	salt
nowadays the password hash function is indicated by the characters at the beginning of the salt â these three values and a few more are de facto standard across many unices including linux systems based on glibc which is practically all non-embedded ones and some of the larger embedded ones

120685
redhat	fedora
i ve been trying to get monodevelop up and running for almost a week now first on my redhat and now on my fedora

120693
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
the criteria that pf 4 uses when inspecting packets are based on the layer 3 ipv4 and ipv6 and layer 4 tcp udp icmp and icmpv6 headers

120776
stdout	stderr
in a perl script i am capturing all the stdout and stderr using the below code

120780
stdout	stderr
in your case you could also change the log functions to write directly to the file instead of to stdout stderr

120781
cpu	processors
once in a while some program ok usually it s firefox will start eating up nearly 100 of a processors s cpu time heating up the processors and driving down by laptop s battery life

ubuntu	centos
i had done this on an old laptop that also had ubuntu 11.4 installed and centos ran fine in the vm

120887
unix	bsd
directions on how to do this are covered here in this raspian faq titled how do i mount directories from other linux unix bsd servers

120907
filesystems	btrfs
as data partition i have a multi-disk btrfs filesystems

120914
filesystems	btrfs
otherwise btrfs requires brtfs device scan call before it knows about btrfs filesystems on your machine

120915
kde	gnome
2 gb is plenty you just need a distribution which does not install a full kde gnome plus office webbrowser mail etc

120915
filesystems	btrfs
i would not rely on the sd card hardware to do wear leveling for you so a copy-on-write filesystems like btrfs is recommended

120922
ubuntu	debian
downloading the sysvinit-tools package for ubuntu 13.10 and comparing to my version debian jessie you can see that there has been a change made to that part of the code most likely to fix this exactly this kind of bug

120935
bash	zsh
i think it s not a property of bash or zsh csh .

mouse	keyboard
i was unable to continue the log in to the unity desktop because the system froze and rendered the mouse and keyboard inoperable

120967
cpu	processors
i can get this value from sysconf _sc_nprocessors_onln but there is also a line for cpu cores and each processors has 2

120967
processors	hyperthreading
i believe this represents the logical processors or hyperthreading that is accounted for

120967
range	max	affinity	processors
i m not clear on this because if i go to proc pid status theres the line cpus_allowed_list and that can range from 0-7 8 processors total but i also wrote a script to call taskset -c -p pid for every pid running and this shows every process of having an affinity list of 0-3 max

120973
ubuntu	centos
i am thinking of replacing ubuntu with centos 6.5 but am not sure if the hardware can handle it

120974
mouse	keyboard
you could try installing the vmwaretools which should allow for normal transitioning of your mouse and keyboard as the vm gains and loses focus

120987
debian	mint	debian	linux	xfce	kde

121053
bash	zsh
regarding the auto-switch between bash zsh well that s something else but very simple as well

121053
bash	zsh
so basically if you can create a bash zsh array you should be able to reverse it using only the 3

121053
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
it does not need to loops over the arrays in the way a for-loop does

121077
disk	ram
the reason why i ask this is to have a better understanding on the decryption process and how it affects the server s resource in terms of cpu and ram and whether disk encryption with luks is more efficient compared to file system encryption like ecryptfs

121080
centos	linux
i don t know enough about linux to know if that means centos 6.3 and 6.5 or if it s something else entirely

processors	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading
your cpu is a dual core cpu with hyperthreading intelâ coreâ i5-460m processors

121177
cpu	hyperthreading
you have also hyperthreading and so you have 4 logical cpu s

121177
cpu	hyperthreading
the tasks did normally not use hyperthreading and cpu s had only separate caches

121177
cpu	hyperthreading
you have a hyperthreading cpu so you ll never know which physical cpu is in use and the balancing of tasks normally does not result in a performance lost because they use the same cache

121185

121274
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
it was quickly followed by solaris 2.0 which kind of merged system v and bsd and was later adopted by most other unix vendors

121281
installation	upgrade
i d recommend doing your installation from the first cd image and then after the first reboot you should be able to connect normally and use apt-get update and apt-get upgrade to download install any needed updates

121286
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs cannot store ownership and permissions in the same way linux unix filesystems like ext 2..4 can

i have a usb bluetooth dongle on a linux 3.12.5 arm system

121866
bluetooth	usb
i ve been attempting to make a bluetooth serial connection from my android phone to the usb dongle on linux

121870
filesystems	xfs
same with other filesystems for example you can t shrink xfs

121871
udp	tcp
this doc does not mention tcp udp etc

121878
chown	chmod
in other words did you use the -r recursive flag when issuing the chown chmod commands

121884
filesystems	fat
unlike usual filesystems the filesystems which is mounted on proc which is called procfs doesn t load data from a disk or other storage media like fat ext2 zfs â or over the network like nfs samba â and doesn t call user code unlike fuse

121887
ubuntu	centos
i then replaced the ubuntu system with centos 6.5 and tried to restore iptables using

121887
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
in the past i have been able to restore iptables fron ubuntu systems onto debian systems but debian is more closely related to ubuntu than is centos

121903
kde	gnome
for example i m curious about linux video game emulator programs and noticed a list here it s unclear to me which of these require gnome which require kde and which of these don t work at all inside desktop environment

121904
gentoo	linux
i have a complex embedded linux software running on a gentoo derivative on which a certain piece of code gets executed regularly every 84 minutes

121923
folder	directory
the contents of mydomain.com are stored in public_html and the contents of test.mydomain.com are stored in folder test both in the same directory

121935
umask	chmod
so for example if your umask was 0022 the write bit is set in the group and other positions and chmod will ignore it if you don t specify a explicitly

121938
vmware	virtualbox
however if you do not want to affect your current files may it be windows mac or another linux os i recommend running a virtual machine like vmware or virtualbox - something like that - and you ll be fine

121940
stdout	stderr
here the stdout or stderr of the scripts inside the cron is unavailable it shows that run-parts command has run over this folder

121943
stdout	stderr
since cronjobs theoretically shouldn t produce any output since no one should be there to see it any output stdout or stderr is treated as if it s a possible indication of an error or issue and so an email is sent to the cronjob s owner to prompt them to check it out

121943
stdout	stderr
so all output stdout and stderr is sent through the local mail system to the cronjob s owner

121948
centos	linux
we have about 6 servers under linux centos

121989
ubuntu	centos
i tested with centos xenserver vm ubuntu and openfiler rpath

121990
versioning	upgrade
i have previously used ubuntu and know that to upgrade ubuntu versioning you can use the sudo apt-get dist-upgrade command

121993
disk	ram
when doing heavy disk io on my system 16gb ram 6 cores raid0 pcie ssd the system stalls and eventually crashes

122002
jobs	cron
you could then have cron jobs that could place the rules for each user in to that directory for the times you desire

122035
gentoo	linux
my gentoo linux is compiled with the offensive use flag enabled

122040
ubuntu	debian
in any modern day debian distro ubuntu knoppix sidux or simular i know out of the box you can plug this in and it should come up as another audio device

122040
skype	hangout
handy for freeing yourself form your computer with skype google voice hangout and cordless

122040
asterisk	pbx
if someone knows how or where to edit this maybe just maybe it can become a fxs usable by asterisk pbx

122045
centos	linux
i am a linux beginner and have centos 6.4 installed on vmware

122061
spaces	delimiter
in the 2nd example you can see that the -s switch has omitted any strings from the output that do not contain the delimiter spaces

122066
vim	emacs
unfortunately to my experience at least if you use emacs in terminal you can t really change color schemes emacs contrary to vim is meant to be used in its own window not in cli

122085
stdout	stderr
you can also make a wrapper around your shell to redirect stderr to stdout like which would allow you to see stderr in your netcat session but would not give you real terminal functionality

122087
sudoers	visudo
editing the file etc sudoers using visudo

122089
sudoers	visudo
why you should use visudo instead of manually editing etc sudoers

122089
sudoers	visudo
once i had root access i used visudo to fix the sudoers file

122089
sudoers	visudo
visudo is a lovely little program that checks the syntax of the sudoers file before you save it so that if you do something monumentally stupid youâ ll know about it before it becomes a problem and prevents you from getting back into the system as root

122094
ubuntu	linux
both the gui based linux installation and the command-line only installation of linux i have are ubuntu 12.04

122118
tunnel	vpn
once the vpn tunnel is established the vpn client 10.8.0.6 can ping the vpn host 10.8.0.1 and vice versa

122118
openvpn	iptables
iptables output from the openvpn server virtualbox host.

122119
ubuntu	debian
i want to make an debian or ubuntu unattended iso for my fog server - to boot up system installation via lan

122130
sudo	passwd
setup your ubuntu user to be able to sudo without passwd you ll need your passwd for this

122162
stdout	stderr
to make this work you need the command substitution to capture stderr but not stdout

122184
ubuntu	debian
so i used the package resolvconf in debian therefore also in ubuntu to add some stuff to etc resolvconf

122190
ramdisk	umount
when switching another root device initrd would pivot_root and then umount the ramdisk

122190
stdout	stderr
chroot . attach stdin stdout stderr to the new dev console and exec the new init

122197
unix	bsd
some traditional unix systems have a group called wheel but often being in the wheel group is only a prerequisite for becoming root and the user must also know the root password and run su that s how bsd uses it in particular

122197
ubuntu	debian
some distributions such as ubuntu and debian include a group called sudo and a rule â œmembers of the group sudo may run command as rootâ in their default configuration

122203
umask	chmod
the advantage over the 022 umask is that in that setting in order to make a file editable by users the author must do two things set the group and extend the permissions chmod g+w

122208
bash	zsh
one point in time i tried oh my zsh but it causes a lot of issues so i m back at bash

122218
debian-based	opensuse
i don t use opensuse but on xubuntu debian-based i can look at what dependencies a program requires before i install that program

122218
kde	gnome
by inspecting the output i can tell that gnome-mahjongg is obviously a gnome program because it requires libgtk-3-0 and that kmahjongg will pull in kde and qt dependencies

122223
sudoers	passwd
to etc sudoers so it doesn t ask for a passwd

122228
kde	gnome
gnome + kde cohabitation

122228
kde	gnome
in many configuration having kde application running under gnome environment don t break anything same in reverse order having gnome application that run under kde desktop could work without real problem

122238
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade to a newer versioning that has a bug fix than my current 1.6

122255
packets	multicast
there are other devices that uses this same kind of beacon with same multicast group and port and i can see those packets come through on other machines

122275
ubuntu	linux
i have an ubuntu installation amd64 on a ssd a and i copied the whole harddisk to another ssd b gpt sda1 bios boot partion sda2 ntfs windows sda2 ext4 ubuntu sda3 linux swap

122281
udp	tcp
i haven t done anything unusual to my hardware or kernel configurations all default settings fresh os install linux kernel 3.11 tcp ip stack and i m averaging about 3.83 million messages per second through tcp while i m only averaging 0.75 million messages per second through udp

122288
udp	mtu	udp	tcp
this is far away from the usual mtu of 1500 bytes and makes udp highly inefficient while tcp merges multiple sends into a single packet on the wire except if tcp_nodelay is set to make efficient use of the link each udp message will result in a separate packet

122288
udp	mtu	udp	tcp
in numbers about 23 messages of size 64 byte will be combined into a single tcp packet of mtu size while it will need 23 single packets for udp for the same amount of data

122288
udp	mtu
udp is inefficient if used with packet sizes far below mtu

122288
udp	tcp
as for your expectation that udp should be better did you ever wonder why all the major file transfers ftp http ... are done with tcp based protocols

122288
udp	tcp
so some people switch to udp in this case and re-implement the reliability layer of tcp and optimize it for high-latency links while others tune the existing tcp stack to make better use of the link

122314
ubuntu	centos
furthermore the windows server as well as a laptop running ubuntu 12.04 do not have this problem and can browse the shares of the centos server

122425
disk	ram
if it is high meaning close from the maximum value seen under total for swap then it means that your system is swapping a lot and which means that it is paging to disk which is much slower than ram

122427
ubuntu	debian
disable delay in ubuntu and debian

122443
debian	linux
how can i print out the current keybindings in linux debian

122455
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
note also that if you are writing this for a debian based system eg ubuntu linux mint you should consider using adduser instead of useradd

122467
udp	tcp
is it possible perhaps using iptables or one of the wrappers frontends to iptables to trigger an action or run a script after a certain period of time has elapsed with no network activity on a certain incoming tcp or udp port

122484
centos	linux
my os is linux centos 6

122492
kde	gnome	google-chrome	firefox
building off of this notion of openness as you walk users up through the stack of software from the linux kernel up to the desktop environment gnome kde etc. to the web browser firefox google-chrome etc.

122530
solaris	sunos
in my solaris server sunos 5.10 shadow files are getting created automatically every 10 minutes for two particular users in etc

122532
daemons	systemd
in freedesktop.org-compliant systemd there s a login manager daemons such as the consolekit daemons or systemd-logind responsible for performing the shutdown

122532
switching	screens
some desktop environments usually have desktop manager gdm lightdm etc. which lets you login lock screens sometimes even switching sessions

122557
sysv	systemd
i have somehow an rough idea of how the userspace and init-system be it classic init sysv upstart systemd work at systemd shutdown

122591
width	height
this should do the trick it first loops over all files change according to your needs to find the largest width and height and then loops again to add the required borders change the -bordercolor black part to suit your needs

122592
imagemagick	mogrify
it uses mogrify from imagemagick to resize all pngs in the current directory to 200x200px -extent 200x200 by adding a white background -background black and centering the image -gravity center

122601
xfce	gnome
i haven t used gnome for a few years but this is generally how gnome mate xfce desktops go.

122616
sudo	passwd
i have configured sudo to run without a passwd but when i try to ssh sudo foo i still get the error message sudo sorry you must have a tty to run sudo

122622
post	get
if anyone post a better full solution it ll get all the cookies

122623
ubuntu	linux
i am currently running ubuntu server 12.04 but this applies to all flavours of linux really

122624
stdout	stderr
also note that it means the remote command cannot detect end-of-file on its stdin and the stdout and stderr of the remote command are merged into a single stream

122645
packets	multicast
i understand that your host 192.168.2.7 is sending multicast packets to group 239.255.250.250 on port 9131

122645
packets	multicast
first make sure that the host running the servers the one receiving the multicast packets have joined the multicast group

122645
packets	multicast
if you don t see any packets coming in then the multicast packets are not forwarded assuming that

122645
packets	multicast
then on client send a multicast packets use the script in link below to troubleshoot

122656
bash	zsh
put the following line in your .bashrc if using bash or .zshrc if using zsh or other applicable shell initialization file

122665
lsof	netcat
use lsof to see the network sockets used by netcat

122667
prepare	execute
for power off only if acpi is configured in possibly execute code to prepare going into acpi state s5 soft power off

122668
spotify	soundcloud
mopidy is a music server which can play music both from multiple sources like your local hard drive radio streams and from spotify and soundcloud

122668
spotify	soundcloud
your playlists from spotify or soundcloud are also available for use

122668
spotify	soundcloud
mopidy is a music server which can play music both from multiple sources like your local hard drive radio streams and from spotify and soundcloud

122670
hex	binary
in a last-ditch attempt to make this work i opened the java binary with a hex editor and replaced the string lib ld-linux.so.2 with home chroot ld.so and made that a symlink to ld-linux.so.2 and it worked

122684
stdout	stderr
perhaps stderr and stdout are not being correctly redirected to dev null

122702
stdout	stderr
or swap stderr and stdout

122706
stdout	stderr
perhaps stderr and stdout are not being correctly redirected to dev null

122706
stdout	stderr
note that although it says this redirects every output this refers to the executing shell so if the executed process uses other file descriptors for logging or redirects its own stdout stderr so they never reach the shell those are not affected

122709
debian	linux
this is for debian linux

122721
kde	gnome
then you will add things required by your program or go for a full distribution because building heavy sub-system like gnome or kde on lfs can be a real pain-in-the-ass

122721
ubuntu	centos
as pointed out by securitybeast instead of starting from a full distribution like centos or ubuntu you may also have a look at building distribution tools like

122727
ubuntu	linux
the partition which has linux under system column is your drive in which ubuntu linux is installed

122733
titlebar	window
when you then startx your program will be the only thing running and it will be impossible to change desktops or start anything else partially because there is no window manager or desktop environment hence there will be no window frame or titlebar either

122733
sysv	systemd
to belabour the point a bit when you are researching this you may find some griping about systemd and upstart from people who were previously familiar with sysv claiming that they are too complicated

122733
sysv	systemd
however objectively they are not any more complex than sysv imo systemd is simpler to use in fact but most dogs prefer their old tricks so to speak

122738
octal	hex	octal	decimal
if line starts with 0x matches regex 0x each hex number splits a line into words like the zsh would split a command line is converted to octal actually the hex number is implicitly converted to decimal by the shell and than formatted as octal by printf

122768
ubuntu	linux
according to this blog post it sounds like the technique is identical for chrome as well adding ssl certificates to google chrome linux ubuntu

122768
ubuntu	linux
the directions from that post were specific to ubuntu but should be easily adapted to other linux variants

122774
ubuntu	linux
i have a minimal ubuntu as a linux server

122780
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu you will need to install the package pv to use it

122790
gentoo	linux
it s an open-source gentoo linux derivative and chrome os s base

122792
daemons	systemd
i do not have a ubuntu systemd here to test this on but i am pretty sure it should suppress output from upstart the init daemons that runs your scripts but not the kernel s initial boot messages

122816
mouse	keyboard
this program prints the idle time user does not move click with mouse does not use keyboard in milliseconds so a bash script that builds upon this could looke like this

122843
ramdisk	umount
when switching another root device initrd would pivot_root and then umount the ramdisk

122843
stdout	stderr
chroot . attach stdin stdout stderr to the new dev console and exec the new init

122886
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
i m familiar with using openssh to salt passwords or printing hash using perl s crypt but for my purpose i cannot see it s usage

122895
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
other kernel-based firewalls in unix-like operating systems include ipfilter multi-platform pf openbsd ported to various other bsd variants and mac os x npf netbsd ipfirewall freebsd ported to various operating systems

122905
bash	zsh
the bash equivalent though it will also work in all posix shells and zsh

122913
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
i ve run into this problem for years on live cd dvd usb distros like debian ubuntu mint maybe even fedora if i recall

122913
ubuntu	mint
memory used by overlayfs the currently used fstype for live mint ubuntu and tmpfs are hidden in free s cached memory and proc meminfo s inactive entries along with temporary disk read caches so it s unclear how much memory is really free

122913
subtract	add
i m using df to add up all the space used by overlayfs tmpfs and subtract it from the free + buffers + cached info from free

122915
bash	zsh
if used in ksh93 zsh bash

122931
bash	zsh
here assuming a unicode locale and zsh ksh93 or bash

122933
tail	zcat
zcat var log aptitude.1.gz or zcat var log aptitude.1.gz | tail -20

122944
unix	solaris
i have recently installed solaris 11 but i am an absolute beginner in unix systems

122944
unix	solaris
the only unix like environment i have got myself into before is ubuntu which was quite a bit different from solaris in my opinion

122944
filesystems	ntfs
the main problem i am facing at the moment is that the ntfs windows hd partitions are not appearing in solaris filesystems which was not the case when i used ubuntu

122951
ubuntu	mint
am using mint 14 nadia ubuntu 12.10

122951
versioning	upgrade
current lo versioning 3.6.2.2 from the repo and i have a problem with this bug where conditional formatting seems to be causing a crash so i want to upgrade

122960
kde	gnome
so i wonder if it is possible that kde applications when running under gnome can use the information from applications based on gnome

122987
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
install a recent version of a debian variant such as ubuntu or mint that includes uefi shim in case something goes wrong in your boot sequence and lastly

123010
daemons	systemd
note that this is for systemd processes ie daemons etc for user processes the common thing to do is just to create the log file as a hidden file in the user s home directory

123011
kde	gnome
although it was originally written for kde but it works fine with gnome aswell

123013
ubuntu	linux
i was never asked such a question while install ubuntu linux and i m free guessing to store as much data in it as i want limited by the partition size

123029
debian	linux
edit the system is linux debian 7

123060
udp	tcp
first of all dns is primarily a udp service not a tcp service

123060
udp	tcp
in addition dns can optionally use tcp which uses tcp port 53 but while dns can work fine without tcp it doesn t work without udp

123060
centos	linux
e.g. dig 130.35.249.52 oracle.com if you do not have dig get it with yum install bind-tools rhel oracle centos 6 or the equivalent command for your linux distribution

123064
ssd	sata
while investigating the issue with my sata3 ssd drive being recognized as sata2 for some reason had to change sata ports to fix it i noticed the following messages when i run

123067
bash	subshell
when you run sequences commands inside curly brace all commands is run in current shell instead of subshell if you run inside parentheses see bash reference

123092
octal	hex
# can be written as x23 hexadecimal 43 octal u23 unicode hexadecimal up to 4 hex digits or even u23 unicode hexadecimal up to 8 hex digits

123092
bash	zsh
in cases where you do not need echo or printf you can get bash works on zsh too to do the replacement by using

123113
rsa	dsa
the keys are for the rsa dsa and elliptic curve dsa cryptographic algorithms

123137
sudo	passwd
the difference being that sudo asks for your user passwd not the root target user passwd

123149
freebsd	netbsd
freebsd and netbsd

123151
kde	gnome
i have an older system that use gnome that i m happy with and i m trying to make the kde system behave as much like the gnome one as possible

123157
sudo	passwd
i m trying to make sudo ask for target passwd except when run by root

123158
stdout	stderr
my guess is that the service httpd configtest is outputting to stderr instead of stdout

123158
stdout	stderr
for more information on what stdout and stderr are and what does check out the wikipedia pages on standard streams and redirection

123159
kde	gnome
keep in mind i was really really annoyed by that and some other things that i saw as kde eccentricities at first and almost gave up on it right off the bat which i ve done before and same w gnome

123160
stdout	stderr
you can make it done by redirect stderr to stdout

123162
sudo	passwd
you can t configure sudo to do this and it wouldn t make any sense either since root may always do whatever he wants su doesn t ask for a passwd either does itâ ½

123199
hex	binary
the path to the loader is compiled into the binary as you discovered with your hex editor

123212
put	get
i want to put the graphics in it but when i open it i get this

123217
daemons	systemd
i once worked on a systemd that had some daemons configured while it was running

123232
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
installation on ubuntu debian linux mint is as simple as sudo apt-get install filezilla

123239
sshd	xinetd
if you were running sshd under xinetd the completely untested xinetd config fragment below would limit your total number of ssh instances to 20

123250
filesystems	btrfs
i know that btrfs supports compression but i don t want to change the filesystems that i have ext3 to support this feature

123260
kde	gnome
i try my best not to install kde applications on gnome of my ubuntu but sometimes i have to install some kde applications such as okular

123260
kde	gnome
i wonder how gnome support kde applications

123260
kde	gnome
how shall i install an kde application properly in gnome

123262
dns	spf
the above tools range from using a mix of online databases of emails that are known to be malware related to blocking emails based on the geographic ip address that sent them to using dns rules via spf sender policy framework

123266
kde	gnome
how gnome support kde applications

123266
kde	gnome
many of them should not require kde to be the running desktop environment and gnome won t care

123266
kde	gnome
how shall i install an kde application properly in gnome

123268
innodb	myisam
innodb will recover by its own when run but if there was some myisam than you ll have to do this manually

123290
google-chrome	firefox
either i should be able to route all the traffic from google-chrome to wifi and from firefox to ethernet

123292
centos	linux
how to change console resolution on linux rhel centos fedora etc

123310
ubuntu	linux
but like in ubuntu linux i couldn t use service networking restart nor could i find anything under etc that could provide a hint

123333
chown	chgrp
when i responded i suggested he chown or chgrp the special file but this is probably not the best method

123353
folder	directory
edit just noticed all folder missing from bin etc lib64 root sbin got moved to var directory i tried var bin su get

123354
x86	mips	microblaze	blackfin	powerpc	microblaze
alpha arc arm avr32 blackfin c6x etrax cris fr-v h8 300 hexagon itanium m32r m68k meta microblaze mips mn103 openrisc pa-risc powerpc s390 s+core superh sparc tile64 unicore32 x86 xtensa

123356
folder	directory
to move all directory except hidden ones from folder to the current directory you should use

123359
manual	rcs
a special mode of rcs operation which is mentioned in the emacs manual info in the vc section could be an option of how to overcome such problems

123362
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
ksh tend to be the default or at least the standard compliant shell on many unix like solaris aix hp-ux while zsh is often only an optional shell that needs to be installed separately

123367
postfix	dovecot
i set up dovecot and postfix but when i try to authenticate with thunderbird it gives this error thunderbird failed to find the settings for your email account.

123370
bash	zsh
since the replies looks like there is no way to accomplish what i want in bash unless i shift to zsh

123383
ubuntu	linux
trying to understand the behaviour of the environment in linux ubuntu 13.04 concretely i ve find different situations where setting envirionment variables are used or defined for in different contexts

123390
put	get
the initial value was created by the shell at invocation because it was interactive and then it sourced then that file -- but ps1 did not get put into

123396
sudo	passwd
if by just typing sudo su an ordinary user can get superuser privileges then the system might actually be less secure than if it only had a root user think of a fire-and-forget joe account with guessable passwd in such a case it would supply a ready backdoor to rootdom

123406
debian	linux
there are too many to list here but i will list the linux architectures officially supported by debian since this is a good indication of what is commonly used

123414
folder	directory
i want to create a folder inside home directory and another one inside directory

123414
folder	directory
does another user on the same system may be able to access the folder which was inside the home directory

123414
folder	directory
is there any disadvantage of creating a folder just inside home directory

123427
udp	tcp
socks5 is just a transport protocol on top of tcp udp but below application layer

123427
udp	tcp
thus it s comparable with tcp and udp too

123430
stdout	stderr
these are 0 for stdin 1 for stdout and 2 for stderr

123458
freebsd	linux
the exact list of plugins available depends on your platform -- i use freebsd but you may use linux

123464
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade systemd from versioning 208 to 212 also tried any other versioning between these two numbers

123467
centos	linux
i m on linux centos 6.3

123492
stdout	stderr
let us say i redirect the stdout stderr of a program to files

123496
stdout	stderr
in your case stdout will be saved to file output.log and stderr will be saved to file error.log

123530
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux 12.04 if that s important

123532
debian	linux
i m using a debian linux

123537
uniq	grep
i tried history | uniq | grep some_text but that doesn t work because of the line numbers

i was wondering if we add a job in the crontab to run every 5 mins and the job does not actually manage to finish in 5 mins does the cron daemon know that the previous instance is already running and skips the next run

123631
filesystems	fat
for filesystems like fat mount 8 lets you set the ownership and access permissions for all files within the filesystems

lisp	scheme
in lisp macro systems the back-quote character called quasiquote in scheme introduces a quoted expression in which comma-substitution may occur

123655
ubuntu	debian
since you re probably comfortable rolling your own rpms i might be inclined to roll my own .deb file here taking the package files from a newer or older version of ubuntu debian and using the build tools to built these for 12.04

123832
filesystems	fat
the area near the start of the disk is normally used by the fat in the fat filesystems they come preformatted with and this area is randomly written to frequently so they use a different algorithm in this area that is slower at sequential writes but not terrible at random writes

123832
filesystems	fat
what you are seeing when you write to the filesystems is the performance of the rest of the disk and when you dd at offset zero you are writing to the fat area

123841
dpkg	apt
var lib dpkg contains the database of installed packages and additional information about installed packages and var lib apt contains additional information managed by apt rather than dpkg

disk	ram
when running from a flash disk or rom a virtual file system also gets created in ram but you need less ram then if using the bootp method

124058
ubuntu	debian
unlike ubuntu debian uses a hybrid boot image that can be directly copied to a usb flash disk using dd you may find this easier to work with especially since ubuntu requires the use of a special program to create the bootable usb and that program is somewhat buggy

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
can someone please tell me the differences between ubuntu and linux mint

124135
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i thought they were almost the same thing until i downloaded ubuntu 13.10 versions of softwares for my linux mint 16 system and half of them didn t work

124136
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	short	base
in short linux mint does uses exactly the same base as ubuntu

124136
ubuntu	mint
in fact if you check the contents of etc apt sources.list you will see that mint uses the ubuntu archives for most of its software

124136
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
you should always attempt to install software in this manner as each package in the ubuntu repository has been configured to integrate with the system be it ubuntu or linux mint attempting to install from another source may be problematic

124136
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
the difference between linux mint and ubuntu lie mainly in the packages which are installed by default the artwork which is included and the installer itself

124136
debian	mint
in fact the mint desktop environments along with other mint software are available in the debian repositories this is where i get simple scan from

124136
ubuntu	debian
as ubuntu is based on debian they are also available in the ubuntu repositories

124136
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
since this software is available in the ubuntu repositories and the mint developers do not engage in the mass packaging of software required to maintain the own independent repositories unlike debian ubuntu linux mint uses the ubuntu repositories as the source of most packages installed on the system

124136
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
although linux mint do provide their own repositories for new releases of their own software which may still be unstable or otherwise hasn t made it into ubuntu yet

124136
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
most of the linux mint developed software is actually installed from mint repositories which take precedence over those in the ubuntu ones

124149
stdout	stderr
the solution is to redirect stdout and stderr so that the program can continue running in the background

124163
folder	directory
it needs the permission to write create folder files in directory of other users cms system

124172
sudo	passwd
i know that a similar question had already been asked quite a few times here but most of the answers either took advantage of sudo s passwd caching which for some reason doesn t seem to work for me in two consecutive ssh calls or the fact that we re root so we can set up a passwordless sudo or make ssh let in root

124194
children	parent
this will create a process which along with any of its children will have a pid as usual within the parent system namespace

124230
stdout	stderr
maybe it s because it outputs text both on stderr and stdout and what you want to capture is on stderr

124230
stdout	stderr
and try to redirect stderr to stdout before the pipe

124233
disk	ram
note that character and block devices have distinct numbering spaces block major 1 is assigned to ram disk char major 1 is assigned to a set of kernel devices including null and zero

124241
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu based systems packages will often install a file to usr share bash-completion completions which provides the programmable completion for the command

124241
ubuntu	debian
on other distributions the etc bash_completion.d directory may be used this location is deprecated on debian ubuntu but some packages still use it

124250
ubuntu	centos
i cannot say if vpnc will or won t work with checkpoint and in the past when i ve attempted to use vpnc with aventail nortel it did not work for me so i reverted to using the native client software that was included by aventail nortel on fedora centos ubuntu systems

124250

i cover some of this at a highlevel on my blog in this article titled setting up aventail vpn software on linux fedora centos rhel

terminal emulators have 2 screens buffers that you can switching between

124348
switching	screens
so you switching to the alternate screens buffer run your commands and then switching back to the main one

124350
jobs	cron
checking the contents of var log cron redhat-based location or var log syslog debian-based should show that anacron indeed runs your jobs

124374
freebsd	linux
i really advise you to quietly read the freebsd handbook as freebsd is not linux

124403
put	get
i have put several printf and printk statements in following files but did not get any thing useful as of now

124406
versioning	upgrade
yet this does not take into account the risk of having a versioning mismatch between the already upgrade tmux client and the server that manages the terminal where the distribution upgrade is running

124406
versioning	upgrade
should one put a warning on the possible versioning mismatch when running distro upgrade in a tmux session

124410
ubuntu	centos
if the answer depends on the distro then centos arch and ubuntu would be good examples

124413
redhat	fedora
fedora is owned by redhat and the latter is a publicly traded billion dollar annual business

124413
ubuntu	debian
i would think canonical helps out significantly since ubuntu is reliant upon debian but judging from this link provided in kiwi s answer they are still having to beg publicly for 250k to cover meeting costs which is pretty disappointing

124439
fish	bash
just now i ve tried with both fish and bash from both fish and bash outer sessions with and without noblock and with and without a screen -t . i also see the same behaviour on very fast and very slow connections

124455
stdout	stderr
i have a program i need to run at startup it has output on stdout and stderr that i want to redirect to the system log using the logger command

124455
stdout	stderr
this is redirecting the stdout to syslog just fine but stderr is coming to the console so i need some help on refining the command

124456
stdout	stderr
you need to combine the output of stderr and stdout prior to piping it to logger

124466
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
similar question for a linux distribution ubuntu mint ...

124467
ubuntu	debian
i tried installing several ubuntu packages on debian wheezy

124467
ubuntu	debian
there s your problem ubuntu and debian use the same package format but you can t so easily mix debian and ubuntu packages on the same system because the releases have different versions of the packages

124467
ubuntu	debian
you d get similar issues if you mixed multiple releases of debian or of ubuntu

124469
centos	linux
el6 suggests its enterprise linux rhel centos

124474
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you don t want searches in man pages to be case-sensitive or if you want them to be always case-insensitive there is no way to configure this in man-db itself

124504
daemons	systemd
yes when the advice is given to secure disable remove accounts they re talking about both user and systemd accounts such as the ones used by daemons

124504
daemons	systemd
you wouldn t want to leave user accounts on a systemd for users that no longer need physical access to the systemd nor would you want to leave accounts for daemons that have been disabled or have been removed

124513
put	get
but if i start a youtube video and put it in full screen i get horrible performance -- even several seconds of freeze

124516
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i would start with the version of bluez and see if you can t get a newer version upstream from the developers since you re using linux mint which derives from ubuntu

124527
disk	ram
i am currently thinking that if i could get the disk blocks that these files occupy i could sort those merge the blocks that were close given that sequential read is often faster than seeking and read these blocks so that they were in ram cache i have 32 gb ram before doing the copy

124541
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
what i was wondering why can web servers i have administrated everything from apache lighttpd to nginx not use the capability system capabilities 7 such as cap_net_bind_service on linux and simply start as non-root user

124544
daemons	systemd
this is not unreasonable since the privileged activity is very limited and by convention many other systemd daemons run root continuously including other inet daemons sshd

124573
unix	solaris
i have recently installed solaris 11 but i am an absolute beginner in unix systems

124573

ubuntu	debian
iirc debian and derivatives like ubuntu have an equivalent etc debian_version file

124687
switching	screens
if you are using a gui desktop you have an x server running and it controls the screens so you cannot use the framebuffer at the same time although you can switching back and forth to a vt and use the framebuffer there

124689
centos	linux
check the file etc redhat-release this is an enterprise linux distribution largely compatible comparable with red hat enterprise linux 5 or centos 5

124689
ubuntu	linux
the idea of the enterprise linux distro s is to have a long life cycle 5-10 years more compatible with enterprise requirements such as stability then bleeding edge frequently updated distro s like fedora or ubuntu

sudo closes all open file descriptors other than stdin stdout and stderr see man sudo so process substitution does not work ootb with sudo

124848
x86	64bit
if you get x86 it means you have 32 bit linux os and if you get x86_64 it means you have 64bit linux

124854

redirect stderr to the file that stdout points to then redirect stdout

with regard to slowness the de doesn t do all that much if you are doing other things but if using opengl based desktop effects spinning cubes and all that these will be noticeably slower on slower systems without hardware support nvidia or ati cards

124962

hard links can not be created for directory as a hard link could be created between folder inside each other i suppose computers do not yet have the resources to check for this without a serious slowdown

124995
put	get
i ve made the ssh link and i can at least get rsync to load the files incrementally which i plan to do daily using cron.daily but i want the server synology 213j to take care of tarring the file though - in my mind - i think it would be fine for my computer to tell the server to tar the file every week and then put it in weekly then tar it every month and finally every two months

there are always going to be some kind of interrupts going on but you can configure irq affinity to send them to cpu1 leaving cpu2 available for data processing

125111

as stated before it s hard to give you absolute rules but reducing the number of unnecessary hardware interrupts is a good start but playing around with irq affinity and tx rx affinity can yield an advantage as well

for redhat based distros such as centos fedora rhel you can use rpm to verify and repair some aspects of the installed packages

this requires that your shell supports for recursive globbing zsh does out of the box bash does after you run shopt -s globstar ksh93 does after you run set -o globstar

the folder disappears from the directory listing inside home client if i login with client

125304
cpu	processors
i m not sure i understand the question well but processors supporting x86_64 can run 32bit x86 too so you can install the 32bit version of a distro on a recent cpu and use only 32bit software on your x86_64 capable hardware

125312
folder	directory
i believe your issue has to do with the permissions of either the directory or the user s folder

125313
rpm	yum
for starters i would attempt to do this first to see if you can get yum to do the heavy lifting and install the rpm keys for ovirt

125314
x86	mips	x86	64bit
many processor families come in both 32-bit and 64bit variants x86 arm sparc ppc mips â

125314
ia-32	x86
ia-32 a variant of x86 commonly known as i386 the name used by debian or i686 which like ia-32 are generations of the x86 architecture series

125314
x86	64bit
because the x86 instruction set uses 32-bit registers and the x86-64 instruction set uses 64bit registers and because for each instruction set there is a single abi used by all linux installationsâ¹ these are often described as just â œ32-bitâ or â œ64-bitâ

125318
icmp	udp
traceroute in linux default use udp ping use icmp so as your output it seems that those traffic have been blocked by the firewall

125318
udp	tcp
as above when you can get result from curl www.gooogle.com i am sure that the firewall allows at least tcp port 80 and udp port 53 for dns work

125319
icmp	tcp
we start our probes with a ttl of one and increase by one until we get an icmp port unreachable or tcp reset which means we got to the host or hit a max which defaults to 30 hops

125319
traceroute	packets
so the asterisks you re seeing are servers that you re packets are being routed through whom are timing out 5.0+ seconds and so traceroute defaults to printing the

125319
traceroute	packets
without replying to pings traceroute s trick of inducing each server by incrementing the ttl time to live for each packets that it sends to the actual destination will fail

125319
icmp	udp
such firewalls filter the unlikely udp ports or even icmp echoes

125319
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	traceroute	packets	udp	tcp
so depending on how you configure traceroute it may be using icmp udp or even tcp packets to elicit a response from the various systems that are handing the routing of your packets from point a to point b

125319
traceroute	packets
with the egressing of packets over port 80 you can take advantage of this and tell traceroute to use tcp over a particular port 80 in this case to get what you want

125320
traceroute	packets
in particular ping and most of the time traceroute send the icmp echo_request packets and many companies and schools block all icmp traffic through their firewalls as it can be used to find out information of the network devices behind the firewall

the versioning of debian in there is apparently on the wheezy upgrade path if that s what you call it

125327
versioning	upgrade
i tried apt-get upgrade mysql-server which says i already have the latest versioning

yum and rpm are complementary package managers

125661
debian	linux
in the case of debian there is the debian linux kernel handbook

125661
ubuntu	debian
since ubuntu is essentially debian all of this should apply

125661
ubuntu	debian
note that using the stock debian ubuntu kernel and kernel header binary packages is an entirely reasonable thing to do and does not require an compilation

125670
ubuntu	debian
there are also distro specific ways to search for these locations using rpm redhat or apt debian ubuntu

125678
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
with respect to installing codecs from default repositories ubuntu linux mint seem to do a reasonably good job at offering this option

125718

the short answer to figuring out the total number of hosts is to subtract the lower address 2 from the upper address 3 and then add one to get the total hosts

125824
ubuntu	linux
i realize tools for making a flash drive image that boots a linux system for example ubuntu are common enough

125859
debian	linux
after installation and a reboot i was presented with a console with the words debian gnu linux 7 hostname tty1

125880
exif	xmp
it includes a command-line program called exiftool that can change exif iptc xmp and many other forms of image metadata

i think i should set the size of the emacs window relatively to the size of the screens but i don t know how to do it in twm or maybe i should put a switching depending on the vnc session

125966
ubuntu	debian
note that this makes use of pg_wrapper which comes with postgresql-common and works on ubuntu debian

subnet	packets
if there is packets loss at any of the nodes within the same 16 subnet or within 2-3 hops of the endpoint then this can indicate that your vps provider is experiencing network issues

126069
folder	dir
at the root then i d be stuck counting the number of folder down the working dir is

126078
vmware	virtualbox
the simplest and the most proper variant today is to install a target system as a virtual guest using any kind of virtualization from a simple chroot through lxc and up to virtualbox vmware etc. and then use distro-specific native tools

126106

sudoers	visudo
first as root user issued visudo command to edit the sudoers file

126214
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
using a filesystems unaware of owner group conecpt fat or ntfs coming to mind butâ aaah no

126214
chown	chmod
first and second point are easy to accomplish chown chmod

126260
filesystems	btrfs
the main reason for me to do so i mean upgrading not breaking was that i have btrfs filesystems that had performance problems

126269
sudo	passwd
i am trying to setup my server so that i can restart apache as userx without having to enter a sudo passwd

126269
sudo	passwd
however when i logon as userx and run sudo usr sbin service apache2 restart it asks me for a passwd

126280
opensuse	linux
now if i can just figure out how to get opensuse to sign their 32-bit version of the linux kernel.

this would put the error messages stderr in one file and file list stdout in one file

126321
centos	linux
i went and obtained the lastest openssl tarball source patch openssl-1.0.1g.tar.gz from here for my linux workstation running centos 6.5 and built the patch including

126379
versioning	upgrade
i am on arch-linux and just upgrade to the latest versioning of gnome-terminal

126381
xfce	gnome
the phenomenon completely vanished and xfce is vastly more responsive in general than gnome

126381
xfce	gnome
as i followed an otherwise identical installation process i have to assume it was either gnome 3 causing the issue or gnome 3 having an argument with my hardware that xfce didn t have

126400
ubuntu	debian
update both debian wheezy stable and ubuntu 12.04 have tmux 1.6 that lacks the necessary option

126426
ubuntu	linux
i will be using ubuntu linux for this project

126426
uniq	grep
each isolated environment includes the application example config files and the standard unix toolset grep awk sort uniq etc. however access to an entire linux filesystem is fine too as long as the user can only damage his own isolated environment and not those of others

126451
hide	show
why not hide the debugging messages and show them only when needed

126469
ubuntu	debian
since i am currently using ubuntu it would be great to find something based on ubuntu or just on debian

126480
procmail	exim
there should be no need to use .forward for procmail if you setup the transport and router configuration for exim to deal with procmail directly

126500
folder	directory
if you know for sure there s exactly one directory and nothing else no other folder and no other file in the current directory you can enter that directory with

126517
titlebar	window
right click on the window titlebar and select more actions - window manager settings

126534
sudoers	visudo
if not you might want to edit your etc sudoers file visudo and add a line containing

126540
ubuntu	linux
the original package git-multimail is was developed on some variant of linux i m guessing ubuntu

126541
hmac	md5
however python does include some cryptographic primitives the hashlib and hmac modules provide the most common digest algorithms md5 sha-1 sha-2 and the corresponding hmac algorithms

126548
binutils	glibc
what typically happens is that you get a huge daisy-chain of follow-on packages that you also need to upgrade gcc needs a new glibc new glibc needs new binutils new binutils breaks your gdb so you need to update that etc

126558
switching	screens
the keys in my window manager that must switching focus to another screens also not seem to be working i can move mouse over the other screens but rmb that should set mpv on pause doesnâ t work too

126571
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu you have to copy the certificate.pem to usr local share ca-certificates certificate.crt and then run update-ca-certificates

126572
pop-up	dialog
doing an acpi shutdown no-longer pop-up the same dialog in gnome

126580
ubuntu	centos
i ve recently upgraded my ubuntu 12.04 lts to centos 6.5

126585
rpm	yum
i m most familiar with yum rpm based distros so that s where i d like to stay but if there s another distro that will have better package similarity with apt instead i suppose i can make that work

126599
gentoo	ubuntu
also tell the version of ubuntu and gentoo number of storage devices os installed on each storage device wether windows installed

126606
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux but i easily set up an ubuntu 12.04 server out of a spare box

126611
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu has moved along from requiring manually configured mounts for a long time now even for non-gui environments

126616
ubuntu	debian
update finally got around to building i386 debs for gcc 4.9 in an i386 chroot using schroot see how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

126616
installation	upgrade
the installation of gcc 4.9 debs isn t completely straightforward because some of the common libraries for 4.7 and 4.9 need to be upgrade too like libstdc++6

126629
stdout	stderr
various imagemagick command output to stderr instead of stdout

126629
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout to capture the output

126650
installation	upgrade
you may want to change that 6 to a 7 to upgrade your java installation

126684
ubuntu	debian
i suggest checking the apache error log in var log apache on debian ubuntu or var log httpd on redhat and derivatives

126699
ubuntu	debian
so far i have downloaded firmware-nonfree_0.36+wheezy.1.tar.gz in my ubuntu os and placed it into my home directory in my debian os

126699
ubuntu	debian
what i did was to download from my ubuntu system the firmware-linux-nonfree_0.36+wheezy.1_all.deb file and placed it into my home directory in my debian system

126719
folder	directory
here s what i mean i have a binary file named x in my path not the current folder but it is in the path and also a folder with the same name in the current working directory

126721
sudo	passwd
i use sudo in many systems but i have one of them that makes me type my passwd each time i run sudo

126722
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
this problem applies to gnome kde xfce for me

126737
haskell	scheme
operator is similar to the way conditional expressions if-then-else constructs work in functional programming languages like scheme ml and haskell since if-then-else forms an expression instead of a statement in those languages

126761
disk	ram
if i create a ram disk on cent os using tmpfs will it go away on restart

126761
disk	ram
i am going to allocate a ram disk for use on mysql tmp directory i just want to make sure it will work after reboot

126777
dropbox	evernote
i currently manage most of this stuff manually by having copies of the relevant config files on dropbox or summaries in evernote etc

126810
folder	directory
if i do tar -ztvf file.tar.gz to see the content you can see the folder directory structure

126810
folder	directory
i only want to extract the subfolder measures under folder s012011_csv in the current directory of the .tar.gz folder

126811
int	chars
if you want to include other chars in the assertion - such as the terminating right parenthesis after int c you can add that as part of a chars list

126819
bash	zsh
it also looks like zsh may have some compatibility with bash completions

126831
bash	zsh
bash zsh etc

126836
mouse	keyboard
also as an extension of my question could i achieve a similar result but emulate a usb mouse or keyboard or forward the mouse and keyboard from pc-a to pc-b through said interface

126838
bluetooth	usb
i think but i don t have references for that that this distinction is one of the reasons for having different connectors on the usb cable apart from wanting a smaller connector on your phone bluetooth headset than on your pc

126845
conio	ncurses
ncurses in linux ncurses does not depend on conio at all

126846
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
at least not the ones that i m familiar with fedora centos rhel debian ubuntu

126878
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you should issue passwd 16040 as root sudo passwd 16040 if your user is in the sudoers file to change his her passwd

126914
sudo	passwd
i always thought that sudo just starts another login-process specifically using root as a username and asking for the passwd to login

126918
sudo	passwd
so sudo parse his config and determine if user should be able to work with sudo run specific programs and wheter should it sudo ask about user passwd or not

126927
bash	zsh
i ve seen this comment many times on unix linux as well as on other sites that use the phrasing backticks have been deprecated with respect to shells such as bash zsh

126949
calendar	gcal
gcal the ultra-powerful command line gnu calendar

126951
sudo	passwd
sudo usr bin passwd 16040

126951
sudo	passwd
sudo -i and after usr bin passwd 16040

126953
terminate	timeout
after asking on irc a bit it seems the general expectation is that if one node feels a connection has terminate abnormally for any reason including reaching an internally derived timeout it s expected to send the remote node an rst packet before closing the connection on its side

126977
filesystems	btrfs
some filesystems can also compact short files so that they occupy less space by sharing blocks see for example tail packing and others like btrfs do copy on write so the relationship between a file its logical length and how much space it occupies on a disk is a complex one

126980
debian	linux
that s not the bourne shell or bash emulating the bourne shell that s the almquist shell in your case probably the debian almquist shell a linux fork by debian of bsds sh itself based on the original almquist shell

126994
bash	zsh
note that some shells like zsh ksh93 and bash have builtin regexp matching operators as an extension above the standard sh syntax but the syntax varies slightly across those

127001
freebsd	linux
are there any notable differences between lxc linux containers and freebsd s jails in terms of security stability performance

127003
traceroute	packets
the asterisks you re seeing are servers that your packets are being routed through whom are timing out 5.0+ seconds and so traceroute defaults to printing the

127003
icmp	udp
such firewalls filter the unlikely udp ports or even icmp echoes

127003
icmp	udp	traceroute	packets
traceroute in linux default use udp ping use icmp so as your output it seems that icmp packets are allowed in your firewall whereas udp packets are blocked by the firewall

127006
daemons	systemd
now during the start up of the systemd as i had already mentioned the kmod daemons executes the modprobe to load the modules

127025
icmp	udp
either the machine you are running the tests from or your local gateway router is blocking udp or icmp

127032
ubuntu	linux
are there any diagram generator applications on linux using ubuntu 12.04

127048
torque	slurm
i ve read about torque slurm resource managers and maui open grid scheduler sonf of grid engine but i do not know which is more appropriate to use in a local environment

127051
versioning	upgrade
if you can guarantee the same versioning on both os and take care to upgrade both at the same time so chrome and st are as close as possible you can probably mitigate most of the risk.

127064
folder	directory
i have created a folder outside of my htdocs directory as a means of adding extra security for downloadable digital goods to be sold from within a magento storefront

127115
versioning	upgrade
when checking my versioning in iceweasel tools add-ons i was surprised to see that it is an older versioning even though i did all upgrade with apt-get

127119
versioning	upgrade
the first one will probably be versioning 13.0.0.182 and in an opt google chrome directory you can disable that and fall back on the .mozilla one until it is upgrade

127122
sudo	passwd
the -t option allocates a psuedo tty and enables user interaction with the commands ran by ssh such as entering a passwd for sudo

127128
ubuntu	linux
i m using local ubuntu 14.04 and red hat enterprise linux 6 on the remote

127131
xming	xorg
you can either let it connect to your local xorg if you re on a unix workstation or if you re on windows there s a program called xming that will run one for you and you can configure putty to forward x11 to that

127139
daemons	systemd
though root can switch to one of them using su or the equivalent systemd calls which is how daemons run as them

127153
sudoers	visudo
if you want to do this as normal user you could use sudo and add the following line on etc sudoers through the visudo command

127189
debian	linux
i had windows on my laptop and installed debian gnu linux a few weeks ago on it

127195
ubuntu	linux
i installed the second linux distro along with ubuntu something went wrong it was to choosing a wrong nvidia driver and i decided to remove that distro completely by deleting the partition and creating it again i ll persist installing it from ubuntu

127213
debian	linux
i m quite new to debian let alone linux and would like to setup dual screens

127227
stdout	stderr
alteratively you can use dev stdout or dev stderr but they could be redirected if your command is within a script

127241
spaces	delimiter
in a language like ruby you can split the strings into an array of spaces delimiter words via a regex s+ and get the intersection of the two resulting arrays

127248
vlan	packets
using tcpdump and assuming the packets contains a 802.1q vlan tag you can do the following

127251
vlan	packets
you can use tcpdump to disassemble cdp lldp packets to find the vlan number

127253
subnet	vlan
you can look at an ip address and subnet mask and determine which subnet the ip is in but not the vlan

127260
debian	linux
linux 3.2.0 debian wheezy

127312
ubuntu	centos
i ve checked 3 servers running ubuntu 12.04 and centos 6.5 and mac osx 10.9

127312
ubuntu	centos
only the ubuntu and centos machines have non digit niceness values

127313
ubuntu	centos
only the ubuntu and centos machines have non digit niceness values

127327
debian-based	ubuntu
i guess since ubuntu is debian-based i could still find the old .deb s i need on launchpad.net but i m starting to think that maybe i m doing something wrong

127334
bash	subshell
why does bash have to create a subshell to run sleep in the 3rd case when the documentation states that commands between curly braces are executed in current shell context

127339
bash	subshell
i ll post results of my tests which leads me to conclusion that bash makes a subshell for a group command if and only if it s a part of pipeline that is similar as if one would call some function which would be also called in subshell

127347
bmp	png
i have a bunch of photos jpeg bmp png that i have arranged in such a manner that the metadata is in html form in a separate file

127347
bmp	png
my images are arranged like this photo- serial number . jped bmp png

127371
icmp	tcp
it displays live graphs of network traffic i o icmp ip tcp network sockets like netstat swap usage and so on

127377
centos	linux
centos 6 runs a pretty old kernel being a stable linux distribution that is now about 3 years old

127377
centos	linux
there s nothing about hadoop or wanting to become a linux admin that requires that you use centos 6

127391
post	get
i managed to get what i wanted by using include inside the post section

127405
debian	linux
and as documentation overall a manual of how to create a custom linux kernel in debian gnu linux and the manual page for make-kpkg

127425
octal	hex
as hinted by terdon the gnu implementation of awk has a -n|--non-decimal-data option that allows awk to recognise hex and octal numbers on input

127434
redhat	fedora
on redhat based distros such as fedora centos rhel you can check for the users logged in inside the file var log secure

127439
filesystems	hfs+
the filesystems is hfs+ formatted using an actual imac

127466
switching	screens
below 165 mhz switching to the mode works but my screens will go blank and complain out of range

127471
subtract	add
i want to get an output file in which if the 5th column is + then subtract 5000 from column 2 and add 2000 to column 3 so as to output following

127471
subtract	add
if the 5th column is - then add 5000 to column 3 and subtract 2000 from column 2 so as to get following output

127487
sudo	passwd
the thing is that this user created without a passwd behaves just as he had one he has sudo rights but i simply can t sudo because it asks for a passwd that doesn t exist

127525
ubuntu	centos
how do i transfer data between ubuntu and centos using lan cable in the same network

127529
sudoers	visudo
actually we want to edit the file in etc sudoers .to do that by using sudo visudo in terminal it duplicate temp sudoers file to edit

127529
sudoers	visudo
after edit the sudoers file by visudo we edit the temp file of sudoers so save and quit temp file visudo to write in sudoers file. wq

127550
xfce	gnome
it s probably ok if gnome runs instead of xfce but why no panels menus can t right click etc

127554
chown	chgrp
in fact all it does is to adjust the file ownership chgrp + chown

127569
ubuntu	debian
and in which package it has been built in debian or ubuntu repository

127585
mouse	keyboard
i want to connect a second monitor keyboard and mouse to my pc running ubuntu and let somebody else my son use the a different tty while i am working

127591
mouse	keyboard
it works by giving a different serverlayout in the xorg.conf grouping the different screen mouse keyboard

127594
vim	emacs
since emacs -style line editing is the default the remote file presumably already contains a line like set -o vim which you should remove

127597
freebsd	linux
it seems your linux formatted dev ada4 mbr disk is not recognized properly by freebsd geom driver

127613
icmp	udp
the stars mean a device in the chain didn t respond to your icmp udp packet

127616
traceroute	packets
stars in output of traceroute means that this device does not replies with echo icmp when ttl packets exeeded it s how traceroute works sends icmp request to target starting with ttl 1 and increasing this value by 1

127629
bmp	png
i have a folder with images png bmp jpg and extension-less files

127638
stdout	stderr
lastly i d try changing the pipe from | to so that you re parsing both stdout and stderr from ldapsearch

127642
freebsd	linux
of course there are a few differences here and there such as native zfs support or the geom architecture for freebsd versus the many drivers or various file-systems for linux

127642
openbsd	linux
but some would argue that openbsd has a deep and consistent approach to security while hardened linux distributions are just modified versions of the vanilla linux-kernel

127649
put	get
i want to limit the number of files that get put into a tar ball and erease them after they ve been inserted into the tarball and being indipendent from the current directory

127653
gentoo	linux
i run gentoo linux on my laptop

127665
postfix	dovecot
with this symlink even after stopping the postfix and dovecot services both ps aux as well as netstat -tuanp didn t show anything related i was not able to unmount disk2 pers

127665
postfix	dovecot
when i removed the symlink and updated the postfix and dovecot config files to point directly to the new dirs on disk2 pers i was able to successfully stop the services and unmount the directory

127669
folder	directory	unix	aix
now i would like to map 2 aix folder to windows for an application to access - the application on windows is ibm connect direct and needs to permanently transfer files to and from the directory on the unix server

127686
ubuntu	linux
i m looking for a little advice i would like to do an upgrade preferably through the update manager from my current 10.10 32bit ubuntu box to 12.04 64bit can anyone think of anyway i could do this without doing a full re-install of my linux partition

127689
sudo	passwd
when i do the backups since i have to use sudo to type the passwd every time i have to physically type in the passwd instead of just running a cron job to do it automatically

127693
sudo	passwd
method #2 - passwd less sudo

127693
sudoers	visudo
the other approach would involve setting up a entry in your etc sudoers file using the command visudo to edit it

127702
cifs	smb
it provides windows-compatible smb cifs file and print sharing

127712
folder	directory
if i use mv to move a folder called folder to a directory that already contains folder will they merge or will it be replaced

127717
ethernet	wireless
first of all if you are using virtualbox to host the xen server please ensure to use ethernet not wireless network and set promiscuous mode to allow all

127731
put	get
notice the choices i put into the driver picker pulldowns to get to the download page

127761
sudo	passwd
but still it asking for passwd when i run sudo ls

127763
folder	directory
as long as no two files have the same name in folder and directory folder you will achieve the same result merging

127769
google-chrome	firefox
rather then make this block using etc hosts i d suggest using a browser addon plugin such as this one named blocksite for firefox or stayfocusd for google-chrome

127782
gnu	groff
i am not sure it is fully usable but remember that gnu roff groff has a processor for the pic language as well as an ascii postprocessor

127790
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
if despite the above you still want to allow your user to run any command without a passwd the line you want to add to etc sudoers using sudo visudo is

127790
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
save the file and exit visudo and try running sudo ls you shouldn t be asked for a passwd

127803
versioning	upgrade
since i upgrade firefox to versioning 29 it is sending the wrong accept-language header which should be it was right on previous versioning

127847
jobs	cron
running cron jobs can be allowed or disallowed for different users

127848
folder	directory
now you as a user usually work in a specific directory tree in the file system known as your user s home folder usually denoted as

127848
folder	directory
the first one is moving or copying it to a directory that is in or adding the current folder to but for security reasons that s not a good idea or executing it right from the folder you are

127863
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
looking for general information regarding this can be for any distribution debian centos arch linux etc.

127866
ubuntu	debian
now one can have a single physical network card nic share several ips like this in etc network interfaces debian ubuntu

127867
debian	linux
i m a linux beginner using debian 7 and have created a new user website with an htdocs directory like this

127878
hash	salt
does the supplied password during login get converted to a salt hash and then compared to the one in etc shadow

127881
hash	salt
3des for example has 11 characters of hash password plus 2 characters of salt

127881
hash	salt
both the salt and the hash

127881
hash	salt
once i type my password the library gets the shadow entry extracts the salt first two characters combines the salt with my unencrypted password the one i just typed and generates a new hash

127881
hash	salt
the idea is the same behind all cases of salt hash

127881
hash	salt
the format in the shadow file has changed a bit to be easier to distinguish between different hash algorithms but eventually all that is stored are optionally an id that identifies the hashing function the salt and the hash

127914
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m using linux mint debian edition up

127914
chown	chmod
i ve tried to chown and chmod it to every possible owner and mode but it just won t work

127922
daemons	systemd
to make connections to a systemd that s running the daemons xrdp you can use one called xfreerdp there are of course others

127945
pthreads	fork
you can also create threads -- distinct from fork in that they share the same global heap memory space of the parent process instead of getting a duplicate copy of it but note threads each execute with an independent stack memory of their own -- with the clone system call which is what pthreads is built on top of

127980
filesystems	btrfs
in my two-year experience with btrfs the filesystems proved only to be

127983
ant	maven
during this process i ve been going down a long list of required packages mockito - objenesis - maven - maven2 - classworlds - dom4j - jtidy- ant - jakarata-common-net - saxon and i m running into an issue building saxon-6.5.5-3.3

127986
sudo	passwd
have you checked to see if sudo is just remembering the last time you entered root s passwd

127989
filesystems	xfs
i can t find a simple straight answer about which filesystems metadata operations are actually persisted to the ext4 xfs filesystems journals

127990
filesystems	xfs
i believe xfs also journals all metadata transactions unless you ve tweaked the filesystems

128007
debian	linux
in my linux debian gnu linux 3.12.0 x86_64 this is know by acpi system so calling acpi_listen shows

128035
starttls	smtps
however if your mail server expects to use starttls then you use the regular smtps protocol in smtp_url and make sure to

128055
filesystems	btrfs
i have deduplicated my btrfs filesystems with bedup so now all duplicate files above a certain size are reflink copies

128090
ubuntu	linux
hi i m a total noob in linux ubuntu

128110
rpm	zypper
why the hell does zypper think that the rpm which i purposely gave it for this exact reason is an uninstallable provider

128138
disk	ram
the need for ram is a function of the number of files and directories on the disk and the number of simultaneous accesses it is serving

128147
rpm	yum
i then removed all versions of coreutils and coreutils-lib more or less following this sequence of commands i rpm -e --nodeps coreutils ii rpm -e --nodeps coreutils-lib iii updatedb and iv yum clean all

128155
rpm	yum
note i m very new to yum rpm but am familiar with linux

128155
rpm	yum
i found srpms for fedora core and am trying to rebuild them on my centos install but am running into dependency issues i was hoping someone better versed with yum and rpm might be able to help me with

128155
rpm	yum
so any yum rpm gurus out there who can point me in the right direction

128175
disk	ram
if your machine runs out of ram it ll start writing the contents of memory out to disk paging to free up that ram

128175
disk	ram
that swap number is telling you how much ram has been written to disk

128181
apache	nginx
apache can play that role but i advise you to better use nginx which is lighter

128212
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu are applying a patch to reverse the changes in nautilus

128254
ubuntu	debian
there are other tools on debian ubuntu systems to do that eg apt-get aptitude gdebi - are any of those available for arch

128254
ubuntu	debian
alternatively if you have access to a debian ubuntu system you can get a list of dependencies there using and then once you have them on your arch system use to install them in one step

128258
unix	bsd
you see this in other parts of bsd unix as well such as hard disks

128302
vim	emacs
completions have failed for the programs tar vim and emacs

128315
width	height
first we need image width and height

128340
freebsd	solaris
on gnu freebsd or solaris systems at least this brute-force approach works

128356
ubuntu	linux
i use elementaryos a linux distribution based on ubuntu

128359
uniq	grep
i m not sure if all your examples will include a underscore or not but you could key off of that and use sort | uniq -d to produce a list of substrings that are present more than once within a given file using the actual file itself as a list of fixed strings to grep via the -f switch

128359
uniq	grep
the results of this command are then run through the sort uniq -d commands which will list the entries that occur more than once amongst the results that grep -off has produced

128363
vpn	lan
i know that a vpn requires two network cards 1 to the internet and 1 to the lan

128377
ubuntu	debian
restart postfix assuming debian ubuntu here

128397
rar	zip
there are three executables sometimes package separately 7zr only handles 7z archives 7z handles many common archive formats including zip and 7za supports additional plugins useful for rar which requires non-free code that isn t linked into 7z itself

128408
bsd	aix
linux has inotify for this and bsd has kqueue but aix has nothing similar as far as i know

128412
ssl	https
the primary indication is that the host serving the https traffic s ssl certificate is being served from the correct domain and that the signing chain of the certificate is also correct based on the ca certificate authority that issued chain signed the certificate

128412
ssl	https
it used to be the case that you had to have a specific ip address set aside for each ssl server s hostname that you wanted to make use of over https

128450
wan	lan
separate sshd configurations for your lan and wan interfaces

128450
wan	lan
in the above 192.168.1.1 is your lan interface ip 10.1.1.1 your wan ip address and in both cases 22 the port to listen to

128454
postfix	haraka
i have a smtp server haraka - on port 25 and a local postfix server on port 9267

128454
postfix	haraka
i intercepts mails in haraka and then i send them to my postfix server

128461
free	malloc
glibc detected mkfs.xfs free invalid pointer 0x0000000002431600 glibc detected mkfs.xfs malloc memory corruption 0x000000000243170 and does not return unless i hit c

128462
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i am running debian base ubuntu linux mint linux os

128463
rpm	yum
i could not find the package by yum install neither there is a corresponding rpm

128464
dpkg	apt
usually that is taken care of for you by a package management system apt dpkg which downloads the package and unpacks and installs the binaries inside for you

128467
bash	zsh
but modern shells like zsh bash ksh ash yash all posix compliant sh ... have builtin operators for that so you hardly ever need expr nowadays and it s best avoided as it s got a few issues

128467
zsh	tcsh
shells like tcsh or zsh have operators to remove extensions

128467
gif	png
if you want to remove the extension only if it s one of jpg png gif then that becomes more complicated and shell dependant

128467
gif	png
if you want it case insensitive you can replace the png gif jpg in all those solutions above with some shells tools can also do case insensitive matching

128470
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian

128476
stdout	stderr
the means that stderr goes to the same place as stdout and they re both piped to tee

128481
filesystems	fat
no because a fat is part of a filesystems and each partition contains one filesystems

128481
filesystems	fat
so if you move data to a different filesystems the operating system cannot simply rearrange things in a fat table -- there are two to consider and they do not map each other arbitarily

128481
filesystems	fat
hence filesystems implementations fat etc. must assume they are organizing an actual physical region of a device and there is no layer above the filesystems to try to further organize the contents of the entire device beyond breaking it into partitions

128482
jobs	cron
as an example i have some mysql cron jobs on some servers that require extra file handles to be opened so i set this

128493
ubuntu	debian
on a debian ubuntu one

128501
chown	chmod
as yeti suggested in the comments i used the find command to find all files and directories within the directory and output their permissions owners into a chown or chmod command

128506
kde	gnome
however i would want to ignore the windows that unity gnome kde etc

128509
versioning	upgrade
as you can see i ve since upgrade the libgnuradio libraries and removed the older versioning

128512
filesystems	btrfs
i m attempting to install arch linux using the btrfs filesystems

128512
filesystems	btrfs
all i have done is created a partition so how can btrfs already exist as the filesystems type

128521
ati	nvidia
the only meaningful advantage in buying an ati or nvidia card is to use them for hardware accelerated opengl rendering generally in 3d

128521
ati	nvidia
again do waste money and hassles with proprietary drivers getting a gaming cad card from ati nvidia

128531
bluetooth	usb
why isn t the rfcomm added automatically to dev after usb bluetooth module is connected

128534
daemon	cron
i m using ubuntu 14.04 and the cron daemon is running

128546
ftp	telnet
you can gain root access and telnet and ftp to your tv

128547
jobs	cron
so i think you just need to add cron jobs

128554
jobs	cron
to further help you debug what is wrong with your cron jobs you should check your mail

128561
sudoers	passwd
if it s the modification of the sudoers files on each host and disabling root passwd how do you manage these sudoers files and keep everything up to date and consistent

128566
redhat	fedora
i read that redhat is based on fedora and rhel 5.x is based on fedora core 6

128568
sudoers	passwd
if it s the modification of the sudoers files on each host and disabling root passwd how do you manage these sudoers files and keep everything up to date and consistent

128624
lxml	beautifulsoup
but if you insist on using beautifulsoup it uses lxml a enhanced version of native py module you can

128654
stdout	stderr
by default nohup redirects stdout to nohup.out and stderr to stdout

128661
debian	linux
i m running on debian 3.2.46-1+deb7u1 x86_64 gnu linux sid

128663
mouse	keyboard
is any way to redirect audio together with video and keyboard mouse

128673
rpm	yum
no rpm is available for it neither yum is helping me

128677
many-to-one	one-to-many
i have found questions on se for the opposite situation many-to-one but this would be a one-to-many situation

128685
filesystems	ntfs
if you ve previously tried to run windows chkdsk on an ntfs-3g filesystems containing colons but that was mounted and used under linux without either the windows_names or option the only way to restore ntfs filesystems integrity is to boot a windows operating system and allow windows chkdsk to permanently delete all files containing colons

128685
filesystems	ntfs
put another way be very very careful running windows chkdsk on an ntfs filesystems that has been written to using ntfs-3g under linux

128685
filesystems	ntfs
however there is virtually no one using filesystems that are exclusively non-windows-compatible ntfs and never intended to be used with windows so almost everyone actually needs the non-default behavior

128685
filesystems	ntfs
tuxera s recommended failsafe way to repair a corrupted ntfs filesystems is to boot a windows operating system and run chkdsk

128685
filesystems	ntfs
unfortunately many folks use ntfs as a universal filesystems for portability and backups

128706
filesystems	btrfs
i then chose btrfs on about 20gb partition for the root of the filesystems i chose btrfs because of its cow properties i assume this will allow even wear across the drive also btrfs is just badass

128717
vim	emacs
in order to run a tool such as emacs or vim in this manner you ll often ties need to have access to a tty device so that you can get access to its stdin and stdout

128718
stdout	stderr
it also tries very hard to get the contents of stdout and stderr from the pre script

128718
stdout	stderr
proc_std and proc_err are threads that repeatedly call readline on stdout and stderr

128718
stdout	stderr
since your script inherits the stdout and stderr socket from the pre script they will never encounter eof

128718
stdout	stderr
this ensures your script doesn t inherit stdout and stderr so anaconda doesn t hang and the install can continue

128726
debian	linux
i m working on an embedded-x86 linux device that runs debian linux 3.8.13

128726
packets	multicast
that sort-of-works but i have some programs that are supposed to send ipv6 multicast packets out of both ports at all times and they can t do that on a port that doesn t have an ipv6 address assigned to it

128751
gentoo	linux
i have a gentoo linux system in which i am logged in as root

128776
x86	mips
for some reason this depends on the architecture arm and x86 don t copy .config but mips and tile do

128809
mouse	keyboard
by inactivity i mean lack of mouse and keyboard events

128809
mouse	keyboard
execute second script when that period is interrupted by mouse or keyboard

128817
folder	directory
is it possible to create some kind of directory watcher and trigger a script when the folder is not empty

128820
kde	gnome
this happens whether i am using gnome or kde

128842
freebsd	linux
most guides you find will be for linux but the pam configuration will be very similar on freebsd

128862
folder	directory
you can move your home directory to a new folder

128881
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
just to clarify i have ubuntu arch linux opensuse and windows 7 on this machine but i am using ubuntu as the main os and allowing it to manage grub and its configurations

128916
versioning	upgrade
now the problem with that i guess is that the upgrade packages themselves could depend on upgrade versioning of other packages on the system which means that the list of stuff to download could get arbitrarily long

128945
bash	zsh
afaik zsh and csh is the same as bash in this case

128946
kde	gnome
gnome kde localizations and localized man pages

128958
sudoers	visudo
in order to let anyone run skype the new scripted one you need to edit the sudoers file using visudo so anyone preferrably in a group possibly group skype can call it as user skype

128962
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
try other distribution as fedora or debian mint if you like ubuntu

128971
inittab	fstab
if you want to put all of etc on a different partition you can make a minimal etc that contains just what is needed etc fstab what init needs etc inittab or etc init and or whatever your init system uses minimal etc passwd and etc group etc.

128980
stdout	stderr
that s nothing to do with grep - it s because the pipe | redirects the standard output stream stdout whereas the permission denied messages are in the standard error stream stderr

128980
stdout	stderr
you could achieve the result you want by combining the streams using redirect the stream whose file descriptor is 2 to the stream whose file descriptor is 1 so that stderr as well as stdout gets piped to the input of the grep command

128980
stdout	stderr
so you can also use this construct as well if you want to join stderr and stdout

128981
stdout	stderr
the permission denied lines are going to the stderr standard error stream but you are piping stdout standard out through grep

128983
bash	zsh
the shell program can choose to act as a login shell in other circumstances for example bash and zsh act as a login shell if passed the -l command line option

128983
bash	zsh
with zsh you can do and with ksh93 bash or zsh you can do exec -a -bash bash

128985
bash	zsh
please note that patrick s answer s inconsistent results are mostly a result of him using zsh then bash

128998
jobs	cron
cron jobs using the keychain

129010
folder	directory
i want to compress a working folder to save it as a backup but i have some files and a directory that contains huge files that i don t need to save

129038
stdout	stderr
redirect stdout and stderr to same place

129051
kde	gnome
i would stay away from gnome or kde as they would eat up more ram

129076
spaces	delimiter
expands to a single argument with all the elements delimiter by spaces actually the first character of

129105
bonjour	avahi
a future solution will likely use bonjour on the client side and avahi on the server so we can have a connectionless protocol but this will take time to implement and i need an interim solution because any software we add to the client side takes a very long time to get approval for

129144
put	get
if you put that in .bashrc instead every time you launched an interactive sub-shell some addition would get tacked on to the end of the path again creating extra work for the shell when you mistype a command

129164
email	dkim
you should set up spf and dkim authentications to stop email be considered as spam

129164
dns	spf
spf consists in adding a txt dns record to your domain

129164
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	email	dkim
see create and configure dns records for a domain and authenticate email with dkim on debian or ubuntu linux for more details

129201
debian	linux
but you can also save the settings to the file etc network interfaces debian gnu linux or appropriate of networkmanager

129240
ubuntu	linux
my linux version is 2.6.32-47-server gcc version 4.4.3 ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5.1 #109-ubuntu smp tue may 7 02 17 05 utc 2013

129246
sudoers	visudo
only root can use visudo to edit etc sudoers

129248
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i run arch linux with kernel 3.14.3-2 but i also tried it in ubuntu 12.04 ubuntu 14.04 debian jessie and fedora

129265
ceil	floor
it looks like the estimate of the entropy added is essentially the floor not ceil because of the initial bitshift before the loop of base 2 logarithm of delta

129274
sudoers	visudo
clearly the user running visudo already has permissions to edit etc sudoers and therefore has the ability to add rules that will allow execution of any other commands on the system

129274
sudoers	visudo
if a user changes etc sudoers with visudo that can be seen by checksumming or reviewing the file

129315
ftp	smb
i have a system with a watch folder where people companies can upload new files via ftp or smb

129321
pull	push
puppet is strictly speaking a pull solution so what you re proposing will be difficult using it since what you re looking for sounds more like a push solution from your desktops to your servers

129358
stdout	stderr
for some reason -v writes to stderr and not stdout but that is a detail

129359
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
interestingly a live usb with certain linux distros are recognized on my computer such as linux mint cinnamon and ubuntu

129361
kde	gnome
gtk is the standard toolkit for gnome while qt is used by kde

129367
debian	linux
i m designing an app that will be deployed installed to a linux machine perhaps archlinux but could be any distro and in fact i would actually prefer something lightweight and inside the debian family if at all possible

129377
folder	directory
make a folder called test and use this python script in the same directory where the folder is

129391
bash	zsh
is this possible in bash or zsh

129404
mongodb	bson
bsondump from mongodb goes the inverse way but i m clueless as to what i can use to go from json to bson

129430
gentoo	linux
pygoscelis papua linux is an unofficial build of gentoo linux for amazon ec2

129430
gentoo	linux
multiple wordpress blogs gentoo linux and amazon ec2

129436
mouse	keyboard
it transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another relaying the graphical screen updates back in the other direction over a network

129436
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
this allows the user to control their x11 desktop kde gnome xfce etc. from a remote computer either on the user s own network or from over the internet as if the user were sitting in front of it

129459
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
p - indicates the protocol as tcp udp or icmp

129461
solaris	aix
it isn t clear to me what units the used and free space are given in when -i is in effect and i don t see any more-relevant switches except that -i will show the number of used inodes and the percentage of inodes in use. note usr sysv bin df -v on aix â œreports percent of blocks used as well as the number of blocks used and freeâ which is similar to solaris s usr bin df -v behavior

129468
chmod	sudoers
i typed pkexec chmod 0440 etc sudoers

129472
versioning	upgrade
it was very easy to install ipython and upgrade it to the newest versioning 2.0 using pip

129472
versioning	upgrade
i finally installed it using yum but i can t figure out how to upgrade to the recent versioning

129521
stdout	stderr
this will send both stdout and stderr to home user stdout_and_error.log

129521
stdout	stderr
this will send stdout to home user stdout_and_error.log and stderr to what was previously stdout

129521
stdout	stderr
meaning in it sends stderr 2 to wherever stdout 1 currently goes

129521
stdout	stderr
but if you afterwards redirect stdout somewhere else stderr doesn t go with it

129521
stdout	stderr
this is why in your first example both stdout and stderr will go to the same place but in the second they won t

129522
stdout	stderr
combining stderr stream #2 with stdout stream #1 adds stderr into stdout

129522
stdout	stderr
you re first example would append stdout to a file then add stderr to stdout

129522
stdout	stderr
you re second example would add stderr to stdout then append the combined stdout with stderr included to a file

129554
ubuntu	centos
i have a problem in sadf between ubuntu and centos

129554
ubuntu	centos
i need to display time in ubuntu as it s displayed in centos epoch time

129561
umask	chmod
the umask is a value which tells the kernel which access-bits to clear on newly created files this primarily affects the open 2 and creat 2 system calls â you would still be able to set access bits â forbiddenâ through the umask value by explicitly calling chmod 2 on the freshly created file

129607

however when i have windows that go off screen and i want to move them so that you can see their title bars you can hold down the alt key and then put the mouse anywhere on the window you want to move and then hold down the left mouse button and drag the window in place so that you can see the title bar

when using ssh vpn tunnel -w option is there a way to know when the tunnel is actually up

130641
g++	gcc
and yeah g++ will be installed with all gcc ports

130668
config	ini
ansible uses ssh no agent required the config files are in ini format

130668
config	ini
ex uses ssh no agent required config file can be written in plain perl in ini format or using template like yaml or template toolkit

width	height
i am running debian live cd in qemu kvm and when i connect to vnc via vncviewer localhost 5900 the window is cropped to some static width and height combination

130709
bash	tcsh
bonus points does bash have something like tcsh s ability to do

130716
bash	zsh
as for the bonus question i don t think bash can do that but zsh is awesome and can do it

130734
ubuntu	linux
i am using a host ubuntu 14.04 system and i am currently going through the linux from scratch guide here

130741
versioning	upgrade
add testing to your sources.list and upgrade your versioning of glib

130746
filesystems	btrfs
suppose i have 2 btrfs filesystems

130746
filesystems	btrfs
how would i shrink the btrfs filesystems lying on dev sde to dev sde1

130750
folder	directory
as you know directory storage is a shared home folder between user root and user openelec

130764
filesystems	btrfs
if you have all of dev sde under btrfs management how would you create the partition dev sde1 on the drive dev sde without destroying the existing filesystems

130789
lvm	mdadm
you can simply setup the lvm vg volume group on top of a md mdadm raid1

130789
ubuntu	debian
tutorial mdadm software raid on ubuntu debian systems

130797
daemons	systemd
the intent would be to have more than 65k daemons listening on a given systemd

130822
nagios	mrtg
we have mrtg available currently for trending and can use nagios for alerting of a particular threshold being exceeded

130835
bash	subshell
if i execute a subshell bash it works fine

130848
daemons	systemd
the intent would be to have more than 65k daemons listening on a given systemd

130860
cinnamon	gnome
i guess the 2 finger events are caught by gnome or cinnamon and not passed trough propagation is stopped

130868
children	parent	stdout	stderr
the key thing to be aware of here is that children inherit the stdin stdout stderr file descriptors of their parent

130919
redhat	fedora
i think it won t work with the current versions of fedora and redhat

130926
bash	zsh
seconds in ksh zsh and bash is a special variables that holds the number of seconds since the shell started

130937
exponent	modulo
i am trying to extract modulo and exponent components from public key which is in .pem file using below command

130941
jobs	cron
i have several questions related to non-interactive non-login shells and cron jobs

130941
jobs	cron
q4 how can i set bash_env for cron jobs

130947
sysv	systemd
if by in you mean is started from a shell then this depends on the init systemd -- sysv executes shell scripts for services so those services are always started via a shell

130967
bash	zsh
bash and zsh have different default behavior when it comes to failed globbing

131010
rpm	yum
i installed bsdtar from source from the libarchive website because i could not find an rpm nor a package in yum

131017
rpm	yum
yum relies on rpm to do the transaction .

131017
rpm	yum
but you have to do the actual rollback using an external bootable lvm environment because yum rpm glibc could all be hosed by that point

131032
bash	zsh
i have an alias in bash that i m trying to port over to zsh

131033
bash	zsh
in both zsh and bash expands first to and then because of the unquoted each is treated as a pattern to perform globbing on

131033
bash	zsh
here you don t want globbing so you should quote all the globbing characters in both zsh and bash zsh is just kind enough to point your mistake to you

131037
ubuntu	centos
at least that s the case on fedora centos and other distros from what i can gather from this forum post titled mysql forums mysql workbench ubuntu cannot start ssh tunnel manager

131041
bash	zsh
this answer assumes that your shell is bash zsh or ksh93.

131043
hash	salt
the script creates a file secret.enc given by the variable secretfile in its directory by using openssl to encrypt the file using the sha512sum salt hash of the filepath as the passphrase

131077
kde	gnome
this is the difference between a desktop environment de like kde or gnome and just a window manager like openbox

131077
ubuntu	openbsd	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	openbsd	gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	debian
for this i use the image viewer feh it has packages for arch linux debian freebsd gentoo openbsd and ubuntu

131100
zsh	tcsh
with csh tcsh or zsh is mapped to the array and you can print its elements one per line with

131101
udp	tcp
a partial solution seems to be to use cat proc net tcp and cat proc net udp command lines

131102
udp	tcp
you should be able to find all open ports in proc net tcp and proc net udp

131125
folder	directory
if there are any new files folder i create in my samba share directory guests are by default able to right in read from the new files folder

131129
ubuntu	debian	macports	homebrew
enables autojump if installed with homebrew macports or debian ubuntu package

131162
x86	64bit
i need to install gcc version 4.7.1 with 64bit support on the solaris x86 machine i m using for my user account only so as to not modify the system as a whole

131172
debian	linux
linux is 2.6.35.3 with debian wheezy on armhf

131199
ubuntu	linux
both computers are running ubuntu gnu linux version 12.04 and have been configured to use dhcp upon installation

131206
dnf	yum
note that dnf is a replacement for yum and became the default package manager in fedora 22

131206
dnf	yum
if you re on an early version of fedora you can replace dnf with yum in any of the previous commands and you ll get the same results

131224
ethernet	wireless
however now i see that i have em1 for the ethernet card and wlp3s0 for the wireless

131242
put	get
here is the complete list of variables that i get from a simple test i put in script

131275
bash	zsh
in ksh bash zsh only but not in bin sh

131275
bash	zsh
in ksh93 bash zsh only but not in bin sh

131310
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu if home bin exists it will be automagically added to path but this doesn t happen in debian

131332
udp	tcp
i already allowed the 53 port tcp and udp but the dns does not work

131387
ubuntu	debian
the command-not-found package is responsible for that behavior in debian and ubuntu

131395
bash	zsh
zle is zsh s line editor like readline is bash s

131406
filesystems	btrfs
the whole point of having a copy-on-write cow filesystems like btrfs is that the content of multiple versions of a file can be efficiently shared

131421
udp	tcp
see the man page for upnpc of course for more details but here you can see -e sets the name of the forward setting -a lists the server s ip addresses the last three items are inside port outside port type of connection tcp udp

131457
folder	directory
however after checking the installation folder i am confused because there seem a lot of seemingly useless folder and files inside the directory

131460
kde	gnome
if you re running something from the gnome family like gnome shell cinammon or mate a kde app isn t likely to integrate well into your environment

131460
kde	gnome
this is because the app expects the kde version of things like notifications or the system tray to be there instead of the gnome version and can t deal with the difference

131460
kde	gnome
some people feel that if you have gnome and kde libraries simultaneously installed you have destroyed the purity of your gnome system and the os has now been dirtied with the kde libraries

131460
kde	gnome
this feeling has no technical basis but a lot of people do feel like that including me i must admit and will therefore avoid pulling kde libraries in as dependencies or conversely avoid pulling in gnome libraries into their kde systems

131462
xfce	gedit
i have tried cycling through different gtk xfce themes available using the xfce4-appearance-settings app but this affects the tab appearance of everything except gedit

131462
xfce	gedit
i m using gedit 3.10.4 and xfce version 4.10

131467
bash	zsh
with bash also zsh and ksh you can do like this

131473
redhat	fedora
the kernel-devel package in fedora and other redhat derivatives does not contain the full kernel source just headers for public interfaces and makefiles needed for driver development

131502
gmail	hotmail
i can send and receive mail from gmail and others but not hotmail

131506
daemons	systemd
the directory etc init.d contains systemd scripts that essentially start stop restart daemons systemd services

131517
daemons	systemd
the proper location according to the filesystem hierarchy standard is in run but var run also sees significant use and on many modern systemd is the same as run and tmp don t require root privileges on startup which systemd daemons very often have before they drop privileges

131520
pull	push
because if you do ssh for pull push file jenkin s uses jenkin as standard user

131537
hash	md5
real world will have the same md5 hash unless they have been

131560
debian	linux
i would like to use only opensource free linux debian packages

131567
centos	linux
note though this is a linux appliance of sorts it s actually based on centos

131571
stdout	stderr
i ve also modified dostuff to send the echo to stderr where it will be shown on the terminal and then the printf sends to stdout where it will be captured into the variable stuff

131585
folder	directory
a directory is a folder a place where you can put files or other directory and special files devices symlinks...

131586
disk	ram
the server a blade server with 10k sas disk 32gb ram and 8 core xeon 3 ghz

131587
centos	linux
oracle linux derives from rhel centos so i would expect the application to be available in a similarly named package

131588
bash	zsh
i use a for-loop that does what i intend in bash but behaves very oddly in zsh

131604
freebsd	linux
although there are cryptography experts recommending that we not depend on full disk encryption i think on freebsd or linux that a chaining different encryption strategies may be a reasonable strategy

131676
centos	linux
i am wondering if i could install a linux os centos is the only one with which i am little familiar on the free space and access her windows file system

131698
versioning	upgrade
will it upgrade overwrite the old versioning ok

131716
bash	zsh
i want to be able to start zsh with a custom rc file similar to the command bash --rc-file path to file

131744
versioning	upgrade
if you get an error message saying that handbrake breaks libdvdread4 you can upgrade libdvdread4 to the wheezy-backports versioning

131767
bash	zsh
this requires mksh ksh93 yash or bash or zsh which doesn t have all these quoting issues

131776
uptime	reboot
if you want it in numerical form it s the first number in proc uptime in seconds so the time of the last reboot is

131819
unix	solaris
this command works on many other unix systems too solaris â

131834
filesystems	fat
you can certainly create a directory of links to your music in the structure you ve described if it s anything but a fat filesystems but fat doesn t support links so you d have to create windows lnk files aka shortcuts

131869
apache	nginx
i posted a comment suggesting to set tomcat to listen on 80 or to use apache nginx as a reverse proxy which is what i think you should really be doing

131874
sudo	passwd
this causes sudo to prompt for your passwd if your session is expired

131912
filesystems	ntfs
contrary to what most people believe ntfs is a posix-compatibleâ¹ filesystems and it is possible to use permissions on ntfs

131920
pulseaudio	mixer
if mplayer is using the pulseaudio mixer likely then you can also try m 9 and 0 mplayer s default mute and volume keys

131921
bluetooth	usb
i believe you have to start compiling a kernel for a virtual machine emulator drivers for that especific video card drivers for just one ether card and no need for shadowed passwords usb support bluetooth wireles drivers filesystems and all exoteric stuff there is

131921
openbsd	freebsd
the bottom system could be a more security rigorous system such as openbsd or freebsd

131921
openbsd	linux
plus i wish there was a workstation openbsd distro as well not a server openbsd distro to run this pocket linux distros on openbsd with qemu

131921
openbsd	linux
because the base system for openbsd is audited and none of the linux code is most of the time not completely sure

131936
filesystems	ntfs
this will show you some information about partitions witch can help you decide witch one is your d size in blocks filesystems type vfat ntfs ..etc and index

131937
sudo	passwd
as there is a sudo -i in the script will i be prompted again for the passwd

131940
freebsd	netbsd
newer versions of freebsd and netbsd sed support both -e and -r

131940
openbsd	netbsd
-i works with gnu sed recent versions of netbsd openbsd sed but not os x s sed

131942
mouse	keyboard
but when i start passing through an usb-device external hard drive the mouse keyboard still works fine stops working on the vnc client

131946
kde	gnome
if your desktop environment is gnome or kde not sure if this will work anywhere else - and no idea about gnome 3 then autokey is probably exactly what you re looking for and a lot more

131949
bash	subshell
bash has a variable that contains the pid of the current subshell

131953
debian	linux
i have a linux based server under debian 7.1 and several windows computers

131953
filesystems	ntfs
my question is what is the best filesystems format for this exchange ntfs or ext on the exchange hard drive for best performances and security

131956
sudo	passwd
in my experience sudo never asks for passwd if you are already root although i couldn t find this explicitly documented

131967
debian	linux
i m new to linux development and need some pointers to help me get a camera ov7670 working on a beaglebone running debian

131972
bash	zsh
i don t think bash is able to do that so you might try out zsh

131977
mutt	thunderbird
i ve switched from using thunderbird to offlineimap and mutt

131979
solaris	sunos
then i tried to install it on solaris 8 sunos ms-sparc8 5.8

132008
ubuntu	linuxmint	ubuntu	mint
and since mint is based on ubuntu and i was trying to install either or ubuntu 14.04 or linuxmint 16 i figured i d ask here as well

132008
installation	upgrade
i have since upgrade to windows 8.1 pro lost grub during the installation but from the hdd partition size of windows i knew my linux partition was still there

132008
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
should have just reinstalled grub but instead tried reformatting the linux partition and doing a clean install of ubuntu 14.04 x64 and also tried mint 16 x64 cinnamon

132028
udp	tcp
-u use udp instead of the default option of tcp

132029
terminate	timeout
i want to create the entire folder 7 gb archive without any terminate message timeout

132043
bash	zsh
so the answer is this is not possible in bash you need to use zsh for this

132056
google-chrome	firefox
gedit firefox google-chrome and it will be opened on my client machine just the window actually application works on the remote machine - on server

132068
disk	ram
i often start a long running command that is bound to either cpu disk ram or internet connection

132068
fish	bash
is there a reasonable way to do this with either bash or fish shell

132100
imagemagick	pdftk
it depends on imagemagick and pdftk

132119
debian	linux
debian gnu linux at least configures gcc binutils to generate executables with this field set to 0 by default

132146
stdout	stderr
a short answer redirect both stdout and stderr to file tmp

132152
stdout	stderr
if ls writes on both its file descriptor 1 stdout for the file list and file descriptor 2 stderr for the error messages those outputs will overwrite each other assuming tmp is a regular file and not a named pipe

132152
stdout	stderr
actually the stdout output will be buffered so is more likely to be written at the end before ls exits so it will overwrite the stderr output

132153
disk	ram
3 as an alternative you can read from a fixed position for example from the beginning of the disk with the same dd command but always at least so many as many ram you have

132154
gentoo	linux
i m running 64-bit version of gentoo linux

132158
g++	gcc
where i am lost is how do i hardcode the paths of my local libs into all the required binaries gcc g++ etc

132163
ubuntu	debian
tested and works on debian 5 6 ubuntu 14.04

132164
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i currently run linux mint 16 petra with mate which is based on ubuntu 13.10

132201
bash	zsh
in your shell customisation file .zshrc for zsh .bashrc for bash ...

132201
umask	mkdir
that is set the umask to 7 but redefine mkdir to a function where the real mkdir is called with the same arguments with a umask of 2

132219
stdout	stderr
if the message were sent to stderr or stdout there would definitely be a system call trace showing ssh write to stderr stdout

132219
stdout	stderr
does ssh directly manipulate terminal device to display the message without interacting with stderr stdout

132221
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian based systems use the suffix -dev but fedora uses the suffix -devel

132237
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
if your shell supported brace expansion works with csh tcsh ksh zsh bash mksh lksh pdksh yash with brace-expand enabled by calling yash --brace-expand or set in interative shell with set -o brace-expand or fish

132248
debian	linux
i ve got two vms with arch linux and debian running under virtual box

132256
min	max
every time i run a command to change the min and max freq settings cpuspeedutils it changes some items as you can see below

132278
filesystems	ntfs
as per patrick s comments the filesystems is mounted with the in-kernel ntfs driver which is read only

132288
bash	zsh
and a pure shell one bash zsh ksh

132314
spaces	delimiter
awk does the job in one-line but cut needs a grep command to get only the lines which contain particular word and it prints the column 2 according to the delimiter spaces

132328
pull	push
or is this sharing approach doomed to end in tears and lost data and i should resign myself to using two copies and lots of cursing when i find i forgot to push pull latest changes between them

132331
children	parent
the main difference is the returned value of the fork system call which is the pid of the child in the one that is identified as parent and 0 in the child which is how the software can determine which process is considered the parent the parent has the responsibility to take care of its children and which is the child

132337
debian	mint	debian	linux
it works fine on linux mint but not on debian 7.5

132360
bash	zsh
bash and zsh will write out a temporary file for every heredocument - but they clean them up too

132371
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this works for ubuntu and i am currently testing it in linux mint both cinnamon and mate versions

132382
sysv	systemd
each nix has an init systemd and there are various different init systemd out there sysv upstart systemd etc.

132382
daemons	systemd	sysv	systemd
now systemd has some support for running sysv daemons so you might be able to get away with writing a sysv script and have it work for both but i do not know how that will fare with upstart and other systemd

132413
filesystems	ntfs
non-unix filesystems may give unexpected answers how is the unix user mapped to a sid for ntfs

132415
zypper	yum
in general opensuse doesn t have yum it will have zypper

132459
redhat	fedora
i can t check since i don t have a redhat based machine but as far as i can tell from searching here it should be installable on fedora with

132472
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
it is derived from the almquist shell ash originally to serve as bin sh on debian and also used in ubuntu and other derivatives and other linux distributions

132473
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
the dash shell a posix-compliant derivative of the almquist shell used as bin sh in debian ubuntu and other linux distributions

132487
tunnel	packets
through a bunch of routing and iptable rules packets coming out of the loopback interface are sent over an ipsec tunnel

132487
tunnel	packets
this is mostly happening when packets are being forward from the loopback interface go through the xfrm rules and into the tunnel

132492
spaces	delimiter
cut -d treats each individual spaces character as a delimiter

132492
spaces	delimiter
awk s default delimiter is any whitespace sequence which can be multiple spaces a tab etc

132499
cpu	processors
if it helps the computer is a toshiba satellite s855d laptop with an amd apu quad-core processors 3 cpu 1 gpu

132533
sysv	systemd
once upon a time they all used more or less the same sysv style init excepting some which used a more bsd style systemd which allowed for the writing of generic init scripts that would require little modification from distro to distro

132533
debian	centos
currently sysv is still used by a number of distros such as debian and rhel centos

132533
sysv	systemd
al. and upstart ubuntu 1 do include mechanisms for backward support of sysv style init scrips so if you are looking for the method most easily adopted for use on the most systemd that is still it

132533
ubuntu	debian
1 but ubuntu and debian are moving to systemd meaning upstart will likely disappear and most of the major distros will have a common init system

132567
centos	linux
i am using centos linux 2.6.32-431.11.2.el6.x86_64

132585
notepad++	scite
so after defining your language in notepad++ you should be able to get the compiled lexer and adding it to scite

132597
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu debian based you may run apt-cache show package command to view all the information about the package

132598
ubuntu	debian
i found .kde share config khotkeysrc on both machines debian jessie and ubuntu 14.04

132601
bash	zsh
this is the globstar option in bash 4+ and ksh and is supported by default in zsh

132602
openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
could it be a bug of netbsd file name troff.1b works in openbsd and linux

132612
client-side	server-side
telnet is two things a server-side application daemon and a client-side application

132625
ubuntu	linux
while i don t own a otg cable is there a way that i could fake an otg device to my android phone using my ubuntu linux desktop

132631
bash	zsh
if you don t want to hard-code the external path but you do want to prevent the use of the builtin you can use note capital p in bash in ksh and in zsh

132638
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
example the cpio man page under freebsd solaris linux use different lines for the different modes indicated by the choice between -i -o and -p

132644
bash	tcsh
i am having problems with simple scripting my box is centos so bash is the default shell now i wanted to send a line via setenv tcsh and would like to make a script that will ask me to input a string to setenv every time i login

132669
debian	linux
i am new to linux debian and i am trying to made a program to experiment bitwise operators

now i want to install php-fpm varnish apc fastcgi as well memcached to speed up my server for my wordpress website

132683
stdout	stderr
i want all of the stdout and stderr to go to the log file but only the lines with volume from stdout to be written to the terminal

132686
debian	linux
i m running debian gnu linux 6.0.6 alias squeeze inside virtualbox for windows from here and it has two sets of login details

132688
stdout	stderr
this combines the stdout and stderr from mplayer appends note the -a to tmp server.log and grep s all lines for the word volume

132692
post	put
if i need to i will put further questions in a separate post

132695
stdout	stderr
here i am first appending stderr to file and passing only stdout to tee and using grep from there

132721
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu or linux in general is there a correct location to install services that you download from the internet and want to run

132722
openbsd	debian
an exception to that seems to be at least the csh-20110502 found on my debian system itself based on openbsd s csh

132733
centos	linux
which yum package should i install to get the setfacl command on my linux virtual server running centos 6

132733
folder	directory
i need this command to correctly setup directory access for my symfony log and caching folder per their instructions

132737
folder	directory
this directory contains two folder folder_1 and folder_2

132750
overwrite	preserve
the value is indeed preserve by sudo but afterwards overwrite by the shell

132759
rpm	yum
the next time yum or rpm runs they ll pick these files up that are present here

132763
folder	directory
i m trying to make a inotifywait script take different actions for files vs folder if it sees a close_write flag being raised in the watched directory but cannot seem to get the checks working

132782
bash	zsh
if you want to use only shell zsh ksh93 bash here s another way

132786
kerberos	ldap
i m currently trying to set up an integrated kerberos v ldap system for authentication authorization

132786
kerberos	ldap
from what i have managed to gather there are at least two ways to integrate kerberos v with ldap

132786
kerberos	ldap
use ldap as a backend to store kerberos principals

132786
kerberos	ldap
user kerberos and sasl authentication via gssapi to authenticate to the ldap server to be able to query and modify the ldap entries using a kerberos ticket

132786
kerberos	ldap
the thing is i would like to make a hybrid of the two not just use ldap to store kerberos principals but also make sure that when i add a kerberos principal it s created with in order for it to appear as a unix user entry to nss for authorization purposes

132804
debian	linux
i compared the ctrl + l in the linux debian terminal and the cls in powershell

132843
rpm	yum	redhat	fedora
any time you have a question about a command on a redhat distro such as fedora centos or rhel it s best to utilize the package manager tools rpm or yum

132856
gif	png
i am an ubuntu 12.04.4 lts 32-bit user and i would like to automate the process of opening several png images as layers then saving these layers as a single animated gif file in the gui of gimp

133869
gif	png
with imagemagick you can convert a stack of png files into an animated gif quite easily

133886
ubuntu	mint
note below is from here but will work since mint uses same repos as ubuntu

133888
debian-based	ubuntu
is there an easy way to download all the dependencies for a package on a second ubuntu computer for a debian-based system crunchbang on a laptop lacking internet

133889
debian	linux	dpkg	apt
i m primarily interested in debian wheezy but a good answer would explore a solution that works with any reasonably modern linux distribution based around the same package management infrastructure apt dpkg and friends

133903
sudo	passwd
on this particular box the root login is disabled and every time i need to run something with sudo it asks for my passwd

133905
sudo	passwd
you can configure sudo to work without the user passwd

133913
spaces	delimiter
the x modifier after the delimiter allows the use white spaces and comments so your regular expressions are more readable

133917
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
firstly if you find that entering your passwd at every sudo is tedious do as mirimir suggests and edit the etc sudoers file to something like

133917
chown	sudo
change the owner thusly sudo chown root root path to script.sh

133936
sudo	passwd
therefore i issued the command sudo -i and input my passwd

133937
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
when i installed ubuntu i had a partitions with the windows os installed but now i ve made some changes i ve erased windows created two new partitions in the storage ocuppied by windows before and installed linux mint and a new home partition for linux mint

133942
ubuntu	linux
can i recover from a system disk error on ubuntu linux

133962
pop-up	dialog
my router is recognized and the following dialog pop-up every 2 mins or so

133973
wan	lan
what you need is to make sure the lan route takes precedence over the wan one

133985
stdout	stderr
with rshd tail stdout would have been the socket directly but sshd adds encryption and is able to multiplex several streams like for port agent x11 tunnel redirection stderr on a single tcp connection so has to resort to pipes

133985
stdout	stderr
another drawback of using -t -tt is that stdout and stderr are not differentiated on the client

133985
stdout	stderr
both the stdout and stderr of the remote command will be written to the ssh client s stdout

134008
cinnamon	gnome
it does the job pretty well and i think cinnamon 2.2 feels better than gnome3.10 on ubuntu gnome 14.04

134031
debian	linux
i m experimenting with using btrfs on my debian linux armhf system

134046
bash	zsh
if you are using ksh93 zsh or bash you can use the ksh-extension which does c-style backslash escape interpretation inside the quoted string

134052
folder	directory
for this we create a folder named zorin inside the mnt directory with this command mkdir mnt zorin

134055
phpmyadmin	adminer
not to mention that phpmyadmin is no longer under development adminer is phpmyadmin s present and future

134064
rtp	rtsp
in the past i have successfully done what op asks by using cameras streaming h.264 over rtp controlled by rtsp

134069
folder	directory
one way to transfer files is by using the shared folder feature of virtualbox which allows a directory on the host computer to be mounted or mapped on a guest that has the guest additions installed

134074
zsh	tcsh
with zsh note that which is only built in tcsh or zsh in other shells it can give random results use type in bourne like shells

134078
stdout	stderr
a function that prompts for input and outputs only a newline delimited list of acceptable arguments to stdout and erroneous output to stderr might look like

134080
chown	chmod
chown and chmod returns operation not permitted

134085
jobs	cron
i want such applications to be able to be run as cron jobs

134085
jobs	cron
i want cron jobs to be able to start and stop containers

134095
jobs	cron
but you might not want your cron jobs to run on every single host just one of them

134122
bash	zsh
because of the two levels of shells you need to escape the single quotes twice here using ksh93 bash zsh syntax

134139
stdout	stderr
this propagates ctrl + c ctrl + c will kill ssh and the remote sleep but sends stderr to stdout

134151
cpu	processors
that would be the bloomfield processors based on the nehalem microarchitecture which moved the memory controller from the northbridge onto the cpu which amd had done in 2003 with the opteron amd64 and introduced quickpath interconnect qpi as pendant to amd s hypertransport for cpu cpu and cpu ioh io hub ex-northbridge interconnection

134158
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
for simplicity easy install you could use linux mint or ubuntu

134167
ubuntu	debian
to build the example the freetype dev package is needed on debian maybe also ubuntu use

134168
sudo	passwd
sshpass -p passwd ssh -q username 74.11.11.11 sudo mkdir temp

134168
sudo	passwd
with sudo you could even run mkdir without a passwd

134169
stdout	stderr
with -tt sshd spawns a pseudo-terminal and makes the slave part the stdin stdout and stderr of the shell that executes the remote command

134169
freebsd	solaris
on solaris and freebsd where pipes are bidirectional when the reading end of the pipe which is also a writing end there is closed it returns with pollhup and pollin on freebsd where you have to request pollin or else doesn t return

134173
sudoers	passwd
so in your example etc sudoers on 74.11.11.11 would allow user username to execute mkdir as root without a passwd

134184
ubuntu	linux
unetbootin allows you to create bootable live usb drives for ubuntu fedora and other linux distributions without burning a cd

134190
for-loop	loops
so instead we could just write for-loop s output directly to the outfile in order to maintain the write descriptor for desktop externalservers.txt until loops has finished which should avoid any blank lines being written

134191
gentoo	debian
for anything else you can just assume based on the distro launchd on os x sysvinit on debian openrc on gentoo

134201
centos	linux
i m looking into creating my first email server on centos linux

134203
email	dkim
so dont confuse this with an imap service on the server nor smtp as used by the email server to forward on email based on mx records and spf dkim for domain verification

134218
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am trying to get the automatic brightness bug fixed in linux mint 17 based on the new ubuntu release

134255
folder	directory
this will search for a file not directory named exactly myscript inside your home folder

134304
apache	nginx
most servers apache nginx etc. have a parent process that s owned by root which then forks copies of worker nodes up using a less credentialed user

134304
apache	nginx
the applications that run on top of apache nginx are really the true sources of buffer overflow or sql server injection attacks since the applications are the services that are exposing the entry points for malformed data to be injected into your server stack

134304
apache	nginx	post	get
apache nginx by themselves generally do not accept any input beyond the get post methods that they accept

134310
disk	ram
i m thinking of moving the process to a ram disk and using rsync to copy it back when done

134310
disk	ram
if so how do i go about creating the ram disk

134319
bash	zsh
these work in all posix-style shells bash ksh zsh â

134319
fish	tcsh
cd - also works in tcsh and fish

134324
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
linux 2.2+ solaris 10+ and freebsd s all allow non root users to listen on ports lower than 1024 though just not by default

134324
apache	nginx
these are the privileges for apache but they are likely to work for nginx as well

134349
put	get
so i would expect that you could put this together to get the format that you re asking about

134350
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
i d recommend that the external disk in this case have a filesystems that handles a huge number of files easily thinking reiserfs ext4 with dir_index option xfs maybe btrfs

134358
stdout	stderr
i m not sure if you are trying to hide stderr or redirect it to stdout

134358
stdout	stderr
to redirect stdout and stderr to a file

134358
stdout	stderr
to redirect stdout to a file and hide stderr

134358
stdout	stderr
to redirect stdout to console and hide stderr

134358
stdout	stderr
to redirect stdout to console and stderr to a file

134358
stdout	stderr
to redirect stdout to a file and stderr to a file

134365
debian	mint
i checked debian wheezy package names mint might have a different set but you get the idea

134381
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu linux 12.04.1 with virtualmin 4.08.gpl gpl and 2 cpu cores

134394
unix	solaris	openbsd	solaris
other unix variants have made different choices solaris can run 64-bit programs on a 32-bit kernel as well as the other way round while openbsd cannot run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit kernel

134394
x86	64bit
if your x86 cpu has the lm flag it s a 64bit cpu

134454
ubuntu	mint
if you are using ubuntu or any derivative mint install ubuntu-restricted-extras from the software centre

134457
rpm	yum
when yum s accessing files such as the rpm database

134476
bash	zsh
the same goes for bash s and ksh s and zsh s double bracket syntax

134538
debian-based	linux
i m just in the process of setting up my linux debian-based router with a pppoe connection via an adsl pppoa - pppoe bridge

134549
wan	lan
when i disable eth0 i can access the wan through wwan0 but of course i loose access to the organization lan

134557
width	height
clearly the ability to detect when output has exceeded the current viewport s width and height exist does anyone know how to incorporate this into the terminal itself

134566
bash	zsh
ksh or bash -o extglob or zsh -o kshglob

134573
udp	tcp
if you say -p tcp --dport http this implies -m tcp the same can be done for the udp module --dport and --sport imply the respective module as long the protocol in -p matches

134608
ssl	https
in etc httpd the ssl folder if that is removed does that mean any site on the server if directed to https will not throw warning

134609
ssl	https
once that is done if people try to surf to your site using https they will get an error message saying connection refused - which means that your server doesn t accept any ssl traffic

134613
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i m looking for a new work laptop for development work on linux and after testing way too many distros i pretty much does not want to ever use anything other than xubuntu or possibly some other debian ubuntu based xfce setup

134630
debian	linux
i have a custom hardware i.mx6q based board running a custom stripped version of debian the usual linux tools to make life easy are not available

134637
punctuation	words
if i change it to _ symbol or . punctuation i get the desired behavior but then some_thing will also be two words to font lock and completion

134640
i2c	spi
xilinx - connecting the aardvark i2c spi activity board to the ml507

134642
range	minimum
to copy files with size in a range from minimum to maximum and re-create the directory structure use something like this

134667
folder	directory
i want to copy only directory from a folder on a remote server to my server

134667
folder	directory
the problem is that both are copying the entire folder including all folder and directory from copy from

134678
jobs	cron
if you don t have the laptop turned on all the time choose a time when it is often used and perhaps do it several times a day so that at least some of the cron jobs start

134703
x86	64bit
is there a system or product that can be used in automating the process of building 32bit and 64bit libraries for multiple platforms solaris sparc x86 and windows used in building c++ based software applications that is replicable by other users and on different machines

134739
bash	subshell
this doesn t work because each side of the pipe runs in a subshell in bash and variables set in a subshell are local to that subshell

134759
nerdtree	tagbar
this results in a layout with two sidebars and a centre column containing the main editing buffer the file i m editing but with the cursor in the nerdtree sidebar - resulting in the tagbar being collapsed by default

134759
nerdtree	tagbar
what i want to do is execute the keystroke combination which i ve mapped to the command to move the cursor one buffer to the right between the nerdtree opening and the tagbar being toggled - but so far i haven t managed to get the cursor to move

134760
stdout	stderr
it could be that your script is producing output to stdout and stderr and you are only getting one of those streams output to your log file

134760
stdout	stderr
this redirects stderr 2 into stdout 1 then pipes stdout into tee which copies it to the terminal and to the log file

134760
stdout	stderr
that is redirect stdout both to the original stdout and log.txt internally via a pipe to something that works like tee and then redirect stderr to that as well to the pipe to the internal tee -like process

134766
bash	zsh
in ksh bash or zsh you can use to enable backslash escapes inside the quotes which lets you type to get an escape character

134767
bash	zsh
if you want to both redirect the output of a part of the script and run that part in the parent shell in ksh bash zsh you can use process substitution

134797
debian	linux
additional info i m working on an up-to-date console-only debian wheezy linux

134807
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
i m new to centos and have previously only worked with debian ubuntu servers and i can t seem to get rid of this error

134810
rpm	yum
if you don t use command yum replace something-soft-name you can remove package yum-plugin-replace rpm -e yum-plugin-replace

134823
subnet	packets
my tun0 interface however does not have a default route so only packets to it s subnet are routed through this interface

134852
versioning	upgrade
this is the same versioning as with ubuntu13.04. to upgrade to 2.1.0. i ran the 3 commands using ppa

134854
versioning	upgrade
or you could also upgrade your distribution which will bring you newer versioning of all your applications but takes much more time

134863
sudo	passwd
sudo will close all file descriptors for its invoked process but 0 1 2 and you need dev tty on or you can t enter a passwd but if you can accept blocking for the span it takes to run a single command then you can do the above

134875
sudo	passwd
when you have a system with more than one administrator sudo allows running commands as root without needing the root passwd which is from my point of view more secure

134883
proftpd	vsftpd
while vsftpd is great proftpd may be a bit better with easier imo configuration file

134897
mouse	keyboard
x11vnc allows one to view remotely and interact with real x displays a display corresponding to a physical monitor keyboard and mouse with any vnc viewer

134901
udp	tcp
there is a lot of network activity udp and tcp right now though so i m wondering if the network driver is calling random to get dynamic collision backoff times because of packet collisions

134903
rpm	yum
it s called gnome-disk-utility in centos6 i just confirmed that that rpm is in the default yum repos

134914
rpm	yum
is there a way i can list the configuration flags with yum or rpm without extracting the spec file

134929
stdout	stderr
the process is running in the background in the terminal but the output from stdout and stderr is still being sent to the terminal

134931
stdout	stderr
additionally you must make sure that your program doesn t write to the terminal through stdout or stderr as both of those will no longer exist once the terminal exits

134935
wan	lan
internet - wan bridged_device lan - eth_router - lan

134970
freebsd	linux
i was reading about serving large files from disk when i learned about asynchronous disk io and heard it is better supported in freebsd than linux

134970
ubuntu	linux
i have reasonable experience working on linux ubuntu and prefer using it for the application

134987
folder	directory
i had two folder in the same directory and i wanted to move one into other with the command mv foo foo2

134995
lvm	mdadm
depending on your distro there may be an lvm layer sitting on top of your mdadm raid array

135017
apache	nginx
most people run their httpd apache nginx etc through an init system

135024
vmware	virtualbox
the wifi on the host is not actually directly accessible to the vmware guests or any vm guests using other technologies such as kvm virtualbox etc

135025
cpu	irq
top and friends shows that other then 50 steal time afaiu time stolen by the hypervisor for other vms on the same cpu the rest is almost entirely irq time

135032
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
the following plugins should be installed under debian ubuntu linux

135032
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
the following plugins should be installed under rhel fedora centos scientific linux redhat enterprise linux desktop systems

135033
stdout	stderr
moreover the eof on file1 messages go to stderr while the file1 file2 differ message goes to stdout

135048
folder	directory
i have a folder called share which has symlinks for every subfolder of each pictures directory of each drive

135053
ubuntu	debian
i found this info on this link use html tidy with php5 under ubuntu debian

135054
switching	screens
each console has its own set of programs connected to it and its own video buffer and switching switches which console receives keyboard input and is displayed on the screens

135067
sudoers	passwd
the whole sudoers thing is yet another arguably unnecessary abstraction from the tried and true etc passwd basic user group unix-style permissions scheme and it requires its own management

135081
bash	subshell
but if you do exec an outside process - such as bash or any other - rather than a shell builtin then you don t need the subshell

135085
freebsd	linux
asynchronous io in freebsd isn t totally better than in linux

135085
disk	ram
if your working set page set which shall be in ram for working without obvious process performance degradation is larger than fits in ram including spendings for kernel data disk cache etc. you ll fall into constant swapping

135093
ubuntu	mint
for mint and also for ubuntu 10.04 assogiate is a useful mime-type editor

135094
disk	ram
1 you can also set platform on sys power disk to do the same thing via the system s acpi hardware presuming the driver works properly and puts the machine into suspend state saved to ram

136104
udp	tcp
there are man pages for various other tcp ip udp man 7 tcp man 7 upd man 7 ip settings but i can t find the net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians docs

136139
disk	ram
with linux it s possible to use it as swap space or even as ram disk

136153
put	get
that first sed line is all it takes to get just your first and last lines and put them in the same pattern space for sed editing each of them preceded by a n ewline character

136171
debian	linux
linux localhost 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.57-3+deb7u1 x86_64 gnu linux

136199
debian	linux
platforms debian wheezy 7 red hat enterprise linux 7

136203
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
csh tcsh fish zsh will issue a no match error message and not run the command while the posix shells will still call find but with the pattern unexpanded

136204
tunnel	packets
your script only allows outbound packets to tunnel interface localhost and remote host at 123.123.123.123

136211
tunnel	vpn
what i m trying to do is to route ipv6 traffic through a vpn tunnel

136229
mouse	keyboard
using st with dwm depending on the way i select text mouse vs keyboard and where the text is document body vs address bar copying text from firefox and pasting it into st does not always work

136235
post	get
as other php5 modules are failing as well i m reluctant to just remove the post install scripts -- i d need to remove a couple of them to get php installing

136240
filesystems	ntfs
i want one hard drive to have an ext4 filesystems for linux use only and the other to have an ntfs filesystems for possible future access from windows as well as linux

136240
filesystems	ntfs
should the codes be as for normal filesystems 83 for ext4 and 07 for ntfs or are there special filesystems types used for encrypted volumes or does it not make any difference which codes i choose

136241
filesystems	fat
now create a fat filesystems on your efi-system partition

136258
folder	directory
does it make any difference whether a file system hierarchy sorts files by types and put them all under one directory like all the binaries are under bin or on the other hand sorts them by package name such as all firefox files are under the firefox folder

136260
fastboot	adb
i need to access my nexus 7 2013 lte deb over adb and fastboot but it seems that it s required to be root to be able to run the adb server to be able to access the device due to usb rules

136260
fastboot	adb
how can i configure udev to allow access to this device as a non-root user for adb and fastboot

136261
fastboot	adb
simply unplug your android device and replug to be able to access adb and fastboot as a non-root user

136271
disk	ram
ram disk

136271
disk	ram
if the rpi s image does not have to change and it sounds like it doesn t if nothing will try to or should be trying to write to the disk then try using a root filesystem created to be unpacked into ram

136271
disk	ram
all changes occur to the ram disk so there is effectively zero writing to the sd card only reading at boot

136280
rmdir	mkdir
apart from sh the bare minimum that you can t really do anything without is mount umount and halt but it would be atypical to not have also cat cp mv rm mkdir rmdir ps sync and a few more

136280
readonly	temporary
tmpfs filesystem on tmp to allow programs to create temporary files that will be in ram rather than on the root filesystem which may be in flash or readonly

136300
virtualbox	esx
virtualbox does not support running any kind of native virtualization software inside it virtualbox itself kvm rhev hyper-v esx xen in full virtualization mode â

136304
freebsd	solaris
the â œfilesystem typeâ in a pc partition is actually a volume type or more precisely a usage type it s really supposed to indicate which operating system the partition belongs to windows vs solaris vs freebsd and what it s supposed to do with it nested partition of some kind vs filesystem vs swap

136309
versioning	upgrade
a limitation of the unix approach is that it doesn t easily permit the coexistence of multiple versioning of a package which is especially problematic while the package is being upgrade

136311
solaris	aix	filesystems	xfs
log-structured or journaled filesystems such as those supplied with aix and solaris and jfs reiserfs xfs ext3 in data journal

136324
umask	chmod
basically i think i am looking for a recursive way to reapply the default umask parameter to a whole folder with i think chmod

136328
post	put
while using curl to post or put a file to a url there are two different ways to load the file content

136336
mpfr	mpc
so i downloaded and installed mpfr gmp and mpc

136336
mpfr	mpc
follow these links gmp mpfr and mpc

136336
mpfr	mpc
note follow the build and install instructions given for gmp for mpc and mpfr

136350
jobs	cron
i entered crontab -r instead of crontab -e and all my cron jobs have been removed

136352
jobs	cron
crontab -r removes the only file containing the cron jobs

136352
jobs	cron
on redhat centos if your jobs have been triggered before you can find the cron log in var log cron

136360
folder	directory
i want to generate symbolic links from multiple folder while maintaining the directory structure

136409
bash	tcsh
bash was initially designed in the late 80s as a partial clone of ksh with some interactive features from csh tcsh

136409
bash	zsh
nowadays the ksh and zsh globs and to some extent bash -o extglob which implements a subset of ksh globs are functionally equivalent to regexps with a syntax that is less cumbersome to use with filenames and the current shell syntax

136416
spaces	delimiter
pipe that line to awk and print the 5th word delimiter by spaces empties removed and format the resulting string as an integer

136423
bash	zsh
i am using my school s computers and would like to use zsh instead of bash

136434
folder	directory
the permissions on all folder in the directory are fine

136471
bash	zsh
using perl from zsh bash or any other non-csh-like shell

136481
debian	mint
i m interested mainly in debian but also mint also based on debian

136513
floating-point	integer
you can also search on unix stack exchange which has a question tagged bash calculator and now also floating-point how to do integer float calculations in bash or other languages frameworks

136522
stdout	stderr
but i set it to -x debug mode and redirected its stderr to stdout so it prints all of the filenames

136527
ubuntu	debian
as of 14.04 ubuntu doesn t gainsay debian on this

136528
chown	sudo	chown	mount
so that i could use the new partition i did sudo chown me me mount directory to change the file owner and group from root to me which worked fine

136529
filesystems	fat
on the other hand if you use a filesystems that doesn t store uid gid information like fat then the uid gid of every file on the filesystems is taken from the parameters you gave to the mount command either directly or through etc fstab

136530
truecrypt	umount
this version will repeatedly try to umount your truecrypt drive until it succeeds then send one email

136538
chown	chmod
i ve done a chown and chmod on the directory and its children to be able to use it with the app user which is u0_a100 and that works but these permissions are wiped on reboot so no go

136570
kde	gnome
i checked the requirements and it turned out that it requires either gnome or kde

136570
kde	gnome
what makes it compatible with gnome and kde but not with the others

136584
uniq	comm
without the -d option for uniq things quickly get more complicated one way is to invert the output of uniq -u using comm

136613
gentoo	linux
i have a mid-old laptop that i want to use for learning more details about linux so i decided for a first-time gentoo installation

136613
gentoo	linux
my biggest usb stick has 2gb for the live linux so the full gentoo live dvd larger than 2gb is no option

bash	tcsh
for example sh and bash can both execute and csh and tcsh can both execute and though shell-specific startup files like .bashrc .bash_profile and .tcshrc can override those

136615
bash	zsh
zsh doesn t happen to execute bash -specific startup files so that s not an issue for you

136624
bash	zsh
that works in bash and zsh

136645
sudo	passwd
if your user has already sudo privileges which are protected with a passwd i would keep them as-is and only add a stanza to use rsync without a passwd

136677
kde	gnome
there are a few variations on the ssh-askpass program which should also work gnome kde versions

136715
openbsd	linux
usr bin is the location for env on nearly every linux and some unixes including openbsd

136788
bash	zsh
in bash zsh and ksh at least in both vi and emacs modes pressing escape and then underscore inserts the last word from the previous line into the edit buffer for the current line

136788
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
in bash zsh csh tcsh and most other shells is replaced with the last word of the previous command line when the current command line is parsed

136804
children	parent
these 3 directories are children of a parent directory a b c 1 a b c 2 a b c 3 can this be done with one line in the crontab

debian	linux
operating system debian gnu linux 6

136848
debian	centos
i have servers with debian or centos and i would like to install programs from sources because i can always have up to date software

136851
sudo	passwd
and finnaly as root run passwd sudo passwd sam

136859
puts	gets
basically when it gets an event that a window has been iconized it withdraws it and puts it into a global list

136863
debian	centos
if you want the latest software usually not a good idea on a server it s better to keep a stable system don t use centos which is the most conservative among the major distributions and don t use debian stable

136863
debian	linux
use fedora or debian unstable or arch linux

136876
mouse	keyboard
newer versions do not at least in my testing use keyboard or mouse interrupts for entropy

136899
gentoo	linux
i have a linux gentoo system which performs a cronjob every day at 3 10 in the morning

136901
mouse	keyboard
after i locked my screen with ctrl alt l kde keyboard shortcut that locks the screen and went away for 5 minutes all the usb devices stopped working mouse keyboard headset

136904
rpm	yum
i m using rhel6.0 and encountered the problem that gdb yum rpm don t work any more

136908
rpm	yum
looks like your rpmdb is corrupted rpm -v python says package python is not installed but yum even tells you what python version you have

136908
rpm	yum
afterwards re-run rpm -v python yum and run yum check

136919
ubuntu	linux
i am quite a newbie to ubuntu and linux world

136919
folder	directory
i want to know why is that and if it s possible to extend my home folder as my root directory still has quite some space

136933
titlebar	window
to move around a floating window with no titlebar use mod+drag anywhere on it

136938
folder	directory
can i simply not use the home folder to store my files and directly move them to the root directory

136943
pop-up	dialog
the dialog which pop-up allows you to upload isos which are then available in the storage when creating vms

136964
bash	zsh
i changed my default shell to zsh from bash in ubuntu

136989
chown	chgrp
using the chgrp and chown that only changed the user id utilities

136999
filesystems	btrfs
examples of such filesystems are zfs or btrfs

137022
for-loop	loops
now i want to find whether the listed output files are directory or not by using for-loop or while loops

137025
for-loop	loops
the for-loop loops over all the entries returned by ls then the if tests if the entry is a directory

137028
daemons	systemd
i can start the carbon cache daemons no problem with sudo opt graphite bin carbon-cache.py start but i m struggling to run it as a systemd unit

137041
daemons	systemd
option so that systemd can identify the main process of the daemons

137051
cpu	processors
i ve seen people run parallelized c code on this cluster which when i use top to see what processes are running are shown to be using for example 400 of the cpu since they are using four processors for a single instance of their code

137051
cpu	processors
however instead of top showing the python code to be using 400 of the cpu it is being shown as four different processes each using their own processors at 100

137073
ubuntu	debian
save the config test with apache2ctl -t for debian ubuntu or apachectl -t for rhel then restart apache

137077
bash	zsh
is there a way to do it in bash or zsh

137086
chown	chgrp
there are cases where the desired end condition could not be achieved using the chgrp and chown that only changed the user id utilities

137086
chown	chgrp
now the above implies there are things you can do with chown user group that you can t with chgrp group

137086
sysv	systemd
sysv and a few other systemd allow or used to allow the owner of a file to change the user and group of a file to anything but even in those systemd that text above doesn t make sense to me

137086
chown	chgrp
ok if one does do a chown someone-else the-file one cannot do chgrp something-else the-file afterwards because one is no longer the owner of the file but there s nothing preventing him her from doing the chgrp first staying the owner of the file and chown after and that s not what the text above is exactly saying

137109
bash	zsh
i m using bash so i m not sure if all of the commands will work with a posix sh or zsh ksh .

137119
ftp	smb
- trying different protocols ftp scp smb ruling out a problem with a specific protocol or server

137122
bash	zsh
yes in both bash and zsh you can serialize the contents of a variable in a way that is easy to retrieve using the typeset builtin and the -p argument

137122
bash	zsh
this will work for bash zsh and ksh including passing data between different shells

137122
bash	zsh
bash will translate this to its builtin declare function while zsh implements this with typeset but as bash has an alias for this to work either way for we use typeset here for ksh compatibility

137122
bash	zsh
note for all of these in order to maintain bash zsh cross-compatibility we will be fixing both the cases of typeset and declare so the code should work in either or both shells

137125
folder	directory
if what you want to do is delete everything in the . library caches directory apart from a single folder called snapshots there is no need to use find

137130
bash	zsh
i use the glob above to handle any .files and put it within an sh statement because bash or zsh will likely not interpret the portable shell glob correctly

137149
bash	zsh
it also works with non-ascii characters in bash 4.0 and later and in zsh

137179
redhat	fedora
redhat based distros fedora centos rhel

137187
bash	zsh
.zshrc is a startup file of zsh similar to .bashrc for bash .

137193
folder	directory
move the framework folder to its own directory

137202
cinnamon	gnome
now the gnome shell - and by extension cinnamon - will respond to sighup by completely reinitializing

137215
versioning	upgrade
if you really need these packages you can upgrade your debian to the testing versioning

137223
unix	aix
istat doesn t know any format for unix time on aix

137223
unix	aix
my question how can i display the modification time for a file in unix time format on aix

137250
unix	bsd
if you are into history there is also a 1989 edition the design and implementation of the 4.3 bsd unix operating system

137287
chown	chgrp
then chgrp to a group from a process that running neither as root nor as the user owning the file could make the file off-limit for a later chown

137287
chown	chgrp
for a recursive call there are edge cases where a whole pass of chgrp followed by a whole pass of chown can fail when a single pass would succeed

137290
kde	gnome
if you are searching only for a databased one you can see some project for desktop as nepomuk strigi soprano kde virtuoso and akonadi but even deskbar-applet beegle for gnome

137302
bash	zsh
serialize some or all â ksh bash zsh

137302
bash	zsh
ksh both pdksh mksh and att ksh bash and zsh provide a better facility with the typeset builtin

137302
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh restoring can t be done from a function because typeset statements inside a function are scoped to that function

137303
chown	chgrp
the chown system function - which is the documented system call made by both the chown and chgrp shell utilities - is specified to fail for numerous reasons

137303
chown	chgrp
in this scenario chown then chgrp would fail as the user would no longer have permissions to alter that file s permissions whereas chown user group - so long as group is among the user s own - would succeed

137303
unix	bsd
symbolic links in 4.4 bsd did not have owner group mode or other standard unix system file attributes

137314
ubuntu	debian
see how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

137315
bash	zsh
open a terminal now running bash and run zsh

137323
put	get
pgup and pgdn will get me the first and last options so i can put the two most common choices there and get the rest as needed with a usb keyboard

137334
stdout	stderr
by default sudo closes all file descriptors other than stdin stdout and stderr

137344
centos	linux
i am also aware of sys block loopx loop backing_file however this is only available in linux 2.6.37 and my code needs to run on centos 6 2.6.32

137351
google-chrome	firefox
the technology behind it relies on desktop browsers such as firefox or google-chrome and sets up a peer-to-peer connection between the chat-ees if that s a word

137364
mouse	keyboard
entropy is gained from keyboard usage mouse usb hard drive activity y know.

137370
kde	gnome
now change application framework to gnu tools add a layer called x11 and another called gnome or kde etc

137370
kde	gnome
for servers there is usually no x11 or kde gnome as a graphical user interface is a waist of resources

137393
mouse	keyboard
your computer has one seat assigned a mouse keyboard display microphone camera and audio

137393
mouse	keyboard
a seat is a collection of physical devices mouse keyboard display etc assigned to said seat

udp	tftp
how are clients able to connect to tftp server if the tftp server is not listening on udp port 69

137429
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
if i can t get this to work with mint linux would this be simpler with ubuntu

137439
slackware	suse
do not change versions - this is typical for enterprise-grade distributions like in alphabetical order redhat and suse as well as for some others debian slackware ubunty lts and probably their clones

137445
disk	ram
note that my hard disk and ram are pretty new i bought them 5 months ago

folder	directory
personally i ve used symbolic-links depending of the project either to have link inside var www or var www itself being link to one of the folder in mine home directory for example projects www

137464
udp	tcp
when sending packets from an application that binds to a local address tcp uses a different source address than udp

137464
udp	tcp
for example bind to 10.10.0.51 alias ip the src addr for udp is 10.10.0.51 but the src addr for tcp is 10.10.0.2 primary ip address of the machine

137464
udp	tcp
my question why does tcp use the source address from the routing table but udp uses the source address the application binds to

137486
sudo	passwd
i d like to give her sudo privileges but i was wondering if it s possible to disallow the use of the passwd utility so she can t change my passwd accidentally or intentionally

137487
execvp	execl
that maintained modified copy will then be passed to the next command executed by the process or any of its children via the execvp execl system popen .

137496
mouseup	mousedown
how can i change this to be so that when i move the mouseup from my laptop screen it goes to my pc monitor and when i move the mousedown from the pc monitor it goes to my laptop screen in gnome shell

137542
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
this works fine in bash zsh but not on fish shell

137551
ubuntu	debian
do not mix standard debian with other non-debian archives such as ubuntu in etc apt sources.list

137552
folder	directory
please note this will work only for files or folder that are created within the directory

137563
bash	zsh
in bash zsh ksh

137571
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
other shells with array lists variables include csh tcsh rc es bash which mostly copied the ksh syntax the ksh93 way yash zsh fish each with a different syntax rc the shell of the once to-be successor of unix fish and zsh being the most consistent ones .

137600
gentoo	ubuntu
in this case it is a c program called gsar that is licenced under gpl v2 so it surprises me quite a bit that there is no package for this very useful tool in neither gentoo redhat nor ubuntu

137604
debian	linux
at a quick glance this doesn t seem to be a known debian bug and right now i have no time to test if it applies there as well so maybe it s specific to kali linux

137606
mouse	keyboard
i am not able to switch workspaces or change the focus with the keyboard changing focus with the mouse still works

137627
min	max
what can be the cause for min max buttons not getting displayed for some windows in a jave ui application

137644
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
you can safely use mint or ubuntu they re both based on debian as you suspected same package management etc

137646
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
debian s apt based system is also used with derivatives such as ubuntu and mint so you should be comfortable there

137651
gentoo	linux
what is the difference between arch linux and gentoo linux

137660
backslash	double-quotes
three are necessary because those are contained within double-quotes and the backslash escapes itself in that context

137661
gentoo	linux
arch linux uses the pacman or in some spins such as antergos pacman xg which uses the good precompiled package system while gentoo uses the portage manager which makes packages from source code

137661
gentoo	linux
according to distrowatch arch linux is the 8th in overall popularity while gentoo is at 47th

137661
xfce	gnome
gentoo has a good variety of officially supported desktops from afterstep and blackbox to gnome and xfce

137664
debian	mint	debian	linux
if you like linux mint and would like to see a version closer to debian be sure to take a look at the directly-debian-based version lmde

137667
gentoo	linux
in the installation of gentoo you ll be much more encouraged to compile your own kernel an experience that any power user of linux should go through

137704
spaces	delimiter
essentially the file is broken up by changing the record separator rs to the various entry blocks entry and the fields within those records are delimiter by changing the field separator fs from the default a spaces to the quote marks that hold the values you are seeking

137717
udp	tcp
on my linux systems smakynet is tcp udp 122

137721
daemons	systemd
the 2nd ip is the one associated with the ethernet port on this systemd and the ip 0.0.0.0 is special denoting that the server daemons nginx will bind to any and all interfaces that are present on the box

137731
bash	zsh
i tried this in bash dash sh and zsh and all present the same results

137788
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
on debian and derivatives ubuntu mint â x-terminal-emulator will always launch the administrator s default graphical terminal

137789
ubuntu	debian
shouldn t ubuntu use debian stable for stability

137790
ubuntu	debian
debian is more stable than ubuntu but that doesn t make ubuntu unstable

137790
ubuntu	debian
after time which includes bug reporting and resolution from ubuntu users this unstable branch of debian becomes the stable branch of the next release

137790
ubuntu	debian
that branch will later become ubuntu and much later then next debian stable

137790
redhat	fedora
redhat is very stable but the packages in that distro start their lives in fedora which is roughly the equivalent of ubuntu in this context

137790
ubuntu	debian
you could consider lts to be somewhere between the latest ubuntu and debian

137800
toolchain	binutils
during the link stage the library path order is relevant assuming you re using the gnu toolchain gcc binutils you can probably see what s going on by setting cflags before configure or possible in the makefile directly

137806
wan	lan
the rules above are assuming that you re using this box as a gateway firewall with eth1 connected to your wan and eth0 connected to your lan

137815
ubuntu	centos
i am not very experienced with ubuntu -- i am an old hand with centos and redhat

137821
centos	linux
i am rather new to linux and have a centos box to play with

137826
x86	mips
that would be like ring 0 on x86 processors system mode on arm kernel mode on mips supervisor mode on 68xxx etc

137826
x86	mips
on that same conceptual level user land is what runs in the least privileged mode ring 3 on x86 cpus user mode on arm or mips etc.

137826
unix	bsd
the programs and processes you see running in unix or linux or bsd are the user land

137826
unix	bsd
to answer your specific question in unix linux bsd a driver is usually some smallish piece of software that deals with the specific peculiarities of some piece of hardware a network card a disk drive a video card

137829
daemons	systemd
so userland is what the daemons does or can do when interacting with the operating systemd ressouces i o network memory cpu time

137834
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
i don t think there is a way to directly install web font in mint ubuntu debian based

137845
debian	linux
i would like to have an up-to-date clone of a debian gnu linux system on an external hdd and therefore be able to replace the internal hdd with the external hdd at any time and being up and running in no time

137852
cifs	smb
you could also make use of fuse to mount a variety of types of media as local directories including smb cifs

137852
cifs	smb
how to mount a smb cifs share as an automount on centos fedora rhel

137857
xfce	kde
i remember doing exactly the same thing in the kde desktop checking custom dpi but that did not work when i was login back in my xfce session

137886
debian	linux
ssh server runs on debian linux burza 3.2.0-4-686-pae #1 smp debian 3.2.51-1 i686 i686 i686 gnu linux

137888
folder	directory
it seems the common trend in programming when building functionality for handling file uploads is to have the file first uploaded to a temporary directory folder tmp on linux

137924
vim	emacs
stty susp undef will disable the keyboard-initiated suspend signal for most programs however commands like vim and emacs that have specific bindings for ctrl-z will have to be reconfigured individually

137932
required	placeholder
neither placeholder nor replacements may contain nul characters but you may use standard c -escapes such as 0 if you need nul s and consequently you are required to write if you want a

137951
bash	zsh
in bash you need to run shopt -s globstar first and beware that bash recurses through symbolic links to directories unlike find or zsh

137953
ubuntu	debian
both debian and ubuntu build their releases from debian unstable

137953
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu have different timelines and different goals when they prepare a release but the core process is the same

137986
debian	linux
linux details debian wheezy 7.0 64-bit

137988
kde	gnome
desktop environments des like gnome or kde

137992
sudo	passwd
one simple way to do this is to use the graphical ssh-askpass program with sudo this gets around the fact that sudo is not connected to the terminal and allows you to enter the passwd safely

137992
kde	gnome
there are a few variations on the ssh-askpass program which should also work gnome kde versions

138006
x11	konsole
the minimum would be to retain only executables that both link against some x11 libraries and call some master terminal function or utility like getpt or grantpt but that s bound to find a lot of spurious positives too and to miss executables where the call is in a library like konsole

138009
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
with csh tcsh ksh93 bash fish or zsh -o cshnullglob you can use brace expansion and globbing to do that -- is not needed for these filenames but i assume they are just examples

138009
bash	zsh
another way to do this would be to populate an array and go from there here ksh93 zsh or recent bash syntax

138020
bash	zsh
of ksh or bash -o extglob or zsh -o kshglob or

stdout	stderr
stderr to stdout

138052
stdout	stderr
if you understand that fd2 is stderr you might think oh and capture stderr where ever i send stdout fd1

138061
for-loop	arrays
do i need to use for-loop and store the files in arrays variables

138084
stdout	stderr
my coworkers and i usually say two is greater than one because most of us don t always remember that stderr is file descriptor 2 and stdout is 1 especially those new to unix linux so the other mnemonics about redirecting stderr don t really work

138100
versioning	upgrade
when mintupdate tries to upgrade versioning 4.5.6 to versioning 4.5.6-1 the following error pops up

138119
debian	linux
on linux debian i never had the pleasure installing anything differently than through

138196
sudo	nohup
first problem is that nohup seems to need sudo

i have rhel6 running on my server and installed mysql from red hat enterprise linux 6 oracle linux 6 x86 64bit rpm bundle

138215
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade can be run while the program runs but the running program you see is actually the old versioning of it

138217
ubuntu	centos
if your host machine centos has x-windows you can use ssh -x to forward all x11 traffic to your centos machine while sshing into the ubuntu vm

138217
ubuntu	centos
for example if your ubuntu vm s ip address is 192.168.0.123 and your username on the ubuntu vm is fred you woud use this command from centos to connect to the ubuntu vm

138217
ubuntu	centos
after you connect just run the command that expects x11 and it should just appear on your centos desktop even though it s running on your ubuntu vm

138240
bash	zsh
bash contrary to ksh93 or zsh 1 can t do floating point arithmetics

sudo	passwd
is there some way to make su ask for the passwd again in case of a wrong passwd just as sudo does

put	get
otherwise you d need first to get the number of records first to know how many to put in each output file

138368
bash	zsh
the same commandâ² works in zsh and ksh though att ksh93 requires both the first and last number to be passed to fc â³ which also works in bash zsh and pdksh mksh

versioning	upgrade
support for the record extension was added to xsun in solaris 7 11 99 as part of the upgrade from x11r6.0 to x11r6.4 - it wasn t available in prior versioning of solaris 7 though once 11 99 was released you could apply the patches to add it to xsun

138392
jobs	cron
i have setup cron jobs to run inside a chroot environment depending on the user group

138392

zsh	subshell	bash	zsh	bash	subshell
bash zsh and mksh arrange for to yield different values in the parent and in the subshell

138503
unix	bsd
you can trace unix from there to either closed-source system v unix or bsd

138510
tail	pstree
the second command is not a tail call of pstree because pstree is not the last thing in the command line

138510
bash	zsh
zsh and ksh both seem to be able to do that but not bash

138516
submit	submission	disk	ram
how much io are you submission submit too little the wrong way and all the io can be cached so you wind up testing the speed of your ram rather than the speed of the disk

debian	linux
debian gnu linux 6

138518
ubuntu	linux
i am newbie in linux i want to format my sd card using ubuntu for this i follow this tutorial

138546
debian-based	ubuntu
so i ve been dealing with ubuntu and other debian-based distros for a while and kinda like crunchbang

138546
google-chrome	firefox
but i ve been also noticing that ubuntu as well as lmde comes with that fancy nice eyecandy feature called smooth scrolling not just in firefox google-chrome i m referring to the system-wide scrolling experience

138554
debian-based	linux
i got debian-based linux with gnome 3.4.2

138554
debian-based	linux
i had debian-based linux for 4-6 weeks now and am in the early stages of the learning

138555
uniq	grep
i know i could hack my way with a cat | grep | awk | cut | sed | tac | sort | uniq solution but i wonder if there s a simple way of doing this with utilities like pidof ps etc

138586
mouse	keyboard
although it seems to happen usually when i move the mouse around to change focus to another window rather than when i m typing on the keyboard

138586
switching	screens
but up until now even switching user or logging out and re-logging in doesn t change the situation invisible mouse on the 30 screens and garbled one on the 27

138598
daemons	launchd
pidfiles can be written either by the daemons itself or by the monitoring program that launchd it

138605
openbsd	freebsd
openbsd is focused on security and far more conservative than freebsd when it comes to adopting new features

138605
unix	solaris	openbsd	solaris
since solaris is system v -based solaris plus openbsd gives you a reasonably broad view of unix portability

138605
ubuntu	linux
linux fedora ubuntu

138607
freebsd	linux
reasonably recent versions of tar on linux freebsd minix3 and osx automatically detect compressed archives so you can call tar in the first place without worrying about the compression used on the archive

138607
openbsd	solaris	openbsd	linux
older versions of tar as well as many systems today such as openbsd solaris and linux with busybox can at least call bzip2 under the hood even if you have to tell them explicitly with the -j option

138614
hide	show
i d like to use the keyboard shortcut ctrl + space to open close the linux mint menu similar to how command + space is used on os x to show hide spotlight

138628
asterisk	pbx
currently hard phones connect with sip to a hosted asterisk pbx

138628
asterisk	pbx
if i could deploy just the dialer and interface but use the hosted asterisk pbx that would be good

138629
ubuntu	linux
i can just wire this setup and i get internet on the ubuntu gnu linux pcs without any further tinkering with setups

138646
ubuntu	debian
i have a dual boot setup debian ubuntu and windows on my laptop

138658
freebsd	netbsd
on mac os x and freebsd netbsd etc

138660
ubuntu	linux
i m on linux ubuntu 12.04

138675
ubuntu	debian
it will allow you to protect specific entries so it will require a password to boot windows but it won t require a password for any other entries ubuntu debian or whatever

138679
octal	decimal
the sticky bit is set here because you set decimal 777 octal 1411 not octal 777 decimal 511

138679
umask	mkdir
you should also note that the ultimate effect of the mode argument to mkdir also involves anding against your umask

138679
chmod	mkdir
i would suggest that if this affects you you chmod after mkdir instead of using the mode argument

138680
octal	decimal
you probably want to use an octal number for mode rather than a decimal one

138704
debian	linux
i work on raspberry pi with standard linux debian wheezy

138724
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems is ntfs

138733
daemons	launchd
outside of daemons processes and processes launchd in background commands within a script are synchronous

138751
versioning	upgrade
today though it upgrade all of our servers with a new versioning of php5

138757
opensuse	linux
i have upgraded two e-350 systems which have been running vms one of the systems only linux vms the other one windows vms to opensuse 13.1 i.e kernel 3.11.10 kvm-1.6.0 libvirt-1.1.2

138769
post	get
apologize for the cross post i didn t get the answer i wanted

138782
spaces	delimiter
you have to let the awk command execute creating a series of output values delimiter by some delimiter spaces tab nul or something then assign these to the array elements

138810
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i d like to apply a low-pass filter on the subwoofer channel on my 5.1 sound system under solydk a linux distro based on debian testing pa is installed and configured by default just like under linux mint or ubuntu

138817
asterisk	pbx
we have polycom phones for use with our asterisk 1.8 pbx

138827
bash	zsh
ksh93 zsh bash syntax

138827
subshell	dash
except with dash and yash that one uses temporary files instead of pipes fed by subshell so is likely to be more efficient in addition to being more portable

138845
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude

138875
ispconfig	zpanel
webmin ispconfig zpanel is a good alternative for it free version

138885
udp	tcp
tcp does this but udp does not

138898
disk	ram
the system logs out then it saves something from your ram to the disk

138934
traceroute	packets
it runs a continuous traceroute and generates meaningful network statistics such as of lost packets and several rtt metrics

138962
stdout	stderr
that will save your original file descriptor for stdout to 3 and then redirect stdout and stderr to dev null

138970
ubuntu	debian
as rasberry pi usually runs a variant of debian then maybe start with that or ubuntu

138996
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
lxml requires the dev devel versions of libxml2 and libxslt because they include header files that lxml needs to build

138996
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
however whenever i try to pip install lxml it tries to use the non-dev libxml2 libxslt in the root bin

138996
libxml2	libxslt
how do i get the system to use the versions of libxml2 libxslt that i installed

139005
udp	tcp
note that a single tcp or udp connection will see no speed up as it will still be going over a single link

139013
perl	tcl
you can use tcl expect or perl expect

139016
vim	emacs
to sum up dabbrev-expand inside xterm is not as good as in emacs and vim i guess but it s still faster than rewriting long strings by hand and less typo-prone

139019
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
fedora 15+ rhel7 arch debian 8+ ubuntu 15+ opensuse 12.3+

gentoo	freebsd
gentoo supports net freebsd

139019
opensolaris	smartos
solaris opensolaris based illumos smartos etc

139019
sysv	systemd
sysv is the linux standard etc rc.d xyz that most new init systemd continue to support the scripts from so that s your base point

139027
debian	centos
os is centos 6 but interested in debian 7 as well

139065
stdout	stderr
sometimes they are written to stdout sometimes to stderr

139174
redhat	fedora
through the fedora project as a community complement of their own redhat enterprise linux

139181
folder	directory
i m somewhat confused by all the directory and folder used for programs

139201
debian	linux
i m using linux kernel 3.2.0-4-amd64 from debian wheezy

139213
versioning	upgrade
i can imagine that my versioning is old it is what came with debian stable but i don t want to upgrade it unless the newer one really has the support for html5

139228
chown	sudo
a sudo chown root root looks like this client rootu is just a test file

139228
kerberos	ldap
i don t have ldap or kerberos or any sophisticated authentication set up at the moment that is all beyond my skill and 0 pay level at the moment

139228
chown	sudo	chown	mount
where can i find a simple way to mount a directory with files owned by me or root via sudo chown if i choose and not some strange 4294967294 user that doesn t exist on the client or server

139237
google-chrome	firefox
i ve read something weird about firefox not supporting flash on linux google-chrome seems to support it but i wouldn t want to switch if possible

139245
ubuntu	linux
programmatically how can i check whether the lun node is a boot volume or not the lun node is created under dev on linux systems such as rhel or ubuntu or any other linux flavour

139252
sudo	passwd
i m trying to give the ubuntu user on my machine the ability to rm folders and files mainly in the www folder without the need to invoke a passwd or the need to use sudo

139262
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
to make this permanent once you have found the correct settings save them into 50-synaptics.conf which is located at usr share x11 xorg.conf.d 50-synaptics.confin debian ubuntu semplice and at etc x11 xorg.conf.d 50-synaptics.conf in arch linux based distros the first inputclass part is for the multi-touch middle click fix which is already enabled in arch so you shouldn t need to add it

139268
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	aix	unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
so one can look at the rm manpages for osx or freebsd aix solaris and hpux - the well known unix 03 registered unices

139268
solaris	aix
osx aix and solaris 1 refer to the -- delimiter verbatim in man rm

139284
sudo	passwd
additionally sudo is the right method for a lot of things but if you are setting it up without a passwd that is another indication that you are doing something wrong from a security standpoint

139293
ubuntu	linux
on windows i can easily stay on battery for 3-4 hours in powersave mode but on linux first ubuntu 14.04 currently fedora 20 the battery s discharge rate varies from 10 watt to 40 watt 25 watt mean on powersave mode with backlight on the lowest possible value resulting in 1-2 hours of battery life

139293
google-chrome	firefox
currently i ve only opened a terminal and google-chrome window with this page and a youtube video on a almost clean fedora installation but it also happens with firefox or without youtube video

139312
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
for the mounting in the bash script you are creating use giles answer to modify your sudoers file to allow the cron script to execute as sudo how to run a specific program as root without a passwd prompt

139336
imagemagick	mogrify
i d use convert or mogrify from the imagemagick suite

139337
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i believe linux mint did something similar with ubuntu software-center a while ago to get around similar issues

139358
dpkg	apt
for apt from the manual page for dpkg

139358
rpm	yum
for yum you should be able to query using rpm

139358
rpm	yum
but i don t have a yum rpm system to check

139394
folder	directory
a folder generated in the temp directory is the output of the script that will be copied to another part of the machine

139394
folder	directory
i was wondering if it would still be around if the version of the folder in the tmp directory got cleaned up by the os

139395
debian	centos	gentoo	centos	gentoo	debian
i ve sort of narrowed things down to debian centos rhel-based gentoo and slackware

139395
ubuntu	linux
i don t have much experience with linux primarily using ubuntu via de so i m concerned that trying to remove extraneous features may compromise its integrity

139397
ubuntu	debian
yet for some others debian is light and ubuntu is heavy

139400
folder	directory
in your scenario you are expecting the files folder to remain after the temporary directory has been cleaned up

139400
temp	tmp
you can create a soft link from mystuff to somewhere on a tmpfs mounted at tmp but when the temp files are deleted the link will point to nowehere

139416
jobs	cron
is there a way to query a crontab to find which cron jobs run at some arbitrary date time or during a certain range of times

139419
centos	linux
i am quite savvy but not an expert in linux especially centos and cannot fathom how to get node.js and npm to work on centos 5.10

139450
redhat	fedora
redhat fedora

139452
jobs	cron
you have a problem something s causing performance issues on the application server between 1 and 4 am and the cron jobs seem a likely culprit

139452
jobs	cron
over time cron jobs accrete into an impenetrable opaque mass of text

139477
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs partitions are always mounted as rw but i d like to avoid this if it is not really necessary to prevent filesystems corruption

139521
versioning	upgrade
i was wondering if i have to upgrade php5.3.3 to higher versioning because it doesn t seem to work on lower than php5.4

139542
ubuntu	centos
p.s. i m using ubuntu 12.04 or centos 6 both with gnome

139561
opera	firefox
you can also see that i defined the priority to be 100 for firefox and that the opera package is installed with a priority of 200

139569
ubuntu	linux
what is equivalent to it in linux ubuntu server

139580
versioning	upgrade
then you can install not upgrade root rpmbuild rpms i386 libpcap-1.4.0-1.i386.rpm along side with libpcap-0.9.4 so that the versioning may peacefully coexist on your system

139580
rpm	yum
if you use yum instead of plain rpm then it can keep track of all the transactions for you with yum history

139581
folder	directory
i have been searching for an answer on how to search for text within files within sub folder of a parent directory using grep

139587
dpkg	apt
it just means that the dpkg instance called by apt apt-get failed for some reason

139589
sudo	passwd
alternatively i can switch off passwd checking per-user but that s not what i want because the user might set a passwd later and then sudo should prompt for it

139616
sudo	passwd
i don t think this is possible because sudo will not know that a user doesn t have a passwd or that it s the empty string until it sudo presents the passwd empty or otherwise to the pam module for validation

139616
sudoers	passwd
your only recourse here is to configure users that do not require the use of a passwd with the nopasswd option in your sudoers file

139633
clang	llvm
also take a look at why is freebsd deprecating gcc in favor of clang llvm

139635
filesystems	ntfs
what i want to know is the best choice for normal rotating hdds containing ext4 and ntfs filesystems mbr style

139659
filesystems	ntfs
what i want to know is the best choice for normal rotating hdd containing ext4 and ntfs filesystems

139659
filesystems	xfs
either way none of the schedulers seem to have any features that would benefit one filesystems xfs ext3 ext4+extents reiserfs etc over another

139663
subshell	ifs
see bashguide arrays for details - including an explanation of the use of the ... subshell to preserve the parent shell s ifs value

139684
atom-editor	sublimetext
what about sublimetext or atom-editor

139688
dpkg	apt
when installing packages through your package manager apt which relies on dpkg the files in the .deb archive get extracted and moved to the place they are supposed to be

139701
put	get
as a solution i thought that if the installer script would merge together these files i d get a large monolithic bash file which can be put anywhere on the system

139704
google-chrome	firefox
you can normally use the developer tools of your browser firefox and google-chrome support this to read the headers sent by your browser

139706
redhat	fedora
for example under fedora and redhat and centos the apache webserver runs as apache and the data files are owned by that user

139706
ubuntu	debian
on the other hand i believe that apache runs as www-data on debian ubuntu systems and consequently data files are owned by that user

139707
post	get
look at live http headers for cookies and for any post or get parameters

139710
udp	tcp
as to your thoughts about creating congestion conditions you may find it helpful to intentionally generate iperf udp background traffic just below the qos class queueing threshold before you run your tcp traffic

139743
tunnel	vpn
i know there are other ways to bypass the gfw ssh tunnel vpn but this method is the most convenient one for ordinary users

139746
debian	linux
however it seems that rpm packages cannot be made if one doesn t have the source unlike other packages especially debian packages which can even be constructed without dpkg-deb by using the standard linux tools

139777
packets	pcap
you could copy or stream the pcap file to your desktop and use the wireshark gui for packets analysis

139788
debian	linux
i use linux debian 7.5

139802
umount	vfs
the shutdown process will pivot to a saved copy of the initramfs and allow for usr and root to be properly umount from the vfs

139808
tunnel	wan
in your case you should select a private network segment which is not used in your local network 10.0.8.0 for your tunnel network instead of your wan ip

139811
filesystems	ntfs
which users have access and what is the filesystems nfs ntfs fat16 32 ..

139813
mouse	keyboard
they are arguably even more awkward in a gui app where you need to take your hand off the keyboard and manipulate a mouse and then there are the limitations to complexity mentioned in the last paragraph

139815
ubuntu	debian
you can install exiftool on debian ubuntu with

139825
ubuntu	linux
you didn t say which distro of linux you have installed but i ll make a bad assumption here the since you have a flash drive with ubuntu you are running ubuntu

139830
google-chrome	firefox
i like google-chrome and such i don t really want to switch back to firefox or anything else

139832
unix	bsd
ffs mount_ffs -- berkeley fast file system the standard filesystem type on bsd unix

139833
unix	bsd
ffs mount_ffs -- berkeley fast file system the standard filesystem on bsd unix

139857
debian	linux
the clients should be able to use windows linux debian in most cases and android

139863
g++	gcc
disk space is limited on the yun and i haven t setup an sd card yet so no gcc g++ yet

139863
g++	gcc
i ve also seen a lot of examples using pygame but i haven t managed to install pygame yet using opkg install python-pygame and until i setup an sd i won t have space for gcc g++ to compile from source

139873
solaris	aix
it also works on solaris 10 rhel3 aix 5 and busybox 1.22.1 in my android phone use tail +1 -f file with busybox

139899
sudo	passwd
you probably have no graphical tool installed which asks for your sudo or root passwd before running a tool which needs these permissions

139917
cifs	smb
remember cifs is considered a dialect type of smb

139954
opensuse	centos
to accomplish this there is an opensuse rpm package that provides a cups pipe backend that can be used with centos

139963
sudoers	visudo
read man sudoers and use visudo command to configure etc sudoers

139963
sudoers	visudo
add this string into etc sudoers with visudo don t edit etc sudoers directly

139994
folder	directory
other items on the directory folder and files must also be listed

140012
range	min
interestingly though i noticed the min range for both device types was listed at a staggering 0-1048575

140052
redhat	fedora
for an rpm managed system like centos redhat or fedora

140052
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
for a debian system like ubuntu or mint

140077
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication rsa dsa ecdsa

140079
for-loop	loops
to expand these you d need to do a while or for-loop and pass the results to diskutil as you iterate through loops

140092
daemons	systemd
manjaro also uses the systemd systemd management daemons and is based on arch so the arch linux documentation may provide different but complementary information

140102
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs does not have linux-style attributes so any permission change is implemented as a no-op in ntfs filesystems module

140110
sudo	passwd
for years now i have occasionally noted that i don t actually know how to deal with the sudo passwd prompt cleanly

140110
sudo	passwd
once sudo starts asking for a passwd it doesn t want to give up

140110
sudo	passwd
what is the proper way to tell sudo to abort the attempt while at the passwd prompt

140145
apache	nginx
assuming you know what http s service and version is running iis apache nginx then you can have an idea of the what is the underlying os

140152
cpu	processors
the machine had a cheap motherboard and a high tdp processors and i ve since changed the motherboard to a more higher quality version that provides enough power to the cpu the same hw error hasn t occurred with the new motherboard

140157
udp	tcp
requirements of udp scans are much different than tcp scans

140157
udp	tcp
common and affects udp scans far more often than tcp

140157
udp	tcp
recommend combining tcp and udp scans when performance is critical

140161
centos	linux
archive while mainly operated on centos linux should also allow a single file retrieval on windows for emergency purposes so a squashfs-style filesystem is not a viable option

140205
xfs	btrfs
we are now thinking about using btrfs instead of xfs and use send receive to synchronize the data more efficiently

140231
ubuntu	debian
the use of ip addr change does not appear in any man-page i have access to debian ubuntu and online and also not in the official documentation

140245
ubuntu	linux
how do i bypass that screen so that it bypasses the linux bootloader and goes right into ubuntu

140262
gentoo	debian
after unsuccessfully getting the system to boot from gentoo s grub2 i figured i could also boot gentoo by adding an entry to debian s grub configuration so i edited etc grub.d 40_custom with the following

140320
post	get
as mentioned in the linked post you can get the locale-dependant thousands separator with

140324
icmp	udp
you should allow udp port 53 for name resolution and icmp echo for ping test

140325
lvm	mdadm
one possible solution is to use lvm to manage redundancy instead of using the mdadm linux software raid

140332
rpm	yum
iirc source rpm packages get installed in the usr src sub-directories but if you weren t planning on building your own packages you should simply download the correct binary package and install that or use yum install intltool

140355
binutils	automake
in void linux it s xbps-install -su base-devel which provides m4 autoconf automake bc binutils bison ed libfl-devel flex libgcc-devel kernel-libc-headers glibc-devel isl cloog mpfr libmpc gcc libstdc++-devel gcc-c++ gettext-libs gettext groff libtool make patch pkg-config texinfo unzip and xz

140372
folder	directory
however the local repository folder names directory names are still in an unreadable state

140372
folder	directory
i.e. the above shown greek folder name î ï î ï ï î ï î î is actually the directory

140372
folder	directory
or is it required to remove these directory from the local repository and force another syncing via offlineimap taking care not to let the respective mailbox folder be removed from the remote repository

140397
stdout	stderr
can i configure my shell to print stderr and stdout in different colors

140397
stdout	stderr
but i am looking for a solution that will allow me to change both stdout and stderr to one color

140397
stdout	stderr
i am not trying to set different color for stdout and stderr as this is problematic and may create problems mentioned in the answer from the link above

140397
stdout	stderr
i am looking for a solution that can allow me to add couple lines to my .bashrc or .bash_profile and permanently change the color of stdout and stderr

140399
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr don t have colors

140399
stdout	stderr
it should also be noted that stdout and stderr are not singular -- they re per process output streams

140399
stdout	stderr
terminal emulators usually have ways to set the palette via a menu such that the default foreground applied to data received via both stdout and stderr streams could be whatever

140399
stdout	stderr
if setting the terminal foreground is not what you want you can filter stdout stderr on a per process basis

140401
filesystems	btrfs
some possible outputs are cifs nfs afs â presumed remote and ufs ext2 ext3 sic - ext2 ext3 and ext4 have the same filesystems magic number btrfs tmpfs â presumed local

140410
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m having trouble getting the drivers for a netis wf2123 wifi adapter to work under linux mint 17 effectively ubuntu 14.04 lts 64-bit

140425
jobs	cron
debian seems to have directories for cron jobs such as etc cron.daily and etc cron.hourly but is there a way for me to automate editing removing and updating cron jobs from an automated script

140438
ubuntu	mint
the update to mint 17 aka ubuntu 14.04 did not make any difference but the most likely explanation is that the recent update to ubuntu 14.04.2 as the base distro fixed something

140454
stdout	stderr
you can technically color stdout and stderr line by line with adding the right color escape codes to start and end of line on both streams

140454
stdout	stderr
set the terminals default color to the stdout stderr color and color the rest like you prefer

140454
bash	zsh
but don t try that with bash if you can use zsh as the prompt handling code it much more flexible there - that s what you ll need

140456
bash	zsh
i don t use zsh zsh-5.0.5-1 every day otherwise i would have noticed it segfaults when i launch it from the bash cli

140514
bash	zsh
so bash didn t complain about the error but zsh did.

140523
debian	linux
i m configuring a business intelligence tool yellowfin bi on my debian linux server and i get this error

if it s an alias or a function your subshell might need to be bash

i am starting up screens with the following config file to give me 4 tabs that i can switching between

osx	mint
if the order of your boot menu is important and not just that windows boots by default and you don t have anything bootable besides linux mint and windows like osx bsd you can do

chown	chmod
set the permissions on the directory to something like 770 or 775 and set the group and user owner appropriately using chmod and chown respectively

144484

this program should then receive the entire file from the user store it in ram or a temporary folder until it s fully downloaded then examine the file name and contents to make sure that files of the undesired file type throw an error and are not placed in the directory

144511
openbsd	linux

kde	gnome
it is possible that phpstorm specifically calls functions only present in kde and gnome but i have found some evidence of users getting jetbrains applications to run in lxde see below

144709
kde	gnome
it think that kde and gnome are only listed as required because they are the only display managers that have been tested and documented to work by jetbrains

144709
kde	gnome
in your case there must be some library not being loaded or installed in lxde that in gnome or kde loads by default

rpm	yum
as per centimane s comment if the .so file is provided by an rpm and that rpm is not installed on your system it might be a good idea depending on versions and making sure this would not break currently installed apps to install the .so with the rpm found in the output of the yum provides command

i ve been trying for the past few hours to cross compile a rpi kernel on my arch linux distro and then my ubuntu distro when that failed i received similar errors for both attempts

144728
folder	directory
i have a folder in my home directory called linux

144730
ubuntu	linux
i ve got a box that is running freenas right now but i d like to convert it to a linux server flavour i was thinking ubuntu with the gui so that i could still run some of the same software i have running on the freenas now for the household and have the web hosting services on it as well

144744
ubuntu	linux
i have configured cross compiled and installed default httpd 2.2.24 2.4.1 2.4.4 and 2.4.9 on my linux pc ubuntu 12.04 lts as well as on my own custom linux board

144744
ssl	https
then i have added support of ssl module mod_ssl to test http as well as https request

144744
ubuntu	linux
both http and https request works fine without any issue on my linux pc ubuntu 12.04 lts

144746
folder	directory
i have installed cdo climate data operators in a folder in my home directory

144746
folder	directory
how should i set up any of the dotfiles to access it in home directory without specifically going into src folder

144768
mouse	keyboard
in order to easily switch between the two i use a simple usb kvm switch a newstar so i can use a single mouse and keyboard for both machines

144790
ubuntu	debian
however i have to wonder why you are installing from source when the package is available on debian and therefore on ubuntu

144790
ubuntu	debian
to be clear the idea here is to rebuild debian ubuntu sources on your release

144812
hash	md5
then i need to combine those hex strings and hash them using sha1 or md5 to create fixed length hex string

144829
daemon	cron
if you will get further problems try to investigate log of your cron daemon usually you can see all the errors there

144831
fseek	ftell
functions like fseek and ftell use a signed long which on 64-bit gnu systems is also 64-bits

144862
ubuntu	linux
i want to run a task which takes quite a long time remotely in ubuntu linux bash via nohup and redirect stdout to a file

144873
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am trying to create a soft hotspot in linux mint 17 based on ubuntu 14.04 lts but when i try i am not able to edit username password for the created hotpsot moreover it is not detected by my mobile

144906
ubuntu	debian
packages will be signed as usual and some of the packaged software will be the same as provided by the official debian and ubuntu repositories but usually newer - but not always sometimes it will be the same

144913
installation	upgrade
so i wish to upgrade my 32-bit installation of rhel 6 server to a 64-bit installation

144914
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
we will get the options to do a fresh installation or upgrade to another rhel versioning

144927
wan	lan
i have 1 wan eth0 and 2 lan eth1 eth2 interfaces connected

144937
put	get
i would rather put the burden of proof on them to demonstrate that running centos 6 with the same minor version and the same hypervisor and the same host os if it s not running on bare metal they are able to get better performance

144937
profiling	instrumentation
getting the profiling to successfully launch and instrumentation your application can be a challenge depending on exactly what that application is but the results are almost always telling in some way

144948
jobs	cron
also in var log cron you can check cron log with specific messages for cron jobs

144948
stdout	stderr
by default cron uses sh not bash so in is a shortcut to redirect both stderr and stdout in bash but that s not case in sh

145013
sudo	passwd
with his line you are all authorized to sudo to anybody else including root without passwd

145013
sudo	passwd
if you should only be able to sudo to this one particular user without giving your passwd the correct line should be

145013
sudo	passwd
now you can run anything as that user without giving a passwd while anything requiring you to sudo to root will still require a passwd

145020
ubuntu	linux
it was long time i have not used a ubuntu 12.04 linux box

145050
stdout	stderr
what are scrollback and scrollback buffer in programs like bash and screen and how do they relate to the tty the programs being run and stdin stdout stderr

145067
udp	tcp
keep in mind that you will be working with raw ip packets tcp segments or udp datagrams depending on the type of traffic you want to process and it will be your responsibility to correctly re-assemble the traffic maintain checksum correctness on packet level and everything else that your operating system s tcp ip stack magically takes care of behind the scenes

145067
dpkt	scapy
if you re planning to work in python i would suggest that you use dpkt or scapy to work with packets or tcp segments

145114
umask	chmod
i understand to some good extent file permissions the concept of umask setuid and using octal numbers with chmod

145130
filesystems	ntfs
linux can read and write to many filesystems including ntfs which is likely how your windows partitions are formatted

145130
ubuntu	linux
many os installers including ubuntu apparently will scan your disks for any partitions that linux knows how to mount and set those up to be mounted at boot which is why you can access them

145132
spaces	delimiter
since it uses only commas and not spaces as delimiter

145146
switching	screens
i am new to using tmux in scripting and i am attempting to manipulate it so when i run a script i can have multiple screens attached and split in my putty session and also have it color coded and binded so that if i use alt+arrow key it will switching to the next pane

145172
kde	gnome
i created a small script that sets a window s icon based on the current gnome icon theme it can easily be adapted to work with kde

145174
put	get
if i put the same line in a bash script i get some strange characters at the end of the name

145175
dns	spf
my domain has reverse dns record set up and i am using spf record

145186
bash	zsh
. somescript.sh or source in some shells such as bash and zsh the current shell reads the script into the current environment and executes the contents as if issued from the prompt - so is defined in the current shell environment - your interactive shell

145186
children	parent
this behavior differs from that of subshells run at the prompt or otherwise as children of the current shell because they automatically inherit the environment of their parent whereas - as demonstrated above - executed children require that it be explicitly export ed

145192
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
on many linux distributions be it backtrack kali backbox ubuntu mint etc. whenever i use anything from the aircrack-ng suite my wireless card is shown as channel -1

145197
bash	subshell
in bash you can put the printf output directly in a variable which is slightly faster than using a command substitution but this is unlikely to ever matter even on cygwin where subshell are slow

145199
ubuntu	debian
install subversion on debian ubuntu sudo apt-get install subversion

145199
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu

145207
ubuntu	linux
if i enter grub loader i can pick ubuntu with linux 3.11.0.12-generic and i am able to enter passphrase latin characters but when i get to login screen it only types in russian

145211
filesystems	ntfs
ubuntu will show files and folders in ntfs fat32 filesystems which are hidden in windows

145215
ansible	puppet
other tools to manage files software packages config in a centralised manner are chef puppet ansible cfengine

145216
bash	zsh
in zsh by default a failed expansion like this is an error but in bash it isn t the failed pattern is just left as an argument exactly as it was written

145216
bash	zsh
zsh s behaviour is safer in that you can t write a command that secretly doesn t do what you meant because a file was missing but you can change it to have the bash behaviour if you want

145217
centos	linux
note i believe linux is the primary boot partition for centos

145223
ubuntu	centos
but when i run it on ubuntu or centos i get the following error

145229
unix	bsd
it is part of the posix standard every official unix includes it and all linux and bsd distributions include it as well

145234
int	chars
if you see int expression expected it s a sign that what s before the ends with a carriage return chars

145234
int	chars
so when linux sees a windows text file it sees that each line is terminated by a cr chars â â which is a valid chars but rarely a desired one and is not a valid chars in an int

145242
packets	pcap
the next step will be for the device to inspect the packets coming over the bridge and if they match a set of criteria using a utility akin to tcpreplay to replay the known-valid responses from the pcap files in order to successfully execute a replay attack

145264
sudo	passwd
but with sudo it would but being run after ssh it never gets passwd input for sudo on the remote server so the solution is use -s man sudo and pipe passwd for sudo as follows

145264
sudo	passwd
on the one hand this is good for the automation with no getting sudo passwd promts and to have completely automated code script you would add sshpass -p passwd ssh.

145264
sudo	passwd
however on the server where others can easily read your sudo passwd provided as open text during the ssh session that s not recommended from the security perspectives

145264
sudo	passwd
with -t it s impossible to pipe ssh sudo command | command for example but it is possible with ussage of -s and echoing passwd ssh server echo passwd | sudo -s ls -l | grep a

145294
ubuntu	linux
my specific version is ubuntu linux 14.04

145297
debian	centos
in debian you should edit the file etc bash.bashrc and in centos the file etc bashrc

145297
debian	centos
from now on every command of every ssh session will be logged at var log syslog on a debian system and at var log messages on a centos system

145298
chown	passwd
running my bash script as my user i get prompted for the root passwd and then i get a usage message for chown after i type in the root passwd

145301
ubuntu	linux
i am on linux - ubuntu

145331
clang	llvm
where the pkgs run over all the clang llvm packages you have installed

145332
ubuntu	centos
when i use ubuntu and centos i see dev sda and dev vda

145342
tar	gunzip
when i run gunzip -dc path_to_tar.gz_file zip1.tar.gz | tar xf - in the directory where the tar.gz file is located it extracts just fine

145342
tar	gunzip
i tried this gunzip -dc path_to_tar.gz_file zip1.tar.gz | tar xf target_directory with a tar error

145404
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
how you do that varies gnu sed uses -r while freebsd netbsd openbsd and os x sed use -e

145404
openbsd	netbsd
os x still doesn t today and the older netbsd and openbsd machines i have access to don t either but the netbsd 6.1 one does

145414
versioning	upgrade
i recently did an upgrade which pulled in a new xorg versioning xserver-xorg-core amd64 2 1.15.1-1â â 2 1.15.99.904-1 including all the submodules such as xserver-xorg-input-synaptics amd64 1.7.3-1+b1â â 1.8.0-1

145483
debian	mint	debian	linux
i have installed linux mint debian edition and everything is working correctly except that 100 sound setting is not ideal on my speakers so i see that i can increase it to 152 from my sound settings

145487
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
this feature generates numerous different types of keys rsa dsa ecdsa and it does not show a randomart image

145489
rpm	yum
transfer them to the fedora machine and install them with rpm -ivh files or yum install files

145495
mpfr	mpc
before to intall gcc i installed the gmp 4.3.2 mpfr 2.4.2 mpc 0.8.1

145496
sysv	systemd
i specified the debian version above because debian will be moving from sysv init to systemd in the next major version

145500
crypt	hash
you could remove the shadow as well as any strong hash options option from pam_unix to disable the shadow file and go back to traditional crypt passwords

145505
debian	linux
i m specifically interested in vanilla debian and in lightweight distros such as trisquel mini damn small linux is it still maintained

145510
mouse	keyboard
when i cat the device file for my mouse directly using i get output similar to what you get with your keyboard gibberish

145516
put	get
but i get assoc symbol s function definition is void thai-tone-conversion-list error when i put 2 in thai-input-mode

145523
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
the non-posix features in bash and tcsh and zsh and all of the other current shells are useful and there are plenty of occasions where you might want or need them

145524
unix	bsd
the posix shell is based on the 1988 version of kornshell which in turn was meant to replace the bourne shell on at t unix leapfrogging the bsd c shell in terms of features.â to the extent that ksh is the ancestor of the posix shell most unix and unix-like systems include some variant of the korn shell today

145524
bash	tcsh
that early association between linux and bash pretty much sealed the fate of many other shells including ksh csh and tcsh

145524
bash	zsh
all this history explains why the creators of relative latecomers like bash zsh and yash chose to make them sh -compatible bourne posix compatibility is the minimum a shell for unix-like systems must provide in order to gain widespread adoption

145524
freebsd	netbsd
you can see this direct descendancy in the source code repositories for netbsd and freebsd they were shipping an almquist shell derivative from day 1

145524
ubuntu	debian
dash famously adopted by debian and ubuntu in 2006 as the default bin sh implementation

145524
debian	linux
this choice is typical on desktop and server variants of linux except for debian and its derivatives

145524
bash	zsh
ksh93 bash and zsh in particular have many features that don t exist in the older standard shells

145524
bash	zsh
it tends to be more conservative in its feature set than bash zsh and the enhanced versions of ksh93

145524
unix	bsd
early versions of bsd unix were just add-on software collections for v6 unix

145524
unix	bsd
since the bourne shell wasn t added to at t unix until v7 bsd didn t technically start out having the bourne shell

145524
unix	bsd
nevertheless the first standalone versions of bsd 2.9bsd and 3bsd were based on v7 or its portable successor unix 32v so they did include the bourne shell

145524
unix	bsd
the 2bsd line turned into a parallel fork of bsd for digital s pdp minicomputers while the 3bsd and 4bsd lines went on to take advantage of newer computer types like vaxen and unix workstations

145524
bash	zsh
an sh -compatible script in this sense would mean it is expected to run perfectly on the true bourne shell or any of its successors and clones ash bash ksh zsh etc

145524
bash	tcsh
os x switched the default shell from tcsh to bash in os x 10.3 panther

145524
freebsd	linux
the higher popularity of linux and os x makes some people wish freebsd would also switch to bash but they won t be doing so any time soon for philosophical reasons

145527
g++	gcc
i want you to compile that one with gcc into an object file and i want you to compile this one with g++ into the main object file then i want you to link them together into an executable file

145529
next	except
replace-string o ã replaces the next occurrence of o after the cursorâ¹ except in transient mark mode with an active mark in which case it replaces the first occurrence in the marked region

145530
implements	extends
single unix specification version 3 ogs issue 7 sus version 4 is not fully implements on many systems which includes and extends posix and usefully is available online and for download in debian

145550
ubuntu	linux
there are a lot of tutorials which show how to install kali linux s tools on ubuntu distros

145566
dlsym	dlopen
then compile them with gcc -shared -fpic -o thing1.cc -o thing1.so and have a main stub program doing dlopen 3 on . thing1.so then dlsym on god

145580
debian	mint
today i updated my computer from mint 15 to debian 7.6

145593
debian	mint
first i am surprised that you are able to update mint 15 to debian 7.6

145603
ubuntu	debian
btw i am a bit new to fedora but familiar with debian particularly ubuntu

145613
debian	linux
if you want to learn about linux systems administration they try debian distro and they try a redhat distro

145616
disk	ram
failing that put them on a usb disk or ram stick if you have a port available on each machine

145621
folder	directory
i normally use wondershaper for this so i tried placing the deb in the pool main w wondershaper folder but that obviously doesn t work as that directory is for what gets installed in the final system

145621
put	get
also i know how to get the desired busybox build their ftp has prebuilt binaries that include what i need so no problems there i just don t know where to put it

145624
rpm	yum
simply download the rpm matching your vm architecture and install using yum

145627
put	get
by following the instructions you can get the base file system replace or change whatever you want in my case i simply manually installed some debs where they wanted to be and then repackage the initrd properly put it back where you got it from and rebuild the iso file

145628
debian	mint	debian	linux
i am running linux mint debian edition lmde and i need a program like microsoft publisher that i can make fliers and pamphlets with

145635
tunnel	vpn
torrent client that can tunnel all of its traffic through a vpn

145645
cpu	processors
i want to disable 3 cpu cores and run my processors on a single core

145692
ubuntu	linux
i have two ppp peers dsl-line1 and dsl-line2 which are configured with pppd on ubuntu server linux

145716
fish	bash
this happens in both fish and bash

145732
centos	linux
i m using centos linux

145733
wordpress	joomla
if you can keep attackers from guessing your wordpress or joomla or whatever password and keep your whatever up-to-date and get lucky by not having any hackable plugins or 3rd-party code installed you should be able to avoid mayhem

145736
postfix	dovecot
i am using postfix + dovecot + imap + maildir and i am accessing my server from two different machines desktop and laptop two clients thunderbird

145740
apache	nginx
it sounds like it does target vulnerabilities in apache and nginx but if so it s unlikely that there are fixes for those yet

145740
apache	nginx
there s nothing explicit on the nginx news page or apache vulnerabilities page

145761
debian	linux
ps i am using debian testing linux rig 3.14-1-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.14.12-1 2014-07-11 x86_64 gnu linux

145766
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
this works at least for kde and xfce gnome not tested but it might work as well

145771
postfix	dovecot
i had a postfix dovecot system with mail users working

145786
xmonad	xmobar
for some reason my xmonad config won t launch xmobar but it doesn t throw any errors and the command xmobar launches it fine

145793
debian	mint	debian	linux
recently i installed windows 8.1 and linux mint debian edition on a new laptop

145814
bash	zsh
here s a way to pre-filter both files that relies on ksh bash zsh process substitution

145835
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m on linux mint debian edition

145897
ubuntu	mint
your system is trying to use repositories from ubuntu 13.04 upon which mint was apparently derived and the error is occurring because those repositories are no longer present

145898
ubuntu	mint
this is because ubuntu 13.04 has been end-of-lifed mint 15 was released 2013-05-29

145898
ubuntu	mint
if you absolutely must keep mint 15 you will need to update etc apt sources.list.d official-package-repositories.list to point to the ubuntu archive urls

145898
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
the latest version of linux mint is mint 17 which is based on ubuntu 14.04 trusty tahr

145906
sudoers	passwd
add added bob to the sudoers with nopasswd this works fine when i m logging in as bob but if i try and login as bob2 i get asked for the sudoers passwd

145914
disk	ram
because disk are much slower than ram this can lead to slower response times for system and applications if processes are too aggressively moved out of memory

145922
filesystems	hfs+
i ran the command fdisk -l to find out what my external drive is formatted to i found out it s uses gpt partitions and the filesystems is hfs+

145926
sudo	passwd
you can also try sudo if it is installed and configured to give your user root access sudo bash which expects the passwd of the account using the sudo command or no passwd at all if sudo is configured that way

145962
ubuntu	linux
i am looking for a linux ubuntu software that allows me to take note of new words that i learn online

145986
centos	linux
you can also reference this red hat networking guide as red hat enterprise linux is identical to centos

146020
ptrace	exploit
the protection afforded by disabling ptrace to non-child processes is somewhat limited it prevents a real but narrow range of exploit and at a small but non-negigible cost

146029
debian	mint	debian	linux
physical pc os linux mint debian edition

146037
stdout	stderr
attach stdin stdout stderr to the new dev console and exec the new init

146051
cpu	processors
it shows 4 processors with 2 cpu cores

146051
cpu	processors
any method in ubuntu to get current cpu frequency to see if the processors is on turbo boost or not

146053
cpu	processors
cpu cores being 2 is that total number of cores in the processors which can be checked from the spec given in the intel s url you have given

146071
mdadm	btrfs
i have a btrfs raid5 setup no mdadm with four disks the fifth failed

146086

146119
sudo	passwd
if needed to avoid sudo passwd promt

146119
sudo	passwd
the explanation for the last one is having sudo run after ssh it never gets a passwd input for sudo on the remote server so the solution is use -s and pipe a passwd for sudo as above

146131
min	max
i did change the stripe size and the min and max speed limits and it did not change a thing

146158
ubuntu	debian
with the perl rename tool which is called rename on debian and friends including ubuntu it may be prename elsewhere

146159
rpm	yum
yum list installed has 930 lines while rpm -qa has 895 lines what might be the difference

146161
rpm	yum
it will look for yum installed as well as rpm installed

146161
rpm	yum
in addition the format of rpm -qa output will work better with the yum install command that you are wanting to execute

146162
rpm	yum
so the difference might be yum resolves the dependencies but rpm has installed all the dependencies and so it provides a more complete list

146162
rpm	yum
i see the actual difference between yum and rpm as below

146167
ubuntu	debian
what is currently a good way to disable the cpu throttling on ubuntu and debian systems

146186
stdout	stderr
i have read that it means send stdout and stderr to file

146186
stdout	stderr
i also understand that means that the stderr should be sent to stdout

146188
stdout	stderr
-- redirect all thing from stderr to stdout which is now pointed to file

146189
stdout	stderr
the final result is that both stderr and stdout are sent to file

146196
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
the sudo command without another user name allows you to run commands as the super-user root provided you are a sudo-er your user name is in etc sudoers with the correct fields and know the passwd to that sudo-enabled user

146197
folder	directory
i d like to compare two folder with each other and afterwards delete all duplicate files within one of these directory

146207
crypt	salt
anything else it does some validity checking but x sails right through yet crypt doesn t like it salt not long enough

146210
tar	gunzip
when you uncompress these files you use gunzip or bunzip2 and not tar

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
the deb file format is the format of packages that can be installed on debian debian and derivatives such as ubuntu ubuntu linux mint linux-mint etc

for questions about the tools to install these packages use dpkg or apt as appropriate

146223

the -b option is supported by gnu grep and most bsd versions as well osx freebsd openbsd netbsd but it is technically not a standard option

146240
cpu	processors
so in most software manuals the terms cpu and processors are used to mean any one piece of hardware that executes program code

146240
cpu	processors
the processors numbers which are the number of the cpu number entries in sys devices system cpu correspond to these 4 threads

146252
folder	directory
but since it works on one directory at a time it will be inconvenient to use it with numerous folder in sub-folders

146268
daemons	launchd
to do this you would probably want to modify the etc init.d script that launchd this daemons

146269
mouse	keyboard
normal applications receive mouse events using the x11 protocol or whatever higher-level toolkit they are using along with all other types of events keyboard events window drawing events window focus events etc... not through stdin

146271
debian	linux
my distribution is debian linux desktop environment is xfce and computer is a lenovo thinkpad x201 though this problem seems to only be specific to this mouse rather than any of those things

146273
sysv	systemd
on systemd such as linux and sysv which have dev fd a regular pipe is used and is used as the name

146287
mouse	keyboard
such as keyboard pressed mouse events..

146288
mouse	keyboard
while the above should be able to capture all events if your xinput doesn t support test-xi2 or --root you can use xinput test on a particular keyboard or mouse device

146340
ubuntu	debian
on my system ubuntu but debian should be similar i am not prompted when i apt-get install libpq-dev and i have this entry

if the file is sorted in your current locale preferably c you can possibly speed things up by using comm instead of grep

146373
apache	nginx
there are various proxy servers available a quick search of your disto s repository will bring up a few - squid is one and the apache and nginx webservers can also act as proxies but installing one wouldn t help your scenario as the proxy would try to access the website on your behalf and still be blocked by your corporate firewall

146576
filesystems	btrfs
i am having significant problems using docker on my btrfs filesystems and i suspect that is due to a lack of stability with the btrfs driver

146586
put	get
if you take one of the urls that gives a 404 error and put it in your browser you will see that you get the 404 error as well

146629
disk	ram
ssd i don t know how fast the ssd memory is compared to ram memory but certainly it is not faster so sync is likely to give a performance penalty although not as bad as with mechanical disk drives

postfix	dovecot
i have postfix + maildir + dovecot + imap on my mailserver

146634
mutt	thunderbird
when i am connected over imap with thunderbird and simultaneously start mutt locally on the server mutt seems to be confused

146634
mutt	thunderbird
when i move a message in thunderbird over imap mutt notices something has changed and reports

146634
mutt	thunderbird
when i manipulate a message in mutt thunderbird registers the change and has no problem with it

146656
ubuntu	linux
i currently have created two virtual machines in virtualbox both running linux ubuntu 14.04 and now want to have them have different ip addresses

146662
debian	linux
debian or any other linux distribution will work without swap partition - just don t create one during installation

146683
sudo	passwd
but with sudo it would but being run after ssh it never gets passwd input for it on the remote server so the solution is use -s and pipe a passwd for sudo as follows

146683
sudo	passwd
on the one hand this is good for the automation with no getting sudo passwd promts and to have completely automated code script you would add sshpass -p passwd ssh.

146683
sudo	passwd
however on the server where others can easily read your sudo passwd provided as open text during the ssh session that s not recommended from the security perspectives

146683
sudo	passwd
nevertheless with -t it s impossible to pipe ssh sudo command | command for example but it is possible with ussage of -s and echoing passwd ssh server echo passwd | sudo -s ls -l | grep a

centos	linux
already installed vmware workstation 9 on my linux centos 6.5 final with 3.10.40-1.el6.elrepo.x86_64 running kernel

146703
sudo	passwd
the next issue is that ssh runs a non-interactive shell with no tty so sudo can t ask for a passwd

146703
sudo	passwd
do not ever echo your sudo passwd as suggested by another answer

146703
sudo	passwd
this means that all i need to do is grep sudo youruser .bash_history and i have your passwd and complete access to the server

146718
installation	upgrade
when you run apt-get upgrade it completes the installation of any package that s partially installed

i d like integrate a multi extension support png bmp etc

146751
filesystems	fat
efi firmware understands the fat filesystems and so it looks for the partition the table describes with the efi system partition flag mounts it as fat and attempts to execute the path stored in its boot0000- guid nvram variable

146757
sudo	passwd
i don t want to disable the sudo - i just want to mimic a situation when the user actually puts the passwd

146759
sudoers	passwd
you must edit your etc sudoers file and grant your user permission to run some programs as root without passwd

146760
bmp	png
considering file extensions jpg png bmp raw and others should i use a while cycle to do this

146784
ubuntu	debian
does the kernel package update debian ubuntu update lilo as it does with grub2

146790
mouse	keyboard
if i hook up a mouse and keyboard and monitor i can still interact with the server

146797
xfce	gnome
it should work fine under the gnome desktop even though it was designed for xfce because xfce itself relies on many gnome libraries

146798
versioning	upgrade
i ve also set autocd which allow you to type a directory name and be cd d into it if it exists ok in ubuntu but in osx i had to upgrade my bash versioning from 3 to 4

146801
folder	directory
perhaps you could move the original directory to a different location such as a hidden folder and make both of your directory soft links to the real location

146803
filesystems	fat
this is a problem for efi systems not configured to load filesystems drivers such as are provided with the refind package because fat is a fairly stupid filesystems overall and it does not understand them

146973
sudo	passwd
the passwd change was successful because i was also able to authenticate against the root account with authconfig --test which asks for root passwd outside of sudo su

redhat	fedora
the package name is written in upper case in fedora and thus redhat centos etc. though

147009

147066
unix	aix
aix - ibm proprietary version of unix

147066
unix	solaris
solaris - sun proprietary version of unix

147068
sudo	passwd
su is similar but less read not configurable than sudo - most importantly it requires authenticates users based on the knowledge of the root passwd which is security-wise rather appalling

147073
sudo	passwd
to use sudo you need to supply your own user passwd and then you re allowed to do some things on the target user s behalf

147073
sudo	passwd
why is the sudo passwd different than the su root passwd

147076
unix	bsd
although there wasn t a formal c specification for some years bell did licence the source code for unix to universities in the 1970 s methinks a much more open era than now technology wise and this is how the first unix-like os namely bsd came about

147080
sudo	passwd
one of the striking features of sudo is that you can configure it such that a user has to authenticate himself with his own passwd instead of that of the target

147080
sudo	passwd
thus sudo has grown very popular amongst admins for it allows to authorize users to do only defined privileged operations without dealing out the superuser passwd plus you get some degree of accountability

147109
bash	zsh
in bash ksh or zsh

147109
bash	zsh
matching a string against a pattern with inside is a ksh extension also present in bash and zsh

147109

ubuntu	debian
windows 8.1 and ubuntu work fine but debian cannot even boot

147259
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
when you invoke sudo it prompts for passwd and then checks the etc sudoers configuration file to see if the user is permitted access to run the command

147259
sudo	passwd
since root can do anything we often want to use the sudo program to elevate ourselves to root with a passwd prompt to perform some system level commands

147337
hide	show
if the disk has partitions there s no point in telling linux not to show them to you whatever problem you re having this could only hide the problem not solve it

147354
debian	mint	debian	linux
is there a way to replace password lock screen in linux mint debian edition with a pin lock screen

147437
debian	mint
i had this problem as well with mint 16 cinnamon and mint 17 debian cinnamon

147438
hash	salt
salting prevents that as a different salt value leads to a different hash value so it doesn t matter that the password are equal

147460
google-chrome	firefox
in many cases where flash doesn t work with firefox or chromium you can successfully view the content on linux with google-chrome

this should involve some kind of emulation such as linprocfs that will allow you to run linux binaries inside freebsd

147498
octal	hex	octal	decimal
may be specified in decimal hex or octal and can be determined

147499
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
the distributions in question are debian linux 7.6 and centos 7

vmware	virtualbox
at least vmware and virtualbox count video memory as part of the memory allocated to a virtual machine

147557
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs

147606
kde	gnome
do you have gnome kde or some kind of xwindow dm

147608
bash	zsh
with any posix shell implementing the user portability option includes ksh zsh bash yash you can also use the fc command

147629
kde	gnome
and there is a very old directory .gnome2_private and i don t even run gnome i run kde

147660
jobs	cron
on any platforms configuration at jobs could conceivably be run by periodic cron jobs or other scheduler

147661
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
the crond daemon runs your cron jobs and the atd dameon runs the at jobs

147666
filesystems	btrfs
as someone who is using a btrfs filesystems with arch linux for almost 2 years now i can safely say that there does not seem to be a practical limit on the number of snapshots that can be easily reached

147666
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs filesystems can lead to fragmentation

147666
filesystems	btrfs
as you might know btrfs treats subvolumes as filesystems and hence the number of snapshots is indeed limited namely by the size of files

147666
filesystems	btrfs
aside from these limitations there can potentially always be problems when you run out of space without you immediately recognizing because checking for free space on btrfs filesystems can sometimes be tricky without being able to differentiate between different methods of measuring free space on a btrfs filesystems one can easily use track of what amount of space is actually left

147666
filesystems	btrfs
last but not least a warning i am no expert on btrfs filesystems and only read about these things when i had the same question a while ago

147671
ubuntu	debian
i sync my .vimrc file between two machines one running debian testing and the other ubuntu

147687
debian	linux
i m using kali linux a debian based distribution

147689
put	get
those dirs should be owned by the user and there he will be able to put and get files

147690
folder	directory
users home directory are owned by root and within them there are folder documents and public_html owned by respective users

147692
sudo	passwd
in your sudo line the passwd prompt is for your local passwd not for the remote one

147709
mouse	keyboard
unfortunately this is not a solution as it also stops it from correctly configuring my other mouse and keyboard as a result buttons on both devices do not work correctly

147712
post	get
searching for error -110 leads to several post suggesting that the device probably doesnâ t get enough power

147716
versioning	upgrade
you might have upgrade your ubuntu to the latest versioning and have playonlinux installed in the old versioning

147723
ubuntu	linux
update this problem is being avoided by using a keyboard which is exactly the same model tracer patriot black but with a ps 2 connector.the seller said me these keyboards work on linux ubuntu machines telling me he installs linux sometimes for his clients making me believe the problem is also caused by my old pc machine

147739

google-chrome	firefox
given a fresh install of slackware64 how can i install the 32-bit flash plugin content debugger in firefox and google-chrome

147776
ubuntu	linux
today i needed linux so i chose ubuntu and installed it from a bootable flash drive alongside windows

147782
kde	gnome
it s normal to have some gnome directories if you don t use gnome as your window manager the same goes for kde and any other gui toolkit gnome is also a gui toolkit and any application that uses that toolkit might use the directories

147794
gentoo	linux
you can try to use a more low level linux distro like arch linux or gentoo

147818
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
allow to execute sudo anacron without passwd by adding the following line to etc sudoers

ubuntu	centos
rhe centos doesn t have this issue this is a ubuntu thing

147847
sudo	passwd
sudo sorry a passwd is required to run sudo

147851
rpm	yum
the package that provides required libraries is installed and libraries are searchable from rpm yum

147859
folder	directory
i can understand the rationale of hiding files and folder in the home user directory to prevent users from messing around with things

147880
bash	zsh
is there a way that i can combine the following commands the last is a zsh function into a single bash script

147882
bash	zsh
write a bash script and for the last command invoke zsh to execute it have one shell invoke another shell

147882
bash	zsh
write a zsh script which in turn runs the four commands forgetting about bash

147901
ubuntu	debian
if op is using debian ubuntu or their variants check out this ask ubuntu post especially the secure-delete package in the recommended answer

147906
redhat	fedora
for example fedora and centos and presumably redhat use a basic rename utility that does basic search and replace and nothing much else

147949
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
the one found on debian and derivatives ubuntu mint â is a perl script and its first argument is a perl expression that transforms the old name into the new name

147949
debian	linux
if you have a linux distribution that isn t derived from debian then the rename utility is one that is suitable for almost no practical task

147968
debian	centos
no gui for end-users just like debian and centos with their minimal isos

147970
filesystems	ntfs
i cannot mount my second hard-drive because it has an unknown filesystems even though i know it is ntfs

btrfs	hfs+	hfs	btrfs
most linux unix formats ext2 ext3 ext4 and hfs hfs+ btrfs and zfs try to keep data unfragmented but there will always be some small amount of fragmentation

147977
queue	fifo
i thought it might be possible with a fifo queue but i m having trouble getting this to work

147983
switching	screens
anyway the problem is if i use xrandr to switching to the 1920x1080 mode or let x11 do so by default on startup my television shows a black screens and an error é žå ¾å œã å åš ä å unsupported input signal

148021
ubuntu	linux
the issue is present using avalue s own linux firmware ubuntu 10.04

148042
disk	ram
set initrd init ram disk to use the image initrd.img-2.6.32-33-generic

148083
bash	zsh
for instance with bash and zsh you need to setopt the notify option so that you get such a report immediately instead of waiting for the next prompt

148128
gentoo	linux
i am running gentoo linux for amd64 using kernel 3.12.21 amd64 on an hp pavilion touch 14-n009la with an amd a8-4555m cpu

gentoo	linux
i am running gentoo linux on an amd64 laptop and i am having an extremely hard time setting up host networking on kvm

148201
filesystems	ntfs
my suspicion is that this caching may also be related in part to it being a ntfs filesystems that i m working on

148214
postfix	dovecot
i followed this tutorial to setup postfix and dovecot before i realized what it did but have removed it since

148234
bash	zsh
there are similar features in zsh and other shells but you ve indicated you re using bash

for debian and most derivatives like ubuntu these come in packages xautomation and xbindkeys respectively

148313
folder	directory
if you were to quote the then zip would simply look for a file directory called and compress that file folder if it existed

148354
filesystems	btrfs
or which alternative filesystems besides btrfs which i used before - it had severe cpu usage issues for many small files can i use

148361
daemons	launchd
and in this way when i launchd the slurm daemons with an ssh connection everything works and when it is the init process that starts the daemons it is like it does not consider the rules in etc security limits.conf

148375
single-quotes	double-quotes
while bash removes those double-quotes before passing the string to sed it leaves the inner single-quotes alone

148386
bash	zsh
with zsh or bash

148404
stdout	stderr
what i want to know is how bash actually changes stdin stdout stderr when you use pipes or redirection

148481
daemon	cron
it seems you want keep your daemon running by cron

148492
bash	zsh
it works in bash zsh mksh but not ksh93 ash or yash

bash	zsh
to avoid reading the file several times with shells supporting process substitution ksh zsh bash

148557
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	aix	unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
this is the best approach on linux freebsd and osx but root seems to ignore files that it sees as having a length of 0 so it might not work on some other unix variants where dev fd is not a regular file such as solaris dev fd is a device file or aix and hp-ux dev fd doesn t exist

148577
ftp	telnet
xpect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin tip etc

148587
ubuntu	debian
what i am wondering is if there is a more official equivalent to this behaviour in the debian package manager mainly looking at ubuntu

148601
vim	emacs
this is also the mode you d want if you wanted to run vim inside emacs

148627
daemons	systemd
systemd actually only the systemd-logind daemons and library is required

148665
gentoo	ubuntu
i tried booting with gparted ubuntu and gentoo but none of the other oses would create dev sda either

148693
disk	ram
ram is so much faster than disk so you should have high iowait s but not high cpu

148693
cpu	irq
run atop and see where the cpu is actually being used and break it down into system user irq and wait

148698
stdout	stderr
the process inherits stdin stdout and stderr from the shell

148698
stdout	stderr
the process inherits stdout stderr from the shell so it still writes to the terminal

148768
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
since firefox seems to be buggy answers with different mainstream web browsers google-chrome opera etc are accepted

148776
sysv	systemd
i was able to solve the staggered start by using systemd timers which are certainly a lot more elegant than the shell code i was using in sysv inits

148779

the filesystem you are trying to remove symlink from is probably an initramfs which is loaded on ram at boot so the one you are modifying is the ram copy of the initial ram disk which is discarded at shutdown

148889
width	height
the vsplit command accepts only width as a parameter not height

148909
debian	centos
i am using centos and i am installing one debian application with multiple-instance

148916
ubuntu	debian
on fedora this is in the qt -devel package but on debian ubuntu it may be in it s own package

148918
cpu	processors
while the decision about cool n quiet is made by software outside of the processors turbo core is a decision made autonomously by an additional microcontroller on the apu or cpu

148918
ubuntu	linux
i started with a fresh ubuntu 14.04 server kernel 3.13 installation which i see as comparable to the arch linux installer 2014.08.01 kernel 3.15.7 due to the presence of acpi_cpufreq kernel cpu scaling and radeon kernel gpu driver

148949
debian	linux
i would like to better understand what is on this hard disk and how i can mount it into linux specifically debian gnu linux stable

148981
stdout	stderr
i guess the reason for the second process the one with pid 6650 in your sample is to close tty connection stdin stdout and stderr so you could logout

148990
debian	linux
i m running crunchbang linux 3.2.0-4-amd64 debian 3.2.60-1+deb7u1 x86_64 gnu linux and i just switched over to using systemd

149003
sysv	systemd
if you also have the sysv init script showing up in systemd disable it

149022
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu apt-get install multitail

149038
kde	gnome
linux-based guis such as kde and gnome support mime type-based

149042
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
inside a desktop environment gnome kde or xfce xdg-open simply passes the arguments to that desktop environment s file-opener application gvfs-open kde-open or exo-open respectively which means that the associations are left up to the desktop environment

149042
ubuntu	linux
still since this is unix linux and not ask ubuntu

149049
ubuntu	debian
i have a dual-boot ubuntu debian gnome machine

149049
ubuntu	debian
my mouse touchpad does not work correctly right-click not recognized cannot do 2 finger drag and drop highlight on debian but it does work properly in ubuntu

149049
ubuntu	debian
i have so far overwritten .conf files in debian with .conf files from ubuntu in usr share x11 xorg.conf.d and restarted x and rebooted

149049
ubuntu	debian
originally i did not have a etc dev x11 xorg.conf file or a etc dev x11 xorg.conf.d directory neither ubuntu or debian

149049
ubuntu	debian
compared x -configure from debian and ubuntu

149053
lsof	netcat
if you have bash and coreutils timeout sleep but not netcat lsof netstat you can use this solution which uses bash magic tcp sockets

149056
debian	mint	debian	linux
i have a linux mint debian edition device that i m connecting to my sony bravia tv via hdmi

149068
innodb	tokudb

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
linux also often confusingly is used to refer to systems like debian ubuntu redhat centos suse and many more

149075
solaris	bsd
x11 is used on most unixes gnu including gnu+linux bsd solaris hp-ux etc

149075
versioning	upgrade
though if you did have a 1985 versioning of x11 you would have to logout to upgrade to one that has 3d etc

149082
folder	directory
my question problem is i want to move the whole folder directory instead of file to the remote server

149093
bash	zsh
tested in sh bash and zsh

149129
width	height
lc_paper the default paper size defined by height and width

149137
bash	zsh
these man pages are correct for all bourne-style shells dash bash ksh and even zsh but typically incomplete

149153
debian	linux
i just installed debian and i m relatively new to linux

149153
ethernet	wireless
at the moment i m connected to the internet via ethernet cable and i m having trouble connecting to a wireless network

149182
ubuntu	debian
if you use debian based or ubuntu please install the below

149195
vim	emacs
the focus is vim but considering vipe reads the editor variable i would also read with interest a solution leveraging emacs

149198
ubuntu	linux
i am new to arch linux coming from ubuntu and have just installed arch linux on my machine

149213
temp	tmp
as i couldn t recognize any pattern in the vipe temp files this broadly handles all files opened in tmp

149219
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
the equivalent -l option doesn t exist in the classic bourne shell or original csh but most newer shells bash dash ksh yash tcsh zsh rc es fish and any semi-recent version of csh have it

149251
mouse	keyboard
gui applications such as xterm gnome-terminal konsole â transform keyboard and mouse events into text input and display output

149274
tunnel	vpn
the server has been configured with a tun device tun-aib0 that acts as an endpoint for a vpn tunnel

149293
put	get
this doesn t even get as far as dropping traffic on the floor it won t let me put the tunnel into the bridge

149297
sudo	chgrp	chgrp	mount
mount point owned by group sudo chgrp media drive_name group_name

149298
ubuntu	linux
it is not the first time i am using linux i have ubuntu in my desktop pcs

149298
ubuntu	opensuse	xfce	gnome
i have tried various distributions on my laptop like opensuse gnome fedora xfce ubuntu unity and i always have the same problem

149299
google-chrome	firefox
i am mainly looking form some light-weight even text application rather than full-fledged one because i have opened too many webpages in both firefox and google-chrome and they take up too much resources

149336
mouse	keyboard
the catclysm gaming mouse has usb interfaces for both a mouse and a keyboard - you basically need to telling the mouse which buttons you want matched to which keystroke s

149339
children	parent
if a parent process terminates then its zombie children if any are adopted by init 8 which automatically performs a wait to remove the zombies

149339
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
the freebsd wait 2 netbsd wait 2 openbsd wait 2 and mac os x wait 2 man pages confirm this too

149349
solaris	sunos	opensolaris	sunos
also only a development version of sunos 5.11 was ever released as opensolaris - if uname reports sunos 5.10 it is the solaris 10 release that predates opensolaris

149368
debian	linux	google-chrome	firefox
for me on debian linux google-chrome refuses to recognize the embedded language meta tags but firefox iceweasel can handle

149378
debian	linux
i have installed linux debian onto my computer which is not partitioned

149387
postfix	dovecot
i wanted to host my own mail server and in order to do so i ve installed postfix 2.7.0 and dovecot 1.2.9 on ubuntu server 10.04

149395
freebsd	debian
i suggest reading the hosts_access 5 man page for your system debian version freebsd version

149425
titlebar	window
i d like to see the name of my document in the window s titlebar

149429
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
also as an x utility its appearance is generally boxy and doesn t fit into the default themes of most desktops environments such as gnome kde xfce etc

149467
switching	screens
with the screens option -l you can switching on logging of the output to files named screenlog.n with n the index of the window

149470
mouse	keyboard
controlled entirely from the keyboard but a mouse can also be used

149470

desktops and mouse or keyboard navigation

149470
mouse	keyboard
using mouse and keyboard

149507
kde	gnome
examples ubuntu s unity gnome kde

149515
lxml	libxml2
i am using centos 6.5 and want to use newer versions of python lxml libxml2 and libxslt2 than what s available from the repos

149515
lxml	elementtree
however from lxml import elementtree fails because it expects my newer version of libxml but it looks at usr lib64 libxml and fails

149515
libxml2	libxslt
building against libxml2 libxslt in one of the following directories

149525
google-chrome	firefox
alternatively is it possible that google-chrome browser can read and import the passwords stored by firefox

149547
jobs	cron
a quick and easy check is to and run your cron jobs

149566
bash	zsh
otherwise if you have access to bash though ksh93 or zsh will do as well you could always do

149592
post	get
the effect you ll get is probably of the command working more often than not but sometimes failing with the error you post

149594
bash	zsh
pipe expression in process substitution causes a race condition in bash and ksh zsh doesn t

149594
bash	zsh
the main problem here is that zsh waits bash doesn t

149598
bash	zsh
the reason autocompletion is available on zsh but not bash is that it is easier to implement in zsh because it has more detailed support for command line interaction compared to readline used by bash

149598
bash	zsh
if you like this kind of advanced interaction with your tools you should take a close look at zsh because that s the main difference between bash and zsh

149626
bash	zsh
if you re using bash zsh or another more powerful shell you can also use here strings

149627
ubuntu	debian
in my situation the error appears when i try to run an application compiled on ubuntu 12.04 lts using glibc_2.14 on debian wheezy which installs glibc 2.13 by default

149636
int	chars
a sequence expression takes the form x..y ..incr where x and y are either int or single chars and incr an optional increment is an int

149642
centos	linux
centos 6 is the free version of redhat enterprise linux 6

149643
filesystems	xfs
a default filesystems of xfs

149644
centos	linux
centos 7 is the free version of redhat enterprise linux 7

149658
ubuntu	centos
if you want long term stability deploy centos or the lts ubuntu releases instead

149680
kde	gnome
you can run up2date --configure from a gnome or kde desktop x-windows display and will open a gui

149690
debian	linux
i have a script on my nas which is a synology ds212j which is running on a special distro where uname -a gives me linux ds212j 2.6.32.12 #4493 wed jul 16 11 37 16 cst 2014 armv5tel gnu linux synology_88f6281_212j which is suppose to run rsync to backup my raspberry pi running raspbian based on debian

149708
mouse	keyboard
the mouse pointer keeps on working but clicking works in no part of the screen neither does the keyboard work

149727
bash	zsh
if one of the commands reads input it would be a good idea to use another fd for input so the commands won t eat it here assuming ksh zsh or bash for -u 3 use instead portably

149731
unix	solaris
however note that some xargs implementations have a very low limit on the maximum size of the argument 255 on solaris for instance the minimum allowed by the unix specification

149732
ubuntu	debian
exactly where this is done will vary depending on debian or ubuntu versions

149736
debian	linux
debian gnu linux is supposed to mount hfs+ automatically and just work --it even has all the packages pre-installed typically

149748
debian	mint	debian	linux
edit 1 while other linux distros have this upstream throttle on linux mint debian edition 201403 upload is working as it should usually being around 30-45mbps

149748
ubuntu	linux
the same symptoms seem to be present in different hardware and linux distributions also with ubuntu 14.04 lts 64 bit workstation kernel 3.16 and raspbian jessie for raspberry pi kernel 3.14

149749
mocha	node.js
using some of node.js tools like mocha in my urxvt terminal i have some problems with coloured output

149762
mouse	keyboard
ps 2 mouse keyboard

149762
switching	screens
the boot performance measured is a cold boot from flipping the power switching until the text tty1 ubuntu login appears on screens

149762
ubuntu	linux
in other words the variation in linux kernel + ubuntu boot process is within a 0.539 seconds range and has an average value of 5.233 seconds

149762
ubuntu	linux
during cold uefi boot the linux kernel + ubuntu boot part were timed by debug output at

149767
debian	linux
i use linux debian but it isn t impornant linux distro or version

149792
dpkg	apt
â¹ you can set a dpkg or apt hook but it ll run after package removals upgrades etc. not just after installing packages

149818
kde	gnome
i have installed some kde and gnome applications on the same computer

149818
kde	gnome
is there any way to set these consistently either changing to the kde order or to the gnome order

149829
switching	screens
i solved this problem for myself by switching to a dedicated screens locker instead of xscreensaver

149835
cpu	affinity
for some reason i want to have 10 processes share the same cpu core by affinity

149851
for-loop	arrays
similarly when i do for-loop for an arrays does it scan all the indexes where arrays i exists or it point only defined arrays s index for ex

149884
bash	zsh
an easier way to do this would be to make a bash zsh alias like this

149888
kde	gnome
use a terminal in gnome or konsole in kde

149895
tunnel	vpn
now how to get traffic out from the namespace to the vpn tunnel

149895
tunnel	vpn
for the sake of example suppose that eth0 is your main interface tun0 is your vpn tunnel interface and veth0 veth1 the pair of interfaces of which veth1 is in the namespace

149899
tunnel	vpn
i already managed to do this using a vpn p2p but i wonder if it is possible using iptables through ssh tunnel ssh tunnel is mandatory here

149899
debian	linux
i use two linux debian wheezy servers to open a tunnel over internet between the two programs

149901
ubuntu	centos
problem in installing ubuntu after centos 7.0 i have a laptop with a hard disk around 170gb

149901
ubuntu	centos
after installing centos 7.0 i tried to install the ubuntu 14.04 alongside with the centos 7.0

149901
ubuntu	centos
the ubuntu installer could not recognise the existing centos 7.0 and i could not shrink the exisitng drive

149901
ubuntu	centos
will change of installation sequence helps remove the centos 7.0 and install ubuntu first

149906
centos	mint
have kali centos mint and even a few different win flavors setup as vm with no issues for any of them

149907
centos	linux
you should boot to a live usb or cd dvd some linux os install gparted and shrink the centos partition from there

149916
bash	zsh
so you can use that in all posix compliant shells the sh of all modern unix-likes dash bash yash mksh zsh posh ksh...

149916
bash	zsh
let and ... are only available in ksh zsh and bash

149921
chown	chmod
you can recreate it give it to root chown root root tmp and set 1777 permissions on it so that everyone can use it chmod 1777 tmp

149924
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon
xfce gnome and cinnamon what i m currently using all suffer from this

149965
folder	directory
each of these folder contain images and the directory names under images and images2 are exactly the same however their content is different

149980
sudo	passwd
the main difference between su and sudo in their typical configuration is that for sudo you type the same passwd as when you log in whereas su requires a different passwd the passwd of the root user

149980
sudo	passwd
it s also possible to configure sudo not to require a passwd

149980
sudo	passwd
either way you ll be prompted for a passwd the root passwd for su your own passwd for sudo

149980
sudo	passwd
sudo can remember your passwd and not ask you again for the next few minutes

149982
ubuntu	debian
one reason is that it misses valid ip addresses of the machine such as 127.0.1.1 with which the fqdn may be associated in the etc hosts file this is currently the default under debian and ubuntu for instance

149997
stdout	stderr
is there a short and simple command that generates both stdout and stderr so that i can use on it

150011
stdout	stderr
to guaranteed stdout written before stderr

150025
bash	zsh
you could try something like this ksh bash zsh syntax

150031
stdout	stderr
just write a subshell which sends to stdout and stderr .

150031
stdout	stderr
this will create files stdout.txt and stderr.txt containing the words stdout and stderr respectively

150041
bash	zsh
zsh has different parameter substitution than bash which is documented in man zshexpn

150080
dpkg	apt
i think apt dpkg sometimes eat the error messages so you don t get to see them

150093
nerdtree	ctrlp
i have only a couple of plugins installed ctrlp nerdtree and highlighters for jade less and coffeescript so i don t think that s what s interfering

150105
versioning	upgrade
i need to update my versioning of openssl and so i looked to implement an upgrade but i do not want my versioning of php and apache is updated that i can do to accomplish this

150110
daemons	systemd
optionally look inside a modern systemd startup daemons and see how it uses shell scripts programs and systemd calls to achieve stuff try not to be too shocked at how rickety it all seems.

150153
ubuntu	linux
i was also searching for the search everything tool for linux and discovered search monkey in the ubuntu repository

150157
spaces	delimiter
if i try to loop through the directory to send files one at a time my desired outcome as some files are fairly large the script interprets spaces as delimiter escaped or not - so path to the files file 1.xls is seen as 3 values path to the files file 1.xls

150188
bash	zsh
using double quote prevent bash and other bourne-like shells except zsh perform field splitting after your variable is expanded

150226
folder	directory
it means that every file or folder under sourcedirectory older than two days should be moved to destination directory

150232
bash	zsh
if you do want to have your shell run the commands based on the output of find then that will have to be bash zsh specific if you want to be reliable as in

150232
bash	zsh
bash zsh

150265
disk	ram
on swap use a big swap partition 2 times of your physical ram - even in current times. if you have multiple data partitions for example a system and a home or a windows and a linux then make the swap partition between them to the middle of the disk

150276
tunnel	packets
it causes the kernel to set the source address of all packets sent into the tunnel to 0.0.0.0

150276
tunnel	packets
by running strace on the openvpn process set to hexdump everything it read from the tunnel descriptor and then manually decoding the packets headers.

150300
folder	directory
out of these multiple directory there could be 1 or more folder

150300
folder	directory
also the folder and directory are synonymous sorry for the confusion

150311
folder	directory
if another user can write to your home directory then they could change alter anything including the .ssh folder

150366
put	get
once something s in a string you don t get to pick which spaces will be used for word splitting but with an array you can decide when you put them in and when you get them back out again

150366
subshell	ifs
as ever you d want to save and reset ifs or only make the change in a subshell

150377
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
it is available for linux ubuntu and debian seem to have it in their repositories

150379
starttls	smtps
i am trying to forward emails that are fetched with fetchmail to another smtps host which enforces starttls

150393
tftp	telnet	ftp	telnet
curl supports ftp ftps gopher http https scp sftp tftp telnet dict ldap ldaps imap pop3 smtp rtsp and uri

150453
filesystems	ntfs
data recovery tools in linux are very weird and rare in between even more that works on ntfs filesystems

150518
gentoo	linux
the linux brand is gentoo 3.15.5-hardened-r2

150560
mouse	keyboard
i m using linux mint 17 with the cinnamon desktop environment and i want to quickly toggle between left-handed and right-handed settings for the mouse by using a keyboard shortcut

150563
kde	gnome
i don t know where it originated at a guess mac but it s become a standard in most major environments including gnome kde osx and microsoft office

150563
kde	gnome
the de facto standard gnome kde osx windows and many more is ctrl + x mnemonic x as in a cross to suppress something with ctrl + c to c opy and ctrl + v to paste mnemonic downward-facing arrow

150566
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	centos	debian	mint	centos	mint
on fedora rhel centos and on debian ubuntu mint and probably others the dependencies recorded in comments are only taken into account by the service script management utility chkconfig

150575
versioning	upgrade
normally you need to upgrade versioning by versioning or from an lts release to another lts release but there s an exception you can go 12.10 â 13.10 â 14.04

150577
chown	sudo
sudo chown vagrant var backup all

150582
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
example user uses fish on local and wishes also to use it on remote but remote only has bash and zsh installed

150610
protected-mode	real-mode
it either calls on an older real-mode video bios oprom and waits for it to complete or it detects a protected-mode gop video rom throws a switch and moves on

150610
filesystems	fat
it will also load whatever uefi-drivers the oem has stored in flash-memory on your main-board but for the most part we can ignore this with the primary exception being the fat filesystems driver

150610
filesystems	fat
for some uefi firmwares removable disks are special cases in that they need not be flagged esp if they have no partition table at all - in other words it is often possible to boot from a usb-disk that was never partitioned and is formatted in whole with a fat filesystems

150620
mutt	thunderbird
i d love to use both thunderbird and mutt together

150625
freebsd	linux
on some laptops these keys are not handle by the os but by the firmware and on my dell inspirion mini 10 the the keys only work on linux and not on freebsd which makes me belief that there is a driver needed to handle the brightness keys on my mini

150636
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
this is a public repository of screenshots taken from applications contained in the debian gnu linux distribution and its derivates like ubuntu

150650
filesystems	ntfs
are you sure the file names are valid on the ntfs filesystems

150650
filesystems	ntfs
another approach is to mount the ntfs filesystems in a way that it cleans up sanitizes the file names itself

150664
postgresql	mysql
is it possible to execute mysql commands directly one step instead of entering the console first and issuing commands two steps like in postgresql

150675
ubuntu	mint
i continued booting with my live usb of mint 17 cursing ubuntu of course with some persistence space

150681
profiling	benchmarking
your best bet is to profiling disk usage and use a real i o benchmarking suite link bonnie++ or something to test how much effect changing various tunables has

150684
uninstall	upgrade
this will put the package in usr but more than that will allow you to uninstall the package even in the case you are doing an upgrade using apt-get without leaving litter around your system

150694
ubuntu	mint
since you are using an obsolete version of mint and mint use ubuntu repositories mostly you get several not found errors since they where removed from the servers to other servers

150694
versioning	upgrade
remember most of these issues are just blown away if you reinstall since linux mint doesn t offer a reliable upgrade path your os anew with a recent versioning of mint

150702
freebsd	linux
however in practice only certain lba-48 enabled operating systems including linux freebsd and windows 7 that use 64-bit sector addresses internally actually support this

150706
stdout	stderr
a frequent annoyance is that often the developers haven t anticipated this type of use so the app prints lots of useless cryptic or uninformative messages to stdout or stderr

150715
folder	directory
if you have an mda that automatically stores your mail into folder in your home directory then why keep a mail spool at all

150720
sudo	passwd
sudo asks you for a passwd

150720
sudoers	passwd
regarding the fact that it needs user s passwd not the root s one that is an excerpt from sudoers manual

150720
sudo	passwd
however in fact sudo does not need your user passwd for anything

150720
sudoers	passwd
if you want to turn off passwd asking change the sudoers entry to

150720
sudo	passwd
you have to enter user s passwd only due to sudo internal security mechanism

150720
sudo	passwd
you gain your root powers because of setuid bit of usr bin sudo not because of any passwd you enter

150721
sudo	passwd
the whole point of sudo is to grant you someone else s privileges usually root without asking for this other account s passwd unlike su

150721
sudo	passwd
sudo is asking here for your passwd just to make sure a passer-by won t misuse your unlocked terminal

150721
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and many other linux and unix oses are granting an initial account created at installation time the right to run any commands as root

150723
sudoers	passwd
you only have to type your normal user passwd because you the user has been added to sudoers file which gives you root priviliges

150730
centos	linux
due to some company policy i cannot connect my centos linux computer to the internet

150752
h.264	webm
unfortunately the adoption of webm the opensource alternative to the patent-laden h.264 codec has been slow

150754
unix	aix	vmware	virtualbox
i am learning aix 6-7 for practice is there any alternative unix flavour which could be quite similar to aix which could be run on a vmware or virtualbox for practice

150759
unix	aix
if you can administer another flavour of unix moving to aix is all about the differences in hardware much the same as moving from linux to hp-ux would be

150762
jobs	cron
if it takes longer than a minute you could have multiple cron jobs running concurrently fighting one another for resources and many remote filesystems aren t able to handle concurrent accesses well

150762
jobs	cron
to avoid concurrent cron jobs you could use some kind of locking mechanism or since it will run non-stop anyway you could put it in a service script instead

150781
spaces	delimiter
the command will output the flat ascii formatted results for possible import by excel spaces and tab delimiter as well as generating the output.wks file which is already in biff binary interchange file format

150807
ubuntu	debian
in particular your python installation is looking for files like lib python2.7 site.py and lib python2.7 sysconfig.py in usr local but these files are part of the base python package python2.7-minimal or possibly libpython2.7-minimal depending on what version of debian ubuntu your distribution corresponds to

edit vim emacs - though why you d be using a command line if you were running emacs-os i have no idea thing.py - the last word in the previous command line

151133
disk	ram
well to be completely honest the previous atime value may exist somewhere on ram or even on disk but you wouldn t know where nor for how long

151150
ubuntu	linux
also i m not a linux user i moved from windows to elementary os luna which is based strongly on ubuntu 12.04

151194
ethernet	wireless
i note that what i m trying to do should be possible because it s perfectly simple to share my university wireless network via my ethernet port on my windows laptop

151211
centos	solaris
i have a centos 6.5 and solaris 5 machines

151244
ubuntu	linux

cron jobs can be registered by each user in which case they run with that user s privileges or at the system level in which case they run as a user chosen by the system administrator

151286
put	get
you ll get better answers if you say what exactly you want to do instead of how you want to do it - in other words put down the chocolate-covered banana and step away from the european currency systems

151315
sudoers	visudo
run sudo visudo to have a look at what s currently in your sudoers file

151340
ubuntu	mint
yesterday i messed up my partitions wanting to replace ubuntu with mint

151340
ubuntu	mint
i selected the option to overwrite ubuntu with mint

151343
centos	linux
how is centos different from red hat enterprise linux

151343
centos	linux
while centos is derived from the red hat enterprise linux codebase centos and red hat enterprise linux are distinguished by divergent build environments qa processes and in some editions different kernels and other open source components

151343
centos	linux
for this reason the centos binaries are not the same as the red hat enterprise linux binaries

151343
centos	linux
while centos delivers a distribution with strong community support red hat enterprise linux provides a stable enterprise platform with a focus on security reliability and performance as well as hardware software and government certifications for production deployments

151343
centos	linux
in addition the centos project maintains code repositories of software that are not part of the red hat enterprise linux codebase

151349
centos	linux
technically they are the same in the sense that red hat enterprise linux makes use of the gpl meaning that the source code must be made available and that the centos project uses that source code to make centos

151350
openbsd	debian
this is with qemu-kvm 1.1.2 on debian wheezy amd64 and openbsd 5.5 amd64 generic.sp so what you may do instead is sending a shutdown -h now or halt -p to the openbsd console

151373
stdout	stderr
echo is still writing to its stdout but its stdout has been made a duplicate of the shell s stderr using the shell redirection operator

151402
udp	tcp
install linphone 3.7.0 mainly because this version allows to configure multiple proxy accounts with different transports udp tcp tls

151402
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian

151402
opus	speex	vp8	opus	vp8	speex
it is available on most platforms you could think of and it is subject to active development namely wrt codec support it supports vp8 and h264 video codecs and opus and speex for audio among others

151449
filesystems	btrfs
and now the mountpoint of my root filesystems has according to lsblk changed to var lib docker btrfs

151456
openbsd	linux
optionally if you would rather avoid the conversations taking place in the clear it s very easy to set-up encryption which is mostly transparent to the end-user secure foss alternative to skype on linux openbsd

151456
opus	speex	vp8	opus	vp8	speex
it is available on most platforms you could think of and it is subject to active development namely wrt codec support it supports vp8 and h264 video codecs and opus and speex for audio among others

151458
sudoers	passwd
if you don t want to be challenged every time for your passwd then i d recommend setting it to nopasswd in your etc sudoers file rather than hardcode your passwd in your logins

151460
post	get
full instruction how to get through usbip setting process you can find in my blog post

151475
ubuntu	debian
copied the ubuntusettings file from ubuntu system to debian

151480
rpm	yum
sudo yum install rsync rpm based

151484
filesystems	btrfs
in your case dev sda2 contains a btrfs filesystems which is mounted both as and as var lib docker btrfs probably with two different subvolumes

151486
udp	tcp
if you want to use tcp for reliability just remove the -u option from nc and replace udp with tcp on the redirection

151493
rhel	suse
as i understand it they are mostly related to configuration suse has yast while rhel has the tools

151499
folder	directory
basically the shell executes mv with the contents of the directory if it is not empty and not including files folder with names beginning with

151514

also consider tags such as backup or for the backup system s you re using bacula amanda tar etc.

151578
daemons	systemd
at boot the systemd daemons loads all systemd in the default target and their dependencies

151578
daemons	systemd
logind is a different daemons distributed with systemd and reads its configuration from the etc systemd logind.conf file

151617
pppoe	dhcp
i am not sure how pppoe works whether it gets an ip over normal dhcp and establishes a session using pppoe or getting the ip is also part of pppoe handshake

151640
bonjour	avahi
but the basics are to install the avahi daemon and start it running then connect from an os that understands bonjour or zeroconf names

151657
hash	md5
the md5 hash is missing a delimiter at the end and i have no idea how to negotiate the output with the pipes

151682
folder	directory
to check the size of all files and folder in the current directory

151689
rpm	yum
if there are two or more versions of a given rpm available in a yum repository how can i instruct yum to install the version i want

151690
rpm	yum
you can also use one of the following options to download a particular rpm from the web and then use yum to install it

151691
post	get
oh and i can t add a comment yet but as an update to warren young s post - apple did get unix certification for 10.7 or at least they claim to have

151736
ubuntu	debian
i recently purchased an asus q550lf laptop with windows 8.1 preinstalled and subsequently installed ubuntu 14.04 and debian 7.6

151736
ubuntu	debian
i use ubuntu for most tasks but occasionally have reason to boot debian

151736
ubuntu	debian
i don t have a problem with the touchscreen in windows or ubuntu so i suspect some problem with debian

151740
rpm	yum
another option you can download rpm file then instruct yum to do a localinstall

151746
versioning	upgrade
this bug appears to have been fixed in versioning 1.2.5 i ve upgrade to 1.2.5 and used the program several times and it has always selected the correct paper-size

151768
cat	tee
i get the same problem with cat ul and tee and the only thing that seems to work is less

151783
debian	linux
it is connected to my laptop running gnu+linux debian 7 with kernel 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.60-1+deb7u3 x86_64 gnu linux

151816
git-rebase	undo
with it you can undo a merge or git-rebase

151822
redhat	fedora
i had a similar problem needed monodevelop and mono on my redhat and fedora systems and i found this guy who has repos for these i think they re always the newest packages but i know they are newer than come with the distributions normally

151822
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian
he has repositories for and supports these centos debian fedora ubuntu and opensuse

151849
folder	directory
so if i put some files directory in dev somefolder the os would keep this folder s content cached

151865
backslash	double-quotes
backslash to be included within double-quotes

151884
xlib	cairo
i could trace the problem back to the cairo device if i use a xlib device access is successful at first try

151886
cpu	affinity
since you are stating that cpulimit would not be practical in your case then i suggest you look at nice renice and taskset which may come close to what you want to achieve although taskset allows to set a processesâ s cpu affinity so it might be not immediately helpful in your case

151915
centos	linux
i ve been trying to accomplish a dns set up on my local machine using linux and centos

151915
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but when surfing to ims.be or www.ims.be using google-chrome firefox ie safari i get an error that the webpage is not available.

151915
centos	linux
i m working on a windows 7 using centos to access linux

151925
bash	zsh
process substitution is not specified by posix so not all posix shell support it only some shells like bash zsh ksh88 ksh93 support

151961
ssl	https
with some protocols tls is usually used on separate ports most famously port 443 for https http over ssl tls as opposed to plain http on port 80

151961
starttls	smtps
some protocols such as smtps pop3 and imap allow to initiate ssl by the starttls command

151961
ssl	tls1.2
technically ssl designates obsolete proprietary versions of the protocol ssl2 and ssl3 and tls designates the more modern versions tls1.0 tls1.1 tls1.2 and the upcoming tls1.3

151961
ssl	https
what s the difference between ssl tls and https

151961
ssl	https
now that it is 2015 what ssl tls cipher suites should be used in a high security https environment

151963
stdout	stderr
with that option the ssh server on host creates a pseudo-terminal device and makes that the stdout and stdin and stderr of vi

151963
stdout	stderr
another potential type of corruption associated with -t is if your startup files on host .bashrc .ssh rc ... write things to their stderr because with -t the stdout and stderr of the remote shell end up being merged into ssh s stdout they both go to the pseudo-terminal device

151964
sctp	tcp
tls can only be used with connection oriented transport protocol like tcp or sctp

151964
ssl	https
related tags ssl certificates public-key-authentication https

151985
sudo	passwd
enter sudo -s and supply your admin passwd

151985
ubuntu	freebsd
another option is to set up a virtual machine inside the mac for example freebsd or ubuntu

151986
ubuntu	mint
i found these instructions at askubuntu but i m not sure if they re still relevant or if there are any differences between ubuntu and mint i should be aware of

151987
disk	ram
so now we ve learned that this types of devices in osx lingo are called ram disk they re actually called this on linux and other oses too but i m just showing you how to decompose these types of questions yourself for future reference

151987
disk	ram
this page had even more info and a link to a gui tool ram disk creator which you could use to construct your own ram disk on osx too

151987
disk	ram
how to create a 4gb s ram disk in mac os x

151987
disk	ram
for the total capacity of your ram disk

151987
disk	ram
example weâ ll create a 4 gb ram disk which requires a number of

151992
ubuntu	mint
just change the distro from ubuntu to mint

151993
peer	p2p
the ticket issue 288385 p2p write a fake avahi zeroconf network to simulate a private network of peer has the following description

152023
ubuntu	debian
there is no package containing a vncserver-x11 binary in ubuntu or debian

152029
ubuntu	linux
on all linux systems i tested kernel 2.6 and afaik normal boot procedure e.g ubuntu 12.04 mount does not show a rootfs entry

152046
centos	linux
i m working with centos and linux on my windows 7

152074
debian	linux
i had once installed debian on the mac and it automatically booted into linux but when i pressed alt i was able to access the refind menu and boot into mac os

152075
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 6

152094
daemons	systemd
the reserved blocks allow systemd daemons to keep going even when the disk is full while non-root processes will not be able to write to it

152106
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	redhat	fedora
in debian ubuntu you can use the --purge switch to apt-get remove in fedora redhat centos you don t need a special switch - the configuration is removed automatically when the package is uninstalled

152109
mouse	keyboard
for me it was sufficient to disable the mouse but the keyboard can be disabled as well

152109
mouse	keyboard
disable keyboard mouse input on unix under x

152114
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
there are then some highly instructive blank spaces starting with words like debian ubuntu and other linux

152115
ssl	https
ssl tls ipsec and s mime use x.509 certificates so whenever you use https on the web you get your hands dirty

152115
x509	openpgp
the main difference between x509 and openpgp is their underlying trust model

152115
x509	openpgp
while x509 is organized hierarchical where there is one and only one certification authority openpgp follows the web of trust where there is no such central instance

152118
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp	sctp	icmp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
icmp is technically at the same layer as tcp udp sctp or dccp but icmp is not a transport protocol in the sense that it is not used by user programs

152118
igmp	arp
icmpv6 does even more with ipv6 arp and igmp are gone and reborn as icmpv6 neighbor discovery and multicast listener discovery

152135
snmp	mib
it has since been extended the snmp mib is rfc 1157

152136
opensuse	centos
my system setup is a mixture of centos 5 and opensuse 13.1

152136
opensuse	centos
however i am not able to get back from centos to opensuse even when at the console

152142
tunnel	packets
originally there were just tunnel mode where entire ip packets were encapsulated in containing ip packets and transport mode which operated on the original ip packets

152176
spaces	delimiter
this is because a spaces are word delimiter on nix command-lines

152200
width	font-size
soft-breaks are a result of rendering the text in a specific font font-size and page width

152222
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu and i guess in debian too there is a system script named update-grub which automatically executes grub-mkconfig -o with the correct path for the grub configuration file

152230
debian	mint	debian	linux
now the whole idea here was that even though both kali and mint run off of debian linux mint is used for entertainment purposes such as

152230
debian	mint
now i know that both kali and mint are both debian based distros and are known to be very secure but i ve had a slight run in with some malware and ransom-ware when running mint alone so i just wanted to take some precaution this time around

152253
udp	tcp
you might want to take a look at the command line tool socat for simulating connections of all sorts tcp udp etc.

152258
mouse	keyboard
however all i got was the window manager starting but none of the keybinds keyboard or mouse were working at all

152277
lvm	umount
when done remember to umount run lvm before exit ing the chroot

152282
daemons	systemd
is it a bad idea to put variables needed by a daemons program running at boot on a headless systemd in etc profile.d

152282
daemons	systemd
so would my daemons process that will eventually need the systemd variables held in profile.d not have these variables set until someone logs into the systemd or will these be set after rc.local runs on an unattended systemd

152290
filesystems	ntfs
this is not possible on a vfat or ntfs filesystems and quite a number of other older filsystems

152323
daemons	systemd
psad is a collection of three lightweight systemd daemons that runs on linux machines and analyze iptables log messages to detect port scans and other suspicious traffic

152338
for-loop	arrays
it doesn t look like much i know but what s important here is that you don t have to worry about any weird filenames or any of that - the intended destination for that output is a shell that shares a positional arrays with the for-loop that generated it

152364
sudo	passwd
sudo will close all file descriptors but 0 1 2 by default and it wants on a terminal for the passwd but you can often sneak by with hijacking stderr

152370
min	max
after this loop there is a little bit more code which utilizes min and max

152384
spaces	delimiter
the first one pulls the entire file into pattern spaces and ensures that every field is comma delimiter so the first line for instance

152400
children	parent
so you need to use a parent process that explicitly starts the children

152409
hindi	tamil
most of the indian language scripts are combining characters - .for example kannada hindi tamil malayalam etc etc

152425
filesystems	btrfs
from my experience the aufs driver doesn t work well over btrfs filesystems

152427
ubuntu	linux
the platform i am running on is ubuntu 14.04 but i d imagine this issue should be linux flavor agnostic

152448
sudo	passwd
i am trying to test if a user has the required sudo rights to run a command as another user without providing a passwd

152448
sudo	passwd
however the scripts prints this error message if sudo requires a passwd

152463
gentoo	linux
i have a gentoo linux server

152478
bash	zsh
it is unfoutunately not suitable as a general purpose shell because it s syntax is pretty different from shells like bash or zsh

152494
children	parent
using the pr_set_child_subreaper option it can wait not only for its own children as before but also for all of their descendants should their parent die prematurely

152500
ssl	https
http that is tunnelled through ssl tls is called https and usually served on tcp port 443

152502
ssl	https
https is http that is tunnelled through ssl tls

152517
freebsd	linux
i think you might need to download the larger installation image it comes with more stuff i think i know that is true about linux but not sure about freebsd

152541
preorder	inorder
the option -depth is changing the tree traversal algorithm for the file system tree from an preorder depth-first search to an inorder depth-first search

152544
screens	tablet
the clients machine are an android tablet and a windows 7 pc these are using different screens resolutions for the connection

152577
switching	screens
the thing is that i attached the screens to my board i switching my board on i login as root i start the xserver startx and then i run my application and everything is works properly

152584
debian	linux
i am trying for days now to enable 3d of my ati x 1900 under debian gnu linux 7.6

152589
ubuntu	linux
i am not really sure how this is possible but i have a linux ubuntu 14.04 box with 2 interfaces

152594
disk	ram
there have been a lot of questions about ram disk and i am aware of ramfs and tmpfs which allow the use of ram as a block device

152617
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
you may prefer to use a shell with proper syntax highlighting like fish fizsh or zsh with add-on instead of bash

152661
ubuntu	debian
on some distributions eg debian ubuntu this should be installed as default and aliased to rename

152661
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu it is part of the perl package

152666
filesystems	fat
warning this answer will not work on filesystems that do not support hard links fat

152687
folder	directory
if you use only standard permissions make sure you chmod g+s each directory so that members of the same workgroup can have appropriate access to these folder and files they create are still owned by the workgroup and not some private group the owning user is in

152691
centos	linux
i just installed the basic linux centos 7 no desktop and am experimenting with the system

152832
wan	lan
the wi-fi connection you are on is likely over a local area network lan and the remote host is probably operating over the internet as a whole which from your mac s perspective is the wide area network wan

152832
wan	lan
the ip address you are seeing with ifconfig is almost certainly your lan address and not the wan address that the remote host needs

152832
wan	lan
you should be able to see the wan ip address of your lan

152832
wan	lan
wikipedia had nice descriptions of lan and wan that might be worth looking over

152843
sudo	passwd
gksu doesn t has an option like sudo has to pass the passwd to it in the following way

152843
sudo	passwd
echo passwd | sudo -s command

152847
sudo	passwd
both gksu and gksudo pass your passwd to sudo

152847
sudo	passwd
you ll notice that they run sudo with the -h option as well as -u and -p for username passwd and -s option to avoid a terminal

152858
debian	mint	debian	linux
this is been an issue across 3 different computers with different types of linux all debian based...ubuntu xubuntu lubuntu and mint and different video cards

152863
google-chrome	firefox
browser which i used was google-chrome in the latest stable version or firefox available in the official repositories of ubuntu 14.04

152863
folder	directory
| grep pdf in my home directory but none was found except few unimportant documents in downloads folder

152894
bsd	aix
but aix allows direct manipulation of the attributes very much like a bsd system does

152896
udp	tcp
there is no connection setup in udp before sending any packets like you have with tcp which means you only see packets if actual data gets transferred

152928
chgrp	chmod
add game to group chgrp -r game-group game-directory chmod -r g+s game-directory

152931
stdout	stderr
i think it combines stdout stderr and output it to the file is pointing to and append the multiline string to it

152933
stdout	stderr
the second part of the command means that the output of stdout and stderr both should be appended to a file whose name is in the variable

152969
subshell	ifs
no subshell or subprocess is created here so we don t need to export ifs

152986
ubuntu	linux
i really enjoy using linux though and this one aspect is really preventing me from switching completely i have a dual boot setup currently with ubuntu 14.04 and have to reboot for most lectures

153014
folder	directory
one of the best ways to get the right configuration is to copy a working configuration from the boot directory to your .config in kernel source code folder

153060
debian	linux
i m running a debian linux distribution and currently trying to establish a connection to my wireless network wpa2 security wpa_supplicant already installed

153060
ethernet	wireless
the wireless dongle connects to the network but it only responds to pings and lets me connect through ssh from another computer when the ethernet cable is plugged in

153060
ethernet	wireless
it is still reachable via wireless connection after unplugging the ethernet connection but it won t work until a connection to a wired network had been created

153061
bash	tcsh
this solution applies only to bash and not tcsh

153064
ethernet	wireless
this is strange because in every other linux mint installation i ve done wireless cards are recognized automatically i continued the installation until the end using ethernet when i logged in i couldn t turn on wi-fi

153105
kde	gnome
you did not yet specify whether you re using kde gnome or another window manger

153115
debian	linux
i m using a raspberry pi do debian linux is there a way to extract these values from the two files and add it together so that it works even if it contains a 5.00 or 66.70 or 1444.24 value

153126
bash	tcsh
the following alias for finding a file works in tcsh but not in bash

153126
put	get
when i put the above line in .bashrc and then source it i get

153129
put	get
when failing like this bash never attempts to run the command so it doesn t get put into the history

153189
packets	multicast
if no address is assigned this simply means that there is no valid address that can be used for outgoing packets so sending a packets fails nor any unicast address an incoming packets can be addressed to that the system would recognize as local so only broadcast multicast packets can be received

i group them under tcp and udp

153442

i have a specific ip 162.298.38.929 to add both by bash script into this ip.txt under tcp and udp lines so it should like this

153442

bash script should search and add the ip both under tcp and udp

153450

safest way i found has been to create a complete database dump clear var lib mysql upgrade to 10 feed the dump to the new versioning and run mysql_upgrade

i am installing this tool to debian gnu linux 7.5 x64 wheezy and when i run install_mnemosyne.sh i get this error when the pycrypto installation is running

153537
ubuntu	linux
arch linux is all about simplicity and there is no way it could be as heavy as ubuntu

153551
lzo	lz4
but it falls back to using lzo because the centos 7 kernel doesn t have the lz4 module it seems

153551
lzo	lz4
i only install updates manually and without the lz4 and lz4_compress modules nothing breaks zswap just falls back to lzo

153557
octal	decimal
however take care to specify them as octal not decimal values

i have tried to put the part between quotes into back ticks but then i just get empty files

153666
umask	mount
running unshare -m gives the calling process a private copy of its mount namespace and also unshares file system attributes so that it no longer shares its root directory current directory or umask attributes with any other process

153676
gedit	nano
both nano and gedit behave properly giving the super user write access all the time

153676

does anyone know what the source of this obnoxious behavior is on the part of emacs and vim

153677

hi i found myself with this weird issue that after installing cinnamon desktop environment on a debian-based linux distro with apt-get upgrade apt-get install cinnamon at the log-in moment even selecting cinammon or cinammon 2d the pc ends loading lxde wich was the first desktop-enviroment that i have installed

153842
put	get
if you compile that program and disassemble the output you d expect malloc to be called to get some memory the pointer returned stored somewhere probably a register the value 3 stored to that memory then 2 added to that memory maybe even requiring a load add and store then the memory copied to the stack and the also a point string i n put on the stack then the printf function called

153850
spaces	delimiter
if the whitespace between the end of the first string and the beginning of the set of digits before the pipe is a tab not a spaces the regex to set the field delimiter would be

153854
uniq	grep
bash shell scripts are generally terribly slow by themselves but for text processing purposes might be just what you need in combination with the cli tools such as grep sed awk cut sort uniq wc and others

153855
chown	sudo
sudo chown debian-transmission debian-transmission var log transmission-daemon.log

153866
bash	zsh
the is an example of ansi-c style quoting as supported by a few shells like ksh93 bash zsh mksh and freebsd sh and likely to be included in issue 8 of the single unix specification

153868
udp	tcp
however there are other devices such as dev tcp and dev udp for testing network connections which you may use from within bash scripts too

153900
bash	zsh
ksh where it originated zsh and bash are the only bourne-like shells with support for process substitution afaik

153900
bash	zsh
in that case it appears that foo s stdin is the pipe fed by echo in all of ksh zsh and bash

debian	linux
let s say i want to test root mail functionality after i set up nullmailer how do i force my debian linux system to send a root mail

centos	linux

153942
bash	zsh
note that contrary to zsh with bash it s important to remember to use the double quotes around the variables

153999
redhat	fedora
xavier posted a good summary of the overall process for a redhat fedora centos distribution

153999
sudo	passwd
ubuntu uses sudo by default and leaves the root passwd unset

154006

i implements that in c as modifiers to the string pattern allowing the ignoring of case and compacting of optional blanks

154016
ubuntu	linux
i was using windows 8 until i decided i d try to move on to linux so i installed a so-called beginner friendly distro which was ubuntu 14.04

154016
ubuntu	linux
it was really slow and after some researching i adopted the idea that ubuntu 14.04 wasn t really that stable so i decided i d download a less resource-heavy distro so i installed arch linux which is what i m using to type this now with gnome

ubuntu	linux
sorry if this seems like a duplicate post but i am ubuntu linux noob and am struggling with it a bit

i installed and configured ubuntu linux 14 for dual boot setup on my windows 8.1 machine

154068
versioning	upgrade
if instead you re trying to upgrade to a different versioning of the vmware tools there might be things here that you want the later install to have

154075
sudo	passwd
the approach you tried would have worked perfectly if each sudo did not require you to enter a passwd

154075
folder	directory
that will copy all ssdaeffer folder that are sub-folders of a directory in

i am working on a ubuntu 12.04.2 lts gnu linux 3.5.0-43-generic x86_64 machine

gnome kde or another windowing manager session manager

154189
g++	gcc
so i assume i don t have g++ but i do have gcc installed

154202
daemons	systemd
i need to run a simple daemons from systemd initrd image

154203
hid	keyboard
if the usb device itself presents a hid keyboard interface then from the point of view of the computer it is or contains a keyboard

154203
mouse	keyboard
here is one of the interfaces of my mouse for instance presenting itself as a keyboard

154206
g++	gcc
so on my computer g++ is in the package g++ and not in the package gcc

154211
rpm	yum
actually there are weak dependencies in rpm that allow for that but unfortunately those have not been added to yum and the rpm.org version that fedora rhel uses since recently and then probably only available via rawhide currently

154216
rpm	yum
because yum by default will always run a yum check to ensure consistency of rpm database and report any conflicts or missing dependencies

154236
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
ctrl + u behavior is not only controlled by the shells that have their own line editor like bash zsh tcsh sh -o emacs but also by the line discipline of the terminal driver when in canonical mode like in cat or basic implementations of sh ksh when no line-editor is enabled

154247
ubuntu	linux
but i want full linux not only nas server - for example ubuntu

debian does not seem to include a package linux headers 2.6.35-9 for the armel chipset - compiling drivers work but insmod and insmod -f is failing with a version mismatch and invalid moduel format

154260
debian	linux
could anyone point me to the debian linux headers for 2.6.35-9 please

154289
bash	zsh
with t csh bash or zsh history expansion you could write

154290
bash	zsh
in zsh you don t need double quotes except when the variable may be empty but if you set path in .profile it s processed by bin sh or bin bash

154342
ubuntu	linux
i am working on a ubuntu ubuntu 12.04.2 lts gnu linux 3.5.0-43-generic x86_64 machine

154352
spaces	delimiter
note that the column delimiter is spaces

154370
bash	zsh
with shells with support for process substitution ksh zsh bash you could do something like

154372
kde	gnome
this is the pts of the xterm or kde gnome terminal etc that you are using to run ssh

154374
debian	linux
for install linux distros on usb driver first you need to change the driver format to ext4 then install debian as it is

154387
ubuntu	linux
i was looking at the script etc init.d sudo in my ubuntu 14.04 linux system

154394
sudo	passwd
crisron the purpose of the line is to ensure that all sudo passwd from any previous instance of sudo are expired

154394
sudo	passwd
sudo then checks the time stamp on the file the next time you run it to decide whether or not to ask you for the passwd again

154394
sudo	passwd
this line ensures that when the sudo daemon is restarted all passwd must be retyped the next time a user sudos something

154398
queue	fifo
is the fifo queue just being buffered through a file

154415
freebsd	linux
i m new to freebsd coming from a linux background

154441
stdout	stderr
last the file descriptors for stderr and stdout are joined into stdout

154442
sudoers	visudo
to do this i had to add the secure_path variable to the sudoers file edit with visudo something like the following line

154451
jobs	cron
i have multiple cron jobs all run smoothly except this one

154460
ssl	https
port state service version 443 tcp open ssl https

154460
ssl	https
why does one show up as ssl https

154462
redhat	fedora
i have a redhat system and so i downloaded the fedora package and then ran the .configure make and make install to get the parallel installed in my system

154498
bash	zsh
you can also use the printf built-in command of ksh93 zsh or bash to finagle this as well

154499
bash	zsh
but works fine in both bash and zsh

154525
folder	directory
i have a folder a which has files and directory i want to move all those files and directory to another folder b except file file2 directory and directory2

154552
google-chrome	firefox
the first line above shows both firefox and google-chrome for text html but for text xml it is only google-chrome

154556
folder	dir
if you are not able to determine the one for opening the home folder or the search button just change it in there like i changed search for windows key + s and for home dir i made it windows key + h

154575
folder	dir
create empty dir some sub folder a

154580
spaces	linefeed
to avoid confusing xargs grep with file names that have spaces -print0 and -0 options will delineate each found name with a null rather than a linefeed

154586
zsh	tcsh
it is simply an implicit output redirect incidentally this doesn t work as given under tcsh zsh and probably others

154612
chgrp	chmod
most posix commands that have recursive directory traversal option ls chmod chgrp chmod cp rm have -r for that

154614
uptime	reboot
i googled around rsyslogd was huped some places suggest it means there was a reboot but i can confirm from the uptime that this is not the case

154632
stdout	stderr
i want to execute all cronjobs in the environment defined in my .zshenv and i want to redirect stdout and stderr of every cronjob to a single log file

154648
client-side	server-side
you can have server-side fonts deprecated and client-side fonts

154684
centos	linux
the second drive has linux centos 7 sda

154684
filesystems	ntfs
mount unknown filesystems type ntfs

154702
ubuntu	linux
i would like to run the elf32-i386 library libkernlib.a with a fortran 77 program on my latest ubuntu linux machine

154736
cinnamon	gnome
i am moving to cinnamon from gnome classic

154749
spaces	delimiter
also you can write names in one string with spaces delimiter

154756
bash	zsh
you can have the same in bash with shopt -s extglob or zsh with setopt kshglob

154760
jobs	cron
in particular if you want to set environment variables for both your interactive sessions and cron jobs don t use .zshenv

154760
jobs	cron
output from cron jobs is emailed to you using the local mail facility

154760
jobs	cron
i don t recommend using a log file instead because cron takes care of sending an email per job and of not sending an email from successful jobs no output return code 0

154795
ubuntu	debian
use the auto nice daemon and package on debian ubuntu

154881
debian	linux
now i have two questions instead of one are there any shell command-line based password generators known either in debian or in the more wider gnu linux world perhaps not packaged.

154901
unix	bsd
i discovered when i added the linker flag --no-undefined and explicitly linked in the pam and dl libraries that i had an undefined symbol strlcpy which exists only in bsd unix and this was preventing the library from loading

154929
stdout	stdio
it s possible maybe even likely that a stdio implementation of a which is the type of the symbols stdout and f in your code that includes its own buffer

154936
ubuntu	debian
ran into this with zimbra 7 on debian using its ubuntu packages

154938
folder	directory
i am running centos release 6.5 and the . files directory is actually a symlink to another folder that happens to be on a luster distributed filesystem

154943
gentoo	linux
i m running gentoo linux if it matters

154974
put	get
however at the gui logon screen when i click on their account and put in the password i get the spinning wheel then it goes right back out to the login screen

154981
chown	chgrp
once i ran chown and chgrp to grant them access they were able to log in from the gui

154984
dpkg	apt
package managers only know about packages that were installed using package managers such as apt and dpkg

154985
maven	pom.xml
i had similar issues reading pom.xml a maven configuration file in shell script for jenkins

155008
ubuntu	linux
i wonder how to test this in ordinary desktop linux ubuntu

155024
versioning	upgrade
it s sometimes possible to upgrade a driver on linux without rebooting but that doesn t happen often the peripheral controller by the driver can t be in use during the update and the new driver versioning has to be compatible with the running kernel

155039
filesystems	xfs
assuming the partition mounted at home user files is a unix linux filesystems such as ext4 or xfs then simply

155047
mouse	keyboard
the key problem here is that the panel does neither become an active window when you hover over it with mouse nor does it grab the keyboard

155053
dpkg	apt
edit also say i use kickstart is there a way to remove the default ubuntu repositories and just install the packages from a collection of .deb files we have locally preferably through apt rather than dpkg

155055
ansible	puppet
this is a big topic but look into puppet chef ansible cfengine salt and others

155066
ubuntu	centos
however there s not much information as to why this is necessary and i ve found that i am able to perform domain joins via net ads instead of net rpc without altering krb5.conf at all in both ubuntu 12.04 14.04 and centos 6.5

155135
ubuntu	debian
this means sysvinit-core or systemd packages on recent debian ubuntu

155159
ssdp	upnp
minissdpd keep memory of all upnp devices that announced themselves on the network through ssdp notify packets

155162
centos	linux
note em0 and em1 are also used by rhel centos and therefore scientific linux as well

155201
debian	linux
i m using an embedded linux with a debian file system and 3.10 kernel version

155219
udp	tcp
you can also use iptables to allow restrict by udp tcp ports on desired interfaces

155219
udp	tcp
for example let s introduce a rule in the filter table in the output chain to allow all traffic on tcp udp port 143 imap

155219
udp	tcp
i think imap goes over tcp but just in case i restrict also udp protocol

155261
filesystems	xfs
depending on the filesystems type the dump command name can change for instance you can have the xfsdump for the xfs

155262
temp	tmp
so instead of copying to the same file sed creates a new temporary file and copies the contents to the new temp file and then deletes the original file and renames the tmp file in sync with the original file which is one reason why the file operations are really faster

155263
vim	emacs
unlike a text editor such as emacs or vim it does not need to maintain the entire copy of the file in memory

155276
centos	linux
i have the challenge that i cannot start a centos linux server in single-user-mode but i need to change the var currently part of to a new disk

155287
debian	linux
i ve got a little turnkey linux debian squeeze vm that i use for sftp

155291
folder	directory
i need the user to find themselves in a specific directory after login and according to their privileges read write files as well as create folder where permitted

155291
folder	directory
no access to any file or directory above the user s root folder

155315
uniq	grep
but you can do it by combining other standard tools like grep sort uniq join

155315
comm	grep
here s a solution use grep with equivalent using comm

155316
redhat	fedora
this is a build service provided by fedora that allows you to upload source rpm srpm files and let the service build it for any target eg redhat centos or fedora

155326
sudo	passwd
while i could probably su using the passwd i do not know the passwd of the user don t want to change it and really should hardcode it in my script anyways so regular su without sudo isn t really an option

155327
vim	emacs
is there some way or method to store all these one-liners so i can look them easily when i need to and paste them to the command line i use vim btw not emacs so an emacs-centered solution will not really help me

155345
debian	linux
i have an xps 13 developer edition dell laptop running debian gnu linux jessie testing

155396
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have installed ubuntu 14.04 and windows 8 as a dual boot system now i want to install linux mint 17 and have a triple boot system

155406
ubuntu	mint
since you already have a grub installed by ubuntu you can either choose to not install a new one from mint and use ubuntu s or you can install mint s and overwrite ubuntu s

155406
ubuntu	mint
once the installation has finished reboot and load ubuntu mint will not appear in the list of available oss

155406
ubuntu	mint
from ubuntu refresh grub so it will detect your new mint installation

155406
ubuntu	mint
reboot and you should now have mint s grub installed and will be able to choose mint ubuntu or windows

155412
ubuntu	debian
i have been using this usr share initramfs-tools hooks rootdir file to boot ubuntu and debian from a subdirectory rather than from the root of a partition

155416
rpm	yum
as passenger does not to be included in the yum repository an attempt was done to install it using rpm although this only should be required in case of rhel 5 according the documentation

155416
rpm	yum
yum install after installing rpm

155438
put	get
in case you put there the same list of x86_32-libraries to pre-load you would get it working but all pure x86_64 runs would start complaining as well

155439
debian	linux
i am running debian gnu linux jessie testing on my laptop

155446
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
now in linux there s lxc which does look very similar to freebsd s jail or solaris zones â can you think of similar way to execute a program

155447
filesystems	ntfs
my drive uses the ntfs filesystems but ntfs was not in that list

155490
width	height
what was easily calculated is that uncompressed image did have the size of 18 3 width height pixels

155492
ubuntu	debian
note that is from my ubuntu 14.04 system but debian should be identical to this

155544
width	height
i need a command which will allow me to search a folder of images for the images with the biggest width and the biggest height

155558
ubuntu	debian
i think the debian ubuntu version of fdupes can replace duplicates with hard

155566
centos	mint	centos	linux
graphics performance is noticeably worse after updating to centos 7 from linux mint 15 where i had catalyst installed

155580
post	get
i have multiple different ips that does get post

155587
debian	linux
in some cases like debian this file isn t there either in which case creating a symlink to the file is necessary with ln -s .. generated uapi linux version.h lib modules 3.10.0-123.6.3.el7.x86_64 build include linux version.h which i don t recommend you to do

155593
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
yesterday i installed linux mint 17 on the same drive that had ubuntu 14.04

155608
bash	subshell
a subshell is another instance of bash with its own state

155608
bash	subshell
that means that any variable changes you make on the right-hand side of a | conceptually belong to a different bash instance â the existing values and declarations at the start are copied in but the variables have different storage locations and modifications to them are visible only inside that subshell you can think of this as working like fork if you like

155627
width	height
we want to sort on width or height so they should be easy to address as sort key field

155627
width	height
to output width and height as the first two columns and then the filename we use w h f n

155627
width	height
the resulting list of lines of the form w h somefile.png are then sorted numerically -n on either the first column the width or second column the height

155651
debian	linux
but when i mount this folder on a debian linux machine folders are created with drwxr-xr-x that i think is weird

155653
jobs	cron
i am having trouble regarding cron jobs i ve basically got two php scripts that i want to keep running continuously on my server

move	drag
this will spawn a new process on every cursor move and typed character and drag down vim s performance as you ve experienced

155678
stdout	stderr
merge stdout and stderr

155682
debian	linux
i ve just started trying to run such things on debian linux on another machine with 6 cores and much more ram than the jobs need

155682
daemons	systemd
also since the limits seem to vary depending on how long the daemons has been running i m not convinced that it could be such a systemd

155698
disk	ram
in windows system i can open the my computer properties and see the details like processors ram hard disk etc

155699
cpu	processors
but in ubuntu you seek for details in dashboard and you ll find your cpu with amount of logical processors clock rate per physical core gpu only the name not the memory and amount of ram

155709
spaces	delimiter
any delimiter other than a comma or single spaces will do fine

155724
kde	gnome
i can t help you with kde but in gnome there is a simple tool to get set settings of dconf â gnome setting store

155727
debian-based	ubuntu
at least on debian-based systems such as ubuntu there is a utility called xtrlock 1 available through the package repositories

155727
mouse	keyboard
this utility locks the keyboard and mouse until the password is entered while leaving windows visible

155739
hide	show
show works like apt-cache show but hide some details that people are

155748
filesystems	btrfs
i ve written a utility that does resume transfers and automatically syncs snapshots in the local btrfs filesystems to amazon s3

155777
unix	bsd
i believe that most but not all system calls cause the unix linux bsd scheduler to execute

155779
post	put
i ve already read some older post here on se and got the conclusion that the only sane way to put a variable even an array is .profile

155807
bash	zsh
while process substitution is not posix it is supported by bash ksh and zsh

155857
vmware	virtualbox
a virtualised vmware virtualbox virtualpc etc install of ubuntu inside windows would probably be enough and would be a lot more convenient in that it lets you run both at once

155868
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
other filesystems are available eg xfs or btrfs but for now stick to ext4

155899
unix	solaris
xclip and xsel are commands which are available on several linux and unix os-es but is unfortenuately not available on solaris 10

155934
switching	screens
in screens for example the shortcut ctrl + a - a has the same functiononality as alt + tab in graphical environments switching to the last screens

155935
pull	push
whether it is faster to push and pull a to from swap or close and restart it depends on the app

155958
gentoo	ubuntu
i ve tried this on gentoo and ubuntu

155969
dnf	yum
it s kind of interesting as a curiosity but for most practical purposes you really want yum or the newer dnf

155972
fastboot	adb
i suspect there is a manual method using fastboot and adb

155987
versioning	upgrade
my question is how i can get direct the valid json format after upgrade in the versioning 2.6.3

155990
post	get
i then took advice from an online post who managed to get it done with fedora by calling dhclient

156009
hash	md5
now the problem is how can i grab the encrypted md5 hash displayed to the user in the shell script

156016
ubuntu	linux
this guide shows the steps for ubuntu titled ubuntu linux tl-wn725n tp-link version 2 wifi driver install

156038
folder	directory
i was also considering the possibility that i need to have the public key inserted in the authorized_keys file inside the user s .ssh directory user .ssh besides having it in root s folder doesn t make much sense because of the value of authorizedkeysfile in sshd_config

156059
bash	zsh
you can in zsh not in bash and choroba has already pointed you to the documentation but if you want to have the redirection before you can do things like

156076
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade my fedora 17 install to a more recent versioning

156082
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon
i have gnome cinnamon and xfce installed

156098
wan	subnet
the best solution would be to use two different subnet for your network one for internal use and one for public wan use putting two interfaces in the same subnet will only cause you trouble

156101
nohup	pstree
it seems looking at pstree that the process is still under the invoking shell even with nohup or disown

156106
debian	linux
how to display contents of mounted boot and root partitions of debian on ssd drive from linux live cd

156127
put	get
if i put a blank line between .tp and the paragraph then i get one in the output

156142
bash	zsh
it took a long time for zsh and bash to be added finally giving us access to all of the exit statuses in a pipeline in addition to the for the last one that has been around since the original bourne shell

156162
unix	aix
how can i do this with unix perl aix scripting

156180
vmware	virtualbox
another alternative would be to spin up a windows vm either with virtualbox or vmware workstation

156205
bash	zsh
shells like bash and zsh expand wildcard into arguments as many arguments as match the pattern

156209
folder	directory
i have a folder with more than 30 sub directory and i want to get the list of the files which was modified after a specified date say sep 8 which is the real case and to be copied with the same tree structure with only the modified files in that folder

156218
folder	directory
i would like to upload some file but i cannot neither copy the file to root folder neither cannot change directory and then copy file

156220
disk	ram
however as i said this is also stupid because you can never be sure that linux actually cached the file in ram and even if it did you would spend time to read it in ram or on disk if it was not cached or already removed from the cache

156220
disk	ram
this way you could be much more confident that linux keeps your compressed file in ram since it s smaller and if your application is io bound loading 100mb from disk instead of loading 10gb should be much faster

156227
bash	zsh
this works in bash dash zsh ksh93 mksh .

156231
freebsd	linux
for that if on linux you can use the enhanced getopt utility from util-linux that enhanced version of the getopt command has also been ported to some other unices like freebsd

156241
stdout	stderr
i would like to use tee to pipe content from stdout and stderr respectively into files in fact append it with

156245
opensuse	linux
i am new to linux have an opensuse vm and want to list the applications installed

156250
filtering	grouping
you can choose in software managment use the filtering that you wanted for example rpm grouping

156251
daemons	systemd
the nice thing about this solution is that it removes the need to have an ftp daemons running on the remote systemd

156257
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
wmiface does not seem to come with all linux distros i didn t find a package providing it on mint or ubuntu but i was able to install it from the packages here

156266
spaces	delimiter
option -d be aware of the spaces between -d and select the null character as delimiter for read

156277
mktime	strftime
the next part we use strftime and mktime function to get the desired result

156277
mktime	strftime
strftime get the format m d y h m s and the time procedured by mktime create the desired result for us

156280
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
linux or specifically ubuntu 14.04 lts server if necessary and centos 6.5 7 minimal would be nice

156292
centos	linux
vps #1 centos release 6.5 final - linux version 2.6.32-042stab061.2 gcc version 4.4.6 20120305 red hat 4.4.6-4

156292
centos	linux
vps #2 centos release 6.5 final linux version 2.6.32-431.29.2.el6.x86_64 gcc version 4.4.7 20120313 red hat 4.4.7-4

156295
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
currently i have a bootable flash with linux mint 10 on it ubuntu bootables would not work no matter how many different ways i tried they all gave me a boot error and moved straight on to the ubuntu grub2 screens which i tried to then select the kernel and boot into ubuntu - this produced the efi error that i am no longer interested in figuring out

156295
folder	directory
dr so my main question is am i able to copy over a new etc folder to the root directory through mint and then try and boot

156300
hide	show
i want to hide show the title bar of a window with a key shortcut

156303
vmware	virtualbox
openvz is a container technology not really a virtualization technology like vmware or virtualbox

156304
ati	nvidia
nvidia ati matrox and others provide proprietary drivers for linux and then there is also an open source driver that should work with any card however open source does not provide all features of the card so if you are looking for multiple heads or 3d you may have to use the proprietary driver -- meaning the card manufacturer has control not you

156304
versioning	upgrade
an example of the drawback to proprietary you want to upgrade to a later versioning of linux but a compatible driver is not yet available

156330
execvp	vfork
when a process calls vfork the parent remains in state d as long as the child hasn t executed _exit or execve the only two authorized functions together with execve s relatives like execvp etc.

156349
xfce	gnome
this second method works in both unity and xfce and should work in gnome too

156376
switching	screens
for instance when i start eclipse luna kepler is working and switching to another task before i choose a workspace in the workspace selection dialog that appears right after the splash screens i cannot switching back to it

156407
tesseract	tessnet2
tessnet2 open source ocr tesseract .net dotnet c# vb.net c++ cli

156407
tesseract	tessnet2
tessnet2 is under apache 2 license like tesseract meaning you can use it like you want included in commercial products

156408
ubuntu	linux
i did come across this blog post titled xtree branch view aka â œflat vfsâ or flat view capability in linux ubuntu file managers

156419
centos	linux
centos is an enterprise-class linux distribution derived from sources

156434
crypt	hash
the closest i ve got is this question enable blowfish-based hash support for crypt

156442
subnet	vlan
basically put the server on it s own internal subnet and monitor traffic to that vlan then the previous script works

156442
arp	icmp
if there is no traffic to the server excluding icmp or arp during the interval of scanning i chose 1 minute

156473
debian	linux
having a look at the default users groups management on some usual linux distributions respectively archlinux and debian i m wondering two things about it and about the consequences of modifying the default setup and configuration

156478
rpm	yum
is there a way to express to rpm yum that i have built the program as source and it should move on and do the install anyways

156488
daemons	systemd
for example if you want to remove the user ftp remove the ftp daemons with your package management systemd

156488

restrict	shared
when you do ulimit -s -v 200000 that restrict virtual memory swap shared data and physical ram to a specific amount so your application won t have enough space

156554
ubuntu	linux
i am new to ubuntu linux and just installed it on my laptop which has already windows 8.1 on it

156556
kde	gnome
the x window system reference implementation server is the x.org server some examples of window managers are kde s kwin gnome s mutter and tiling window managers like i3 and dwm

156557
ethernet	wireless
however i think that what you are trying to do is bridging between your ethernet interface and your wireless interface

156568
dpkg	aptitude
i already tried reinstalling plain aptitude reinstall x every package that was listed in dpkg -s var but that didn t work

156616
folder	directory
i am trying to copy a file from inside a bunch of folder to the current directory i am in

156652
folder	directory	google-chrome	firefox
after the file has been created i d like to display the folder with the file selected similar to how google-chrome and firefox will open the directory of a downloaded file with it already selected

image-manipulation also called image-editing and photo-manipulation although not restricted to photographic image files is the changing of image files tiff png gif jpeg using some tool

156738
dpkg	apt
you can kill apt dpkg and their subprocesses at any time

156738
dpkg	apt
make sure to send a sigint or sigterm signal to apt and dpkg not a sigkill

156741
hide	show
its job is to choose where to display windows and at what size to show and hide windows to display window decorations borders title bar â etc

156775
ubuntu	debian
this includes every recent debian and ubuntu release and their derivatives as well as many other distributions

156775
bash	zsh
otherwise it s only systems that use bash as bin sh or less often zsh or even less often some others where will work in something declared to be a sh script

156785
chown	chmod
give the execution rights on this program only to user uxxd chown uxxd uxxd xxd chmod 700 xxd

156786
daemons	launchd
launchd all the usual daemons

156807
freebsd	linux	ethernet	wireless
now i want to use this linux machine to provide internet to another computer freebsd via a wired ethernet connection no wireless

156811
cpu	processors
it s a bit different in the arm world where the processors design is licensed by arm holdings to multiple cpu design houses who in turn may use multiple different foundries may produce cortex a8 type processors

156814
filtering	grouping
the simply filtering out the lines with -- that grep adds between grouping of output lines when using the -a option

156828
ubuntu	debian
update forgot to mention locally i m running rsync 3.1.0 on ubuntu 14.04 and the remote is rsync 3.0.9 on debian 7

156854
ecdsa	rsa
i installed centos 7 and noticed that i have rsa and ecdsa keys generated

156854
ecdsa	rsa
i got a new pair of rsa and ecdsa keys

156879
freebsd	linux
not sure what are freebsd alternatives variations are but linux commands for b2 tasks would be something like this

156885
bash	subshell
in bash how does one specify operator precedence aka command grouping without creating a subshell

156885
bash	subshell
in most other languages the do this but in bash this runs the commands in a subshell which discards environment changes

156885
bash	subshell
is there an operator in bash that does this besides or is there a way to tell the code inside the to not run in a subshell

156886
disk	ram
initial ram disk creator sys-kernel genkernel-next-58

156886
disk	ram
i ran genkernel initramfs in kde kterm so i could scrollback and i saw the solar theme files copied into the ram disk

156886
disk	ram
the oddest part of all is that even though all the files are copied into the ram disk correctly if i put tribar in all the appropriate files again plymouth will show tribar correctly

156924
put	get
that said put the important yet often idle processes into group with allocated 95 of cpu and your other applications into another one with allocated 5 - you ll get almost all of the power for your jobs when needed while the constantly power hungry process will only get 5 at most at those times

156931
sudoers	passwd
so then from my command line i am logged in with a sudoers user and i would like to type the alias useryyy so that my shell is now logged with useryyy and passwd is a path that only useryyy has access

156954
sudo	passwd
which works but as noted echo s passwd when sudo ing remotely .

156955
tunnel	vpn
i just set up what they call client side vpn split tunnel to achieve access to two hosts by vpn while maintaining traffic outside the vpn in this case the default route allowing access by ssh and so on

156955
tunnel	vpn
find this well written how-to that explains how to set up a split tunnel to access some hosts inside the vpn network with fixed ip addresses and keep dns and all other routes to the internet

156963
redhat	fedora
on redhat fedora centos

156969
sudo	passwd
this most likely results in two passwd prompts one for the sudo and one for the connection back into the local from root remote

157003
centos	linux
i have a linux 3.14.0 kernel centos 6.2 running on my machine but the source isn t in usr src

157005
ubuntu	linux
i have created a new user on my ubuntu linux at which i am the root

157015
ubuntu	debian
now i have a virtual machine ubuntu server 14.04 installed on a different physical server server1 also running proxmox based on debian wheezy and i want this virtual machine to access the usb modem on server4

157019
post	get
maybe this post is old however you can get the disk space with the current version sysstat-11.1.1

157038
rpm	yum
i am aware every rpm package from rpmfusion is signed with their gpg keys and yum will verify by default the integrity of every package installed from rpmfusion

157045
opensuse	linux
i have downloaded the clang for x86_64 opensuse 13.1 i am on scientific linux pre-built binary from here

157054
switching	screens
but now let s say i want to switching windows from different screens sessions from screen_session_b window_1 to screen_session_a window_1

157054
switching	screens
so i wondered if there is a more efficient way to switching between windows across different screens sessions

157060
gentoo	linux
in gentoo linux there is a etc-update tool which allow to merge config file changes interactively like that

157083
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
given these three filesystems xfs btrfs and ext4 i m wishing to

157083
xfs	btrfs
more specifically i m asking for references and data not about i ve been running with ext4 btrfs xfs for x years and have yet to see a corruption this will be flagged as out topic

157083
disk	ram
by data corruption i mean any data alteration on-disk non exhaustive possible sources of corruption disk bit flip ram bit flip cosmic rays abrupt shut-down etc.

157087
bash	subshell
one of the things i ve noticed about bash and other unix shells is that by default and when used in typical ways they spawn subshell for almost everything

157123
cpu	processors
homebrew expects an intel based cpu there are linux distros that support the altivac processors type

157130
ubuntu	opensuse
when i was opensuse with the proprietary driver my consoles also would be black now that i am using ubuntu again they get an even cooler effect don t worry the screen is fine

157172
udp	tcp
i ve looked at netcat a bit but it works on the tcp udp level while it seems i need to work at the ethernet frame level

157229
installation	upgrade
the installation succeeded on a as expected and after that i upgrade to jessie by editing etc apt sources.list and doing

157229
filesystems	btrfs
until here everything succeeded as i see a raid 1 with btrfs filesystems show containing dev sda1 alias a and dev sdb1 alias b

157229
filesystems	btrfs
the above commands btrfs filesystems show and blkid still show the same results

157231
x86	64bit	filesystems	xfs
we can assume that my writes are to a non-daft filesystems type ext-n or xfs say and that the machine is a standard 64bit linux x86 box if any of that is relevant

157243
mouse	keyboard
device and interacting with a mouse and keyboard

157250
min	max
i have been wondering what would be the best way to get good randomness in bash what would be a procedure to get a random positive integer between min and max such that

157252
centos	linux
centos linux release 7.0.1406

157253
centos	linux
setup local yum repository on centos rhel scientific linux 6.4

157258
mouse	keyboard
raspberry pi mouse and keyboard to use as a desktop

157265
centos	linux
i had in my mind that i cannot do much wrong when installing linux centos 7 after windows server 2012 r2 to get all oss as boot options

157265
ubuntu	centos
boot-repair package is only available for ubuntu not for centos

157266
integer	unsigned
it reads 4 bytes from the random device and formats them as unsigned integer between 0 and 2 32-1

157269
stdout	stderr
main question does that mean the child will inherit the parent s pipes stdout and stderr specifically

157293
minix	linux	solaris	minix
minix solaris os and linux on power all have this

157301
filesystems	btrfs
finally i checked if everything went well with the commands btrfs filesystems show blkid and btrfs fi df mnt as mentioned above in the question

157301
filesystems	btrfs
you should be able to mount a two-device btrfs raid1 filesystems with only a single device with the degraded mount option tho i believe current kernels refuse a read-write mount in that case so you ll have read-only access until you btrfs device add a second device so it can do normal raid1 mode once again

157301
filesystems	btrfs
... meanwhile since the degraded mount-opt is in fact a no-op if btrfs can actually find all components of the filesystems some people choose to simply add degraded to their standard mount options edit the grub config to add it at every boot so they don t have to worry about it

157307
ubuntu	linux
i m not sure why you don t use the ubuntu one you already have since that seems to work but you can find great information on linux on usbs at the aptly named site

157316
sudo	passwd
if i sudo administrator from the limited user s login a passwd is requested

157340
xfce	gnome
i have set the compose key correctly by typing setxkbmap -option compose rwin in xfce but before that i just flipped a switch in gnome 3

157345
unix	bsd
research unix didn t pick up the new features until 8th edition which was based directly on bsd and plan 9 reverted to separate commands ls for scripts and lc for interactive use with lc a shell script calling ls and a command mc providing multi-column output

157355
kde	gnome
recently i installed kde via yum but decided to stick with gnome

157369
daemon	cron
i m looking for a scheduler daemon like cron but with at least seconds precision so i can use it for a radio automation app

157380
unix	bsd
the reason why tcp ip sockets use file descriptors is that when the sockets interface was first designed and implemented in bsd unix in 1983 its designers felt that a network connection was analogous to a file - you can read write and close both and that it would fit well with the unix idea of everything is a file

157382
versioning	upgrade
to fix these vulnerabilities upgrade bash to a versioning that fixes cve-2014-6271 and other vulnerabilities

157387
filesystems	btrfs
there are filesystems that you can resize on the fly like btrfs

157390
ubuntu	mint
yes basically the howto s from ubuntu or mint are the same way to go in arch

157393
versioning	upgrade
i recommend however that you upgrade or downgrade to a supported ubuntu versioning 14.04 12.04 as you are missing security upgrade if you stay on 12.10

157397
comm	grep
but if you don t want to use wait you can get the pid with pgrep bsub or ps -eo pid comm | grep bsub and then you can write your own wait-until-finished routine

157400
sudo	passwd
note however that sudo will ask you for limited_user s passwd not admin_user s

157400
unix	bsd
as far as the unix bsd part of os x is concerned administrators are no different from any other user

157400
sudo	passwd
you haven t said what it was you installed or how you installed it but if it asked for a passwd then sudo was probably used

157414
versioning	upgrade
so my question is how can i only apt-get upgrade the security updates without having to update everything to the newest available versioning in debian stable

157428
put	get
one just has to ensure it doesn t get put in any of those environment variables which can modify program behavior

157448
rpm	yum
i ask because with the rpm -u upgrade command a package doesn t have to exist to upgrade install but with yum update if i m not mistaken a package must already exist

157455
spaces	delimiter
here we simply use tr to convert multiple consecutive spaces to a tab the default delimiter of cut then grep for sda3 and print the 4th field

157457
stdout	stderr
redirect stdout to file log.out then redirect stderr to stdout

157457
stdout	stderr
stdout must be redirected before stderr is redirected to stdout

157464
rpm	yum
the major differences between yum and rpm are that yum knows how to resolve dependencies and can source these additional packages when doing its work

157464
rpm	yum
both tools can perform an install and rpm will even allow you to install multiple versions simultaneously but yum will tell you that that package is already installed

157513
udp	tcp
is it possible to use it not for fastcgi server but tcp or udp server

157520
bash	subshell
if you are running a vulnerable shell then when you start a new subshell here simply by using the bash statement you will see that the arbitrary code echo pwned is immediately executed as part of its initiation

157541
folder	directory
to recursively copy all contents of folder except for the subdirectory named exclude-me into the current directory

157544
wan	lan
i am interested in testing for shellshock vulnerable machines that i don t have shell access to on my lan s and wan s such as ipmi cards and internet of things devices

157594
width	height
the script only resized and compressed the images whose width or height was larger than 640 pixels

157594
portrait	landscape
this made it work for images with dimensions like 800 x 600 landscape resizing it to 640 x 480 and dimensions like 600 x 800 portrait resizing it to 480 x 640

157605
filesystems	fat
fat filesystems don t record anything like an owner

157605
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems driver pretends that a particular user is the owner of every file either the user doing the mounting or the user given by the uid parameter

157605
filesystems	fat
fat filesystems don t record unix file permissions so the driver makes them up

157605
filesystems	fat
the main metadata of interest on a fat filesystems is the timestamps on files

157613
width	height
which i use to calculate the width of the borders and the height of the titlebar

157613
width	height	titlebar	window
does anyone know how to get the width of the window borders and the height of the titlebar in unity for ubuntu 14.04

157637
bash	subshell
so sewing all of this stuff together we can run bash as a command give it some dummy thing to do like bash -c echo this is a test and export a variable that starts with so the subshell will interpret it as a function

157680
installation	upgrade
currently the best option is to use official mysql apt repo which allows apt-get upgrade installation

157689
stdout	stderr
i run some unattended scripts and these can produce standard output and standard error lines i want to capture them in their precise order as displayed by a terminal emulator and then add a prefix like stderr and stdout to them

157689
stdout	stderr
ideally i would use asynchronous input to read these 2 streams stdout and stderr and then re-print them second my needs but order of input is crucial

157689
stdout	stderr
example program that generates mixed stdout stderr

157691
versioning	upgrade
if you can t find a binary to upgrade bash on your system you can download the source apply the patch for your versioning and recompile install the build-essential package as well as bash s build dependencies â autoconf autotools-dev quilt bison libncurses5-dev texinfo debhelper texi2html locales gettext sharutils time xz-utils dpkg-dev as of ubuntu 12.04

157695
stdout	stderr
simple wrapper that feeds both outputs of a given command to two sed instances one for stderr the other for stdout which do the tagging

157698
stdout	stderr
redirecting output from a script stdout + stderr to logfile 1 and a grep to logfile 2

157714
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu being debian derived probably use the same extra patches that debian do see here for example

157727
stdout	stderr
and this so q a titled pipe stdout and stderr to two different processes in shell script

157727
stdout	stderr
here i ve concocted an example that will write a to stdout sleeps for 10 seconds and then writes output to stderr

157727
put	get
when we put this command sequence into our construct above we get messaging as you specified

157760
debian	linux
i have got a preinstalled server debian gnu linux 7.6 wheezy where the disk space was partitioned very badly.

157769
emacs	gedit
if i create a text file by copying from different sources into emacs and then open the text file under gedit will it be the same

157769
emacs	gedit
will it be fine in emacs but not in gedit

157777
ubuntu	centos
i also noticed that my openvpn advanced settings lacks the proxies tab in centos which is available in ubuntu

157795
versioning	upgrade
to check a particular system for the vulnerabilities or see if the upgrade works you can check the bash versioning that you are using and see if the versioning is affected it probably is or there are numerous shell test scripts available on the web

157795
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade bash on lenny or etch take a look at ilya sheershoff s answer below for how to compile bash from source and manually upgrade the versioning of bash that your release is using

157798
emacs	gedit
i m not sure what version of emacs you re using but the file automatically looks right to me in emacs24 and emacs23 as well as gedit and vi without having to change any settings ubuntu 14.04

157805
versioning	upgrade
how do i upgrade bash to a newer versioning on debian 6.0 squeeze

157837
range	max
basically for a given range we can determine what the next power of two is exactly how many bits are required to represent max as a bitstring

157837
range	max	range	min	min	max
whenever we want to sample a value in an arbitrary range between min and max with possibly we can simply sample a value between 0 and max-min instead and then add min to the final result

157837
min	max
this works even if min and possibly also max are negative but we need to be careful to sample a value between 0 and the absolute value of max-min

157837
range	max
we can sample n -bit bitstrings now but we want to sample integers in a range from 0 to max uniformly at random where max may be arbitrary not necessarily a power of two

157837
min	max
finally we want to sample integers between min and max where min and max can be arbitrary even negative

157837
min	max
we want two arguments min and max or only one argument max where min defaults to 0

157837
min	max
...and finally to sample uniformly at random a value between min and max we sample a random integer between 0 and the absolute value of max-min and add min to the final result

157841
ubuntu	linux
however some cloud and telephony companies only grudgingly compile their proprietary code for linux and usually then only for a few major distros like ubuntu

157841
ubuntu	linux
are there any methods to provide compatibility for ubuntu in another distro like puppy linux when i only have whatever binary package the company provides

157844
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
uname -r shows which versioning you re running now but if you upgrade the kernel since the last reboot you ll want to uninstall that and keep the latest versioning

157844
versioning	upgrade
you should still enlarge the root partition because having two kernel packages installed is common during an upgrade the running kernel plus the latest versioning

157863
disk	ram
busybox utilities are smaller less disk space less ram but have fewer features

157866
versioning	upgrade
so does that mean i need to maintain a list of symlinks for all minor versioning below the current and update them all to point to the new library everytime i upgrade my shared lib

157870
freebsd	debian
the shellshock bug is particular to bash and doesn t affect the bourne traditional sh or almquist freebsd sh ash debian s dash and sh in newer releases or any other non- bash shell

157880
centos	linux
i have root access to a linux server centos 5.10

157900
ubuntu	linux
i was working with linux a little bit had ubuntu 10 in old laptop only for internet but i was never creating websites there so i didn t need this keyboard shortcuts like ctrl + alt + b ctrl + alt + w | etc

157917
debian	linux
i have updated apt-get upgrade my system debian gnu linux 7.6 wheezy but for problem with disk space operation failed

157933
unix	bsd
it work on windows macos and other unix oses such as linux bsd and so on

157950
kde	cinnamon
so now im wondering as i plan to install mint cinnamon would i replace the kde with

157950
kde	gnome
gnome and would i be able to install a kde application on gnome

157950
cinnamon	gnome
cinnamon is basically a custom gnome 3.x right

157951
kate	kde
of course on first installation of kde application such as k3b apt-get first installs some basic dependencies for following installations such as kmail or kate apt-get doen t need to re-install the same dependencies

157957
bash	subshell
the learning bash book mentions that a subshell will inherit only environment variables and file descriptors etc. and that it will not inherit variables that are not exported

157957
bash	subshell
i tried to use strace to figure out how this happens and surprisingly i found that bash will use the same arguments for the clone system call so this means that both the forked process in and . file should have the same process address space of the parent so why in the case is the varible visible to the subshell and the same does not happen for the . file case although the same arguments is based on the clone system call

157962
zsh	subshell
other constructs that create a subshell include command substitution and pipes command3 | command4 command3 runs in a subshell command4 runs in a subshell in most shells but not in ksh or zsh

157962
bash	subshell
before executing the code in the subshell bash sets the variable bashpid to the process id of the child process

158001
switching	screens
in any case i recommend switching from screens to tmux and you can use this question to learn how to run a command and leave it after it exit

158006
disk	ram
disk on ram â playing with block drivers

158016
jobs	cron
required in order to run cron jobs as that user and perhaps also by some scripts if they use su -c to run as this user

158016
jobs	cron
check for cron jobs belonging to psql

158037
ubuntu	linux
linux kernel 3.2.0-64-generic here ubuntu lts if someone is wondering about kernel options modules

158052
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
by default all installation and upgrade for your mysql server and the other required components come from the release series of the major versioning you have selected during the installation of the configuration package see adding the mysql apt repository

158058
google-chrome	firefox
i typically have at least 15 browser windows open mostly firefox-nightly but also standard 12.04 firefox and google-chrome

158058
google-chrome	firefox
neither firefox nor google-chrome save the extra ewmh information that is needed for restoration to the original workspace

158058
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	google-chrome	firefox
is there is a workspace desktop-manager that doesn t have this restore-all-to-one-workspace behaviour with firefox and google-chrome preferably on for ubuntu or linux mint

158058
google-chrome	firefox
or is there another way to enhance firefox and google-chrome add-on to enforce this behaviour

158058
mouse	keyboard
â¹ a third 1200x1920 monitor is on a separate machine with x2vnc used to share a single mouse and keyboard

158065
google-chrome	firefox
there doesn t seem to much motivation to implement some ewmh support in firefox nor in google-chrome even though this would get the restoration to workspace issue resolved with a large number of desktops

158065
google-chrome	firefox
a bug has been open for firefox since 2007 and one for google-chrome since 2009

158065
google-chrome	firefox
what you can do outside of firefox and google-chrome if the active tabs in different browser windows point to different urls is to use tendency that different urls usually have different titles associated with the pages and hence with the window in which they are displayed

158065
width	height
width and height of window

158109
ubuntu	linux
i am using trisquel gnu linux 6.0.1 a modified version of ubuntu on the xfce desktop environment

158115
debian	linux	bluetooth	usb
i ve just purchased a usb bluetooth adapter for my computer the brand is insignia and i was wondering if it s possible to use it on debian kali linux

158143
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu 12.04 â œpreciseâ and 14.04 â œtrustyâ debian 7 â œwheezyâ

158151
google-chrome	firefox
when dragging a tab from firefox to google-chrome chromium or the other way why is it not accepted by the other browser

158151
google-chrome	firefox
start writing patches for firefox and google-chrome chromium while crossing the fingers that the patches would both be possible to write and be accepted

158152
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome use different rendering engines therefore it would be that there is no simple dropping

158183
put	get
you can put | tr -d on the end of the pipe if you really want to get rid of the colon

158196
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
man module includes the sentence â œthe sh csh tcsh bash ksh and zsh shells are supported by modulecmd.â this is confirmed by

158206
children	parent
thus there is a parent process which monitors its children and if one dies it gets respawned by the parent

158208
stdout	stderr
i m trying to run a command as root via sudo on a remote server and capture stdout but not stderr into a file

158208
stdout	stderr
i added -t so that ssh allocates a tty but then root-file.tar.gz gets the output from sudo and gzip but i can --force so i guess it s capturing remote stdout and stderr into local stdout

158209
sudo	passwd
you can pass the -s option 0 to sudo so it can accept the passwd from stdin instead of requiring a tty

158209
sudo	passwd
0 from the manpage the â s stdin option causes sudo to read the passwd from the standard input instead of the terminal device

158227
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
is there perhaps a way to remote control google-chrome firefox or opera or x itself through scripting

158231
installation	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade my ubuntu installation so i can begin working with mod_mono for apache

158233
dlsym	dlopen
a program could also use dlopen dlsym to call a standard-library function and it could get the name to call from a file a command-line argument standard input a network socket or after some lengthy computation

158239
comm	grep
comm will probably have a performance benefit over grep since it takes the sortedness into account.

158248
subnet	packets
so i masquerade all outgoing packets that leave the host with ip from the guest subnet

158250
x86	64bit
technically i686 is actually a 32-bit instruction set part of the x86 family line while x86_64 is a 64bit instruction set also referred to as amd64

158251
splinter	selenium
if the web interface uses javascript and cannot function without it then you should use selenium directly in your programming language of choice or if you are using python you can also use an abstraction layer like splinter

158254
awk	ksh
and i want to find some bash ksh sh awk scripts that can do the job the same as the perl script do

158255
icmp	udp
everything works correctly if the packet comes from a normal nic eth0 etc. but packets that travel on the loopback interface lo for example packets generated with socat -u - udp localhost 10000 seem to skip the routing decision after the prerouting chain and get received by the local host which in fact replies with an icmp port unreachable packet over the lo interface

158257
filtering	grouping
is it possible to filtering the multiple match menu based on things like position or active syntax grouping

158271
yacc	bison
for etch i ve followed the same logic but i haven t got yacc installed on the system so i had to install bison package for that

158296
vmware	virtualbox
i tried installing debian wheezy on both virtualbox and vmware but i incur everytime in the same error failure trying to run chroot target mount -t proc proc proc

158299
xfce	kde
eventually i found things indicating that gnome2 is no longer really supported and that i should use something else mate xfce kde whatever instead

158313
bash	zsh
and in case i have to put this in .profile how can i keep the fancy shell in other shells like bash and zsh

158314
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
if you want a fancy prompt use a shell designed for interactive use zsh fish or at least bash

158322
ubuntu	centos
i have previously used ubuntu but there were other problems so i switched to centos

158336
freebsd	linux
i ve decided to build a nas running some form of linux probably freebsd or even freenas with snapraid for redundancy

158337
udp	tcp
complementing the previous answer try to add a rule that allow traffic udp like the previous answer and tcp connection like this

158368
centos	linux
in centos rhel oracle linux

158400
crypt	md5
encrypted password is no longer crypt 3 or md5 type 1 format

158416
sudo	passwd
this passwd is cumbersome to enter when authenticating with sudo repeatedly

158416
sudo	passwd
can i authenticate with sudo using a passwd other than the one associated with my user account or enable sudo with no passwd authentication altogether

158417
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
you can edit the file etc sudoers with your editor of choice or just execute visudo and add the line to allow your specific user to use the sudo command without passwd

158425
sudoers	visudo
you will also need to tell sudo not to drop the ssh_auth_sock environment variable by adding the following to etc sudoers via visudo

158425
sudo	passwd
you d probably also want to add the -t switch to ssh-add with suitable short lifetime when adding the key to have ssh-agent mimic the default sudo behavior of prompting for passwd confirmation if a certain time has passed since it was last entered or even use the -c switch to trigger passwd confirmation each time the key is used for authentication

158463
unix	bsd
no unix linux or bsd i ve tried has a system call relating to home directory

158465
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
if it is feasible to enable the root account on your ubuntu system you can configure sudo to prompt for the root passwd instead of the passwd of the invoking user by adding the following to etc sudoers using visudo

158465
sudo	passwd
even if you want to enable authentication with the root passwd for sudo you can keep root logins disabled on local console devices by emptying or commenting out everything in etc securetty

158474
sudo	passwd
why don t you just relax having to put the passwd in by altering sudo s behavior like so

158474
sudo	passwd
between the time you put it in and the three hour limit typing sudo some command will not result in being asked for your passwd until the limit expires

158490
xen	openvz
type of virtualization solution or one of qemu kvm vmware microsoft oracle xen bochs chroot uml openvz lxc

158493
jobs	cron
i have also got the cron jobs sorted out that will run it for me

158493
redhat	fedora
to progress further and using the recommendations in a practical guide to fedora and redhat by mark sobell 7th edition page 607 and other sources i want to refine it to include home var usr local and etc

158523
fish	zsh
the best way to get completion in dash is to run exec zsh or exec fish

158532
ubuntu	debian
works for ubuntu package manager to i have used it on debian and ubuntu and it worked both times

158532
ubuntu	debian
i have used this on debian and ubuntu and it has worked for me

158533
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
on many unix variants including linux and solaris the setgid bit on a directory controls whether files created in that directory inherit the directory s group id bsd semantics used when the setgid bit is set or the process s effective group id system v semantics used when the setgid bit is clear

158535
client-side	server-side
most software only handles one of the sides client-side sending the request and reading the reply for web browsers and tools like wget server-side listening to requests and replying to them for web servers

158542
vmware	virtualbox
it typically depends on your virtualization technology vmware virtualbox kvm etc.

158562
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
it also doesn t support protocols other than tcp and udp - so for example ping and other icmp utilities won t work

158567
installation	upgrade
i just tried to upgrade the python installation on my centos machine

158610
ubuntu	debian
i tried this on ubuntu 14.04 and it works well there so why doesn t it work on debian

158663
debian	linux
when using linux debian i often use dd to copy a disk image to an sd card

158671

aren t there any iptables magics that can be used to redirect for given domain to https - preserving the original https get or post etc

158673
centos	linux
i would like the hostname command to show the fqdn by default on centos linux

158687
debian	linux
i have a laptop that runs debian jessie with only the linux console - no x server installed

the issue is related to hid that the mouse is passing is being treated as a keyboard

158724
put	get
actually whatever i put in this rootfstype field i get the same error

158744
ubuntu	debian
at first i tried debian then moved onto elementary os and now i m at kubuntu figuring that ubuntu had more of its software up-to-date so it should be able to play sound on my system

158796
versioning	upgrade
since i have upgrade mysql to 5.4 and rddtool to 1.4.8 and tried a different cacti versioning also

158799
versioning	upgrade
the dateformat option was introduced in versioning 3.7.7 so you ll need to upgrade

158799
versioning	upgrade
even apart from this i d definitely recommend that you upgrade the server to a more recent versioning of sles too as soon as possible - while it s not quite eol yet there won t be any more service packs and it is getting close to the end of its life cycle...

158801
ubuntu	mint
since mint 16 is based on ubuntu 13.10 the same advice as deim0s gave for ubuntu applies for you

158863
screens	tablet
i m holding out for the thinkpad helix 2 which has a detachable tablet as a screens

158863
ubuntu	linux
would i likely be able to use this computer to its fullest with ubuntu or better yet some customized arch linux installation

158896

mouse	keyboard
the mouse and keyboard still work but nothing appears on the desktop

158903
asterisk	pbx
i want to configure a pbx yate or asterisk or sip witch so that when i m away it takes the call and tells the caller i m not home but when i m home it forwards the call to my phone which i connect via sip-account

158908
mouse	keyboard
having the screen fade out is easy enough with xautolock but i can t figure out a way to have to fade back in when i do a keyboard or mouse action

158918
bash	zsh
zsh as of 3.1.6 has bash s var #old new and # or inside a parameter in other words var old new where old begins with a # treats that as an ordinary character in zsh unlike bash

158979
debian	linux
i am a not a experienced linux user admin but last week i acquired a raspberry and installed on it a raspbmc based on debian distro

158986
sysv	systemd
on debian you will have sysv scripts upstart jobs and systemd services all installed at once

158986
sysv	systemd
with upstart and systemd the jobs services will be used if available and the sysv scripts will be run if no upstart or systemd jobs services are available

159016
kde	gnome
i like handling most things from the command line so gnome and kde always seem to get in my way more than i like

159024
sudoers	passwd
it always ask for passwd only once even when i set in etc sudoers file

159036
dpkg	apt
the version is important for dpkg apt so you must use one even a fake if tomorrow a package with the same name enter the distro the one with the newer version will be installed

159062
bluetooth	usb
do not use this tag to indicate physical device such as usb bluetooth dongle usb bleutooth or pci devices pci

159079
stdout	stderr
2 1 redirects stdout to stderr

159083

159155
daemons	systemd
init is the first daemons process spawned during the boot sequence of a unix systemd

159159
versioning	upgrade
dpkg will upgrade the first package to a newer versioning that no longer provides the file before it installs the second package if the second package specifies a conflicts breaks and a replaces relationship to the first package

159160
bash	zsh
both mksh and zsh are shells that support a lot of gnu bash -specific extensions but there are always some that are not understood

159160
bash	zsh
zsh supports more stuff but only in its native zsh mode which is not compatible with posix shells such as gnu bash at t ksh93 mksh

159229

as dopeghoti mentions sudo asks for your user passwd not the root passwd

159404

this is a shorthand for in bash and zsh

159514
bash	zsh
ksh bash and zsh also support to fall through to the next case and not in att ksh to go on and test subsequent cases

sudo	passwd
anyone not authorized to access another user s account would not be given the root passwd and would not have sudo definitions allowing it

159614
sudo	passwd
this all makes sense until you look at something like this link which is a tutorial for using sudo -v and then sudo su - to become root using only your own passwd

159617
sudo	passwd
with su the user must know the root passwd which should be a closely guarded secret while with sudo the user uses his her own passwd

159617
sudoers	visudo
warning always use the visudo command to edit the sudoers file as it checks your edits for you and tries to save you from the embarrassing situation where a misconfigured file due to a syntax error stops you from using sudo to edit any errors

159617
ubuntu	debian
this is especially true on debian ubuntu and variants where the root account is disabled by default

159638
for-loop	loops
a bash for-loop when not given anything to loops on loops over all the command-line arguments

159670

159670
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you can become any user with sudo too with your own passwd provided that the rules in etc sudoers are set up to allow you to

159670

sudo lets you restrict the command a user can run tho yes and prevents you from having to disclose the passwd of specific users or even not having a passwd at all on specific users disallowing regular logins

159670
sudo	passwd
anyone not authorized to access another user s account would not be given the root passwd and would not have sudo definitions allowing it

159815
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
e.g. gnome xfce kde fvwm whatever.

159817

on earlier installs this problem was solved using this solution but it doesn t seem to have any effect on later versions of mint ubuntu

159889
daemons	systemd
but there s a systemd way of doing it as well as long as you are running the systemd-logind daemons or something that provides the same api

159924
sudo	passwd
this has the advantage of not disclosing the root passwd and logging anytime anybody activates their sudo privs and for what command

these files would be sourced when users logged in using any bourne style shells such as zsh or bash or a csh

159947

â¹ i used sudo myself as early as the 80s before linux was first released let alone debian

159970

you should to try to rebuild the catalog file b-tree on the specified filesystems which is hfs+ by specifying -r option for fsck for example

160135
bash	zsh
note it works with bash ksh93 and zsh

160135
bash	zsh
concerning the performance the eval solution is much faster with bash 4.3.30 but the other solution is faster with ksh 93u+ and zsh 5.0.6 ksh93 and zsh being much faster than bash in both cases

160180
put	get
when i put it in an if statement i get some problems

160194
kde	gnome
i was curious so i installed kde alongside gnome which i use primarily for the matter

160200
unix	aix
is it possible to send attachment from unix aix without using uuencode and mute command

-partition and everything for linux centos

160246
ubuntu	linux
i m puzzled by the hash ascii code stored under linux ubuntu etc shadow

160327
range	minimum
since you want to allow the range 0â 4 test that is more than the minimum value and less than the maximum value

160328
versioning	upgrade
when a security hole is found it is standard practice to patch just this hole and not to upgrade the program to a later versioning which may turn out to be incompatible in subtle cases

160332
traceroute	packets
i have used the -i and -t handles as default traceroute over udp returns does the above output mean that packets go straight from 10.0.2.2 to 172.19.156.1

160374
ubuntu	debian
based off kondybas s answer an ubuntu debian specific answer is to change the follow lines in etc exim4 conf.d main 01_exim4-config_listmacrosdefs to read

clearing my cinnamon gnome settings

160469
ubuntu	linux
i d like to run the command on ubuntu 14.04 with linux 3.13 and handle sparse file disk images with it on any filesystem supporting sparse file at least the solution shouldn t be bound to one specific file system

160474
stdout	stderr
but how can i copy both stderr and stdout 1 and 2 to file descriptor 6

160477
stdout	stderr
redirect stdout to 6 and stderr to stdout so it will be further redirected to 6

160512
put	get
the way the system is put together integrated depends on the needs of the people who will be using it so you get differences between the distributions

160512
daemons	systemd
so is the configuration for how systemd services like daemons are started as well as configuration for other things like networking and security policy

160515
filesystems	fat
but the files in the fat filesystems probably constitute a runnable

160563
bash	zsh
reasonably up-to-date versions of ksh93 bash and zsh calculate the length in characters according to the value of lc_ctype at the time the construct is expanded

160585
rpm	yum
i am curious to why after packing into an rpm when it tries to install using yum or rpm it gives an error on the xterm line saying it can t find xterm

160605
ubuntu	freebsd
the only way how to do it is either you configure that ubuntu like a router or you just get a wifi adapter that is supported under freebsd and connect the freebsd machine to the wifi as just another wifi client
