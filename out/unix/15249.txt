furthermore a system installation might be moved to new hardware if the old hardware failed or had to be upgrade

161754
mp4	webm
so far - whether webm or mp4 - the first alternate stream is the highest quality offered per video - usually 720p .mp4 - which is what i m looking for anyway and so there s no logic here for selecting others

161763
kde	gnome
different menus have different groups and prefer different applications â â for example when there is a gnome application and a kde application with a similar purpose the kde menu will typically show only the kde application while the gnome menu will show only the gnome application

for some filesystems like ext4 or btrfs on linux you can use filefrag to get the offsets of the data segments for the file on the block device the filesystems is on

161927
disk	ram
that volume may have physical volumes on disk on partitions on raid arrays on files on ram on network block devices.

161940
dpkg	apt
one place where the list of packages is also saved is var lib apt extended_states at least if you ve only ever used apt to install packages as opposed to dpkg directly â â use that file instead of var lib dpkg status int the command above

consider a parent process which completes a socket bind accept and will fork children with that socket open for them to communicate with while the parent continues accepting connections

162021
stdout	stderr
you are redirecting your outputs both stdout out and stderr 2 1 means redirect errors to where stdout points to to a file called out

162021
stdout	stderr
since both stdout and stderr gets written to a file called out nothing gets piped to the tee command

for ubuntu linux users you can install makemkv from the ppa heyarje makemkv-beta ppa

162110
spaces	delimiter
it doesn t delimit on anything other than the original spaces delimiter in your sample and i originally wrote it to handle separated arg arrays - and so provided that delimiter is solid fields of any reasonable length containing most any character but the delimiter should all work just as well

162130
xfce	kde
kde was my dm and i remove kde and xfce in turn for lxde which i had installed. when i boot i boot into the command line and have to login with no gui

this is ssh s own custom transport layer it does not use the same one that https ssl uses

162171
ubuntu	linux
i have learned that ubuntu supplies the drivers for this realtek chip as standard but i know that beaglebone uses a different type of linux

162207
udp	tcp
of course in real life i more care about latency of real traffic such as tcp udp but i m using ping as a first step

162207

probably ping show same numbers because it simple but on real tcp udp traffic linux will be much faster

162208
integer	fractions
the number can be an integer or fractions

162210
versioning	upgrade
means that you have a readline-devel package installed of versioning 5.0.9 and the ptf you are trying to install would upgrade the main package only and not the -devel one as well

otherwise supposing you are upgrading from one debian release to the next or even from debian stable to debian testing your kernel versioning will not automatically be upgrade aside from minor debian-specific upgrade for security reasons

162334
vte	fontconfig
another library in between vte and fontconfig is pango ...a library for laying out and rendering of text with an emphasis on internationalization...

162334
vte	fontconfig
i guess vte relies on pango to render strings with appropriate fonts while pango uses fontconfig or other supported font backend to find the most appropriate font based on various pieced of logic in pango itself and or the backend

162546
filesystems	btrfs
i created 4 devices 20gb each and created a btrfs filesystems using the option

162548
freebsd	netbsd
the same approach can be used to create dynamic variable names in shell scripts the netbsd rcng system uses this quite widely especially in scripts controlling network interfaces where the number of network adapter designations in netbsd and freebsd make it impractical to explicitly code for each one

switching	screens	mouse	keyboard
today they called me up saying there s no display and sure enough -- after the splash screens the display actually turns off as in the green light goes yellow and i can t even switching to a tty to log in and check dmesg -- because the keyboard and mouse have no power

bash	tcsh
in your example you re using turbo c shell tcsh however you re then mixing in bash bourne shell commands and syntaxes

162617
put	get
also don t get greedy at trying to get a faster data throughput read rate as my attempt at trying many parameters and different block sizes almost left me with a completely dead hard rive that will stop working in over 1 second after power cycling it that was 5 days ago but thankfully it just started once again showing sign of life initially reading at 2 000 bs yes bytes per second a little less than 2kbps i was very disappointed but after canceling ddrescue with ctrl + c and just restarting it once again in reverse with the -r parameter added then speed went back to 630 before i was reading forward at 930 kbps at least i am content that i am doing 630 kbps in reverse and not having to put off with 2kbps so if you get a success at any read speed like in the 500 kbps range stick with it and don t try anything to push speeds any higher it may be your last successful attempt at gaining any read speed

rpm	yum
the rpm s are out for rhel 6|7 and siblings centos et al. and available via yum at most repositories

on ubuntu 12.04 in gnome classic mode i have a custom application launcher that launches a small script drop_on_me whenever i drag and drop a url from the address bar in firefox or google-chrome onto it.â¹ i drag the url by clicking the identity icon next to the url

162667
google-chrome	firefox
when you drag a url from google-chrome to the firefox icon on the taskbar firefox doesn t start let alone start and display the url dragged on it

162667

i have looked at extending the context menu when clicking on the address bar but that would require different implementations for firefox and google-chrome and that in javascript as well.â²

disk	ram
manual says it all pm-suspend-hybrid basically do both suspend and hibernate saves system state to ram and to disk

162890
disk	ram
the only drawback is that saving state to both ram and disk is obviously a little bit slower

162907

that is true for apache dovecot and postfix

162955
spaces	delimiter
i have a txt file of data delimiter by a spaces of 7 columns by 10000 rows

162959
sudo	passwd
the only problem we can see that if a user has sudo permissions for a command then it will need to have the nopasswd set in sudo since the users passwd has to be given if using sudo

162961
put	get
regardless of the flag the problem is that when this ssh command executes all other scripts and processes which are supposed to be running get put on hold because of the tty which does not allow the script to exit until the connection is broken

162983
chown	chmod
run chown and chmod to fix permission problems replace user group with your actual username and groupname

turnkey linux is currently based on debian v13.x is based on debian wheezy

163109
disk	ram
whether to ram or to disk

163127
mouse	keyboard
the system uses the deadline i o scheduler but this should not matter at all since mouse and keyboard i o should not compete with disk i o

163127
mouse	keyboard
for comparison even windows xp does not freeze mouse and keyboard and you can actually do something to kill the offending process

163142
bonjour	avahi
avahi is the opensource implementation of bonjour zeroconf

163152

disjoint set isn t available in ruby standard library so i emulate it using a ruby hash known elsewhere as associative array dictionary map

163192
ubuntu	yosemite
i was using both os x mavericks and ubuntu but after upgrading to os x yosemite i can t see the boot menu

163195
debian	linux
is it possible to export linux specifically debian applications into a single file or as files in a single folder just as windows applications are organized

163200
debian	mint	debian	linux
since you re using linux mint and presumably linux mint debian edition i wouldn t do it since the next major release completely breaks with your current installation

163208
openssl	libcrypto	openssl	gnutls	libcrypto	libcurl	gnutls	libcrypto	gnutls	libcurl
socat requires openssl s libssl and libcrypto for ssl support wget and libcurl require either openssl or gnutls

163208
hex	binary
take the leading 5 bytes of hex on the line starting with 0000 this is the ssl record header that the next hex chunk omits and then take the entire hex chunk after the line ssl 3.0 handshake and convert the lot to a binary file using xxd as above

163234
tunnel	wan
do i need to add specific firewall entries in addition to the configuration provided by csf or am i experiencing problems because ipv6 connectivity is coming over a tunnel interface and then being accessed via the wan eth0

163242
x86	mips	x86	64bit
the precompiled binary you will find in an ubuntu system knows about x86 possibly both 32-bit and 64bit modes but not mips

163242
toolchain	binutils
in my debian machine it produces the output as mips and i also do not have any binutils or cross-compiler toolchain installed in the machine

163246
hash	md5
anyway here s a little idea using find and md5 hash

163246
hash	md5
each file can be associated with a md5 hash obtained through md5sum file

163246
hash	md5
therefore i can monitor file changes by monitoring md5 hash changes

163246
hash	md5
basically i am using a md5.sum file to store all md5 hash associated with tex files

163246
hash	md5
when a file is modified its hash changes and therefore is no longer the same as in the md5 file

163246
hash	md5
when this happens the script calls pdflatex and updates the new md5 hash

163263

163352
jobs	cron
disable email by default cron jobs sends an email to the user account executing the cronjob

163356
stdout	stderr
to redirect both stderr and stdout to file you should use the form

163356
stdout	stderr
briefly all stderr and stdout messages will be redirect to dev null

163357
stdout	stderr
then stderr is then being redirected into stdout therefore both stdout and stderr will go to dev null

163360
stdout	stderr
means a redirection of the chanel 2 stderr to the chanel 1 stdout

163362
stdout	stderr
is asking to direct all the stderr as stdout ie

163362
stdout	stderr
since stderr is now going to stdout because of both stderr and stdout ends up in the blackhole dev null

163364
ubuntu	debian
as far as i can tell it is only current for debian derived distros such as ubuntu

163369
sudoers	visudo
see the man pages sudoers 5 sudo 8 and visudo 8 for the complete documentation

163373
bash	zsh
now to the syntax this is specific to the bourne shell language and its derivatives such as bash zsh and so on

163389
daemons	systemd
if you create a daemons setting it up to run on systemd boot is trivial

163400
configure	libtool
now again do configure on btsco and copy libtool executeable from libtool dir to btsco

163403
rpm	yum
this makes me think that the rpm command simply adds the vlc rpm to the yum repo and then we do a yum to do the install

163412
rpm	yum
rpm command simply adds the vlc rpm to the yum repo .

163412
rpm	yum
i think the package installed using rpm adds the rpm fusion repository after which yum can install packages from that repository

163412
rpm	yum
vlc is available in the rpm fusion repository but not in the official repositories for fedora i presume so unless you add this repository yum list won t show anything for vlc

163422
stdout	stderr
the -cs tells perl that stdin stdout and stderr are all unicode

163448
put	get
anyone who has been sed ing for a while will have learned to rely on the n ewline character - because the only way to get one is to explicitly put it there

163463
folder	directory
directory in my parent folder

163468
stdout	stderr
it s possible that the output is being sent to stderr which is not captured by the operator which only captures stdout

163468
stdout	stderr
instead if you are using the bash shell try routing stderr to stdout and into a file using the operator

chown	chmod
is there any chown or chmod command which i can run on my linux live recovery mod is read-only to correct that partion permission although i checked them all their owner is root

163553
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
on my debian server when a user who does not have any rights in the sudoers file or any include dirs calls sudo -l he gets the standard responsibility header and is prompted for his passwd

163553

is it possible to allow all users on a system to call the sudo -l command without needing to specify their passwd

163560
sudoers	visudo
edit the sudoers file with visudo and add a line like this

163583

solaris	netbsd
dtrace should work on solaris free netbsd and linux

163700
ubuntu	centos
on a centos 6.5 host i have a couple of guests - ubuntu 12.04 and centos 6.5

163742
post	get
the method i post below used to work fine on my old computer but now i m on a different computer using red hat centos release 6.5 i get error messages

163747
disk	ram
under the assumption that disk i o and free ram is a bottleneck while cpu time is not the limitation does a tool exist that can calculate multiple message digests at once

163751
kde	kubuntu
is there a way to get a similar detailed gui outside of kubuntu without installing the entire kde desktop environment

163755
opera	firefox
tested under firefox opera

163770
ubuntu	linux
now given that it s certified for a particular version of ubuntu you could try installing that version purely to confirm if the system is having a hardware issue or if there have been changes made to either the linux kernel and or driver s in newer versions which are rendering it not compatible with your system

163784
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh you can do

163787
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loop to loops over the individual files and then use tee

163787
bash	zsh
combined with process substitution works in bash and zsh among others to

163830
kde	gnome
gnome kde ...

163832
sudoers	passwd
set up etc sudoers to allow you to run the iptables command with no passwd or only run it as root

163838
mouse	keyboard
after still being able to listen to the video for about 3 minutes after the desktop froze unresponsive to mouse and keyboard it then started to loop the last second and about half a minute later crashed entirely

163869
ubuntu	linux
i m an ubuntu user testing out arch linux

163871
debian-based	linux
i m running a debian-based vps linux vps 2.6.32-042stab092.3 #1 smp sun jul 20 13 27 24 msk 2014 x86_64 gnu linux which is behaving a bit strange

163900
udp	tcp
i assume i would only need to do this with tcp connections as udp would be connectionless.

163906
folder	directory
the first two are pretty simple to understand this is creating an alias in bash that recursively lists the files and folder beneath the current directory

163909
antivirus	norton
i learned that this is common and the fix was to disable norton antivirus protection while unpacking the archives then enable it again and scan after the install

163911
rmdir	chown
my searching and attempts with chown rmdir and rm -r have not helped yet

163913
spaces	linefeed
let the shell eat the unwanted linefeed and following spaces

163917
daemons	systemd
so the cause appears to not be the cron job itself but the fact that for the 24 hours leading up to the cron job the systemd activity daemons is not writing to the log correctly

163922
redhat	fedora
i m currently helping a professor who is having trouble installing a particular software onto the school s server which runs on redhat fedora

163922
redhat	fedora
the professor thinks that the software was packaged for ubuntu which distributes files together rather than into multiple folders which apparently is what redhat fedora does correct me if i m wrong

163922
redhat	fedora
is there a way to distribute software on redhat fedora in a similar fashion as ubuntu

163926
ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora
i think you are mixing things called tar-balls when referring to multiple folders with regular installation packages files ending in .deb on debian ubuntu and in .rpm on redhat fedora suse

163936
awk	ksh
and btw this is pure awk solution nothing to do with ksh or any other shell

163959
stdout	stderr
most tools if they can t write to stdout because for instance it s not open will report an error message on stderr in the language of the user which means extra processing to open and parse localisation files... so it will be significantly less efficient and possibly cause the program to fail

163959
stdout	stderr
it can only be more efficient if the program gives up writing to stdout stderr after the first failing write system call but programs generally don t do that

163961
debian	linux
i want to dual boot pc-bsd 10.3 with zfs as the root file system the only file system with debian 7 crunchbang linux with ext4 using grub2 boot loader installed in mbr and grub is managed by the debian

163961
freebsd	debian
all the documents are dealing with dual booting pc-bsd freebsd using ufs2 file system and debian how do i add pc bsd freebsd to grub 2 boot loader

163962
width	height
without it the aspect ratio is preserved and the given size are maximum dimensions for width and height

163976
pthreads	fork
this behavior is not guaranteed by pthreads or other standards other implementations may do different things up to and including simply implementing vfork with a plain fork

163979
min	max
for comparison for a file of 2.3 gib min avg max sd secs for n 10

163998
bash	zsh
here are a few bash solutions some of which should also work in other shells like zsh

164014
chown	chmod
so either you make a copy of your interpreter set the capabilities you want on it also check that nobody can access it through chmod chown and call this copied interpreter in your shebang

164017
stdout	stderr
now redirecting stdout and stderr of main function to tee

164018
ethernet	wireless
- ethernet or wireless

164018
ethernet	wireless
- tried it with brothers notebook with windows 8.1 ethernet and wireless

164039
traceroute	packets
after that do traceroute to see what is the exact cause for the slowness packets drop

164053
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
time stamp is updated and the user may then use sudo without a passwd for a short period of time 5 minutes unless overridden in sudoers

164059
kde	gnome
dvd1 should include far more i think all three lxde gnome and kde

164062
google-chrome	firefox
for example when i m on firefox address bar or google-chrome address bar and press alt + ctrl + n it inserts .net at current position

164088
ubuntu	linux
solved the problem by installing bodhi linux rc1 and updating to ubuntu 14.04

164094
jobs	cron
this also works for at jobs as theyâ re usually just handed to cron anyway

164101
versioning	upgrade
i don t see the point why distros instead of building new versioning don t have a unique versioning which continously provide upgrade for the linux kernel desktop environment software packages etc

164101
versioning	upgrade
for instance new distros versioning release notes feature new software versioning like gcc or gnome but they could have been upgrade in a previous versioning so what is the point

164105
jobs	cron
iâ ve investigated the source as to how cron handles mailing the output from its jobs

164105
stdout	stderr
cron 8 sets up stdout and stderr of the running job and pipes it directly into mail 1 not leaving any temporary files

164107
ubuntu	debian
i am using this bash version on ubuntu 12.04 i ve also seen this in arch and debian

164120
ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora
is there a .sh script that manages starting and stopping the service like debian ubuntu but for redhat fedora

164125
folder	directory
this would eliminate me from having to move them myself so the next time i run my script i will not re-sample them again because they will no longer be in the working directory path folder and still have a back up copy of my files just in case

164134
gentoo	linux
i use gentoo linux

164146
filesystems	btrfs
lilo also doesn t support the btrfs filesystems that i at one time used for the partition i boot from

164166
sysv	systemd
rhel 7 and therefore centos 7 have made the switch from systemd v sysv startup scripts and runlevels to systemd

164177
filesystems	btrfs
one thing you can investigate is to store the files on a btrfs filesystems and have the originals in one originals snapshot and the updated versions in a view based on this snapshot

164185
pull	push
for example i have always been able to run git pull push etc

164198
filesystems	ntfs
making a windows filesystems ntfs would be the absolute answer

164201
ldd	glibc
finally i copied over the ldd and ldconfig binaries which were also part of glibc and chrooted inside my wheezy

164244
processors	hyperthreading
i run debian jessie on a quad-core i7 processors which results in 8 cores being shown thanks to hyperthreading

164258
width	height
to resize one dimension to an explicit value and resize the other dimension by the same factor keeping the aspect ratio you can leave out one of the values in the normal format 950x700 specification like this 950 for specifying width or x700 for height

164264
bash	zsh
note u is for zsh the same as for bash

164274
debian	linux
i m still looking for a kids-specific gnu linux but what i am inclined to do is to set-up debian with some specific application like parental-control etc

164297
ubuntu	centos
i ve compiled a program with ubuntu using clang and clang++ when i transferred my compiled program to my server centos the program doesn t load because of missing libraries

164387
folder	directory
but i can t see a file which is present in a folder in home directory

164387
folder	directory
for example i can t see the files in downloads folder in home directory but can see the folder downloads and files present in home directory while searching in the debian activity overview search bar latest gnome version

164406
ubuntu	linux
as i remember zorinos is based on ubuntu so you can use kxneur the puntoswitcher linux analog

164432
for-loop	loops
and a while loops which is supposed to the the exact same job as the above for-loop

164432
for-loop	loops
the for-loop prints the expected result for all the hosts listed in the hosts file but in case of while loops it only prints the first host s uptime and quits

164433
ethernet	wireless
ethernet works fine and i can connect to wireless networks normally from windows running on the same machine

164438
width	margin
using skim s select tool i picked a 72pt margin on the left for the odd pages and on the right for the even pages with a total width of 450 points

164448
debian	linux
after a quick search i was able to find the torsocks package for fedora debian and arch linux

164449
stdout	stderr
they usually read from stdin or a file descriptor they open themselves and write to stdout or stderr or a file descriptor they open themselves

164475
icmp	tcp
another option would be tcping which can generate tcp packets that provide similar results to an icmp ping

164479
ubuntu	debian
lubuntu derives from ubuntu which derives from debian

164500
stdout	stderr
the at the end of the line redirects tee s stdout to stderr which may be handled differently in a cron job

164508
for-loop	loops
i know i can do this using while loops but since i am learning i thought to use a for-loop

164538
cvs	rcs
the available tools at the beginning were rcs and cvs and linus hates those so everybody just mailed patches

164545
kde	gnome
i d like to know is if there is something similar to ssh or telnet that would allow me to use gnome or kde instead of the command shell

164545
kde	gnome
i want to login to my box from microsoft windows 8.1 and use gnome or kde on my linux box

164551
fflush	gets
the replacement only occurs when the n ewline occurs after the pattern - this is the cycle on which it will be p rinted after all but sed fflush its line buffer and increments the line when we pull in the n ext line so the r gets printed then and then the replacement occurs

164557
calendar	gcal
i don t think it is possible for standard cal but you may want to take a look at gcal the gnu calendar

164564
vim	gedit
being a visual studio fan i am just wondering if i can have same feature in gedit and vim

164564
ubuntu	centos
ps iâ m new to vim and currently using centos and ubuntu

164565
vim	gedit
both gedit and vim have facilities for extension through plug-ins

164580
vmware	virtualbox
but am wondering whether we can mount an iso of our choice disk1.iso by using scsi cd-rom device dev sr0 without changing anything in the kernel as it is done in vmware and virtualbox where we can specify the iso and it automatically emulates a cd-rom hardware and the iso can be mounted using dev sr0 device

164592
filesystems	ntfs
this will not work as it unlikely that your hosts mapped in filesystems windows c drive so most likely ntfs supports the full range of permission bits that linux git expects

164595
vmware	virtualbox
vmware and virtualbox emulate hardware as you mention and hence the kernel and device driver think they re communicating with hardware

164609
wan	lan
4 lan ports + wan port

164666
ubuntu	linux
it s been a while since i started using ubuntu linux as my desktop and i have a question about uninstalling software outside the scope of the package manager

164675
disk	ram
some parts of a library or executable may not be used they will not get copied from disk in to ram or ram gets full and bits that where loaded from disk are dropped because they can be re-fetched from disk if needed or memory that is not backed my disk is mapped in to swap copied out to swap and then dropped

164679
filesystems	hfs+
the default hfs+ filesystems on os x is case-insensitive you can t have two files called abc and abc in the same directory and trying to access either name will get to the same file

164681
stdout	stdio
grep most likely writes to stdout via functions contained in the stdio library

164681
stdout	stdio
stdio is now going to a pipe rather than a terminal device and the library functions that grep is using to write to stdout fully buffers these writes rather than using line buffering

164686
bash	zsh
on bash i was using esc # after ctrl + r to prefix a # to the found line and keep it in the terminal something similar for zsh

164696
kde	gnome
before going into the problem i d like to state that before this incident i had debian with gnome instead of kde

164719
filesystems	fat
this doesn t apply to filesystems like fat which don t have a â œdirtyâ indicator

164722
x86	mips
note that most literature on this topic will be to run arm or mips or ppc on x86 you re doing the opposite x86 on arm

164744
centos	linux
linux client os centos 6.4

164787
folder	directory
now i want to symlink every directory from seriespc to the show folder on volume1 drive series

164796
xfce	gnome
maybe the problem is that xfce applications don t start properly under gnome

164804
debian	mint	debian	linux
if you are using linux mint debian edition lmde then add these lines to your .zshrc

164832
multiplying	add
i want to multiplying the entries of each row which begins with p to the next p in a consecutive way and add them together and take the average

164835
debian	centos
both of these commands run ok on debian but do not work on centos

164842
folder	dir
for some source compilations the folder has a lib bin and inc or include dir - perfect

164842
folder	dir
for some the folder has just lib and inc dir

164842
folder	dir
for some the folder has just inc dir

164853
chown	chgrp
i know what chgrp and chown do

164853
chown	chgrp
my question is since chown does the same thing as chgrp and even more what is the point of chgrp

164863
centos	linux
usually i don t have many problems with linux installations but as they new centos 6.6 was released i found myself in a bit of a problem

164880
rpm	yum
after installing the compiled version of rpm use rpm -i rpm to reinstall your distribution s version of rpm then use yum

164895
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m running linux mint 16 petra based on ubuntu 13.10 saucy salamander

164898
ubuntu	debian
as you could have guessed the package elixir isn t available in anything that isn t ubuntu 12.04 ubuntu 14.04 and probably later and debian 7

164917
ubuntu	centos
the host os is centos 7 and the vm os is ubuntu 14.04

164924
ubuntu	debian
the multi-homed hosts are ubuntu and debian

164937
sudo	passwd
but if i need sudo privileges i need to reenter the passwd for every shell

164943
int	chars
the pattern here is a regular expression that matches any line where the first chars is an int from 0 to 9

164966
ubuntu	linux
noticing the error mentioned in the subject line when trying to execute the below listed bash script on ubuntu 53-ubuntu x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux

164973
sudo	passwd
the user may then use sudo without a passwd for a short period of time 5 minutes unless overridden by the timeout option

164977
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
to show it with the imagemagick graphicsmagick display utility

164977
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
to convert demo.ps to pdf you could use the imagemagick graphicsmagick convert utility

164987
stdout	stderr
according to systemd manual stdout and stderr should automatically go to journal

164996
chown	passwd
then i either have to repeat the ssh-copy-id + edit authorized-keys process and account must have passwd to login or cp -r my root .ssh and then run chown -r someuser

165006
bluetooth	usb
the project i am working on involves using multiple and sometimes single usb bluetooth adapters to obex-push files to phones

165033
ubuntu	freebsd
i have ubuntu 14.04 and i want to install freebsd suse or which distro is possible but i need to do this without any usb install or dvd

165041
centos	linux
although i am using arch linux and not centos in case it helps i encountered a similar issue with a recent upgrade of firefox to 33.0.2

165065
hash	md5
as a secondary answer when fdupes is not available a more efficient way would use md5 to get the hash and sort and uniq to find duplicates without a double shell loop

165081
redhat	fedora
on redhat and fedora use the usr bin vimx command

165082
gif	bmp
i need to add text to an image original image can be jpg gif or bmp file how can i do it

165083
stdout	stderr
the stderr is then redirected to stdout which lets us use wc

165088
processors	hyperthreading
the idea is that if the number of logical processors is twice the number of cores hyperthreading is enabled

165088
processors	hyperthreading
in my naivete at the time i was oblivious to the fact that amd processors don t have hyperthreading

165088
processors	hyperthreading
a co-worker noticed my mistake and stepped in and politely informed me that amd processors don t have hyperthreading

165088
cpu	processors
checking the tech specs of the processors it says there are actually 16 cores per physical cpu

165124
mouse	keyboard
for those that don t know its a product that allows you to program your mouse movements and keyboard

165133
debian	centos
i ve tried both centos and debian with no luck

165166
sudo	passwd
no this is not possible using the unix permissions models that are available via the etc passwd and etc shadow files and sudo

165215
debian	linux
i have a debian based linux installation that gets around

165231
sorting	grouping
flag or -k 1.5 for sorting by grouping permissions

165249
stdout	stderr
you can save the file descriptors of stdout and stderr overwrite them and restore them after the programs have been run

165286
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
for example sh and bash probably expect to find etc profile zsh looks for etc zprofile whereas csh or tcsh will look for something different

165304
vim	emacs
the editors vi vim emacs etcâ dd split and so on.â

165307
stdout	stderr
it lets you keep a reference to stdout aka file descriptor 1 and stderr aka file descriptor 2 redirect them to dev null but still use them if you want a message to be shown

165307
stdout	stderr
if you re going to use this in a script of any size and you ll often want to print status updates about how things are going you ll probably want to create helper functions that do and for printing out messages to the original stdout and stderr so you don t have to pepper references to and all over your script

165313
kde	gnome
i think gnome is more universal when kde is more for desktops

165327
rpm	yum
i don t know about yum but you can ask whether a package is installed using rpm -q my_package .

165330
xfce	gnome
the only solution suggested by the answers on the mathworks forum is to switch off gnome and turn on some other desktop environment xfce for example.

165374
cpu	processors
are the numbers that lscpu outputs the same identifiers i should use to refer to cpu set processors

165380
processors	hyperthreading
if you have hyperthreading switched on you will see two logical processors per core

165384
folder	directory
if the email is in the foo folder in mutt then the s key in the attachment view should save the attachment to the bar directory

165387
ubuntu	linux
is it possible to run the google chrome os s aura gui in other linux distros like fedora or ubuntu

165397
ubuntu	linux
copying a 1tb disk image on a btrfs partition with cp takes less than a second on my ubuntu 14.10 amd64 with linux 3.16.0

165397
filesystems	btrfs
i just want to improve my understanding of zfs and figure out whether zfs is an appropriate alternative as deduplicating filesystems for me by understanding whether copy action described for btrfs are possible on zfs at all on linux 3.16

165423
filesystems	xfs
both the source and the target filesystems are xfs and running creates a directory with the expected ownership

165460
filtering	grouping
-maxdepth 1 -type d or use ls -l | sort to grouping similar types together based on this first character but if you want to filtering you should use grep to only select the appropriate lines from the output

165466
spaces	delimiter
or something similar that command sorts and then splits each line using the spaces delimiter then returns the second group

165504
xfce	gnome
i d use either gnome or xfce terminals

165517
debian	linux
i have a raspberry pi running raspbian a debian flavor linux version 3.12-1-rpi debian-kernel lists.debian.org gcc version 4.7.2 debian 4.7.2-5+rpi1 #1 debian 3.12.9-1+rpi1 2014-05-19

165538
google-chrome	firefox
works as a dead key in konsole firefox google-chrome gvim

165550
ubuntu	debian
i would also like to know which files and commands on a typical unix box or at least on debian ubuntu are playing a role in managing hostnames especially

165553
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
i have tried out the dpkg aptitude and apt commands

165602
ubuntu	linuxmint
i m using chromium version 34.0.1847.116 built on ubuntu 13.10 running on linuxmint 16 260972

165611
debian	linux

165613
folder	directory
i created a directory called folder and took away execute permission

165630
ubuntu	linux
corresponding to kali linux some implementations i.e ubuntu v14

165649
gentoo	linux
on a gentoo linux i am making a call to smbclient which among others show the following output when it is connecting to a windows share on a windows machine

165662
bash	zsh
this would work with ksh93 mksh bash or zsh

165737
daemons	systemd
i would like to know what are the ways to automatically start daemons sshd in fedora systemd

165748
folder	directory
that makes it possible to have some opt folder data directory without having to configure application_name and it still can find that directory based on where the real executable found via the link is.â¹

165807
gentoo	linux
you can start by reading the walktrougth of gentoo linux about configuring the kernel there are some usefull tips on how to start

165815
centos	linux
i have this following setup but its not working in my centos 6x 3.10.23-xxxx-std-ipv6-64 #1 smp tue mar 18 14 48 24 cet 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux

165843
chown	chmod
i had to manually create home bill as root and then use chmod and chown to change the permissions and ownership to the right value

165854
ssl	https
the solution is to use a program called stunnel that is able to wrap the https request in a ssl container so proxy side is indistinguishable from a normal https request for example browsing a https site

165885
ubuntu	debian
a quick google took me to this post the user there stated that using lucid i think i can assume you are using ubuntu debian they needed to install motif3

165914
udp	tcp
same entries show up with tcp instad of udp

165944
ubuntu	linux
i host a handful of domains on a single box linux ubuntu 13.x and am attempting to use postfix 2.10.2-1 to route mail to them

166000
freebsd	linux
however while this can be configured on freebsd other unix linux systems just ignore u+s

166060
centos	linux
on centos linux release 7.0.1406 core

166061
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
to call debian redhat ubuntu and others linux would not be correct

166095
folder	dir
however when i enter the jenkins dir to see which folder is consuming most of this 2.3gb there are some strange results

166114
versioning	upgrade
there are however advantages in doing so if you have two linux versioning installed then an upgrade kernel of the versioning that did not write the boot sector will not result in an updated grub menu with the new versioning for that you have to reboot the other versioning and run update-grub there

166133
sudoers	visudo
if that is the case then in the etc sudoers file shortcut visudo add these lines

166135
debian	centos
i have this working with centos 5 and 6 so it has to be a configuration problem on the debian system somewhere

166135
gentoo	ubuntu
i have also discovered that gentoo and ubuntu are similarly affected

166160
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
it has minimal dependencies a native gtk2 gui cuesheet support support for mp3 ogg flac and ape chiptune formats with subtunes song-length databases and more

166176
rpm	yum
how do i just tell yum to absolutely positively install an rpm and only return an exit code if there s an actual error

166185
bash	zsh
the bash zsh commandline prompt is not displaying colors in tmux even though i managed to get the powerline itself working with colors

166185
bash	zsh
the prompt works fine in pure bash zsh

166210
ubuntu	linux
even more generally how to improve i o responsiveness of a linux ubuntu 14.04 system

166211
stdout	stderr
i have tried adding to redirect stderr to stdout in case it really was being printed to stderr instead

166212
jobs	cron
you can also rework your cron jobs to have these background processes pushed to times when your computations are not running

166212
jobs	cron
additionally you might mod the cron jobs to first find out whether your disk is busy prior to starting if iostat -x says that the disk is busy then sleep for an hour and try again

166222
ubuntu	debian
cln packages are available pre-packaged in debian ubuntu that s what the debian link above is pointing to

166222
ubuntu	debian
for whatever reason the package cln on fedora includes just the library but neglects the examples that are available in the debian ubuntu version above

166260
bash	zsh
is this possible in bash or zsh

166276
bash	zsh
in both bash and zsh and t csh where that feature comes from provided that history expansion is enabled

166320
integer	fractions
i say within 1 second because the is fractions and awk only returns systime as an integer

166333
filesystems	ntfs
since you indicate connecting the drive to a windows 7 machine you probably had a vfat or ntfs on the drive which afaik have less recovery information than some of the linux native filesystems

166333
filesystems	ntfs
then try to recover the filesystems tools depend on the type if it is vfat or ntfs it might be that you better look for windows based tools for that

166358
switching	screens
how do i get my access back remove the endpoint security files or sidestep switching off this login screens

166410
post	get
if you need more info please tell me how to get it and i will post it here

166411
freebsd	linux
for example on a qemu-kvm system you can have one vm running freebsd another running windows and another running linux

166421
ubuntu	debian
i have recently installed debian testing jessie on it previously using ubuntu 14.10

166422
stdout	stderr
in addition to this it outputs extra information intended for humans to stderr interleaved and synchronized with the stdout output

166425
stdout	stderr
if stdout is being redirected or filtered stderr still keeps printing to the terminal

166427
debian	linux
using xfce4 in a debian linux jessie sid distribution i am unable to find or set shortcut to move tab position in xfce4 terminal like ctrl-shift-dgdown pgup in gnome terminal

166447
disk	ram
since suspending an os does not write data to disk the contents of ram are preserved

166452
disk	ram
suspend may be to ram and or to disk

166457
udp	tcp
if you have a tightly configured firewall you will need to allow local traffic to your system on tcp and udp local port 53

166458
btrfs	glusterfs
i m considering btrfs or perhaps a clustered fs such as glusterfs or luster

166463
disk	ram
if you can select the os to boot then it means you are going past a bootloader so resuming from disk not from ram

166473
post	put
could you please post a dummy script for this and tell me where to put it and make it be executed under the given conditions

166485
cat	tee
the first cat can be replaced by a call to tee which also writes the data to a file which can be reread by the second call to cat which is not necessary either

166495
redhat	fedora
for fedora and other redhat distros you can use policykit you may be able to use this on other distros as well i m not able to test this currently

166497
ubuntu	linux
in an earlier version of gnome system monitor on lubuntu there was an addition tab system which displayed some handy system information in a single location including ubuntu version linux kernel version amount of ram and processor info

166508
bash	zsh
this is possible in bash 4 but more cumbersome than in zsh

166536
range	median
i can do the initial steps and output the median value however it cannot say if the output value is within the acceptable range

166538
toupper	uppercase
if you want to process a file you can use awk and its toupper function to convert a string to uppercase

166538
toupper	uppercase
you can test if s is already uppercase with though you might as well use toupper s regardless

166539
bash	zsh
in att ksh and only in att ksh not in mksh bash or zsh you can use to expand to an empty list if no file matches the pattern

166541
ubuntu	linux
is there any equivalent of procstack in linux ubuntu

166569
filesystems	btrfs
i have started to convert my disks to btrfs and following tutorials most of them created the filesystems directly on the device instead on a partition

166582
bash	zsh
the examples above use here strings which are supported for example in bash ksh and zsh

166597
filesystems	btrfs
in fact you can do that using other filesystems other than btrfs - partitions are only useful if you need to partition disks into multiple filesystems

166608
inotifywait	crontab
without inotifywait you can use this little script and a crontab every minute or so

166630
passwd	visudo
you would need to edit the visudo file to allow one user to run this command without asking for a passwd

166631
sudo	passwd
configure sudo to allow you to run the command without a passwd

166656
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
as a minimum i would like to obtain hash under md5 sha1 sha256 with and without salt and bcrypt

166662
hash	md5
as a minimum i would like to obtain hash under md5 sha1 sha256

166688
put	get
to do so i have to stop debian to automatically assemble the raid at startup so i can put it through to the vm via xm block-attach and i don t get that to work

166698
stdout	stderr
so unix it is a file approach together with stdin stdout stderr approach brought a very elegant abstraction to both users and programmers

166720
bmp	png
what command can i use to convert all images in a folder which are not jpgs png and bmp primarily to jpg

166782
udp	tcp
is not using tcp protocol when relaying udp

166782
udp	tcp
if socks5 is supporting udp is true why utorrent can t send udp to tcp port

166806
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
to understand what crypt does with the string as anthon mentions it includes an indication of the algorithm used and the salt for creating the hash see notes - glibc notes in man 3 crypt

166814
temp	tmp
mutt uses vim as its editor and its temp files are in tmp mutt-

166818
chown	chmod
but if you try the same chown and chmod used with the compiled from c previous example executable it won t make any difference

166832
versioning	upgrade
recently i upgrade lvm to 2.02.109 don t recall what versioning it was before and received a message while upgrading

166833
hash	salt
they are hash with a salt

166833
crypt	hash
both the generation of the hash string and verification is done using the crypt function which automatically picks the appropriate algorithm based on the input string

166833
crypt	hash
if the system was configured such that the hash root password is stored in etc passwd then your script could read it and use crypt to validate the password entered by the user

166838
ubuntu	debian
this is relevant to at least debian ubuntu

166844
ubuntu	linux
background i got an acer chromebook yesterday and i am running ubuntu on it i am also somewhat new to linux

166856
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	mint	centos	mint
i m having some weird issues with gnu coreutils date v8.4 centos that aren t occurring in v8.21 ubuntu mint

166876
switching	screens
this just resulted in the gui login screens not loading so i had to switching to a tty and edit back to what it was

166877
next	except
remove all symbols in the brackets equal every symbol except right bracket to make sed not greedy and if in the line remain left bracked - back to start with next line added if there isn t right bracket

166914
debian-based	linux
while i am specifically running a debian-based home-roll-ish on this machine the solution should work for other gnu linux distros in particular the slackware-based family of distributions where i d also like to deploy it

166915
bash	zsh
the variant using printf can be expected to be very fast because printf is a shell builtin in common shells like bash and zsh it does not create any processes

166921
width	height
you may wish to modify the width and height parameters either in the python script or in the svg but they aren t critical since svg display programs generally allow you to control the scale while viewing images

166936
emacs	kate
i can paste the character âˆž in emacs compose + 8 + 8 but this won t work in firefox konsole and kate

166942
folder	directory
i want to set-up some watch folder that will then move the completed torrents to a specific directory for further processing

166947
int	boolean
all of these require you to do translation to and from internal types to the types supported by the storage format dictionaries maps lists primitive types int strings boolean

166963
bash	zsh
right now i use bash i heard zsh has a feature that allows setting euid variables or something like that

166992
ubuntu	linux
output.txt on ubuntu linux looks like this

167031
unix	bsd
in the past there were two main branches in unix flavor att sys v and bsd

167059
bash	zsh
this also uses usr bin printf instead of the shell builtin of bash or zsh to work around minor inconsistencies in implementation of the printf variants and prevent a very dirty effect when in a german locale lc_all is set but not exported

167093
windows	winpe
i load a custom winpe and a test starts running in a separate command line windows if it fails or finish it sends an email notification

167100
bash	zsh
to handle arbitrary whitespace and more than 2 columns per file and assuming your shell is bash ksh zsh

167104
stdout	stderr
it is easy to redirect stdout or stderr to the same output file or one of the 2 std output with a and or

167104
stdout	stderr
i try to have the stream to stdout and on stderr at the same time duplicate the output one on each channel but without using temporary object variable or file

167120
virtualenv	tox	cpython	pypy
tox allows you to automate testing python by using virtualenv for multiple targets cpython 2.7 3.3 3.4 pypy stackless

167149
openbsd	linux
i like very much htop on gnu linux is very nice i would like a similar software for openbsd 5.6

167192
daemons	launchd
note that the cron daemons doesn t run by default on os x but launchd will start it if there are any files in usr lib cron tabs or if etc crontab exists

167192
jobs	cron
speaking of launchd as jherran said launchd items are the more normal way to do this sort of thing on os x but they re a bit different from cron jobs

167192
jobs	cron
by contrast cron jobs including per-user jobs run independently of any login session

167192
jobs	cron
cron jobs get skipped if the computer is asleep or off at the scheduled start time

167192
jobs	cron
cron starts its jobs in a fire-and-forget fashion

167195
openbsd	procfs
at some point you were able to mount procfs on openbsd - see mount_procfs 8 but this was recently removed from the standard configuration

167195
freebsd	procfs
technically it works on freebsd as well with the procfs mounted and may end up working on openbsd.

167199
filesystems	btrfs
with filesystems like btrfs thin luns are sparse files make it with truncate like in the wiki doc

167228
folder	directory
i would like to find the number of folder recursive excluding hidden folder in a given root directory

167255
freebsd	linux
on systems like linux and freebsd and osx which inherits from freebsd where each shell is provided as a separate package there is no man page for builtins

167274
jobs	cron
error messages from cron jobs go to local email

167278
openbsd	debian
what software package should i install on boxes that run debian or openbsd that can create pdf documents

167292
debian	centos
what should i install on debian to get all what is got by installing perl-extutils-embed on centos

167294
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
if you can increase the capacity depends on whether you have lvm installed or not and whether your filesystems supports growing ext 2 3 4 btrfs reiserfs xfsm and maybe some others do

167297
stdout	stderr
in practice some programms write out some or many warning messages to stdout or stderr which may clutter the terminal too much to use one terminal running multiple background programs because you may see lots of mixed-up output which you did not want to see in the first place

167299
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu which i believe is close enough to debian in this case

167355
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
update i run top on linux recent ubuntu and debian 3.x kernels installed as procps 1 3.2.8-11ubun though i suppose that the column ordering functionality might be pretty cross-platform

167363
freebsd	linux
if you choose to make an operating system based on the linux kernel then you have to distribute it for free under the gpl license but if you choose to make an os based on the unix kernel example an os based on freebsd do you have permission to make it closed-source and to take copyrights making it a proprietary software distributing it non-free

167371
udp	tcp
so the question which arises here is why im seeing 1194 open when i use tcp with openvpn and closed when i use udp .

167375
versioning	upgrade
i recently updated the config file for youtube-dl and i also upgrade to the latest versioning

167375
installation	upgrade
i installed it using the manual installation method and thus upgrade using youtube-dl -u

167382
versioning	upgrade
one work-around until you upgrade to a newer versioning of centos would be to change the epel.repo from using https to http

167383
versioning	upgrade
the simplest solution is to upgrade to the latest nmap versioning 6.47 as of this writing

167400
centos	linux
running centos linux release 7.0.1406 - 64bit

167415
folder	directory
basically the above command says i have 10 directory inside my folder

167446
bash	zsh
in bash ksh and zsh

167450
put	get	post	put	post	get
as for the lsof dev sdc cat proc mdstat and dmesg | grep -c3 sdc commands i will put one of the hard drives back into the computer when i get home from work today and post the results of those commands

167452
width	height
on linux i can easily extract the height width ascent descent dimensions of xorg fonts via xlsfonts

167473
minix	linux	unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd	solaris	minix	bsd	minix
some of them are based on the original unix from bell labs solaris hp-ux others are not bsd linux minix

167473
unix	bsd
bsd was originally companion software for a commercial unix and eventually they rewrote all the parts under a free license.

167480
ethernet	wireless
i set up bridging as shown in the handbook between the ethernet interface rl0 and my wireless interface at wlan0 and added the necessary lines to etc rc.conf however now i am unable to ssh into my freebsd box even though it still shows up on the network

167505
kde	gnome
the underlying x server handles either kde or gnome based graphical applications

167541
debian	mint	debian	linux
i recently install linux mint debian on my computer

167544
ubuntu	debian
being ubuntu a debian derivative it should be usable

167572
vim	emacs
i want to be able to map the multi-modifier keys of emacs in vim

167585
sudo	passwd
what difference does it make to not know the passwd for other_user if i can ssh or sudo su - into other_user

167596
rpm	yum
don t be tempted to download a version greater than the one in the security advisory because the yum update in step 3 should replace the version you downloaded from rpm find with the current one in the rhel repo

167596
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
most people here forget that centos is a child of redhat enterprise linux which is a child of redhat now fedora

167596
rpm	yum
yum is an automatic updater and package installer remover for rpm

167609
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu it just worked fine but now i am using arch linux

167618
packets	multicast
in non-promiscuous mode this would only be for packets addressed to its mac address the broadcast address ff ff ff ff ff ff or a multicast address to which it has been subscribed

167618
udp	tcp
it also does validation before sending the packet to the cpu the normal ethernet crc check and ip tcp udp checksums if the nic has that capability and the driver has enabled this offloading

167618
packets	multicast
if this is exceeded it will send all multicast packets to the cpu and the os has to discard the ones it doesn t care about

167623
ethernet	wireless
the reason i want to do this is that at work i prefer to use an ethernet connection with my laptop whenever possible but some times i must take it with me to other parts of the building and use wireless

167623
ethernet	wireless
the ethernet and wireless connections are assigned separate ip addresses that both point to my laptop s host name

167623
ethernet	wireless
when i plug my computer back into the ethernet port after it was connected to wireless dig hostname continues to return the wireless ip address for several hours even though the wireless connection has been disabled

167711
debian	linux

167781
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu i used the command udisksctl but it is not included in the debian 7.7 repository

167796
folder	directory
freenfs exports the directory you specify as the root folder as so in your case you would need

167801
umask	chmod
first i would like to ask if the function of umask is to set chmod values on any file created by a user

167808
debian	linux
i normally use debian variations of linux however appreciate all answers related to any unix linux environments

167811
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i want to know if it is possible to install a debian application or an ubuntu ppa that is not in the kali repository especially because i want to install a bitcoin wallet how can i install a bitcoin wallet on kali linux

167811
debian	linux
if kali linux is based on debian doesn t it mean that after doing the correct settings and probably other modifications you can install apps from the debian repository

167827
post	get
using the help of this blog post and some bash wrapper scripts i was able to get everything working and automated

167836
folder	directory
in fedora 20 the directory you re looking for is in one of the possibly multiple folder

167846
post	get
i ve been trying to get cron to execute these two scripts to schedule and post on twitter tumblr facebook and linkedin

167856
vim	emacs
vim or emacs will be fine also

167858
switching	airplane
in the network settings menu the airplane mode switching was turned to on

167858
switching	airplane
also regardless of the indicated status of airplane mode the wireless switching only flips to on for a split second before reverting to off

167864
xfs	btrfs
the linux partition needs to be partitioned to ext4 default ext3 xfs or btrfs

167865
umask	chmod
if the function of umask is to set chmod values

167865
umask	chmod
umask is not the same as chmod

167865
umask	chmod
the umask doesn t get consulted at all for operations like chmod which explicitly set all the permission bits

167867
ubuntu	debian
if not to make it the default usually already the case on debian and derivative like ubuntu

167868
kde	gnome
i didn t install any kind of desktop environment such as kde gnome unity et cetera and i wonder what the startx command is running

167880
centos	linux
i have a static ip provided by the administrator of my linux centos 6.5

167890
packets	multicast
can i use iptables to track a stateful multicast connection and doing some compare like math reduction based on data inside each packets

167893
ubuntu	debian
i am triple booting ubuntu debian and fedora

i have what should be a kali linux bootable usb and i m trying to install it on a lenovo 64-bit intel laptop that already has windows 7 and ubuntu linux installed on it

167953
hash	salt
in principle i suppose i would have to obtain username and password read salt and hash of the corresponding user from etc shadow

167953
hash	salt
i would then calculate the hash of the given password and the stored salt and check if the result matches the hash stored in etc shadow

167962
ubuntu	mint
the routines described in that howto are available on my ubuntu 12.04 and mint 17 systems without installing anything special

167962
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
the hash password should have multiple tokens cut of everything after and including the last from the hash password and present that as salt to crypt the glibc version according to man 3 crypt should be able to handle the extended salt that indicate sha512 entries as are more common nowadays

167966
bash	zsh
you are using ksh93 bash or a recent zsh or mksh though the only multi-byte charset supported by mksh is utf-8 and only after set -o utf8-mode and a version of head that supports -c most do nowadays but not strictly standard

rpm	yum
after running that do package-cleanup --problems to find other yum rpm db issues and then do one more yum update

168123
rpm	yum
if after getting your yum rpm situation into line things still don t work try creating a brand new clean user to see if that user can log in

168134
ubuntu	linux
it is supported officially by ubuntu 12.04 lts so i guessed that linux would go nicely on it

168134
ubuntu	mint
i installed mint 17 kde based on ubuntu 14.04 lts which comes with kernel 3.13.0

168144
centos	linux

168388
udp	tcp
you have enabled syslog reception over tcp and udp on the client where it s not needed

168388
udp	tcp
on the server you have only enabled tcp log reception however generally in my experience mainly udp is used

168406

so basically put your window at viewport 2 xwininfo -all and click on your window you will get its id and see the the upper-left values are all small like being at viewport 0 but these are actually relative to viewport 2

168782
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash

168810
udp	tcp
ephemeral ports to implement a udp or tcp service

168832
folder	directory
so can we make autojump take the context parent folder into account instead of solely basing its judgment on directory popularity number of times i visited the folder in the past

168851
ubuntu	linux
i have configured different net namespaces netns on my linux machine ubuntu with different routes in each

168870
unix	bsd
unix and by inheritance linux and bsd get the file status via one of the stat-related systems calls stat fstat and lstat

168870
unix	bsd
whoever wrote the error message you quote unable to stat used the name of the unix linux bsd system call as a verb

168891
versioning	upgrade
this package needs to be bought or the versioning needs to be upgrade to 7

168892
gnu	uclibc
the underlying problem is that the libc uclibc does not support this gnu strftime extension

168893
rpm	yum
there isn t a way to do this using yum but you can craft a rpm command that will do mostly what you want

168941
xfce	gnome
i use xfce but gnome s nautilus should be similar

168951
ubuntu	linux
there is some work on systems that combine linux with android such as ubuntu for android but it s been abandoned mainly running on intermediate-format devices tablets but also on smaller devices phones to allow users of mobile devices to run existing applications from the larger-format world

168956
octal	decimal
for historical reasons numerical operations in bourne posix-style shells parse integer constants with a leading 0 digit as octal rather than decimal

168977
stdout	stderr
running bin rm -f on a directory leads to an error that s why the stderr and stdout are redirected to dev null

168980
debian	linux
iam new to linux debian

169056
bash	zsh
or with zsh or bash

169081
sudo	passwd
i switched to my user from his sudo admin user and confirmed everything was okay using the groups command and the etc passwd file looked great

169089
sudo	passwd
i know this doesn t answer your question but if the user was missing from etc passwd then someone with sudo root access at some time deleted the user

169119
sudo	passwd
the thing is the software i need to install requires root permissions and if i include in the bash command sudo su i have to write 64 times the same passwd each time that command appears in the script

169121
bash	zsh
from my attempt at reproducing the problem with bash it seems that bash doesn t relay the session-ending sighup to its children like zsh does so the background job survives

169124
bash	zsh
both bash and zsh have a nice builtin called disown

169133
debian	linux
i m connecting to my debian squeeze server through the windows tightvnc viewer and tightvncserver on linux

169134
sudo	passwd
and also configure your user so that they aren t prompted for a root passwd every time you sudo

169167
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
clean apt for debian ubuntu kubuntu xubuntu and linux mint

google-chrome	firefox
vacuum firefox google-chrome liferea thunderbird and yum

169211
tar	gunzip
this tool can be described as a tiny dirty linux only c command that looks for coreutils basic commands cp mv dd tar gzip gunzip cat ... currently running on your system and displays the percentage of copied data

169221
sudo	passwd
you can configure sudo so that members of a group can run a command without a passwd

169221
sudoers	visudo
use visudo to edit the sudoers file

169248
kde	gnome
i have been running a rolling release distro for a couple of years now and switched from lxde to gnome to kde over the years

169248
dpkg	apt
so i am looking for a dpkg or apt command that overwrites whatever configuration files might be present with the configuration files from the package

169254
centos	linux
i am running these commands as root from an init script on a centos 6 linux server

169286
daemons	systemd
the problem with systemd is that differentiating daemons arguments cannot be conditionally used

169288
sudo	passwd
i m assuming that the sorry try again. is due to the echo command actually getting thrown into the passwd prompt but i m unsure of the syntax to get this thing working properly with sudo su since the admin_pass variable is local and can t be passed to the ssh script without storing the file on the remote client right

169289
bash	subshell
i know if i test variable it would work or if i put the last one inside a subshell but then i would lost job controls i want to avoid daemons but i want to know why bash make it this way where is it documented

169329
filesystems	ntfs
as the used filesystems was not specified i m also assuming ntfs due to the obvious autorun.inf file and system volume information folder

169333
migrate	upgrade	installation	upgrade
basically the ame applies for distro upgrade and fresh installation or when your desktop or major applications suddenly fail - create a new user test with it and then migrate your settings in batches or get to know which can be safely copied over and which are conflicting with experience you should know which are safe and which are not

169351
lvm	umount
and had a look around the place first time i was playing with lvm luks mounting and umount the different logical volumes swap root home when i had to hastily shut the terminal down without closing the luks partition exit

169357
children	parent
nohup is not necessary as recent versions of bash as coming with huponexit as off and this will prevent parent shell from sending hup signal to its children during its exit

169358
bash	zsh
i am experimenting with moving from bash to zsh and in particular with the hash function

169398
fat	hfs+
partial functionality was restored in v3.1 covering only fat and hfs+

169398
filesystems	xfs
in the case of growing an existing filesystems this is a low-risk operation as long as you re using a filesystems that can be grown on the fly like ext4 or xfs

169398
filesystems	xfs
some filesystems xfs can be grown only

169398
lvm	xfs	filesystems	xfs
a common situation is to have an xfs filesystems on top of a multi-drive lvm-managed disk array to which you add some drives then expand the lvm and finally expand the xfs filesystems into the new space

169400
tar	gunzip
this tool can be described as a tiny dirty linux only c command that looks for coreutils basic commands cp mv dd tar gzip gunzip cat ... currently running on your system and displays the percentage of copied data

169421
xls	ods
now the csv format is really just a text file format and does not allow for sheets which are allowed in the binary format xls or ods libreoffice s spreadsheet file format

169431
ubuntu	debian
i know the command for ubuntu is chmod +x filename.sfx but i don t know the command for debian

169433
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
that being said chmod is a common utility found on virtually every unix -like os out there and ubuntu is merely a highly customised version of debian which is a distro of linux which is a unix clone

169436
sudoers	passwd	chmod	sudoers	chown	sudoers	chown	chmod	chown	passwd
if you don t want to remove their root access by changing the passwd and either changing their accounts group memberships or editing the sudoers file about the only thing you can do is use chmod to remove group other permisions to write to the file chmod go-w filename and make sure that it is owned by root chown root root filename

169467
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
protocols all ip tcp udp icmp actual values set or unset make no difference

169503
bash	tcsh
i come from bash and am looking into tcsh s tab completion feature

169503
bash	tcsh
1 is it correct that tcsh cannot delegate completion to a shell function the way bash does with complete -f _func cmd

169503
bash	tcsh
2 when delegating completion to an external program tcsh only provides command_line unlike bash which provides comp_line and comp_point

169503
bash	tcsh
because tcsh will only give command_line as cmd --foo - whereas bash would give the whole line but give clue about the cursor position in comp_point

169516
daemons	systemd
processes without a controlling tty are typically daemons and systemd services

169516
daemons	systemd
your colleague was suggesting that the problem was more likely to be in a daemons or systemd service

169582
sudo	passwd
using ubuntu and login with my user user and when i open my terminal i execute the sudo -i command i was asked to enter the passwd to have root access

169582
sudo	passwd
after the changes i made with devstack when i execute the sudo -i command i m not asked for any passwd i just have root access and i don t like this

169582
sudo	passwd
is there any way to change this back so when i execute the sudo -i command i will be asked for a passwd

169595
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
if you want to be allowed to run commands as root but be prompted to enter your own passwd then edit the sudo configuration by running the visudo program

169595
sudo	passwd
then to run commands as root use su instead of sudo and type the root passwd

169595
sudo	passwd
note that if sudo asked you for a passwd it won t ask you again for the next few minutes iirc the default is 15 minutes on ubuntu

169595
sudo	passwd
depending on the configuration sudo may keep a separate passwd delay per terminal or a single one per user

169626
ati	nvidia
nvidia both or ati both then in theory this should work without much problems -- but see the next paragraph

169631
bash	zsh
the difference in performance between zsh - as above - and bash is 100th of a second here

169690
centos	linux
i work on a shared linux enviroment centos but for some reason one of my logins has been locked

169728
put	get
say in etc rc.local i put the line nc -l 1234 could i get something that would tell me that the nc command was opened by etc rc.local

169734
debian	linux
with a clean installation of arch linux i ve tried installing debian too without success. i tried installing the open-source drivers but i ve got the no screens found error

169736
sudo	passwd
if my brain is working properly i think the encrypted passwd is being sent to the client system and then is decrypted before being used in the sudo -s commands

169749
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
disclaimer this might be ubuntu specific and i tested on linux mint

169754
ubuntu	centos
i m trying to get a binary compiled on ubuntu to run on centos 7 both 64bit one host the other vm

169754
ubuntu	centos
i have the source but i barely managed to compile and test on ubuntu as it relies on some libs that are built from source tryed on the centos but the g++ version is older and didn t support c++11

169754
ubuntu	centos
what is the easiest way to port something from ubuntu to centos

169757
redhat	fedora
redhat fedora

169757
children	parent
whether linux users like it or not all the other linux distributions are children to one of these 6 parent

169757
ubuntu	centos
the release schedule and the update cycle for ubuntu chose to adopt new versions of the build toolchain before centos adopted them

169757
ubuntu	centos
as such the op was experiencing an issue similar to this because ubuntu s build toolchain supports c++11 and centos s does not until all the version mismatches are repaired and will later run into issues with using multiple package managers

169757
binutils	glibc
binutils depends on glibc and libtool depends on binutils therefore libtool indirectly depends on glibc i won t explain why nearly every package on any system indirectly depends on glibc just know that it does

169765
stdout	stderr
one of the great things that unix introduced was the pipe and those default stdin stdout stderr streams that all commands handle by default

169765
put	get
then schedule a meeting for the echo and cut tool get them from the drawer invoke them wash them dry them put them back in the drawer and so on

169765
put	get
here the obvious way is to get your cut tool from the drawer slice your whole onion and put it back in the drawer after the whole job is done

169765
stdio	fputs
when you do a fgets or fputs in c that s a function in stdio

169797
versioning	upgrade
so when you do apt-get upgrade and there is a newer package of emacs in the repository than what apt-get put there before it will replace that and your custom versioning will not be touched

169814
ubuntu	linux
at the moment i do some tests with loop devices on linux ubuntu

169828
rpm	yum
formats being deb apt and rpm yum

169828

some source package managers being emerge pacman yaourt slackpkg pkgng from bsd macports homebrew pip python gem ruby etc

169834
postfix	dovecot
i just setup a mail server with postfix and dovecot now i m having trouble sending emails with evolution

169859
bash	zsh
note that ports contains the full paths as bash has no equivalent for zsh s t

169916
gentoo	linux
you might want to look at sabayon linux a child of gentoo

169928
folder	directory
however when i try to save the script.sh file in that directory the gedit tool gives me an error stating that i do not have privileges to save in that folder

169962
ubuntu	mint
â¹ in this post â œdebianâ includes derivatives that use the same emacs packaging including ubuntu mint etc

169970
children	parent
the right way to monitor processes is by letting their parent do it â â a process s pid is not reused until its parent has acknowledged its death that s why zombies exist so a process s parent can reliably identify its children by their pid

170016
128bit	64bit
each sector within each cluster is independently encrypted using aes cipher block chaining mode using the sector s offset relative to the start of the device in little-endian format as the first 64bit of the 128bit initialisation vector

170085
icmp	udp
that udp echo has been superseded by icmp echo as sent by the ping command where you have different echo_request and echo_reply packets and those are different from udp packets

170094
daemons	systemd
now you can use the standard commands from systemctl part of systemd to start and stop the daemons like so

170094
centos	linux
how to remove mysql completely from linux system - centos

170120
division	modulo
the above is using the modulo division operator to divide the currently number by 2

170145
sudoers	passwd
that way you could create an account in the sudoers group that would only have google authenticator s passwd authentication

170151
debian	linux
i ve ever wonder why there isn t a command in linux debian and related distros that instead of having to create an alias for a command like

170167
ubuntu	debian
i m using schroot debian sbuild 1.6.10 04 may 2014 in ubuntu 14.10

170173
freebsd	linux
if you are on a console tty on linux or freebsd you can use svgalib to show images in graphics mode without x11

170176
centos	linux
when i open the terminal in centos linux and use su - to work as the root user i type in commands like journalctl that result in a lot of output

170182
single-quotes	double-quotes
you are passing a string literal to the command program just like double-quotes but differ that single-quotes prevent variable and wildcard expansion while double-quotes expand them in to the string literal

170200
bash	zsh
in case sed does not support reading of a script from stdin using -f - you can use process substitution available in bash zsh ksh93

170201
docx	xlsx	xlsm	ods	xlsx	ods	xlsx	xlsm
in the following file formats ods odt xlsx docx xlsm docm html

170205
spaces	delimiter
now i finally pipe it to cut with the delimiter specified as spaces and printing the -f3 which is the intended output

170232
vim	sublimetext
i was wondering if there was a vim plug-in for the sublimetext editor feature showing a smaller version of the file currently being edited generally in the right hand side of the window -- see picture below

170262
debian-based	linux
the linux distribution univention corporate server ucs which i work for and which is debian-based offers various active directory services including a tool called active directory connection which creates this automatic synchronization process between a microsoft active directory and the openldap directory univention corporate server is using including the synchronization of passwords group definitions and other directory service objects

170285
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
note that versions of bash prior to 4.3 were following symlinks when recursively descending the directory tree like zsh s or tcsh s

170295
fish	zsh
to complement the other answers zsh fish and t csh are more helpful here in that they can help you show your mistake before it becomes a problem

170295
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
fish and zsh are correct in making it clear that it s the shell not find that is complaining here while tcsh s error is misleading

170311
bash	zsh
with ksh or bash or zsh

170329
apache	nginx
i can find all the logs produced by my app my database and nginx apache

170347
put	get
to get it read in all interactive shells put the following line in your .bash_profile

170350
disk	ram
the ram in a computer is useful for two things to store the memory of programs and as a cache of recently-used disk content

170374
bash	shellcheck
shellcheck is a static analysis and linting tool for sh bash scripts

170398
mp3	flv
i know that flv and mp4 files contain aac audio while avi video usually mp3 audio streams

170416
for-loop	arrays
a note that you must use double quotes when you want to iterate through all arrays elements or use the c-style for-loop like my first example

170443
x86	64bit
on sparc compiling programs as 32 bit does not have as much disadvantages as on x86 where 64bit also gives you additional registers

170469
daemons	systemd
i ve got a systemd with several daemons running as systemd units that output log information to the journal in arch linux

170475
sudo	passwd
but the problem is that mount requires sudo and passwd introduction or be run with root privileges

170508
folder	directory
i cannot enter a directory after creation in a folder with an acl

170514
stdout	stderr
seems this is not possible and unwanted by upstream redirecting stdout stderr to individual files see - read the whole thread for more context information how this is intended to work

170514
stdout	stderr
you may also want to take a look at view stdout stderr of systemd service

170517
filesystems	ntfs
as mentioned in the manuall ...ntfsclone can be useful to make backups an exact snapshot of an ntfs filesystems and restore it later on...

170520
debian	linux
i set an eth1 interface in linux debian and i rebooted after that but i don t see it when i would like to use the sudo ifconfig or ifconfig command as root only the eth0 interface

170525
ubuntu	linux
i m currently running vlc on windows but i had the same problems when ubuntu was installed and i could very easily switch back to using ubuntu or even a different linux distro later on

170543
ubuntu	debian
installing the dropbox deb files from the dropbox website ubuntu or debian i have not tested others will not install nautilus although gdebi says a nautilus extension will be installed

if i add wp-login.php i can access to the admin panel doing everything but if i try to show published either post or pages i get

170574
stdout	stderr
redirect and append both stdout and stderr to file result.txt

170583
hash	md5
then the output is sort d by the md5 hash

170583
hash	md5
the last awk command tracks three variables lastid the md5 hash from the previous entry lastfile the filename from previous entry and first lastid was first time seen

170610
gtk	motif
x resources are a way to configure x11 clients that use a toolkit that makes use of them mostly classical toolkits such as the x toolkit motif etc. excluding modern toolkits such as gtk and qt

170636
folder	directory
i ve been to cobble up a one-liner script that will append the date to all the files but it hits the folder in the current directory as well

170643
chown	mount
ownership of individual files directories on the mounted drive is permanent so you only have to chown the once not after every mount

170643
filesystems	xfs
you might have experienced problems in the past with filesystems that did not have detailed owner information but ext4 xfs will not give you these problems

170649
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu studio 14.04 all the latest updates linux version 3.13.0-30-lowlatency buildd kissel on an asus k55a

170672
ubuntu	linux
it is not a critique of ubuntu and such only i m coming from the bsd world and looking for a linux that is as easy and as simple as bsd

170680
gentoo	linux
the closest to bsd ports is gentoo linux s portage

170680
ubuntu	debian
i have positive experience with building debian ubuntu packages from source but that s not your main question so i m not going to get into details

170714
freebsd	linux
my personal experience is that linux freebsd and os x all kernel panic about the same amount which is to say rarely. the vast majority of cases where i have been able to diagnose the reason for crash it has been due to a device driver but that in turn was due to faulty hardware

170714
freebsd	linux
i mentioned that os x freebsd and linux are all roughly comparable in terms of kernel panics per year because it shows that quantity of drivers doesn t explain everything here

170714
freebsd	linux
linux has many more drivers than either freebsd or os x yet it s roughly as stable as long as you stay away from the really low-end hardware

170751
umask	chmod
i ve tried mounting the partition with ownership on the files set to mysql mysql and a umask at 000 chmod 777 but mysql always says

170791
ubuntu	debian
the two of them have debian wheezy installed and the other one has ubuntu 12.04 installed

170795
disk	ram
if you don t like that idea then you can create a key file without passphrase and put it into a ram disk

170798
centos	linux
the epel extra packages for enterprise linux repo for centos 6 includes fluxbox

170813
folder	dir	folder	directory
which will symlink everything but i have to go inside the dir and make a new directory because the folder are also symlinked this is expected

170813
folder	directory
so here is what im trying to achieve symlink all files but when there is a folder make a directory with the same name and symlink the files inside of that folder and inside that folder etc

170843
debian	linux
today i upgraded my pretty ancient debian linux kernel 3.2-23 to 3.16-7

170843
switching	screens
i ve also tried switching to using uuids but i get the same result slightly different screens message though

170875
disk	ram
there is no way for a connection to survive a reboot they aren t stored on disk anywhere and ram gets cleared so if that foreign address was connected again after the reboot then they must have been making new connections on the other side

170889
hex	binary
any simpler way to obtain a binary file from a --read-sector hex dump

170894
sudo	passwd
sudo command requires passwd of current user not root user

170912
bash	zsh
assuming a zsh shell or a fairly recent version of ksh93 or bash

170916
put	get
me neither so this method can only tell you whether a file is currently being accessed via a put or get but it cannot distinguish between the two

170923
ubuntu	linux
a directory on a windows 7 host system mounted from an ubuntu linux guest system

170923
filesystems	ntfs

versioning	upgrade
after struggling with usb 3.0 on creating a live usb versioning kali i ve finally managed to actually boot it up and then use the apt-get update + upgrade + dist-upgrade successfully

170947
debian	linux
system is linux tlinux 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.63-2 x86_64 gnu linux

exif	xmp
by default the exiv2 subcommand rm or delete removes exif thumbnails and jpeg comments also additional to the ones you mention exif iptc xmp

170959
debian-based	linux
i should mention that the rename i am talking of is perl-rename known as prename and available as rename on debian-based linux distros the same command seen in ntzrmtthihu777 s answer

170965
unix	solaris	unix	sunos	sysv	systemd	solaris	sunos
the etc init.d directory tree denotes the systemd v sysv init systemd which follows the at t unix sunos solaris tradition of systemd initialization

170965
sysv	systemd
this is commonly called the sysv init systemd

170996
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
graphicsmagick is fork of imagemagick

171058
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
on ubuntu and linux mint websites and forums people usually say that these two desktops can be used as parallel sessions in ubuntu or mint without any problem

171058
xfce	cinnamon
but now i have installed lm 17 qiana xfce and then the cinnamon desktop

171059
kde	gnome
assuming the executables are c c++ programs with a working gnome or kde interfaces on linux

171071
bash	zsh
but in fact if you use any reasonable shell like bash or zsh then you can simply write

171092
google-chrome	firefox
for instance selecting text on a web page that i d like to paste as a file name when choosing save image from firefox or google-chrome the save as dialog box now has the original file name highlighted which overwrites my original copied text

171092
put	get
is there a trick to get around this or prevent automatically selected text from being put in the copy buffer or reverting to the previously selected text once the new selection is deleted unselected

171093
spaces	delimiter
here in this example i just use the spaces as delimiter

171100
spaces	delimiter
above awk command will work if your columns in input file are delimiter with spaces or tab between themself if the columns delimiter with something else you need to tell it to awk with its -f option

171161
stdout	stderr
ultimately as dopeghoti suggested you should log the output of your cron script somewhere capturing stdout and stderr

171166
sudo	passwd
when a user invokes sudo -l it lists what sudo will allow them to do so you could have a script ran as root that bumps through etc passwd and sudo s to each user invoke the sudo -l directing the output to

171185
stdout	stderr
i have launched both mpv and vlc from the command line with varying verbosity levels to see if stdout stderr had any useful information to no avail

171191
post	get
post but when i try to get information about its not defined

171199
bash	zsh
however as an extension some shells like bash ksh ksh93 zsh and others allow their variables be typed like being numeric an array

versioning	upgrade
on netbsd you usually upgrade pkgsrc to the latest versioning which is nothing more than tar -xvzf pkgsrc-version.tar.gz and updates the installed software individually

171219
centos	linux
for example here are instructions for installing extra packages for enterprise linux repo on centos red hat

171231
udp	tcp
when i run ntpd i see that its binding to both tcp and udp ports

171243
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
the -net enables simple networking support tcp udp but no icmp and creates a port redirection for ssh you can then connect to local port 10022 on the host to ssh into the vm

171255
udp	tcp
you do not have to disable tcp here because ntp is a udp based protocol and does not use tcp to communicate with the time server

171284
centos	linux
os linux centos 7 nfsv4

171302
freebsd	solaris
am a noob in solaris trying to learn solaris and freebsd in best possible way

171347
post	get
it s quite obvious the data are the cgi get post parameters and

171354
osx	yosemite
i made a usb to live-boot into kali and install it onto a separate partition essentially dual boot my yosemite osx 10.10 with kali linux

171364
tunnel	vpn
it is able to establish a vpn-like tunnel but to my knowledge other vpn solutions are superior to the openssh approach regarding performance and functionality

171380
versioning	upgrade
based on those 1st 3 messages it would look like you need to upgrade your versioning of perl to at least 5.12.3

171400
debian	centos
quite often the setup is such that you have to be member of the sudo group debian or wheel group centos to be able to use sudo which is better maintainable than having specific names restrictions in the etc sudoers file itself

171417
vmware	virtualbox
much easier and not requiring reboots of the machine is to install a vm virtualbox vmware on the windows machine run linux as a guest vm and share the directories on the windows drive

171465
lvm	mdadm
i have a debian wheezy system with a couple of 500 gb hdds in raid-1 mdadm mirror on top of which sits lvm logical volumes with 5 partitions boot root usr var and tmp total size of 47.15 gib

171466
opensuse	linux
i have just installed linux opensuse and when start the os i get an error

171517
debian	linux
i am on debian linux

171531
freebsd	linux
ony my linux systems man 1 man mentions the manwidth environment variable which now that i look it up is also specified in the freebsd man 1 manpage

171589
redhat	fedora
versions of redhat enterprise linux are spun from which fedora versions

171594
solaris	aix
it s the best for a broader understanding the straight forward logic not philosophy of all nixs like linux solaris hpux aix etc

171595
redhat	fedora
it s here buried in a table on the fedora project s site on a page titled simply redhat enterprise linux

171596
ubuntu	linux
i have experienced several times that with different vms particularly ubuntu linux vms after the first time the vm is brought up host-only networking will not work

171597
gentoo	linux
how can i get full unicode font coverage for gentoo linux

171639
bash	zsh
bash ksh and zsh support both though with subtle differences for some

171704
udp	tcp
tcp udp

171704
udp	tcp
netstat -at is used to display either tcp or udp connections

171704
udp	tcp
tcp and udp protocols are used in the transport layer

171721
ubuntu	debian
if not possible at least ubuntu or debian would be preferred

171722
vmware	virtualbox
vmware seems to run a little better with pulseaudio also being installed sound in virtualbox ran just fine with only alsa

171725
post	get
now while curl usually performs a get request you might want to add some post information to your request forms

171732
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is a next-gen filesystems - it encompasses many of the same purposes as past layering models handled between them

171732
filesystems	btrfs
so in general it is impossible to give an accurate estimate of the amount of free space on any btrfs filesystems

171732
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is in many ways a file database as well as a filesystems

171733
daemons	systemd
older versions of lvm had no journaling daemons meaning that if the systemd crashed the only journal that could be used was on the physical volume hard disk

171770
ubuntu	centos	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	centos
a small yet incomplete list includes centos ubuntu gentoo and arch

171784
gtk	xlib	gtk	motif	xlib	motif
including applications built gtk qt motif etc. upon x11 xlib

171820
ubuntu	debian
i came across the same issue and ended up writing this to make it work painlessly across different systems debian ubuntu currently

171822
ubuntu	linux
my idea is to use ubuntu with kvm because it s pretty easy to maintain and there s a gui to configure new vms our administrators aren t that much into linux

171823
min	max
this is a vector of 3 integers min default max

171824
debian	linux
the delay was there since install debian gnu linux 7.7 wheezy netinstall

171835
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are all redirected but ssh still manages to print a prompt on my screen and read what i type

171844
gentoo	linux
this is an excerpt of inittab on my gentoo linux machine

171889
ubuntu	linux
the cause of the problem may reside in aterm fluxbox or ubuntu 14.04 i m searching a general linux way to investigate my problem

171896
ubuntu	linux
i see upstart as the parent on my ubuntu 14.10 box but that will vary on different linux and unix systems

171907
nerdtree	netrw
i d like to hit a shortcut and use netrw or nerdtree to browse for a file or directory and have it pasted in place into the command iâ m building

171907
nerdtree	netrw
then i d like to hit my shortcut and visually browse using netrw or nerdtree and select a file

171923
debian	linux
since it s my first time using a linux system for 3 months i feel much more confident and secure starting on a new page with the system than simply switching back to windows as i did enjoy using debian quite a bit

171940
width	height
i am thinking about what ways can recover the original scanned pdf file before ocr as much as possible without changing the width and height of each page in pixels and without changing the pixels per inch of each page

171951
freebsd	linux
however i couldn t find an alternative even for linux although some say it may be possible to examine proc tty driver serial by hand if it exists not to mention freebsd which is my actual target

171982
chmod	mkdir
then i did a chmod +w which didn t complain to me and tried the mkdir again but it again told me that it was a read-only file system

172007
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i notice that there s plenty of q a on doing this on ubuntu here for eg but couldn t really find anything relevant on linux mint

172039
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
freebsd openbsd and netbsd use elf on x86 whereas os x uses an entirely different executable format

172047
filesystems	btrfs
sure enough i try btrfs filesystems df media andy btrfs

172084
folder	directory
every user is chrooted into a different directory to prevent them from cd to a higher directory and seeing the other users folder are named after users

172089
children	parent
what i ve not been able to determine is how forked process time is handled in relation to the parent and children processes

172089
children	parent
does the parent process have the accumulated time of all the children as well as itself

172089
children	parent
in my circumstance it s fairly important to understand this behaviour between the children and parent process time

172097
bash	shellcheck
there is software called bash debugger and other software will be shellcheck which will give you general errors but not all

172107
filesystems	ntfs
the external drive has ntfs and ext4 filesystems which are being automounted by dolphin

172109
bash	zsh
the same happens with in bash zsh or ksh not dash nor yash which only accept numerical constants in variables there

172109
bash	zsh
in bash zsh and ksh not dash or yash if x is

172109
bash	zsh
in summary one shouldn t use uninitialised or non-sanitized external data in arithmetic expressions in shells note that arithmetic evaluation can be done by aka in bash or zsh but also depending on the shell in the let test declare typeset export.

172154
centos	linux
connecting from windows to linux centos 5.4 using putty

172179
kde	gnome
i m a long time kde user never seen gnome since may be mandrake linux 10 something

172179
kde	gnome
touchpad menu nor in kde neither in gnome doesn t allow this kind of configuration

172210
debian	centos
i am attempting to set up a minimal debian or centos installation for internal network access

172215
asterisk	pbx
i remember debian taking up less than 64 mb of ram with just ssh and an asterisk pbx started

172217
ubuntu	centos
i ve checked it on current ubuntu suse and centos distributions

172230
spaces	delimiter
it is space-separated in because i set s first byte to spaces - the delimiter is definable in that way

172251
folder	directory
so in a folder there is usually a bunch of files and directory starting with a date

172282
debian	linux
i am running some simulations in matlab on a linux machine running debian gnome v3.4.2

172297
bash	subshell
now i know that i can work around this is bash by inverting the flow of commands and essentially passing cat the argument via a subshell

172299
lvm	mdadm
there are several ways to create a softraid with linux lvm s internal raid and four versions of md raid mdadm 0.90 1.0 1.1 1.2

172306
width	height
curiously enough even the official manual will only tell about modifying the height but what i need is the width

172306
width	height
only a with value being a signed integer number is possible which as mentioned will only ever modify the height but not the width

172309
bash	subshell
wouldn t it make more sense to start a subshell type bash run the setup run the commands and leave the subshell d when finished

172339
ubuntu	mint
since mint is a ubuntu derivative this should work

172339
ubuntu	mint
the reason it doesn t is because the version of mint you are using is based on a version of ubuntu less than 14.04 which is the minimum version in the daily builds repository

172343
portrait	landscape
since i swapped my broken graphics card that supported only 2 monitors for a new one i have all 3 monitors as one desktop 2 landscape oriented and one portrait oriented

172343
mouse	keyboard
i used to have the third landscape monitor on a different system driven via x2vnc so i could share the keyboard and mouse in that situation i never had the following problem

172343
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	cinnamon	gnome
since swapping the problem is that when i have items on my desktop and i right-click the desktop and select sort desktop items by name that the icons disappear linux mint 17.1 cinnamon same problem occurred on ubuntu 12.04 classic gnome

172369
versioning	upgrade
update i ve just spun up an amazon ec2 instance running the latest versioning of amazon linux and upgrade bash by compiling from source

172394
for-loop	loops
for loops you can use a for-loop in the c style

172395
lvm	btrfs	lvm	mdadm	mdadm	btrfs
in addition to lvm internal raid and mdadm raid that hauke mentioned btrfs and zfs have raid support built-in

172395
lvm	mdadm
both these filesystem specific raids are incompatible with each other and the other raid capability providers lvm mdadm

172397
switching	screens
if i join with screens to existing sessions i can get a list of the sessions with c-a keystroke and switching between them however i can t find a way to safely leave detach and keep all the processes running

172402
folder	directory
the following command copies the folder source folder to a parent folder destination which already contains a directory with the name folder

172403
spaces	delimiter
you may want to add spaces or other delimiter after first with

172412
spaces	delimiter
that splits the line at the match with a n ewline character saves it in h old spaces e xecutes cat - which replaces pattern spaces with its output - g ets the contents of the hold spaces appended to our new pattern spaces following another n ewline character and then rearranges on n ewline delimiter

172449
udp	tcp
eth0-rxtx-0 rsstype 0 rqid 0 rsshash 0x0 0 v4 1 v6 0 tcp 0 udp 1 tuc 1 cnc 0 ipc 1

172449
udp	tcp
eth0-rxtx-0 rsstype 0 rqid 0 rsshash 0x0 0 v4 1 v6 0 tcp 0 udp 1 tuc 1 cnc 0 ipc 1

172467
spaces	delimiter
and one thing about cut -d -f2 that someone tell you it s not correct this is strongly correct because this command already use spaces as field delimiter because you just escaped it with

172476
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
in linux mint unlike in ubuntu i see two separate launchers to handle usb sticks one only for formatting the other for writing image files to the usb stick

172478
ubuntu	linux
it can be used in other linux systems at least in ubuntu for sure

172487
debian	linux
i am studying linux on my raspberry pi that installed debian version

172508
stdout	stderr
and the standard file descriptors stdin stdout stderr or 0 1 2 are connected to a pseudo-terminal which is handled by the terminal emulator

172539
g++	gcc
after doing that before running any compilation issue source .cc and then compile as you do normally i.e gcc g++ ld.

172543
zsh	subshell	bash	zsh	bash	subshell
for example bash puts all components of the pipeline into separate subshell unless you use the lastpipe option in invocations where job control is not enabled but at t ksh and zsh run the last part inside the current shell both behaviours are allowed by posix

172543
bash	zsh
does basically nothing in bash but exits from the zsh because of the last exit

172553
hash	md5
the option will take the found paths and gives them to the md5sum command to turn into a list md5 hash + their filepaths md5_hash path to file

172553
spaces	delimiter
the second one -d tells it to use a spaces character as the delimiter between columns

172553
hash	md5
this will give you a list of md5 hash of the files that are only in one or the other

172554
folder	directory
i want an ssh user to be jailed in his home folder and not have any access whatsoever on my server s root directory

172561
versioning	upgrade
for this reason i decided to upgrade vlc hoping that the newer versioning would be rid of the bug

172561
versioning	upgrade
what s worse is that when i went ahead and tried to upgrade apt wouldn t see any new versioning

172583
versioning	upgrade
i m running a pile of mediawiki instances on oracle enterprise linux and i m trying to upgrade from 1.19.x to the latest lts versioning 1.23.x

172609
post	get
according to this post the way to do that is to start the machine with the usb stick connected and get to the grub prompt

172622
bash	zsh
there are no relations between a pid and a job id on shells i have used bash dash and zsh

172667
ethernet	wireless
in fact if you want to guarantee that wireless clients can t go onto the ethernet connection do the following

173694
disk	ram
i expect some overhead due to copying data into a circular buffer which i would have thought is stored in ram and so i expected the pipe to be much faster than writing to a file because ram is orders of magnitude faster than disk

173694
ubuntu	linux
this is on a 3 ghz desktop with an ordinary disk drive not solid state running ubuntu linux

173694
disk	ram
websites that talk about ram disk say that ram disk are 50-200 times faster than hard disk

173699
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
i chose it after trying ubuntu mint debian testing

173712
switching	screens
somehow be able to switching between a console the rendering screens with ctrl+alt+f1 and ctrl+alt+f2

173742
vim	emacs
there is no problem ever when using emacs or wingide but when i happen to use vim to change one of the files under observation the python utility exits because the files which timestamp it tries to check does not exist

173756
folder	directory
i accidently left a trailing slash on my directory name when renaming a folder in linux

173759
folder	directory
suppose you are in the home user test folder where there is the images1 images2 directory

173759
folder	directory
as you were in the root folder and since root folder doesn t have a parent directory

173766
ubuntu	linux
on my linux ubuntu with kde when i press ctrl+f9 the system shows all the opened windows as miniatures allowing me to select one by clicking on it

173771
folder	dir	folder	directory
this means i should ignore folder subdir1 subdir2 and subdir3 and only search in the main directory dir

173805
debian	linux
i have a remote linux debian machine which i d like to access from a very restricted network

173822
apache	nginx
when getting forbidden errors in either nginx or apache it is always worth working your way back up the tree of directories to ensure the web server can access at each level

173845
chown	sudo
i can t change the owner of shared files from xubuntu by any sudo chown .

173845
folder	directory
i also have tried to mount the shared folder into home directory still didn t change anything

173845
chown	sudo
after doing sudo chown

173864
children	parent
in order to kill parent and its children processes you can use

173871
centos	linux
i am trying to make one traffic generator tool in linux centos 6.5

173876
chown	sudo
sudo chown -v hooman

173876

sudo chown -v kaustubh

174004
notepad++	gedit
use plain editors like notepad++ gedit etc. or ides

174023
ubuntu	mint
now i find that all connections from that machine--from both windows 7 and ubuntu 14.04 can t reach the mint machine

174027
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
chroot in ubuntu or recovering ubuntu debian linux

ethernet	wireless
i m guessing that you want to share a wireless internet connection to other hosts on ethernet as in the topology diagram below

174061
mouse	keyboard
magit-status buffers don t respond to mouse clicks at all only keyboard clicks ret s

174061
mouse	keyboard
info-mode only provides the open in new window behavior for keyboard clicks but not for mouse clicks

174061
mouse	keyboard
the implementation details of all this is probably pretty intricate but to illustrate there is no real magic there compare how info-mode treats mouse clicks and keyboard clicks differently compare defun info-mouse-follow-nearest-node click and

174077
hash	salt
3- if i encrypt my password with a hash using openssl passwd and every time there s a random salt added to it how does openssl decrypt it or any other program for that matter

174079
hash	salt
in one way encryption the salt is usually a pre determined string or generated from the plain text version for example the first few characters and you will use that to regenerate the hash and compare the two

174081
crypt	salt
openssl crypt you password with an algorithm and a salt

174081
hash	salt
the salt is given in the resulting hash

174081
hash	salt
if i want to verif you know passwd foo i need to compare resulting hash using passwd option with salt

174091
ubuntu	linux	mouse	keyboard
i updated my ubuntu linux to 14.04 and now the mouse and keyboard don t work in the login screen

174108
filesystems	ntfs
where filesystems is likely to be given the size of the partition one of ntfs exfat or less likely vfat

174108
filesystems	hfs
and search the internet for filesystems recovery for the filesystems used by os x most probably hfs plus

174112
spaces	delimiter
the splitting is done with ifs as the delimiter which contains a spaces newline and tab by default

174114
chown	chmod
give permissions to web server chmod chown

174114
chown	chmod
and the chmod chown method may be not sufficient when you are using in parallel the symfony console in cli under my user account and the web web server user this cause a lot of problems because symfony is constantly modifying permissions

174164
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian and other distributions with apt you can use

174167
punctuation	words
is there a way to combine that with so that words with capital letters aren t duplicated and punctuation is removed

174249
sudo	passwd
if you don t want a passwd prompt use plain sudo

174249
sudoers	visudo
run visudo to create an entry in the sudoers file with the nopasswd tag

174255
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
on modern linux systems acl support is enabled by default in the filesystem but you may need to install the acl utilities getfacl and setfacl on debian ubuntu mint you may need to install the acl package

174284
virtualenv	tox
for python s gtk bindings this did not work for me and i needed some way to test code using tox which builds the virtualenv for you with --no-site-packages

174284
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
for this i created an installable package ruamel.venvgtk that sets up the proper links for python2.7 and python3.4 on debian based systems ubuntu linux mint

174330
mkdir	chdir
where it s not efficient is that mkdir -p a b c will attempt some mkdir a and possibly stat a and chdir a and same for a b even if a b existed beforehand

174344
udp	tcp
this machine opened tcp and udp ports for skype over upnp

174345
coldfusion	railo
this was one of the main problems when i build a plugin for cpanel ndeploy.in which provides railo a coldfusion alternative and i ended up creating certain folders like web-inf and logs in the application_root using root privilege .ofcourse if the cf app has to write something to the application_root that folder must have a 777 permission or write permission for nobody at the least

174347
range	max	rank	max
the salaries file contains sam s john s and max s salaries while range contains your range and rank 2000 to 4000 is deputy 4000 to 6000 is secretary and so on

174352
cinnamon	gnome
i guess this is because your older hardware may not have 3d-acceleration so desktop environments like cinnamon gnome or unity won t work

174363

and this is what the timeout errors look like on a debian kbsd freebsd kernel system same host same situation different vm

174401
sudo	passwd
it is much safer to login with your username and then use sudo whenever you need it this requires intruders to find both the username and the passwd while the root username is famous already

174413
emacs	aquamacs
i started to think that this might be a special feature of gui versions of emacs such as aquamacs but i am pretty sure that i have seen screenshots of what appear to be ubuntu unity terminal windows with similar box highlights

174435
bash	tcsh
tiny core linux currently has bash and tcsh

bash	zsh

174485
rpm	yum
for anyone with some experience in package management with yum it is natural to expect that the following command-line would recursively download a package rpm and all its dependencies

174520
debian	centos
so if you really want a stable release for a very long time go with servers distros like debian or centos - in enterprise deployment of new version is very expensive and because of that support is longer

since the distribution is based on debian like ubuntu i suppose it should be easy integrate the same features in my ubuntu installation but how do i do this and what packages includes kali

children	parent
but if you kill a parent the signal should be relayed down to children when the parent dies and the children should exit as well -- but there are cases where the children processes may ignore the signal via traps or similar mechanisms and may continue to run an will be inherited by the init process or similar. but this subject of process behavior can get complex and i ll just leave it there.

debian	linux
i installed a new debian linux 7.7 in a virtual machine with bridged networking on a windows 7 host

btw the problem as stated occurs with bash and zsh

174690
sudo	passwd
however when i haven t entered my passwd for sudo recently it prompts me for the passwd

174690

my solution to this is to run sudo ls or something else that prompts me for my passwd so that the piped commands will work without asking me to enter it

174843
ubuntu	linux
so i have my arch linux partion on dev sda1 and i have my windows partition on dev sda4 when i used ubuntu i could easily move files from ubuntu to my windows system and access them however whenever i mount my windows sstem on arch i don t have permissions to move the files even run a root

174855
jobs	cron
beware though that adding some restrictions in global pam authorisation will potentially prevent running cron jobs as those users

xen	openvz
by contrast vms based on openvz a xen competitor must keep a particular kernel version running because it s been patched to match the host os s kernel

174879
config	ini
the config stuff is in the ini file which is read at start-up so you can t switch on the fly this way

daemons	systemd
you had to configure the service with your systemd which is probably your main systemd service starter restarter daemons

174938
gentoo	ubuntu
is there a way i could generate a kernel module list in ubuntu then do the kernel compiling on gentoo so it s done with my bootstrapped toolchain

174988

it seems working for some of the daemons in my systemd

175026
centos	linux
distribution and samba version in use centos linux 7

175035
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu and debian usbcore is compiled in the kernel so create entries on etc modprobe.d will not work we need to change the kernel boot parameters

175039
daemon	cron
your middle-man can be a daemon or even a cron job

175041
redhat	fedora
it should be available in your repo for a redhat centos fedora machine if it is not already installed

175046
sudoers	visudo
in the default sudoers file visudo it says that members of the group admin is able to gain root privileges and members of the group sudo is able to sudo

you don t need to restart the crond daemon every time when you write a new cron job

175094
filesystems	ntfs
the algorithm for optimal fragmentation will differ for each filesystems type ext2 ntfs but will generally involve placing fragments of a file in contiguous blocks for disk-based storage devices

postgresql	mysql
and the content of your databases - mysql mariadb postgresql probably located somewhere in var but it may be better to do the backup with the database-server or a suitable program for dumping the databases

175152
debian	linux
also i am on debian gnu linux jessie sid and most packages are pretty cleanly installed

175194
cpu	processors
the speed performance is still negligible against most hardware access times but it can be observed when the hardware isn t the bottleneck especially as many hardware operations can be performed asynchronously while the main processors is doing something else whereas context switches and data copies between processes keep the cpu busy

175200
bash	zsh
csh bash ksh zsh have a suspend builtin command or alias in ksh that does exactly that

175200
bash	zsh
bash and zsh do a bit of additional signal handler and juggling and in these shells the suspend command works even if the shell is currently ignoring tstp

175209
packets	pcap
first i ve captured packets of my open access point with airodump-ng and saved them to a pcap file and dsniff worked easily with no error but now i am trying to capture with wireshark and dsniff is giving an error and not working

move	drag
regular click and drag means pulling it over from the right side every time since as soon as i click on it to move it it immediately jumps to the right

175234
ubuntu	debian
install using your package manager e.g on debian ubuntu sudo apt-get install python-lzma this is the backport of the the standard lzma module that appeared in python3.3

175239
debian	linux
however it seems that my linux debian doesn t recognise it at all and any other usb-drive though it powers it

175239
ubuntu	linux
the usb-hubs are ok because i was able to boot from that usb and install a new linux however neither my old distribution i had ubuntu nor the new one can recognise the usb

175281
xmonad	xmobar
you don t have to start xmobar from xmonad but if you want to show the output provided by xmonad.hooks.dynamiclog for instance it s easier to start it from there

175284
ubuntu	linux
each node is an instance of an ubuntu linux virtual machine and runs a master process which takes care of forwarding the code to be executed to a number of worker processes 1 for each core

in ubuntu i use apt-get install python-dev or in yum yum install python-devel but there is no package in zypper like zypper in python-dev

175326
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
osx has a different stat utility the one from freebsd netbsd openbsd with a similar purpose but different options and a different output format

175328
chown	chmod
it assumes find sort uniq awk mawk and gawk should work id bash chown chmod and so on to be available and to understand all the command line switches it is using

175329
disk	ram
if the ram passes the disk is the next most likely culprit

175333
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if your sudoers file doesn t set the requiretty option then you can call sudo from anywhere but if it prompts for a passwd a terminal is required

175333
sudo	passwd
the message â œsudo no tty present and no askpass program specifiedâ indicates that sudo tried to prompt you for a passwd but failed

175333
sudo	passwd
you can pass the -a option to tell sudo to use a different method to prompt you for a passwd

this correctly happens after 5 minutes as i have already set in system settings power management energy saving checked screens energy saving switching off after 5 min

175360
vim	textmate
one of the first very famous and still widely used vim plugins is snipmate inspired by the textmate editor

175379
wav	flac
both wav and flac formats are lossless which means they do not lose any quality from an original music cd

175379
wav	flac
wav however is uncompressed while flac uses a lossless compression mechanism pretty much like a zip lossless compression specifically designed for efficient packing of audio data

175379
mp3	flac
flac files can then be played with your favorite player just like ordinary mp3 s

175379
wav	flac
if you already have wav files then you simply need to convert them to flac and not worry about losing quality

175380
daemons	systemd
from my question it was clear that i cannot easily decide the features of a daemon.i have read in different articles and from different forums that service --status-all command can be used to list all the daemons in my systemd

175380
daemons	systemd
but i do not think that the command is listing all daemons because networkmanager a daemons which is currently running in my ubuntu 14.04 systemd is not listed by the command

175381
filesystems	btrfs
for a start i would like to use btrfs as a dumb filesystems which supports data checksums without using its advanced features such as raid subvolume snapshots send receive etc

175381
filesystems	btrfs
is it actually recommended to use btrfs as filesystems for backup purposes

175406
disk	ram
the process is still running it is being listed using the ps command but its state has been written on disk to free some ram space

175427
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
both on ubuntu 12.04 nor on linux mint 17 there seems to be a default etc tmux.conf file in which case the compiled in default values are taken

175479
freebsd	linux
on linux systems that have gnu coreutils installed or on freebsd 8.3

175486
filesystems	btrfs
in order to demonstrate and test the back references btrfs devel team has added an online resizer which can both grow and shrink the filesystems via the btrfs commands

175507
width	height
an aspect ratio is simply the width of something divided by the height typically expressed as a fraction

175507
width	height
a storage aspect ratio sar is the ratio of width to height in pixels of the stored image or video

175507
width	height
the documentation tells us that ow is the output width 720 from the part oh the output height 480 from the part

175507
width	height
iw and ih are the input width and height respectively

175507
width	height
ow - iw is thus the number of pixels we re adding to the width and similarly oh - ih for the height

175507
width	height
the option specifies the new output width and option specifies the height

175507
width	height
the width and the height formulas are the same just with the height and width swapped

175507
width	height
so multiplying the target width in pixels by the dar gives us how wide it d be if we scaled the video to have the target height â hâ and square pixels as well

175516
sudo	passwd
at least - so long as neither sudo nor su needs stdin to read a passwd - that should get log_f declared

175536
width	height
when viewing it in any pdf viewer the page s width is greater than the height

175536
width	height
but it seems like all the pdf applications i have tried mistake the width as the height and the height as the width for this pdf file see below.

175536
width	height
how can i repair the pdf file so that the pdf applications don t mix its width and height

175536
width	height
the following command shows the width is smaller than the height in points

175536
width	height
the following command shows the width is smaller than the height in pixels

175537
addition	multiplication
this is parsed as 1 + 2 ã 4 since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

175537
bash	zsh
other shells ksh bash zsh treat the value of a as a subexpression which is evaluated to get the value to use in the main expression

175561
ifs	ash	ifs	dash	bash	zsh
some shells may inherit ifs from environment dash ash some don t bash zsh ksh

175610
ubuntu	linux
some application on my system ubuntu linux 13.0 is hijacking a specific keyboard shortcut ctrl+space

175623
disk	ram
the main reason i think is that cache dirty pages can take up to 60 ram by default and when this limit is reached the kernel suddenly want to flash 6gb dirty pages to disk which effectively kills the performance

175638
tiff	png	gif	png
i have one directory with lots pictures in different formats - jpg gif png tiff and svg

175683
udp	tcp
be careful when changing these values because being able to retransmit when an ack is not received for an existing connection is a large part of the difference between tcp and udp and there s a reason everybody likes using tcp

175729
folder	directory
change the directory to unzipped folder

175734
filesystems	xfs
you should not use xfs filesystems for grub2

175734
filesystems	xfs
grub2-install error hostdisk dev loop7 appears to contain a xfs filesystems which isn t known to reserve space for dos-style boot

175734
filesystems	xfs
the only thing i could gather from google with the limited time and knowledge i had was that the superblock of an xfs filesystems is held in the first sector where the bootloader has to be and that makes the xfs unsuitable for grub2 or grub

175778
versioning	upgrade
it is imperative that you upgrade to a newer versioning

175779
mp3	flac
it is configured to create both flac and mp3 output files as i want to have a lossless archive of my cds in case they get damaged or lost

175779
mp3	flac
now to the problem while the flac files get the correct play times written in their metadata all of my mp3 files get wrong durations written in their tags

175783
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to boot install kali linux in virtualbox under elementary os based on ubuntu 12 as host on a 64 bits computer

175783
disk	ram
i ve tried quite a few things to solve the problem such as remove virtualbox reinstall remove again build from sources install countless dependencies that might be useful check linux headers verify sha1 checksums of the images change virtual ram and disk size change disk type from dynamically allocated to fixed and i m still stuck

175809
post	get
i tried matching the post get calls to be exactly like that on the browser by adding --header for each header i got from the http call extracted from chrome s developer tools but it still didn t work

zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
but some shells behave differently and can either abort the command if the wildcards match nothing default behavior in csh tcsh zsh and fish â except that when there are several consecutive patterns it s ok for some of them to match nothing as long as at least one does match a file or expand wildcards matching nothing to nothing n glob modifier or null_glob shell option in zsh n pattern option in ksh nullglob shell option in bash

175835
bash	zsh
the bash â œmagic aliasesâ described by simon tatham simulate zsh s noglob

ubuntu	debian	debian-based	ubuntu
since kali is based on debian you can use apt-offline ways to update ubuntu debian-based distros offline

175877
ubuntu	linux
it has been done under ubuntu 12.04 lts amd64 but it should work or be easily adapted on many linux flavours

175894
tunnel	vpn
set up routes on rhel-router to send traffic through vpn tunnel if connection goes to your university subnet and default connection through dd-wrt-router otherwise

175901
ubuntu	linux
i d like to add an alias to a kernel module make nvidia-343 available as nvidia on ubuntu 14.10 with linux 3.18.1 so that it can be loaded under the alias name and so that the alias appear in the list of aliases in modinfo

175949
versioning	upgrade
one of the most common problems newcomers to arch face is not understanding this relationship and then finding that they are unable to upgrade because their local database does not match the current repositories so pacman will complain about being unable to find versioning xx of a package

175950
debian	linux
i m using a distribution of debian linux called crunchbang below is main information of my laptop which may help

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am trying to install cloudera manager 5.x on linux mint 17.1 based on ubuntu 14.04 lts

175977
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
how can i make linux mint appear as ubuntu to let it install on my system

175989
ubuntu	linux
i have a galaxy pocket and i want to run ubuntu 13.10 but when i try to start using linux complete installer here is what i get

175991
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
in linux mint the same file for the ubuntu version it was derived is under etc upstream-release lsb-release

176001
bash	zsh
i am primarily interested in bash and zsh but it would be great to know how to do this in other mainstream shells

176002
umask	mount
the purpose of the umask option of mount is to set visible permissions of every file on the filesystem when the filesystem itself does not support unix permissions usually permissions are stored in the filesystem when it supports it

176002
umask	mount	filesystems	ntfs
that is why umask option of mount exists for ntfs this filesystems does not support unix permissions while it has no reason to exit for ext4 which does support unix permissions

176012
bash	zsh
it belongs to bash not zsh

176013
debian	linux
happens with every debian based flavour of linux i tried in a year or so x86 and x64 across different pcs wired and wireless

176014
udp	tcp
that prints all tcp and udp sockets and selects for something that ends in a colon and port number you re after

176021
chown	sudo
make that group the owner of the passphrase file sudo chown readpass thatfile

176023
chown	sudoers
then chown the file to them and have the etc sudoers make bob be that special user

176042
apache	nginx
you need a reverse proxy 1 like that nginx or apache can do

176090
bonjour	avahi
their are several names used for this service such as mdns bonjour and avahi

176097
folder	directory
so i tried to find a way to use the unzip those files from my external hard drive and into my music directory in my home folder using the terminal

176125
folder	directory
how can i compress a directory content without compress the full path folder structure too

176125
folder	directory
i am using this command to zip a folder content under var www directory but when i unzip the application.zip i got a 2 level folder structure

176131
folder	directory
how can i copy all files in a given folder including all subfolders into an icloud drive directory using a terminal command

176131
dropbox	icloud
should it not be possible to log into icloud drive using terminal dropbox would be an alternative

176163
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
this is supported in bash zsh tcsh and undoudtedly others

176179
filesystems	ntfs
entry in for the ntfs filesystems in etc fstab

176214
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr namely 2 to the current destination of stdout at this point the terminal

176214
stdout	stderr
so in this case stderr goes to the terminal and stdout goes to a file which isn t what you probably want

176214
stdout	stderr
then redirect stderr to the same destination as stdout somefile

176214
stdout	stderr
in this last case both stderr and stdout go to somefile which is probably what you want

176216
stdout	stderr
on this so thread and a few other threads i have seen the following commands for redirecting stdout and stderr to a file

176224
stdout	stderr
as you might have read in both the duplicate posts the one in the comment and the one in your post they all redirect stderr to stdout which inturn is redirected to the file logfile ie the logfile will contain both the output and errors

176224
bash	zsh
all the three styles of redirections works well in the same way in bash and zsh

176225
disk	ram
if you are out of ram the swap space will use disk as virtual memory

176228
ubuntu	opensuse
i switched from ubuntu 14.04 with unity to opensuse 13.2 with gnome 3.14 desktop

176228
swt	swing
the problem is when i change the cursor theme gtk and java swt apps accepts the new theme while swing and qt still on the old theme

176233
kde	kubuntu
i run kde kubuntu 14.10

176242
pthreads	fork
there is a lengthy discussion of interactions between fork and signals in pthreads

176252
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
to install mutate in ubuntu 15.04 14.10 14.04 linux mint 17.1 17 via ppa

opensuse	linux	opensuse	mint
i have a dual-boot installation opensuse 13.2 linux mint 17.1 on asus k55vd both 64-bit

176285
ubuntu	opensuse
i had this problem on all distributions i tried ubuntu fedora opensuse having kernel 3.14 or above

176310
redhat	fedora
as to what they all are there is a section about naming conventions in that wikipedia article although this is not binding or universal they may be renamed from userspace which redhat fedora derived udev installations will do

176322
fish	bash
bash and fish scripts are not compatible but i would like to have a file that defines some some environment variables to be initialized by both bash and fish

176322
fish	bash
i could then just source it in bash and make a script that converts it to fish format and sources that in fish

176322
fish	bash
i was thinking that there may be a better solution than this so i m asking for better way of sharing environment variables between bash fish

176322
fish	bash
here is an example .env file that i would like both fish and bash to handle using ridiculous-fish s syntax assume bin and bin2 are empty directories

176328
subnet	packets
if the dnatting system happens to be the router for its subnet and the dnat target is outside the subnet then snat is not necessary as the reply packets reach the system anyway

176331
fish	bash
bash has special syntax for setting environment variables while fish uses a builtin

176331
fish	bash
note that path will require some special handling since it s an array in fish but a colon delimited string in bash

176347
folder	directory
home directory and how to allow access to only one ntfs folder of already mounted partition for specific user

176348
stdout	stderr
â œevery file has three of them stdin stdout stderr â is nonsense

176348
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are the names for file descriptors 0 1 and 2 because they have a conventional meaning stdin standard input is where the program is supposed to read user input if it wants to stdout standard output is where the program is supposed to write the data that it produces if it wants to and stderr standard error is for error messages

176365
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
htop is linux only software and apparently works on freebsd and netbsd via linux compatibility layer probably only on 32bit

176365

openbsd linux comp 386 only is on the life support

176366
filesystems	ntfs
i wanted to securely remove the files but i realize that was not certain on a journaled filesystems ntfs

176370
mp3	flac
if it is mp3 to flac you will see a cutoff around 16-18khz where the spectrogram gets blocky

176375
sudo	passwd
this affects all places where a passwd is required - terminal mdm login su sudo in terminal cinnamon-screensaver lockscreen pkexec - everywhere

176375
sudo	passwd
even canceling a su sudo passwd prompt in terminal with c or d takes a long time

176398
public	protected
i have a raspberrypi with raspbian and i want that a public www-folder is protected by htpasswd and that php files are passed correcly and the .htpasswd and .db files are denied to all

176429
filesystems	hfs+
not all of the tools will work with hfs+ though i m assuming that is the filesystems you have

176457
kde	gnome
i experienced it in kde and gnome and i m wondering

176473
folder	directory
then i realized that the folder i moved was using other files from the downloads directory so i tried to move it back

176485
filesystems	ntfs
does whether a filesystems ntfs needs defragmentation depend on

176485
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems type ntfs itself

debian	linux
i m not too experienced with linux on personal computers but i ve recently installed debian jessie on my laptop using gnome 3

176528
folder	directory
after running ecryptfs-recover-private --rw . and doing some basic tasks on the mounted directory it seems that all files have been deleted somehow yet the folder structure remains

176528
folder	directory
run diff -r a b | less where a is the mounted private directory and b is a similar folder on another drive

176534

on linux you can get a list of all the sockets that are in listen connecting connected or partially closed state and their local and remote addresses and ports by reading the files proc net tcp proc net tcp6 proc net udp and proc net udp6

176610
stdout	stderr
this means the input has to come from somewhere else and the output both stdout and stderr should go somewhere else

176610
stdout	stderr
the last part is redirecting stderr to stdout

176626
mouse	keyboard
after installing linux mint cinnamon 17.1 32 bit on my vaio z laptop the mouse and keyboard start working for a few seconds then freeze and continue to work very intermittently

176626
mouse	keyboard
both mouse and keyboard work fine on the liveusb and work in bios

176630
sudo	passwd
if i remember correctly in ubuntu some applications like synaptic and update manager ask for sudo passwd only when if needed

176630
sudo	passwd
how do i configure the system so i can launch for instance update manager as normal user and only provide sudo passwd when the system is to be updated

176638
sudoers	visudo
use visudo to configure your etc sudoers file

176645
debian	mint	debian	linux
my linux mint debian edition now broke

176659
ethernet	wireless
i know that the opposite configuration works out of the box where machines connected to the laptop via ad hoc wireless connection will have internet if the laptop is connected via ethernet cable

176684
udp	tcp
and for 2 if you don t want to use a shubshell and know if the remote server runs nfsv3 or nfsv4 and if tcp or udp you could query for that specifically with rpcinfo

176715
postfix	dovecot
i try to setup postfix and dovecot with sasl authentication but i get the following error when i connect with telnet port 25 to the server

176715
postfix	dovecot
after some investigation it appears that the socket file var spool postfix private auth is not created by postfix dovecot

176715
postfix	dovecot
so i m not sure why private var is not created by dovecot or postfix

176727
freebsd	linux
the linux kernel should really provide an interface that s guaranteed to deliver crypto-quality randomness and blocks only if entropy is genuinely lacking like freebsd s dev random

176728
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you can configure sudo not to require a passwd for specific commands by adding a sudoers rule with the nopasswd tag

176729
filesystems	ntfs
the bug is triggered by the fact that you have an ntfs filesystems on the root of the disk ie the filesystems begins right at the start of the disk

176729
filesystems	ntfs
normally this would work fine with other filesystems but it seems that the fact it is ntfs has the kernel confused

176729
filesystems	ntfs
instead of recognising the ntfs filesystems and passing over it it instead recognises it as an mbr partition table and proceeds to create some device files relating to non-existent partitions

176729
filesystems	ntfs
the alternative of course is to reformat the disk and either put a partition table and an ntfs filesystems on it or just use a different filesystems

176729
filesystems	ntfs
if this is the case having an ntfs filesystems that doesn t work with windows on a disk that doesn t work well in linux probably isn t much use

176729
filesystems	ntfs
it would be useful to reproduce the bug in case it doesn t appear with every ntfs filesystems

176732
postfix	dovecot
i am using this tutorial to set up postfix and dovecot on a centos 7 web server

176732
postfix	dovecot
how do i go about setting up permissions for dovecot and postfix to be able to work properly in centos 7

176732
chown	chmod
i know about adduser chmod chown octal permissions and other commands but i do not know how they all apply to this specific requirement and i do not want to create ineffective things by experimenting without understanding

176732
chown	sudo
i then ran sudo chown -r newusername newusername home newusername and then again repeated but still got the following error

176732
postfix	dovecot
a more complete solution will be to set up an selinux rule allowing postfix and dovecot to function before this goes into production

176742
tunnel	packets
this is easy to route outgoing packets onto the tunnel interface tunl0 configured for the purpose

176759
lvm	btrfs
btrfs includes lvm functionality but you ve gone and stacked that on top of linux s lvm2 layer and put that on top of a hardware raid-6 system

176788
hide	show
but there s a problem with this approach let s say you create a 10mb container with 6mb hidden volume if you create a filesystem after enabling hidden volume protection you will get a 4mb volume and this will show as 4mb even if you mount the outer volume it should show the 10mb so we would have a problem with plausible deniability what s the use of having a hidden volume if you can t hide the used space for hidden volume

176801
folder	directory
why not simply extract that to your home folder into .themes directory

176812
ubuntu	debian
there is an xprintidle utility available as a package at least in debian and ubuntu that will do this

176812
mouse	keyboard
it gives you the number of milliseconds since last keyboard or mouse activity

176824
crypt	hash
the hash you ve provided even looks like a crypt hash

176824
crypt	hash
crypt hash are typically the weakest possible hash for a variety of reasons

176842
xfce	kde
i ve grepped through the kde and xfce conf directories too

176843
lvm	btrfs
the basic plan is to have btrfs on lvm on luks on raid1 with lvmcache in writeback mode thrown in for the root partition to reduce disk access

176843
lvm	btrfs
btrfs snapshots could be used instead of lvm but as of writing this there is no way to add a ssd caching device to btrfs

176843
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs filesystems

176846
xfce	gnome
running xfce here but the same probably applies with gnome terminals

176861
ubuntu	debian
in debian and ubuntu this can be accomplished with debootstrap

176875
pipe	file-descriptor
...and so we can see that the shell is doing the substitution and readlink is reading from an an anoymous pipe that it opens on file-descriptor 63

176889
postfix	dovecot
i just set up postfix and dovecot on a centos 7 server using this tutorial

176905
put	get
if the machine is put into sleep and then resumed i get a black screen

176933
bash	subshell
pgrep bash | xargs ps -fp will get the same result but without a subshell

176935
opensuse	linux	opensuse	mint
i am using opensuse and linux mint 17.1 and

176945
flac	ogg
the same happens when converting ogg to flac or presumably any combination of the formats

176948
mp3	ogg
ogg â mp3 -map_metadata 0 s 0

176948
mp3	flac
flac â mp3 -map_metadata 0 g 0

176948
flac	ogg
flac â ogg -map_metadata -0

176952
ubuntu	linux
an ubuntu 14.04 linux file server with samba configured

176952
chown	chmod
i understand that by default in linux the user that created the file is the owner of the file so i get where the errors are coming from and i know how to correct it manually chown and chmod and then any user can manipulate the files fine

176952
chown	sudo
i changed the group of the directory media data photos to nogroup sudo chown nobody nogroup media data photos

176952
put	get
after this files that are put in the shares seem to get the right group assignment ls -l shows nogroup for the new files and subdirectories

176972
imagemagick	graphicsmagick	etsy	flickr
you can also try graphicsmagick which is a well maintained fork of imagemagick used at flickr and etsy

176975
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 7.7

x86	64bit
the system page size is 4 kib on x86 including 64bit processors

176996
mp3	flac
i have a number of flac files that i m converting into mp3 files with the following

176996
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
is there a utility which will copy vorbis flac and ogg metadata convert it to appropriate id3 tags and tag an mp3 with the same tags as the flac file

177005
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
we have mostly all client machines in linux ubuntu centos

177054
sudo	passwd
is it possible to write a script that run su or sudo command without typing passwd

177055
sudo	passwd
you can use sudo with the -s option to give the passwd through standard input instead of the terminal device

177055
sudo	passwd
for example you can write down the passwd in a file and then do cat mypass.txt | sudo -s your_command

177060
kate	gedit
using n to represent a newline works in gedit and most other editors i ve tried it should work in kate too does it

177063
debian	linux
a live cd dvd usb shouldn t touch the hard drive when booting at least every linux i ve seen doesn t tested debian red hat based others shouldn t either

177067
dpkg	apt
apparently some change to apt or dpkg hopefully fixed with a newer upstream version

177067
dpkg	apt
there may be an updated version of apt you could try by manually browsing your repos stable or stable-updates would be best sticking to whatever is default supported for your distro should give the best results and download an updated apt .deb and install it with dpkg since it appears your apt may be unable to do so itself

177082
freebsd	opensuse
while accessing a drive with high error rates as for example here for opensuse in freebsd the system eventually disconnects the drive and it disappears from dev

177089
ubuntu	mint
could be problems with uefi if your computer has that see this ubuntu help page mint s based on ubuntu the ubuntu techniques usually work for more info

177107
centos	linux
i m trying to configure linux in this case centos to automatically connect to the nearest wifi via push-button-connect

177110
mouse	keyboard
the catch that i feel like i would probably run into is that my mouse keyboard as input devices specified in my xorg.conf file would no longer be allowed to share between the two different x instances

177121
kde	gnome
also if you want to enable kde or gnome network configuration applet you need to enable

177177
rpm	yum
i tried yum clean all and rpm --rebuilddb

177178
gentoo	linux
- research the basic building blocks of a distro by trying arch gentoo or some linux from scratch approach which would help fixing the issues above

177198
spaces	delimiter
a g lobal substitution is going to divide up a pattern spaces into individual fields delimiter per your specifications and operate on each

177203
bash	zsh
these methods works fine at least in zsh and bash

177209
freebsd	linux
a userspace virtual terminal aimed at replicating linux and freebsd pc-bsd kernel virtual terminals

177210
mouse	keyboard
i use debian ppc on an old mac mini g4 it currently serve as a dlna server upnp no mouse or keyboard plugged

177210
mouse	keyboard
as a last resort i could plug in a keyboard but i am looking for a solution without mouse or keyboard

177236
mp3	wav
there are many people out there who asked the same question but the only answers i found was converting to wav and then use lameenc to convert it back to mp3

177255
versioning	upgrade
note i needed the latest versioning of apache that was not yet supported by my versioning of ubuntu and i did not want to upgrade my versioning of ubuntu

177256
versioning	upgrade
edit as mentioned by faker the problem with this is that when you upgrade using apt and there is a new versioning of apache2 the compiled versioning will be overwritten

177256
ubuntu	debian
bazaar.launchpad.net ubuntu-branches ubuntu trusty apache2 trusty view head debian rules

177271
cinnamon	gnome
i use eye of gnome on linux mint 17.1 cinnamon

177281
bash	subshell
your subshell issue is going to occur in most shells but it is by far most acute in a bash shell

177281
subshell	dash
...and the way i wrote it above in several shells for a ceiling of 101 and dash did it without the subshell in .017 seconds and with the subshell in 1.8 seconds

177281
bash	zsh
busybox .149 and 2 zsh .149 and 4 bash .35 and 6 and ksh93 in .149 and .160

177286
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
but that method fails on ubuntu and maybe mint which are the most common linux distributions

177307
mouse	keyboard
no mouse or keyboard input can t switch to another tty nothing

177307
mouse	keyboard
i m desperate so i just switched out the mouse if it happens again the keyboard is next

177309
stdout	stderr
may i output both stdout and stderr on console screen and store one of them into a log file

177309
stdout	stderr
i can output stderr and catch stdout into log file by

177309
stdout	stderr
i can output both of stdout and stderr and catch all of them into a log file by

177309
stdout	stderr
how to just output stdout and catch stderr into file

177311
stdout	stderr
similarly if you want to catch stdout into a file and leave stderr untouched.

177312
stdout	stderr
how to just output stdout and catch stderr into file

177312
stdout	stderr
one way to do that is to swap stdout and stderr

177312
stdout	stderr
then pipes stderr to the tee command while sending stdout to file handle 3

177312
stdout	stderr
i can output stderr and catch stdout into log file by

177316
folder	directory
when i check the directory there is no mysql folder

177322
gentoo	linux
i am running firefox esr 31.2.0 on gentoo linux on an amd64 computer with 8 gb ram

177326
ubuntu	linux
i have purchased a dell laptop with ubuntu linux 12.04 installed in it and i want to install microsoft windows operating system on ubuntu and have dual booting

177328
children	parent
you just don t see them because most parent processes clean up their children very quickly

177328
children	parent
the parent calls wait and or waitpid to learn the status of the children that exited

177343
bash	zsh
it s very weird that after switching to zsh from bash i can t access root

177343
bash	zsh
but after switching root shell from bash to zsh when i try to login via su i got

177361
children	parent
as the sus says quoted in one of the other answers here so i won t quote it again the parent process of orphaned children is set to an implementation-defined process

177361
freebsd	linux	children	parent
so there are exceptions and fairly prominent ones on linux freebsd pc-bsd and dragonfly bsd the parent process of orphaned children is set to the nearest ancestor process of the child that is marked as a subreaper or process #1 if there is no ancestor subreaper process

177361
daemons	systemd
various daemons supervision utilities â including systemd the one whose developers put this into the linux kernel in the first place upstart and the nosh service-manager â already make use of this

177364
mouse	keyboard
it looks like the vnc client can pass keyboard and mouse events and can receive frame buffer updates but for some reason the application running on the server does not seem to process keyboard events

177368
sudo	passwd
the error you receive is due to the use of sudo remotely you d be asked for the passwd but you don t have a tty to enter it

177368
sudo	passwd
you can solve the problem by giving yourself rights to execute dd as sudo without a passwd

177378
debian	mint
is there a reason that you don t use the standard debian based package manager for mint

177384
stdout	stderr
this means that cat is displaying the output of stdout straight away whereas it is putting stderr into it s buffer and then displaying it at the command termination

177387
kde	gnome
but i also hear that gnome 3 and possibly kde can get things going nicely

177387
kde	gnome
i3wm isn t as gui-intensive as gnome 3 and kde

177387
kde	gnome
gnome 3 and kde seem to have a bigger community support around them

177387
kde	gnome
is it safe to assume that since i3wm isn t as heavy as gnome or kde no issues could come about

177401
stdio	fflush
ping does not call fflush after writing out the lines that report timed out packets so stdio buffers those lines until ping calls exit which then sends them all to cat which outputs them

177411
fontconfig	cairo
it provides pdf rendering functionality as a shared library and uses modern components from freedesktop.org such as fontconfig and cairo to take advantage of modern unix desktops

177413
chown	chmod
another option and the more conventional one is simply to make a new group vonflyneeandfoo add both users to it chown -r the directory to that group chmod g+s the directory so that new files inherit its group and then chmod -r g+rx dir to give the files group write permission

177438
sudo	passwd
when we run a command by sudo the passwd is asked

177438
sudo	passwd
if the sudo is not typed the passwd should not be asked

177468
folder	directory
at this point the error message when i tried to create a folder changed from 550 create directory failed i m paraphrasing to 550 permission denied

177468
chown	chmod
at this point i tried using chown and chmod to recursively change the group ownership to a group that my user was in and give my user write permission

177485
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i know linux mint ubuntu debian crunchbang can probably any debian-derived distro or arch or red hat i think they all can install cryptsetup one way or the other

177494
subshell	ifs
this runs in a sub shell to that the internal field separator ifs 1 is not changed outside of the subshell 2

177504
centos	linux
i have a linux machine centos 5.8 on which i have installed multiple applications and tools with yum and few others after compiling the source code on it

177517
filesystems	btrfs
i m fairly new to both gnu linux and btrfs but i ve decided i want to make my next computer a desktop with one hdd use linux with btrfs as the filesystems

177525
stdout	stderr
i have come to understand that we have two methods of redirecting both stdout and stderr to the same file

177525
stdout	stderr
as the author of this book states using this method we perform 2 redirections first we redirect stdout to ls-output.txt and then we redirect stderr file descriptor 2 to stdout using file descriptor 1

177525
stdout	stderr
first the command ls -l bin sends its output to stdout and error to stderr any one of those

177539
barrier	scheduling
video lectures on real-time systems task scheduling memory compression memory barrier smp

177539
verilog	vhdl
knowledge of assembly for your particular architecture and a fair knowledge of vlsi hardware description languages like vhdl or verilog will help you in the long run

177539
profiling	debugging
video lectures on kernel debugging and profiling core dump analysis multicore debugging with gdb controlling multi-core race conditions debugging electronics

177539
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs the linux b-tree filesystems - ohad rodeh

177548
filesystems	ntfs
does the command mount -o bind allow mounting a folder from a different filesystems vfat ntfs to a folder in linux native partition

177549
xfs	ntfs
well i ve made a quick test on my system mounting a ntfs partition from windows onto a directory in a xfs linux partition and it worked okay

177558
xfs	btrfs
now i m using btrfs for the root and xfs for the home partition because of opensuse as you pointed out

177574
centos	solaris
i am trying to install an hp nc364t 4 port ethernet adapter onto a machine running centos 7 however hp only supplies drivers built for redhat sco suse sun and solaris

177595
debian	linux
system is linux tlinux 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.63-2+deb7u2 x86_64 gnu linux default proprietary nvidia driver from debian stable gnome 3.4.2 in fallback mode

177626
apache	nginx
however i mixed nginx and apache

177630
stdout	stderr
since you redirect stdout to the file first the redirection of stderr inherits that redirection

177630
stdout	stderr
this connects stderr to the original stdout which is likely to be the terminal

177667
ubuntu	debian
party repos and packets debian ubuntu

177687
folder	directory
if you need the whole directory structure of mnt partition www under var www html and home user as in two identical folder that keep each other in sync take a look at bind mounts

177697
versioning	upgrade
how can we configure our systems or reprepro-server contiunue using our sources and upgrade the packages from one versioning to the next

177703
tunnel	packets
i have used two very simple vpn-like client server programs to read write ip packets of the two tun0 interfaces and create a tunnel between wlan0 and eth0 so that ip packets from 10.0.0.2 could reach 10.0.0.1 and vice versa could run ftp from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.2

177704
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i just installed ubuntu kylin 14.04 and during the installation there was an option like install ubuntu replacing linux mint which was the one i chose thinking it would just mess with the partition of linux mint

177704
ubuntu	linux
now i boot in ubuntu and i have a huge partition with linux bootable including the space that was before of the data partition.

177710
kde	gnome
i m using kde 4 and it locks the screen without warning and then it requires password to unlock i need a warning before locking as the gnome before locking the screen it set the screen brightness geting darker and darker you know the screen is ready to be locked

177722
ubuntu	mint
if you had chosen install ubuntu next to mint it would have been possible to have both oss and your data as well

177745
stdout	stderr
i tend to think of a stream as something intrinsic to the program such as stdin stdout and stderr whereas a pipe is external to the program

177758
versioning	upgrade
the virtual machine can be upgrade to the latest versioning in the vmware product which you are using

177790
ubuntu	linux
guest3 - linux ubuntu

177812
ftp	smb
thanks to the underlying kde technologies it can transparently access ftp and sftp servers zip files and other archives smb windows shares and even browse and rip audio cds

177879
stdout	stderr
all output both stdout and stderr from the date command is redirected to the file

177879
stdout	stderr
as a bash extension the symbol is a shortcut indication redirection of both stdout and stderr

177879
stdout	stderr
consequently both stdout and stderr are redirected to the file

177886
folder	directory
i jailed all users to their home directory and shared a folder called shared between all of them

177899
versioning	upgrade
did apt-get update and apt-get upgrade and i noticed when i did apt-get install python it defaulted to versioning 2.7

177908
folder	directory
how do i gather my ebooks from all these different directory and put them all in one folder so i can read and reorganize them

177916
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
with csh tcsh zsh or recent versions of bash try

177926
daemon	cron
to make sure the cron daemon is running and honouring the crontab you could make a small test

177941
centos	linux
el5 stands for enterprise linux 5 red hat enterprise linux version or centos version and el6 accordingly for enterprise linux 6

177943
centos	linux
centos linux release 7.0.1406 core

177943
versioning	upgrade
because this computer is for work i would rather not upgrade software where a previous versioning is crucial for development.

177954
sorting	grouping
this was hardcoded in nautilus as per the devs decision to only show basic type information in the type column by default so that sorting by type would grouping type families

177979
bash	zsh
in either your .bashrc or .zshrc depending whether you use bash or zsh respectively export these two environment variables

177983
disk	ram
the main motivation here is from being near to 100 used ram and freezes happen while i assume ram is swapped onto the disk

177987
filesystems	ntfs
initially on a dual boot system it was possible to write an file on an ntfs partition but on rebooting under windows nt xp you would have to do a filesystems check to get the meta data on disc corrected

178006
ubuntu	centos
the question is similar to this question however the server in this case is running centos as opposed to ubuntu so the tty files and syntax is different

178008
ubuntu	debian
if not to make it the default usually already the case on debian and derivative like ubuntu

178016
coreos	proxmox
i have tried to install coreos to my vm in proxmox i have create a file cloud-config.yaml

178142
nas	qnap
i have a new qnap ts-451 nas with two new 3tb drives installed as a raid 1 pair

178163
octal	decimal
if the number begins with 0 it is considered to be an octal value and 16 in octal is 14 in decimal

178180
rss	feed
failed to receive the open clip art library rss feed

178186
sudo	passwd
i want some of my users to be able to change their passwd with sudo command because at the time they log in they are passwordless ssh keys connection

178186
sudo	passwd
my users have no passwd and this is wanted they can t sudo anything

178186
sudo	passwd
nevertheless i want them to be able to do only one sudo command so they can choose a passwd

178186
sudo	passwd
it means they really can t change their passwd without sudo

178201
centos	linux
on my centos linux release 7.0.1406 the pdf reader doesn t render image colours correctly that s sent from macosx cs adobe acrobat

178209
bash	zsh
bash ksh93 zsh and other recent shells support process substitution the syntax but it is a non-standard extension

178211
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i had a look at linux mint s var lib dhcp based on ubuntu 14.04 folder and the only file there was empty

178220
subnet	packets
i thought it might be possible to use iptables and dnat to change the target to an unused address in the subnet and use ip neigh to set the mac address statically to the one of the other nic but not even the dnat rule is matched for packets to local addresses

178245
pulseaudio	mixer
you might consider installing the pulseaudio sound server to handle multiplexing the device to multiple pieces of software that want to use it and the pavucontrol mixer

178278
folder	directory
1 to allow davis to access and modify all files and folder in the the home directory of john

i m not sure about your sd card problems but if your live linux iso cd dvd usb supports the toram boot option linux mint ubuntu most debian-based ones i think and you have more than about 2gb ram you could use that to copy all the required linux data to ram first then you wouldn t even need the live cd dvd usb to be connected to use live linux system or install

this works in others ubuntu debian opensuse

178355
udp	tcp
a network connection tcp udp sockets

178378
centos	linux
for instance centos and oracle linux support a kernel parameter

178379

i have qemu vms with all sorts of distors ubuntu centos debian opensuse so please feel free to answer my question in whatever fits you best

178385
versioning	upgrade
i ve installed vmware player 64bit versioning 7 upgrade from 6 for both windows 7 and centos 6.5

178385
websphere	ibm
i ve observed that the ram usage goes up as it should on host os when i spin multiple guest vm and also when i spin enterprise applications ibm websphere suite on those guest vm

178395
sudo	passwd
as to passwd changes you will have to use a script that limits activity - sudo cannot do it all

178396
postfix	dovecot
i run a postfix dovecot mail server for personal use

178396
postfix	dovecot
can i configure either postfix or dovecot to listen for that email and run commands on that event

178399
debian	linux
i know it s based on debian but i come from windows so i m new to linux and networking in general

178405
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
when i try to install linux ubuntu or linux mint on my toshiba qosmio x500-10v and i pass the install menu this appears

178405
ubuntu	mint
my laptop has windows 7 installed at the moment and i want to install ubuntu or mint

178409
lvm	btrfs
side note it s not easy to do that actually since when creating an lvm partition the installer ui will not even let you chose encrypt this device you can ungrey the checkbox however by first chosing format partition with anything else but btrfs then go back to do not format this partition and selecting lvm the checkbox is now clickable and it also really does encrypt it.

178433
debian	linux
almost all the tools are available to download use in any linux not just kali many are in debian others repositories

178443
folder	directory
execute against the directory then appears to permit the users to both read write files in the folder which is also what i want

178484
ubuntu	debian
so far i ve tried ubuntu 14.04 ubuntu 12.04 and debian 7.7

178488
width	height
accept a frames per second rate setting and pixel width and height of output video

178492
vorbis	webm
choosing webm with vp8 and vorbis again keeping the default settings the result was ok but at approximately five occasions the whole image pixelated as if watching a low quality dvb-t broadcast

178493
installation	upgrade
after the initial installation i used ports to install compile and update my system and i basically wonder if i can not do the same for a minor upgrade

178502
ubuntu	mint
i m migrating from ubuntu to mint and loving it so far

178520
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
second i ran the command sudo visudo to edit the sudo settings and added to the end of the file to make sudo be required instantly after every new command for those who don t know with default settings if you enter your passwd once to unlock sudo sudo doesn t require a passwd for the couple of minutes

178543
spaces	delimiter
which resulted in 100 lines at 10671 columns a piece delimiter on sequences of spaces

178550
ubuntu	linux
i have two laptops host a and host c with dynamic ip addresses and one desktop host b all of which are running ubuntu linux

178573
ubuntu	centos
i m a little bit surprised on ubuntu and centos the last -t actually behaves as showing logins up till the time specified as opposed to as of the time specified as stated in its man page

178575
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
i suggest you raise a bug against util-linux on ubuntu or debian and centos for the man page

178591
bash	zsh
downside of it is only supported in ksh bash and zsh not in plain bourne posix sh

178596
sudo	passwd
allow sudo without passwd for your user

178621
ubuntu	debian
here s what dpkg on debian and ubuntu does when installing the new version of bin cpio that just came out

178621
int	chars
int rename const chars old const chars new

178661
folder	directory
i plan on using this server for also serving home directory and media folder with hd video and music to a few machines

178661
disk	ram
so basically what i m getting from everybody is that i need a significant portion of the combined size of the virtual disk images in ram or is it disk cache

178661
disk	ram
also is there a way to tune the ram on a linux machine to favor the virtual disk images or any specific files over other freeable memory

178680
filesystems	fat
note that even for filesystems that are not based on inodes fat for instance the kernel driver abstracts it so that the user doesn t have to care about this difference

178685
filesystems	xfs
in xfs filesystems echo chattr +a | xfs_io file.txt

178698
disk	ram
the kernel serves ram in pages for instance 4kb and even shuffles them around a bit a page may be swapped to the hard disk and only restored in ram when you access it

178712
freebsd	linux
it is available by default on freebsd systems and on some but not all linux systems but afaik can be installed as a package on most if not all linux systems

178712
freebsd	linux
i ve tested it on freebsd 10 arch linux

178738
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu or for that matter most other linux distros i could use the shortcut ctrl+t to open a new tab in firefox or similar or i could use alt+tab to make unity switch highlighted window or i could use alt+ctrl+f 1-6 to get to another tty

178738
google-chrome	firefox
for the latter i m assuming that this is only relevant for programs on different levels firefox and the session script might compete but firefox and google-chrome would never compete because they should not both be responding at the same time

178752
uniq	grep
i know that to capture a pipeline s contents at an intermediate stage of processing we use tee as ls bin usr bin | sort | uniq | tee abc.txt | grep out but what if i don t want to redirect the contents after uniq to abc.txt but to screen through stdout ofcourse so that as an end result i ll have on screen the intermediate contents after uniq as well as the contents after grep

178795
ubuntu	centos
target os is either centos or ubuntu

178807
freebsd	linux
there are 64 of these devices in linux 16 in freebsd pc-bsd

178809
bsd	aix
aix most versions of bsd

178820
children	parent
it will report the sum of children plus parent

178823
stdout	stderr
this will duplicate stdout to stderr which typically is your terminal screen but doesn t need to be

178824
ubuntu	mint
i m currently on a macbook using it now so the problem seems specific to the machine the macbook working seems to rule out it being the network and it not working on the ubuntu side and the mint side suggests it s a firmware issue

178845
udp	tcp
most used tcp udp port ports sorted by most bytes tx or rx

178845
udp	tcp
most used tcp udp port ports sorted by most number of packets

178853
filesystems	btrfs
i m trying to compress my btrfs filesystems for all the files i added before adding to etc fstab

178893
ubuntu	linux
any idea how can i make this device to work in linux ubuntu

178949
debian	linux
on my current linux system debian jessie amd64 i m getting different behavior for dd using dev urandom dev random behavior is properly documented

178958
sudo	passwd
or do something easier like putting a su and sudo wrappers into your path before the system ones and thus intercepting the passwd thanks joshua for the comment

178976
ubuntu	mint
i ve been long used to have some custom aliases in my ubuntu mint machines like

178976
folder	directory
what has been changed that -r -d recurse makes grep search for a folder instead of following the man directory option

179011
tiff	bmp
my solution uses gs to extract grayscale bmp files from the pdf convert to threshold those bmps to bw and save them as tiff files and then img2pdf to compress the tiff images and merge them all into one pdf

179011
tiff	bmp
i tried going directly to tiff from the pdf but the quality is not the same so i save each page to bmp

179011
tiff	bmp
keep in mind for large numbers of pages the intermediate bmp and tiff files tend to be large in size

179014
tiff	bmp
my solution uses gs to extract grayscale bmp files from the pdf convert to threshold those bmps to bw and save them as tiff files and then img2pdf to compress the tiff images and merge them all into one pdf

179033
filesystems	ntfs
a small detail both sender and receiver filesystems are ntfs does it make a difference

179045
stdout	stderr
this redirects both stdout and stderr to the log file tmp myscript.log

179063
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you want to modify the etc sudoers file to allow anyone to run df with sudo without needing to know the root passwd

179067
disk	ram
the first os has suspend to ram or disk working the latter not anymore

179067
kde	gnome
edit i have kde gnome lxde

179077
spaces	delimiter
the clumsy reading is done because proc uses null character delimiter instead of spaces and thus makes our life a bit difficult

179102
zypper	yum
i figured there might be a tool or yum yast zypper cmd that does these three steps

179145
mouse	keyboard
anyway i plugged a screen and mouse keyboard into it to try to work out whats up with it and i tailed the syslog

179148
mouse	keyboard
all other hardware seems to be fine - mouse and keyboard which are both usb and monitor

179156
zsh	subshell	bash	zsh	bash	subshell
in bash yash zsh mksh that s jobs of the subshell where set -m is enabled so the outer ... and all the processes created within that will be placed in that same process group

179160
lvm	mdadm
i already have a running system of debian and do not wish to repartition my hard drives setup in raid using mdadm and the installation wiki says to use lvm

179164
disk	ram
this will boot your existing kernel under the xen hypervisor and it should operate just as it does normally with the exception that you will then be able to use the xen commands to carve off some ram to create a new domain provide it with a virtual disk and boot it up

179180
kde	gnome
i installed centos 7 first i installed group kde plasma workspace then i installed gnome desktop after that i found only gdm existed

179230
rpm	yum
it is an info message and is saying that the cpanel is not compiling from the source to install the imagemagick and instead using the rpm yum

179235
ubuntu	linux
i am considering switching from ubuntu linux to arch linux

179236
centos	linux
i have set up a linux box centos 7 to use for virtualizing some servers

179241
installation	upgrade
i only get automatic updates apt-get update apt-get upgrade for the first installation the second installation needs to be updates manually

179302
ubuntu	linux
so i made persistent ubuntu added virtualbox and oracle linux iso installed oracle linux via virtualbox and after booting into the system i had to re-install gnome2 because for some reason it wouldn t work

179307
debian	linux
linux doesn t really mind afaik not sure since i switched entirely to debian a few years ago

179345
bash	zsh
i do not use it in my shell scripts unless there s some other reason the scripts should be bash or zsh though in those cases it s best to upgrade to a real scripting language like perl or python

179362
rpm	yum
rerun yum update to update nss-softokn-freebl and fix yum and rpm

179364
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
but i need code that will run no matter if it is being run under bash zsh csh or tcsh

179377
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
edit this works in csh too and zsh tcsh sh pdksh ksh93 - though not fish

179392
folder	directory
i am able to produce a rewrite to a directory named after the tomcat application in this example context in my apache html folder var www html context

179445
sudoers	visudo
if etc sudoers doesn t end in a newline character which sudo and visudo allow for instance if it ends in a non-terminated #includedir etc sudoers.d line your command will make it

179445
sudoers	visudo
visudo also guards against several persons editing the sudoers files at the same time

179445
sudoers	visudo
my version of visudo at least under some conditions edits all of etc sudoers and all the files it includes runs for all of them

179562
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and most likely many flavors of debian stores the information at etc networkmanager system-connections

179565
ubuntu	mint
well either i m very unlucky either mint or ubuntu has a serious network bug

179570
putty	winscp
putty and winscp don t ask for the verification code anymore

179575
ubuntu	debian
i don t remember manually installing any secure boot keys on this system that would let ubuntu boot but not debian fedora live

179578
rss	feed
is there a download manager which can retrieve automatically a url from an rss feed or an xml file or even a text or html file any of these options is fine

179584
fish	bash
imho this is the best option anyway since there are more shells than bash csh such as fish and you have no guarantee on how any of them behave.

179586
filesystems	ntfs
you need the ntfsresize utility from the ntfs-3g package which can resize ntfs filesystems

179611
kate	nano	vim	kate
i like this approach because i can edit markdown files in any linux text editor from nano to vim to kate and view the files in firefox my browser of choice

179613
disk	ram
qemu-system-i386 -kernel path to kernel -initrd path to initial ram disk

179634
versioning	upgrade
i had php versioning 5.4 installed on my mac 10.9 machine and wanted to upgrade to 5.6

179648
screens	tablet
the value might depend on my setup two screens 3840x1200 resolution or on my tablet bamboo mte-450 so it might be different in your case

179655
cpu	irq
cpu 3 usr 3 sys 0 nic 92 idle 0 io 0 irq 0 sirq

179658
debian	linux
i wanted to dual boot it with a linux distro i settled on debian so i resized my c drive as one normally would to free up some space for the linux install

179658
ubuntu	debian
as the root fs and i needed to set up debian to boot in uefi mode via ubuntu live anyway primarily using instructions in this video which basically involve using ubuntu to mount the debian filesystem mounting the efi partition in the debian file system then bind mounting dev dev pts proc and sys and finally chroot to the debian directory to update the sources.list and updating all of debian s packages

179668
emacs	sublimetext
if you want a solution similar to the emacs one but prefer sublimetext over emacs there is the sublimetableeditor

179680
sudoers	visudo
in the etc sudoers file accessible with visudo look for requiretty

179689
opensuse	linux
suse originally suse is the name of a german company that developed the epynomous commercial linux distribution which is also the basis for opensuse

179689
opensuse	linux
use opensuse if the question is about the open source version of suse linux

179695
debian	linux
rsyslog is a popular syslog daemon implementation commonly used on many linux distributions it is the default syslog daemon on debian

179712
stdout	stderr
file descriptor 0 aka stdin is used per default for reading fd 1 aka stdout is default for writing and fd 2 aka stderr is default for error messages

179750
debian	mint
i am trying to get firefox through the debian repo for mint to work within debian wheezy

179750
debian	mint
my goal is not to low prioritize every individual package within the debian mint source

179758
daemons	systemd
also consider that some of the files you ve defined in your example would need some form of daemons to populate them and that daemons is a binary located somewhere in the file systemd hierarchy

179759
folder	directory
now bob wants to move alice s documents directory into his home folder

179790
int	chars
...either expression will begin its match at the first chars of the th group where is a positive int of not-space chars in pattern-space and continue matching until line s end

179817
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse works

179832
solaris	bsd
things like bsd jails and solaris zones basically took the concept of chroot jails and made them actually work securely - so that barring kernel security vulnerabilities you cannot break out of a bsd jail even if you are root inside it

179869
hex	binary
i m using -binary flag because my version of openssl adds stdout before each hash value on default output and -binary helps to avoid it therefore it s easier to store hash results in binary format for further processing so i can just use xxd -p when i want hex values instead of manually cutting out that stdout from each string

179876
folder	directory
ls -d a-k - to display the files directory of the current place directory folder only

179891
ubuntu	linux
i am using a linux ubuntu distribution

179908
sudoers	visudo
in the etc sudoers file shortcut visudo add these lines

179920
ubuntu	linux
i am using pdfjam version 2013.20140215-2 on a linux ubuntu 14.04 which sports texlive 2013 2013.20140215-1 to be exact

179945
mouse	keyboard
if something like mouse or keyboard is connected on boot it s working but when i re-plug this device he often don t want to work

179954
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd root

179966
ubuntu	debian
newer versions of debian and ubuntu have made ia32-libs obsolete by allowing 32-bit packages to be installed on a 64-bit system so you can pick exactly the libraries that you need

180029
kde	gnome
the desktop application may be plasma kde nautilus gnome and others

180032
bash	zsh
make sure you re using bash or zsh or something similar

180036
cinnamon	gnome
i have tried the following with both linuxmint 13 cinnamon 32 bit and trisquel 7.0 gnome 32 bit and get the same error message

180074
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
.make sure you re usb is erased and formatted in ms-dos fatt fat32 .the program you should use to transfer the iso to usb is startup disk creator it s a ubuntu program it should work fine on you re linux mint workstation

180125
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to log file in this case same as stdout 2 1

180140
mouse	keyboard
i tried a external keyboard with mouse cordless but at least compatible with my ubuntu mac os x and windows... and its the same problem.

180144
.htaccess	httpd.conf
any httpd files that shouldn t be served by the server .htaccess any httpd.conf information script files

180183
vim	emacs
as for violating the spirit of vim using emacs-like chords control keys this presumes that emacs has some kind of patent on use of the ctrl key and or that vim is intended as a museum artifact demonstrating the limitations of relatively ancient and obscure hardware terminals

180186
ubuntu	debian
the debian directory from the wxwidgets2.8 debian ubuntu source

180186
ubuntu	debian
debian but will probably work on an ubuntu system

180210
daemons	systemd
even if you are the only user on your computer systemd daemons might send you some mails to inform you about what is going on

180237
kde	cinnamon
this is something that should really be a fundamental applet part of messaging for kde or in my case cinnamon

180244
sudo	passwd
i ve called sudo above the openvpn lines as otherwise they seem to pile up on the shell and give no opportunity to enter the passwd

180268
jobs	cron
is it possible to set jobs to run every n days in supervisord like what cron is doing

180291
ubuntu	debian
perl based rename on debian ubuntu etc see prename manual

180304
stdout	stderr
first you need to find out whether the messages you want are getting sent to stdout or stderr

180304
stdout	stderr
in your first example you ve got stderr getting redirected to stdout - that s the 2 1 part

180304
stdout	stderr
that separates stdout and stderr into two different files

180304
stdout	stderr
if that doesn t work or if executable is supposed to run a long time and you just want to see particular messages do the above procedure and determine your regular expression using vim and figure out if the message is on stdout or stderr

180323
tunnel	vpn
i seek to tunnel one ssl vpn f5 running on my debian laptop client through another openvpn running on a debian linode server but lose all client networking including ping after the f5vpn connects

180323
openvpn	iptables
i m not sure whether this is due to my openvpn configuration or my server s firewall iptables but suspect the latter

180323
tunnel	vpn
i seek to adapt to the new policy and resume work on my project by implementing a vpn tunnel from my client laptop through a debian linode server jumpbox

180323
openvpn	iptables
i had thought that this problem was due to openvpn misconfiguration on my part but now suspect that i need to tweak my server firewall which is iptables running on debian 7.8 in order to allow my openvpn configuration to work see a client-commandline debugging session here

180324
mp4	webm	mp3	ogg	mp3	flv
this needs separate custom actions for each file type because it is limited to mp4 to m4a make changes accordingly for flv to m4a webm to ogg avi to mp3 etc but has the advantage that the output keeps the exact input name file.mp4 becomes file.m4a while with the first command does not file.mp4 becomes file.mp4.m4a

180402
dpkg	apt
this program interferes with the debian package management and does provoke strange but usually harmless behaviour of programs related with apt dpkg like dpkg-repack reportbug etc

180436
rpm	zypper
so why the hell does zypper say that java is required but rpm thinks that java isn t required

180439
stdout	stderr
you can understand and as filenames referring to file descriptors of stdout and stderr

180439
stdout	stderr
there is also a special syntax to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same place but that s

180442
debian-based	ubuntu
the answers to this ubuntu question explain how disk space can be saved and the package manager can be configured properly in debian-based systems

180447
gentoo	centos
subject machines are mostly centos 5 6 gentoo 1 2

180454
hash	md5
best thing to do would be to run an md5 hash on all files prior to the backup and then do a restore and check the md5 hash against them

180454
hash	md5
just make sure to keep checking the md5 hash occasionally

180458
debian-based	ubuntu
on debian-based systems including ubuntu packages create users using maintainer scripts usually postinst

180476
bash	zsh
with bash ksh or zsh the 3 shells that support that non-standard syntax you can declare a lower case variable

180503
unix	solaris
on unix solaris or hpux return

180521
filesystems	btrfs
inside of it is a single btrfs filesystems

180524
client-side	server-side
function keys are mostly undefined based on the differences in the client-side hardware you are using the client-side software you are using the server-side software you are using and the server-side hardware you are using

180553
tunnel	vpn
on this client i have started an openvpn client after previously starting an openvpn server in the cloud logged into a remote-access website and used that site s web ui to connect to a proprietary f5 ssl vpn which i want to tunnel through the openvpn

180557
put	get
can anyone clue me how to put 2+2 together and get linphone working through my headset

180561
centos	linux
the unixware box and two other linux boxes running centos 6 are dedicated and used by 3 people only to manage a number of barriers in a parking lot and not connected to the internet or any other network

180566
kerberos	ldap

jobs	cron
i m running some cron jobs on my machine and every time i fire up a terminal session i m getting a you have mail message the job produces output on success which gets mailed to me

180667
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr are both sent to new because bash has already truncated the file twice when ls starts printing

180667
stdout	stderr
the behaviour you are expecting would require bash to capture ls s stdout and stderr independently and to open them one after the other just before writing

180667
stdout	stderr
however messages may come out interweaven the redirected program might very well write something to stdout then something else to stderr and then back on stdout .

180671
stdout	stderr
after that you have two file descriptor 10 and 11 both point to file new and these descriptor become stderr and stdout of ls

180671
stdout	stderr
when ls running it wrote to both stderr and stdout which point to the same file new and part of output was truncated because stdout had overwritten stderr

180684
tunnel	vpn
my situation vpn tunnel

180725
ubuntu	debian
it cannot of course magically match up a version of debian to ubuntu and to make it to do so you ll have to edit etc lsb-release which may break other things

180726
ubuntu	debian
the script is specifically written for debian and ubuntu systems and i am tagging as such with this in mind it quits automatically if you aren t on one of those distros but this could be applied in a much wider way as well if the command s exist

180726
ubuntu	debian
so i have a wildcard search finding and assuming armhf but it s still necessary to figure out a one liner that returns one of the three - whether it s a ubuntu debian command or a kernel call or something

180728
sudo	passwd
then i ll be prompted for the passwd exactly once by sudo date and the sudo ticket should be fresh for the following command

folder	directory
created a directory on the local machine remotedir inside which i had to transfer all the folder

180734
centos	linux
or does linux centos simply not support thunderbolt2

folder	directory
this works for .png files in the backup directory however the command fails when the files are two or three folder deep located in home admin backup folder1 folder2 the error i get is

180751
antivirus	mcafee
antivirus software is available for linux from vendors such as mcafee but i ve never known anyone to use it -- presumably it s used in situations where a corporate policy requires the use of antivirus software

180753
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
i did some research on filesystems like ext4 btrfs and xfs and even found a benchmark but i couldn t come to a conclusion

180782
minix	linux
probably the most obvious reason is that unix and minix are antecedent of linux having inspired its creation

180782
minix	linux
torvalds began the development of the linux kernel on minix and

180782
minix	linux
applications written for minix were also used on linux

calling curl with -v to get some more verbose output i can see that the put is sent but the server sits and waits for more to come

180822
ubuntu	debian
i like to check whether several packages are installed or not on debian ubuntu

180849
folder	directory
you point the java_home to the parent folder that contains the bin and lib directory

180852
implements	extends
having implements this solution i attempted to extends it to provide some user feedback and eventually clear the buffer once it had been exported

180870
sysv	systemd
as far as i can tell a real sysv systemd is described here

180870
sysv	systemd
when the lpi website mentions that sysv is on the exam would they be talking about the real sysv or the commonly used implementation - debian s sysv-like systemd

180893
kde	gnome
i ve also avoided upgrading big complicated subsystems like kde and gnome because it just too messy though it is debatable whether they are part of the base system

180893
kde	gnome
on the other hand many end-user packages in debian do depend on kde or gnome or at least their associated libraries

180893
versioning	upgrade
for example debian supports multiple versioning of python so one can upgrade or even add more recent versioning of python without compromising the integrity of the system

180920
strace	systemtap
i was using systemtap because it allowed me to get all syscalls from whole system and won t hang it like tracing all processes using strace did

180934
apache	nginx
you could either set-up another virtualhost within apache nginx or whatever your webserver is which points to a blank or default index page so that is shown when going to your servers ip address

180947
bash	tcsh
you can change the default shell to something else if you like although os x only ships with bash and tcsh

180958
versioning	upgrade
and see the error message the hyphen after packager means that the package is requested to be removed and the equal with the current versioning of packageu means that you do not want to upgrade packageu the unsatisfied dependency

180960
filesystems	ntfs
with gparted i have created a new partition table and i have formatted it with the ntfs filesystems thinking that i was doing it for dev md0 and not for dev sdc1

180965
folder	directory
this will also cause rtorrent not to be able to seed those files and torrents will be marked as stopped paused and if you resume the download it will be downloaded all over again to folder finished label_name directory

180966
cpu	processors
just like a 64b or 32b cpu processors calling into a traditional 16b bios a thunk is needed in the operating system to marshal the arguments from 64b to 32b change the processors mode call the firmware and then restore the processors mode and marshal the arguments from 32b to 64b

180966
disk	ram
note that the radeon module copies the atombios contents into ram and thus a small change to the driver to allow the atombios to be loaded from disk is a path to solving this issue

180991
bash	zsh
i m using zsh and bash on ubuntu

180992
filesystems	hfs+
i mostly use mac so the filesystems is hfs+

181021
sudo	passwd
open terminal and type sudo passwd root you will be prompted for a new root passwd

181028
bash	zsh
with some shells zsh bash mksh you can pass job specs instead of pids

181071
bash	zsh
this can be easily done with bash ksh93 zsh arrays

181094
sorting	grouping
especially for magnetic hard drives writing in big chunks sequentially is also faster than writing small pieces in several places all over the drive the chunks can be sorted and grouping before pushing to the physical device although hard drives also do some buffering and data sorting internally in hardware

181115
ecdsa	rsa
it appears that only the nist p-256 cuve is used for ecdh regardless of the size of the rsa or ecdsa public key

181157
debian	linux
debian linux 3.0.8 armv7l + icewm

181158
ubuntu	linux
i basically know nothing about ubuntu linux this htpc is my first attempt

181165
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
if it s debian ubuntu centos rhel i recommend you to edit file

181183
udp	tcp
i know how to open a tcp or udp socket in ubuntu with the following command

181183
udp	tcp
is there any better or more standard way to open a tcp udp socket using bash script

181187
udp	tcp
other popular ways of making tcp udp connections inside shell scripts include the netcat and socat utilities

181212
stdout	stderr
what supervisord is doing is creating a pipe for your program to write to stdout and maybe stderr and then supervisord is reading that pipe and writing to the log files

181260
chown	mount
i could just use chown to make the directory owned by uid1000 but i understand it should not be needed plu i am positive that if i create another user let s call him uid1001 then if we unmount the partition fs and then remount it as uid1001 it s mount point media hrmount will still be owned by uid1000

181261
filesystems	ntfs
if a linux filesystems not fat32 ntfs is mounted then the directory permissions for the root directory are taken from the filesystems

181261
chown	chmod
root must either change the owner chown or permissions chmod setfacl of the root directory or has to create subdirectories which are writable by the users

181267
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs
you can do similar options with adfs affs devpts hfs hpfs iso9660 ntfs tmpfs udf and usbfs filesystems

181292
freebsd	linux
under linux the audio driver selected is snd_hda_intel and the expectation under freebsd was that the snd_hda module would drive the audio

181300
freebsd	linux
freebsd can run linux programs without recompiling you would have to test yours

181308
mouse	keyboard
external monitor external keyboard and external mouse

181313
stdout	stderr
file channels 1 stdin 2 stdout and 3 stderr go to and from the terminal removing a lot of the boilerplate from the jcl above

181343
rpm	yum
remove mysql completely and all files find your correct repo rpm package on download the correct version and install the rpm package through yum localinstall

181347
jobs	cron
i need to calculate the time remaining for the next run of a specific job in my cron schedule i ve a cron with jobs having frequencies of per hour thrice a day etc no jobs running on specific days dates hence just hh mm ss is concerned also i do not have right to check var spool cron in my rhel

181352
rpm	zypper
i find the only way to force zypper to installa specific rpm i want is to state the exact rpms url httlp mylocalrepository myrpms boost-1.36.0.11.17.src.rpm

181357
tex	lilypond
i don t know if this matters all i ever need syntax highlighting for are tex and lilypond files

181360
jobs	cron
cron itself takes care of that by avoiding to run the job twice if the time has gone backward or run skipped jobs after the shift if the time has gone forward

181391
bash	zsh
rather than over-engineer a bash solution gille s suggestion of zsh is worth a look

181404
udp	tcp
you can have an internet super server running that listens on a set of tcp and or udp ports

181420
kde	gnome
i ve seen this happen with gnome updates around file monitoring bits nautilus - it may be the same for kde

181426
debian	centos
i personal side with the redhat centos flavors because i prefer the yum packager to debian s apt-get and i don t like gui s as they tend to slow both my machine and me down

181432
solaris	bsd
as a side note you have tons of linux distributions several bsd unixes and a whole bunch of other variants hp-ux solaris etc

181434
children	parent
in the windows world i d set the permissions on the parent folder and tell it to make children inherit

181436
chown	sudo
i have corrected file permissions for etc vsftpd.conf via sudo chown root root etc vsftpd.conf and now manually server gets started

181440
disk	ram
it s done using a special filesystem driver that s designed to overlay multiple filesystems on top of one another - in this case a read-only file system with a ram disk

181444
folder	directory
dg+s - add the group-setgid bit to folder directory so that the group name is inherited from the root of the tree

181460
bash	zsh
originally i wrote this with the wrong shell in mind bash instead of zsh

181479
folder	directory
i added the jkmount inside the virtual host file instead of 000-default.conf and was able to get apache to pass the request to the tomcat application instead of the folder in apaches web directory

181504
centos	linux
finally click start using centos linux

181504
centos	linux
finally click start using centos linux

181538
ubuntu	debian
this will be armhf on a machine running 32-bit arm debian or ubuntu or a derivative arm64 on a machine running 64-bit arm

181556
stdout	stderr
but now my list of filenames is mixed in with my error messages because tar s -v output obviously can t go to stdout that s where the archive data flows so tar cleverly writes that to stderr instead

181559
bash	zsh
which with at t implementations of ksh or bash or zsh you could write using process substitution

181560
stdout	stderr
so you don t loose the stdout stderr channels for information

181563
ubuntu	mint
and in case the above are no help whatsoever the mint installer runs ubiquity an apparently customized version 2.18.8-1linuxmint8 ubiquity is a graphical installer for ubuntu written largely in python using debian-installer d-i as a backend for many of its functions.

to see a list of available updates including glibc on a opensuse linux enter

181594
for-loop	loops
the trailing slash in the for-loop ensures that it loops over directories and symlinks to directories

181595
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade these rpm to a newer versioning

181597
ubuntu	linux
is there any free way or method for ssh that could be used to install and update linux clients for a ubuntu laptop

181621
filesystems	btrfs
some people think the default snapshot intervals take up too much space too quickly but whether or not you believe that there are times when you want to clear space on your filesystems and often find that the btrfs snapshots are taking a significant amount of space

181627
chown	sudo
i ve reset the permissions for etc vsftpd.conf to root root via sudo chown root root etc vsftpd.conf and now the vsftpd server get started via sudo systemctl restart vsftpd.service and running it manually via sudo usr bin vsftpd

181637
width	height
when viewing it in any pdf viewer the page s width is greater than the height

181637
width	height
... it seems like all the pdf applications i have tried mistake the width as the height and the height as the width for this pdf file

181637
width	height
thus viewing it in any pdf viewer the page s width is greater than the height

181660
ubuntu	linux
linux distribution based on ubuntu and gnome technologies with its own shell and apps

181668
filesystems	fat
uefi also explicitly supports fat format filesystems

181697
debian	linux
if a specific os distro is needed assume debian linux

181699
width	height
all images have very similar dimensions width height and a resolution of 300 ppi

181701
init.d	pid
the daemon function in etc init.d functions looks at the first non-argument parameter strips back the program path to the basename and uses that to derive the pid lock file

181709
debian	linux
the following is a gvpe network vpn setup on debian linux systems

181715
bash	zsh
if your system supports zsh command then in bash script you can run

181715
bash	zsh
zsh other than bash more powerful shell with a lot of features

181718
for-loop	loops
the read check complicates loops a little because immediately after another loops is called - a for-loop which iterates over args as represented in for each iteration of its parent while loops

181719
packets	pcap
this essentially parses the pcap for only connections from the source ip and looks for the total length in bytes from each packets

181747
g++	gcc
i was trying to install an earlier gcc and g++ 4.6.3 for compatibility reasons and now apt seems to be broken

181748
debian	linux
tested on debian gnu linux

181749
cpu	processors
you only need to install the package related to the brand of cpu in the system installing amd64-microcode on a system with an intel processors makes no sense

181778
ubuntu	linux
im trying to achieve high availability ha for a lamp application news portal website which might be of interest to many unfamiliar users.for files im using glusterfs replica for redundancy between two apache-linux-box s with two haproxy keepalived linux box on the front as load balancers but im confused for mysql database server ha.i have 2 separate ubuntu 14.04 to serve as mysqlserver

181781
ssh-agent	lftp
is it possible to use lftp with ssh-agent or is there some other way to avoid supplying the password

181788
versioning	upgrade
normally when using centos you buy into the centos package-centric world whether you like it or not so the correct solutions are to find an assp package that matches your centos versioning or a berkeley rpm which also includes a working perl berkeleydb.so or upgrade centos

181788
versioning	upgrade
usr local berkeleydb.4.5 and manually build or use cpan to install upgrade it the cpan one will be the latest though it has support for just about any underlying bdb versioning

181788
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade berkeleydb you run a small risk of some other perl scripts having problems if they rely on it or a specific versioning of it

181793
ssh-agent	lftp
in its default mode lftp connects to an ftp server and has no relation to ssh thus to ssh-agent either

181815
daemon	cron
i need to add cron to it and have the cron daemon start on startup

181845
debian	linux
linux debian 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.65-1+deb7u1 x86_64 gnu linux

181848
versioning	upgrade
i haven t checked to see if you need to upgrade your kernel but i think 3.2 probably offers sufficiently recent support for the 1.0.6 versioning of the lxc userspace tools

181861
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	redhat	fedora
www-data is on debian ubuntu but for example on redhat centos fedora pld there is apache user instead

181865
ubuntu	debian
but both of these approaches have a significant shortcoming theyâ re unsuitable for packages in debian or ubuntu or probably other derivatives

181865
ubuntu	debian
so for solaar which has different dependencies in debian and ubuntu debian rules has

181878
daemons	systemd
there needs to be some sort of macro or api systemd setup which interacts with dropbox s site to add each new dropbox client server to the list of allowed clients on the dropbox account in order for you to install the daemons

181917
cpu	processors
in my experience there is always a big fat firmware that run on the processors on the network card not the cpu

181933
bash	zsh
find s 0-delimited output will address those here assuming bash zsh ksh

181943
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
however the only thing this did was that i now have ubuntu instead of linux mint in the bootloader why so ever

181945
gentoo	linux
i know it s necessary to run revdep-rebuild after upgrades of my gentoo linux

181951
subtract	add
you don t need to subtract and then add together again.

181985
postfix	dovecot
always reload restart postfix or dovecot when changing something

181996
bash	zsh
bash zsh on linux

181996
bash	zsh
here-files or here-strings in bash and zsh are implemented as deleted temporary files

182032
folder	directory
i have a directory called folder that looks like this

182034
folder	directory
all together the above will find the modification date of each file or directory in the current folder including all subdirectories and set its date three months after whatever it is now

182042
opensuse	linux
the guide on the internet which i have found require me a live cd but the linux distribution which i am interest in opensuse did not provide it so what should i do

182044
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i ve since wiped ubuntu and replaced it with linux mint 17.1 which i believe is based on ubuntu 14.04 the version in which everything worked

182063
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i partitioned 125gb for use with ubuntu linux mint 17.1

182132
bonjour	avahi
unless it s a bonjour printer in which case it will be picked up by avahi

182138
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is an ubuntu derivative you should have no problem following these instructions

182139
disk	ram
as for the load it s normal reading a few gb of data into ram mapping the ram to the vm s page offset takes loads of cpu and disk operations

182142
freebsd	linux
i am currently running freebsd and one other linux distro with it and i have had no problems

182147
jobs	cron
cron jobs can be run as root or another specified user

182147
daemon	cron
as i have no permission to create files in var log the cron daemon will send me an email when the job fails

182148
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
these dependencies can be installed in ubuntu 14.04 and its variants such as kubuntu 14.04 and linux mint 17

182150
debian	linux
install debian linux

182150
debian	linux
these instructions assume you are using a working linux installation i used debian on parallels but they might work on osx i don t know

182158
tcpreplay	wireshark
since wireshark is too resource hungry i need to see the packets in tcpreplay just like in wireshark

182169
centos	linux
os centos linux release 7.0.1406 core

182191
udp	tcp
i have successfully managed to create a tcp bridge and i m assuming its not too much harder to force the udp traffic across that bridge

182206
xfce	kde
i am trying to remove kde from my fedora 21 installation in favor of xfce

182231
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and debian often if i try to run a program i will get a message that says something to the effect of

182242
stdio	fflush
in the cat|tr|sed example tr is still receiving data from cat as soon as you press enter but tr is following the stdio default policy its output is going to a pipe so it doesn t fflush after each line

182247
ubuntu	debian
i m guessing it s the same for debian but on ubuntu at least the packages that are installed by default when debian ubuntu was first installed don t have the automatically-installed mark

182261
switching	screens
the shortcut ctrl-alt-fx will switching the virtual terminal via xf86_switch_vt_x where x is the number of the f key 1-12 while the screens is locked

182261
sudo	passwd
first i ran sudo ls to enter the passwd and grant the user temporary sudo privileges

182261
disk	ram
only key_sleep suspend to ram and key_suspend suspend to disk aka

182276
folder	dir
chmod g+s . makes subsequent file dir creation inherit group id from the parent folder and if the created thing is a dir it too gets g+s set as its parent

182276
folder	dir
the semantics changes if mount option was grpid | bsdgroups in that case new file dir creation would inherit group id from its parent folder even without setting g+s for the parent itself

182280
ftp	telnet
i m working on a script using telnet to connect to an ftp server and dropping a big file on it

182286
ubuntu	linux
objective - client should be presented with os choices in network boot menu - oracle linux 6.5 rhel 7 ubuntu 14

182291
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i know that the debian and ubuntu installer can be booted as a single self-contained linux kernel + initramfs initrd combination

182297
ubuntu	linux
i have iso of puppy linux and just now i have downloaded iso for ubuntu

182297
ubuntu	linux
so can i import those packages like gcc etc from iso file of ubuntu and install it in puppy linux or vice versa

182297
ubuntu	linux
so i don t want to leave puppy linux and redownload programmes again in ubuntu

182297
ubuntu	linux
its stupid though i copied whole of puppy linux to ubuntu s thinking that it would work

182300
ubuntu	linux
i copied whole of puppy linux to ubuntu s thinking that it would work

182303
folder	directory
but the problem is that when i execute it from another folder the shell tries to find nodeharmony.sh in the current working directory not the directory of file.js

182310
package-management	packaging
tag admin package-management devel lang python devel packaging

182318
lvm	mdadm
if something breaks with lvm raid you re probably not going to be able to get as much support than if you had gone with mdadm

182318
lvm	mdadm
unless i m aiming for compatibility i won t be using lvm mdadm anymore

182325
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
in ubuntu linux mint all i have to do is go to settings-printer-add a printer-find network printer

182332
stdout	stderr
sshd.log 2 1 redirect stdout and stderr to sshd.log

182365
cifs	smb
for windows the obvious option is cifs smb since that has native guest support

182365
filesystems	fat
specific to qemu kvm is the virtual fat which allows you to export an existing directory - subject to restrictions be sure to read the what you should never do paragraph - as a fat filesystems to the guest

182367
put	get
so instead of putting that line in .bashrc put it in .bash_profile and see if you only get 1 instance of inotifydropboxcopy

182373
debian	centos
in debian one can use ctrl-alt-f4 to get to the command line but that is not working in centos

182397
vmware	virtualbox
if you want to try them out reasonably safely you can use a virtual machine such as virtualbox or vmware which will isolate the running code from your real machine

182399
stdout	stderr
if the whole thing is not quoted like exec -d config dev null 2 1 the daemon function s stdout and stderr are redirected and any output message or errors from daemon function will not show up during start

182399
stdout	stderr
when quoted it s passed as to the daemon function so that exec s stdout and stderr are correctly redirected

182399
daemons	systemd
systemd daemons don t have to be redirected to dev null because they close all open fds and open dev null on 0 1 and 2 themselves and detach from terminal and use logs for output

182409
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am trying to write a script which works based on the knowledge that each linux mint release was based on a particular ubuntu release

182409
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
it works reliably on debian and ubuntu but does linux mint have this file

182413
ubuntu	debian
a distribution is considered a derivative of itself as well as of its parents so ubuntu is a derivative of ubuntu and of debian

182416
vpn	lan
vpn site-to-site configured between the 2nd firewall and a remote lan 10.60.223.0 24

182448
versioning	upgrade
it came to our notice that glibc needs to be upgrade from the current versioning 2.2 to the latest as per the release 5 6 7

182449
daemons	systemd
on unix-like systemd daemons and what you would call regular processes are the same thing

182449
daemons	systemd
daemons are usually managed by some kind of service manager - systemd upstart or systemv which isn t really management you just keep some pid files to know how to kill them and some init scripts to start them up in an orderly fashion

182503
lvm	mdadm
you can t use mdadm on it at least not in any easy wayâ¹ and the lvm raid tools are nowhere near as mature

182503
lvm	mdadm
if your needs are adequately served by a few large mdadm raid arrays sliced into partitions using lvm i d suggest continuing to use that

182503
lvm	btrfs	lvm	mdadm	mdadm	btrfs
a lot of the uses of lvm raid and even mdadm raid are being taken over by things like cluster storage object systems zfs and btrfs

182514
chmod	sudoers
since i experienced that it doesn t work anymore after next reboot until i set the chmod again i added the local user to sudoers and granted him bin chmod with nopasswd and put the chmod command in rc.local

182542
stdout	fflush
as python will buffer the stdout by default here i have used sys.stdout.flush to fflush the buffer

182545
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	freebsd	linux
there are two common versions of cal on linux the one from util-linux on fedora and the one from freebsd on ubuntu

182545
bash	zsh
you can emulate it with a bash zsh script

182546
ubuntu	centos
i tried when installing ubuntu and centos and both of them don t show me the win7

182549
switching	screens
if you need a new shell to review the command output you can try screens multiplexers such as gnu screens tmux byobu etc in which you can split windows create windows switching windows persist processes view independent scrollback buffer and more

182557
bash	zsh
this wildcard exists in ksh93 bash â 4.3 â 4.0 if there are no symbolic link to directories in your tree and zsh

182603
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
other distributions like debian ubuntu and opensuse provide both versions of webkitgtk

182708
uniq	grep
it appears to be a general case of applying grep command which strips out all lines after the nth appearance of a separator character in this instance but i am looking for something that also removes duplicates from the output which is why in this case i need to pass it through the uniq command

182751
perl	tcl
which usually is not the desired operation for awk perl python ruby tcl tk.

182752
daemon	cron
it shouldn t be a big problem if you can run your own cron daemon

182783
bash	zsh
i am looking for a glob pattern in zsh or bash that i could use to specify files between two dates

182785
kde	gnome
nautilus rox-filer thunar and essentially anything else using gio the gnome vfs supports this as do dolphin and konqueror and essentially anything else using kde s kio layer

182801
debian	linux
i ve used many variants of linux mostly debian derivatives for over a decade now

182801
ati	nvidia
i say this because i use used 5 different distros on 4 different computers with various monitors and nvidia amd ati intel graphics cards

182824
cinnamon	gnome	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
major desktop environments also have no problems with tearing including gnome kde unity and cinnamon

182824
xfce	kde
kwin is the window manager for kde and i have experience of using kwin in xfce when it didn t support vsync and it worked really well

182843
bash	zsh
so for most shells to include bash and zsh but not dash or yash when you get a here_document the shell creates a uniquely named temp file in exec s it on the input file descriptor you specify - or by default just 0 - and promptly deletes it

182843
disk	ram
that in mind this portion could be more i o efficient if the newly created tmp file is on a tmpfs and the source file is on a disk if the i o were reversed here and head read from the on-disk file and wrote to the file in ram

182869
ubuntu	debian
in my case the only os i care about are ubuntu debian and osx

182871
ubuntu	debian
in debian and ubuntu bin sh is dash which is a posix-compliant shell

182871
ubuntu	debian
you need to do this on debian and ubuntu

182872
ubuntu	debian
it s a symlink to dash on debian and ubuntu for example

182874
solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
while on most systems across a wide range including aix solaris several bsd flavors bash ended up in different locations env always ended up in usr bin env

182879
ubuntu	linux
so i am a newbie in linux ubuntu and want to make files in a directory invisible to everyone

182905
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
if you need compatibility to all unix systems that includes things like solaris and aix that froze their shell environments circa 1995

182932
ubuntu	linux
i tried on another computer which runs on ubuntu linux and both avahi-browse and avahi-discover work fine

182958
hash	hmac

182962
tunnel	packets
from your tcpdump it is clear that your client is routing the packets via the tunnel your problem therefore lies at the remote end because it is not rounting the packets back

182970
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	installation	upgrade
yesterday i attempted to upgrade my installation of the textadept editor in my linux mint 13 maya lts xfce 32-bit system based on ubuntu 12.04 precise

182973
filesystems	btrfs
the difference here are some featueres that oracle enabled like seting up your root filesystems with btrfs using uek kernel with this media

182997
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
on a computer running for the long term linux mint 17 xfce ubuntu 14.04 along windows 7 i have created another two separate partitions with the purpose of installing for the short term other systems for testing purposes

183000
debian-based	linux	debian-based	mint
i m running linux mint a debian-based distro and i want to remove a package without removing its reverse dependencies

183000
debian-based	mint
since my debian-based distro doesn t use pacman how can i achieve the same functionality with apt-get aptitude or the mint software manager

183020
disk	ram
common causes for disk failure include failure of the actual disk a loose cable or a ram failure

183032
ubuntu	mint
i ve tried installing both mint and ubuntu by both the dvd-r and usb drive methods

183065
filesystems	xfs
if it s an xfs filesystems

183111
stdout	stderr
i want to have logger log to var log syslog since via ssh i m likely to lose stdout stderr

183137
gedit	nano
note that by default the editor is vi set the editor variable to nano or gedit or whichever editor you fancy and re-run above command

183183
chmod	mkdir	chown	mkdir	chown	chmod
i have noticed that chown is not highlighted in the same color as mkdir and chmod but i can t figure out my problem

183196
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
openssh servers use four types of keys rsa dsa ecdsa and ed25519

183205
apache	nginx
i would most likely use nginx but squid apache or a number of other tools could work as well

183209
folder	directory
this code will copy file.txt from each of a set of folder and place in in the directory x named as the folder from which it came

183211
google-chrome	firefox
can somebody please explain why google-chrome fails to start while all other clients firefox work fine

183224
udp	tcp
some entry in proc net might indicate the time of the last tcp or udp packet

183238
sudo	passwd
i m not 100 sure about whether or not storing the username passwd combination in a variable will work - it definitely won t if your sudo configuration requires a passwd but at the least you can implement a loop similar to what s below

183259
gedit	nano
section 1 basic editors nano and gedit

183268
ati	nvidia
some companies that don t want their software to be open only provide binaries that you can execute to install or run their software drivers whatever for instance video driver modules provided by nvidia or ati are binaries

183273
ati	nvidia
you may try installing reinstalling your ubuntu desktop with removing all the nvidia ati drivers

183283
for-loop	arrays
you need a for-loop to iterate and print content of an arrays

183295
folder	directory
my question is how can i add the tools in my opt folder to my path so i can run them from any directory in a terminal

183303
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
redhat enterprise linux 7 â on which centos 7 was based â was forked from fedora 19 which was released about 15 months prior to the release of rhel 7.0

183354
wan	lan
i have ubuntu server 14.04 with two network cards lan and wan

183362
bash	zsh
since you re already using zsh syntax instead of bash syntax by not quoting your variables just switch to zsh where you can do

183363
rpm	yum
how can i force rpm and yum to fail if a gpg signature is missing from a package or otherwise cannot be verified due to a missing key

183389
centos	linux
on my centos linux machine in my auditd.conf file i have set my max_log_file_action keep_logs

183398
folder	directory
i have a directory that contains folder ending in .ctpre or .ctpost 15.ctpre along with other files folder

183416
xfce	gnome
trying to use slingscold launcher in linux mint xfce qiana - it should look something like the search in gnome shell

183453
debian	linux
on debian derived linux version the package p7zip only installs the base 7z that doesn t support zip

183459
stdout	stderr
a very ugly alternative for batchy operation overnight say is to create a cronjob and the output is emailed in lieu of stdout stderr

183479
public	protected
would it be beneficial as the storage directory is protected by ssh private public key auth

183499
bash	zsh
the .inputrc file is a bash thing not a zsh thing as far as i know

183511
postfix	dovecot
mail server for multiple domains using postfix dovecot vimbadmin roundcube problem

183514
children	parent
filtering on the name of the parent process lists only the parent process not its children

183517
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
if yes then is it enough to cover gnome kde and xfce

183529
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
is targetting to qt kde gtk gnome and xfc xfce enough

183529
kde	gnome
they are not limited to gnome and kde

183529
gtk	xlib
part of the point of the more portable higher level libraries gtk qt is they abstract away the lower level more platform specific ones such as xlib

183529
gtk	xlib
if you want an introduction to the drag n drop api for gtk with a quick nod to the xlib facilities it is built upon on systems that use xlib have a look here

183540
hex	binary
it took the raw binary form of the hex data and dissected it

183540
icmp	tcp
the official documents such as rfc 791 for ipv4 rfc 792 for icmp and rfc 793 for tcp although those are a bit like the aforementioned fire hose

183540
icmp	tcp
less formal documents such as the wikipedia articles for ipv4 icmp and tcp not to be confused with the other tcp and other pages to which they point

183541
ubuntu	linux
i have a dual boot with windows 10 and ubuntu 14.04 but cannot change the brightness level just when i use linux

183545
apache	nginx
is this information in nginx or apache settings

183564
udp	tcp
since your egress packets have the class set based on application and i m guessing that each application uses a certain set of tcp udp ports you could re-classify incoming packets based on those ports

183587
filesystems	ntfs
linux has some device driver for ntfs filesystems so is a file

183607
subnet	packets
packets which do not match the other routes will be sent to the gateway 10.0.0.138 but what is the subnet mask

183614
subnet	packets
the gateway must be a single address as you cannot send packets to a subnet

183629
ubuntu	linux
i am running linux ubuntu 14.04 lts and am trying to install wxpython so i can develop guis on python

183658
for-loop	loops
the for-loop gives shell variable name the value of a file s name each time through loops

183659
kde	cinnamon
on mint cinnamon the part which changes from the kde is that you have to go to gmenu - system settings - accessibility - pointing and clicking

183674
versioning	upgrade
apt-show-versions by default will list all installed packages with the suite they come from their versioning and whether they can be upgrade

183679
dpkg	apt
the uri is not known to dpkg since that s a frontend apt concern

183694
ubuntu	debian	xfce	gnome	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
however i was trying ubuntu xfce unity debian gnome xfce lxde gentoo with lxde openbox and none of them was really usable

183694
ubuntu	debian
both ubuntu and debian recognize my lumia as two empty devices with sizes about 200mb.

183695
xfs	btrfs
but i always used jfs and then now ext4 xfs i m also evaluating btrfs but it crashed a few times on ubuntu 14.04.1 and i once lost a volume

183704
apache	nginx
you can use a reverse proxy in apache nginx over a vpn

183744
freebsd	linux
most software that runs on linux can run on freebsd using an optional built-in compatibility layer

183744
unix	aix
aix is based on unix system v with bsd-compatible extensions

183746
kde	gnome
it is a collection of tools and libraries usually found on linux including gcc gnome and kde and a bunch of libraries and tools gawk bash ncurses rsync lsof ...

183766
bash	zsh
if you re using a modern shell like bash or zsh use so that the shell evaluates t and replaces it with an actual tab

183782
kde	kubuntu
i have tried it in kubuntu 15.04 beta version but a lot of existing kde tools are available that don t fit plasma 5

183801
fish	bash
my default shell is bash which i have set up through .profile and .bashrc to automatically run the fish shell when i open my terminal emulator

183801
fish	bash
in bash before i load up fish

183801
fish	bash
sometimes however i want to run scripts which are written for bash from my fish shell

183801
fish	bash
this is necessary because fish isn t syntactically compatible with bash

183801
fish	bash
when typing bash in my fish the bash i open automatically opens another fish on top of itself because of my .profile .bashrc

183801
fish	bash
that makes it all fishy pun intended because i then have to exit the top fish to get into the bash on top of the second fish

183801
fish	bash
would it be possible to add a third context which i can set up to load when bash is run from inside fish

183802
fish	bash
thus in your first bash in_fish isn t set so it gets set and fish is started

183802
fish	bash
when you start bash from fish in_fish is already set so bash doesn t start fish again.

183882
tunnel	packets
i am trying to achieve flow of ipv4 packets over ipv6 tunnel between 2 machines

183882
tunnel	packets
i am thinking these packets do not go through the ipv6 tunnel

183882
tunnel	packets
i am thinking if do ping 128.247.19.77 from linux1 the ipv4 packets goes through the ipv6 tunnel i.e starts at eth0.1 goes through eth0 reaches other end to eth0 on linnux2 and then eth0.1

183904
switching	screens
either keep you system in text mode console until the problem appears be sure to switching off all display energy saving mechanisms as a suspended screens may not turn on again or you can use a serial port to log kernel messages there to another device

183906
chgrp	chmod	filesystems	btrfs
if its a unix filesystems like ext2 3 4 btrfs etc. then the chgrp chmod etc

183910
mouse	trackpad
when i reenable the trackpad and display the mouse pointer again i ve lost track where the pointer was before

183960
mouse	keyboard
that is one machine with a monitor keyboard mouse for the first xorg instance and a second monitor keyboard mouse for another xorg instance

183999
folder	directory
binaries with this bit set run as their owner group this was used for games so high scores could be shared but it s often a security risk when combined with vulnerabilities in the games and files created in directory with this bit set belong to the directory s owner group by default this is handy for creating shared folder

184014
clang	llvm
ubuntu clang version 3.4-1ubuntu3 tags release_34 final based on llvm 3.4

184027
centos	linux
i m using a linux centos release 6.6 on my laptop and i ve tried to install the topicmodels package into my r environment

184043
ubuntu	debian
to install the upstream packages on debian or ubuntu follow the instructions for your distribution

184043
clang	llvm
back in february 2015 when this answer was originally written the llvm apt repository stated that it included llvm clang compiler-rt polly and lldb

184057
ubuntu	linux
i tested that in my linux ubuntu terminal and it worked perfectly fine

184066
g++	gcc
the output of cat proc version linux version 2.6.30.9 ytian softsrv1.iders.ca gcc version 4.4.1 sourcery g++ lite 2009q3-67 #1 preempt thu jan 23 11 58 19 cst 2014

184097
stdout	stderr
there s plenty of examples on redirecting the stdout stderr of a command to a file at the point of invocation but i can t find anything conclusive on capturing output from a running process or processes

184114
switching	screens
i found it in a form that allows you to run steam in another terminal so you can easily switching out of your full screens games back to your desktop

184126
bash	zsh
the above prints all regular files in the current directory in dash bash ksh zsh mksh posh and yash

184143
wan	lan
i have two nics one for the lan and another for the dmz to which the wan ip is nat ed

184175
ubuntu	mint
i have two computers running ubuntu 14.04 ok one is actually mint 17.1 but that s based on ubuntu 14.04 and i am looking to use one as a wi-fi hotspot for the other

184183
stdout	stderr
next stderr is redirected to stdout which is file.txt

184183
stdout	stderr
thus both stdout and stderr are sent to file.txt

184183
stdout	stderr
in doing this file.txt is created as an empty file. next stdout is redirected to stderr

184183
stdout	stderr
thus stdout goes to stderr and nothing goes to file.txt and therefore file.txt remains as an empty file

184183
stdout	stderr
first stderr is redirected to stdout which is still the terminal

184206
post	get
if you do get the debug logs please post them to the modemmanager mailing list or to the modemmanager bugzilla

184212
post	get
modemmanager has several h5321gw flags for different vid pids already but if yours end up being shown with a different pair just post a new bugreport to modemmanager to get it added properly

184269
ubuntu	debian
for example if i want to install ubuntu debian and arch in one harddisk and i create lvm partition scheme like this

184271
bash	zsh
with advanced shells bash ksh93 zsh the following can be done

184290
stdout	stderr
foo s stdout stderr should be displayed on stdout stderr as before

184290
stdout	stderr
bar s exit code doesn t matter and bar should not output anything to stdout or stderr in addition to 1

184296
stdout	stderr
if i have two backgrounded processes that produce input to stdout or stderr two installation scripts is there an easy way to make these two output streams distinguishable

184304
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox parallels and most vmware products fusion player etc. have an option to enable bridged networking

184314
bash	zsh
if you re using a shell that supports the pipefail option bash ksh and zsh do you could do it this way

184333
bash	zsh
you can use history expansion in t csh bash or zsh

184333
bash	zsh
bash ksh and zsh have a variable which stores the last argument of the last simple command executed by the shell

184333
bash	zsh
bash and zsh have a keyboard shortcut alt +

184371
put	get
so yesterday i put in the cron task to get some error message

184413
chown	chmod
i know i need to use chmod command with this but what should be the value with chown that i should use for this

184464
submit	submission
what do i have to know in order to submit the value of a keypress into a variable without hitting enter or if not submission into a variable just to react when a certain key is pressed

184477
ubuntu	centos
is there any solution i can load ubuntu desktop or centos desktop image from any thin client

184486
sudo	passwd
note that this probably cannot be solved through conventional use of tools like passwd ssh su sudo and the like

184488
jobs	cron
i was trying to automate some auto cleaning of my ubuntu system with cron jobs

184513
centos	linux
red hat enterprise linux or centos

184519
range	minimum
i need to get only the lines from a textfile a wordlist separated with newline that has a length range of minimum or equal than 3 characters but not longer or equal then 10

184530
put	get
i have no problem compiling and running an individual class however when i put that class into a package and try to run it i get error could not find or load main class class name

184543
osx	yosemite
this is on my max osx 10.10 yosemite

184587
mouse	keyboard
to utilize the copy and paste functions you should highlight the text with your mouse and use the following keyboard combinations

184595
redhat	fedora
fedora oracle linux redhat enterprise linux etc

184605
filesystems	ntfs
as per the clarifications you gave in comments you are trying to mount an ntfs filesystems on two systems at the same time

184605
filesystems	ntfs
normal filesystems like ntfs do not support this

184632
folder	directory
i have a bunch of users that are each connected to a directory in the home folder

184678
ubuntu	debian
bash-completion which is available in cygwin debian ubuntu and no doubt many other distributions supports scp auto-completion as long as the shell can access the required server with no prompting it uses ssh in batch mode see the ssh_config 5 manual page for details

184708
udp	tcp
i admittedly didn t set an iptables rule to block all outbound tcp udp so the activity could have been some background process trying to get online

184711
pipe	file-descriptor
because dash and derivatives back here-documents with anonymous pipe rather than as most other shells do with regular files and because the links on linux systems provide an indirect way of referring to a file-descriptor s backing file even when it cannot be referenced in a file-system - such as for anonymous pipe the above sequence demonstrates a very simple means of setting up what some shells might refer to as a coprocess

184717
pulseaudio	mixer
if you still use linux mint look for the alsa mixer applet but note that cinnamon s default applet for sound will disappear when pulseaudio is not running

184721
folder	directory
2 then take terminal and change directory to that folder

184741
folder	directory
this difference explains why rsync was always recopying directory but not recopying the folder which was correct folder sizes and time stamps being the same on both ends

184749
sudoers	passwd
will i be able to do this with sudoers powers or will i need the root passwd for anything

184754
folder	directory
it is very useful to extract new or edited photos from a huge directory tree on fixed disk to temporary folder then add them to archive cd note - the original files are compared against the cd

184777
daemons	systemd
as mikel suggests if you are trying to configure a systemd account which is a daemons try configuring the daemons itself

184787
ubuntu	linux
trash-cli is a linux application that can be installed using apt-get in ubuntu or yum in fedora

184807
stdout	stderr
which sets stderr to be the same as stdout and is likely to be wrong

184818
mouse	keyboard
this is when input devices stop working - any touchpad laptop external keyboard or usb mouse actions cause no effect

184818
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
this happens in every image i try kde gnome lxde xfce

184828
gentoo	linux
you could also check out distributions which are more source-oriented as in compiling from source locally such as gentoo linux

184837
ftp	telnet
i see these and all sorts of things port scans various known vulnerability tests for all kinds software ssh telnet ftp etc show up on our ids box

184851
bonjour	avahi
the implementation for linux is avahi apple s implementation is called bonjour thus the chat protocol is often just called bonjour

184867
bash	zsh
try this in a shell like bash other shells may handle this differently for example zsh

184867
bash	zsh
as for that is a ksh93 syntax also supported by bash zsh mksh and freebsd sh with variations between all shells

184868
bash	zsh
this syntax comes from ksh93 and was portable to modern shell like bash zsh pdksh busybox sh

184871
filesystems	btrfs
i have arch ubuntu and grub2 installed on a btrfs filesystems

184871
filesystems	btrfs
i have un-used space at the start and at the end of my disk due to alignment and i m led to believe that the btrfs filesystems has some kind of arbitrary storage area too

184878
rbenv	homebrew
rbenv itself makes heavy use of symlinks plus i installed it via homebrew so i m wondering if it s unwise to introduce another layer of indirection

184888
post	get
i m using xev to get the keycodes i can successfully map single key presses with the help from another post which i cannot find to get essential other keys backspace and dollar sign in this manner

184909
mouse	keyboard
check that ignore_modifiers is set correctly if it s missing lock or your numlock modifier then your keyboard and mouse shortcuts won t work while caps lock num lock are on

184921
bash	zsh
why does zsh need setopt nohup since bash does not

184937
dpkg	apt
dpkg --root target -i var cache apt archives dpkg .deb

184962
folder	directory
in my cygwin64 installation folder i see a directory home with a user that is copied from the windows user i m logged in with say this user is nifty

184979
kde	gnome
i just tried to run this command in an ssh session local is debian wheezy kde remote is fedora 21 gnome

184985
ssid	wlan
i went through start system preferences network connections wireless tab and added the name of my wlan and edited it with ssid name ad-hoc mode wpa wpa2 personal security and password and said apply

184988
sudo	passwd
just remember that to actually change something significant you d have to type your passwd sudo

185000
ubuntu	linux
it works fine in ubuntu and fedora but in arch linux the touch screen acts like a mouse

185016
solaris	aix
i see on aix the workload partition wpars are similar to solaris zones but there is a difference on solaris zone i can ping the external network wpars are by default isolated

185074
fish	tcsh
i also tried xterm -e tcsh -i -c fish this too gave same error

185076
versioning	upgrade
you have a possibility of getting some resemblance of true text out of it because pdf is a stripped down and upgrade adjusted versioning of postscript and still has commands that print longer strings at a time which are then displayed to the specified style with embedded fonts

185100
gtk	xlib
i need a list of lightweight desktop environment that uses hardware acceleration either natively or from being on top of another library like xlib gtk etc

185117
ubuntu	debian
stress-ng is now available in debian 8 and ubuntu 14.04

185128
kde	gnome
if you use gnome or kde

185128
kde	gnome
as far as i know you can now use any local program to open the file it doesn t have to be a gnome or kde application

185175
mouse	keyboard
i have wireless usb keyboard and mouse combo

185175
mouse	keyboard
i need a way to disable mouse while leaving keyboard function working and a way to enable it again after some time

185175
mouse	keyboard
i tried to play with stuff and i managed only to disable whole usb device but that wasn t what i need as both keyboard and mouse were disabled

185189
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
inside a desktop environment gnome kde or xfce xdg-open simply passes the arguments to that desktop environment s file-opener application gvfs-open kde-open or exo-open respectively which means that the associations are left up to the desktop environment

185192
sudo	passwd
you can have blank passwd for each user account which won t work remotely then the user either runs sudo -s or the user s .bash_profile merely contains that command

185192
hash	salt
these represent the hashing mechanism then the salt then the hash

185220
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i could use some help with what i think is a basic request on the newest edition of linux mint which i think would also be applicable to ubuntu

185236
daemon	cron
1 checked if the cron daemon is running ps ax | grep is working

185263
bash	tcsh
it is not the system that looks for these files but bash csh and tcsh when they are your login shell

185268
filesystems	hfs
does it matter if the facilities that provide access to hfs filesystems if compiled as a loadable module would be called hfs

185316
pulseaudio	mixer
please note that my alsa driver is still lacking some elements for example mixer element is not included and i presume it may be the reason for the lack of cooperation between alsa and pulseaudio

185316
pulseaudio	mixer
from your experience do you know if mixer element is necessary for pulseaudio to qualify alsa devices as capture sources

185318
put	get
you could put that line in a script as is and run it on local machines to get the ip addresses or you can also put in in a shell script to get remote addresses via ssh like so

185321
wan	lan
i am trying to configure openwrt barrier breaker on archer c7v2 to act as a dumb access point so the wan ethernet port will be connected to my network and anything connected to wifi or the other lan ports will seamlessly become part of the network with full access

185335
arp	icmp
a far easier first step is to run the command arp -a which could give you all of the mac and ip on your broadcast network if icmp requests are not blocked

ubuntu	debian
on many systems ubuntu suse debian ... run the following command to enable apache s ssl mod

185381
tunnel	vpn
once i establish an openvpn connection to the remote server from my local machine i am able to ssh through the vpn tunnel with ssh username 10.8.0

185381
tunnel	vpn
note that when i ssh to the same server from outside the vpn tunnel i am able to successfully configure the firewall with firewall-cmd

185388
i2c	spi
as suggested by mali we need to enable the kernel support for spi and i2c transmission protocol

185409
jobs	cron
how can i set it in cron jobs

185438
ubuntu	debian
we designed an installer script on ubuntu since debian based systems are our primary core however some of our cloud based systems and some of our customers use non debian based systems

185438
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
i know the answer to our question is very basic i just don t know the exact syntax i should be using to be sure we support a fairly large number of common distributions centos rhel fedora ubuntu debian etc

185438
debian	centos
of course as soon as i tried to deploy this on our non debian based systems the script errored out since centos didn t understand sudo

185518
chown	chmod
possibly create a group chown all dirs to that group and of course give at least rw permissions for group x6x with chmod

185518
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r drupal var www drupal-7.34 sites all modules admin_menu

185529
debian	linux
i m running debian wheezy 7.8 and uname -a produces linux bc-timmc 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.65-1+deb7u1 x86_64 gnu linux

185537
folder	directory
for example my home directory contains the folder â œdesktopâ â œdocumentsâ and â œdownloadsâ

185549
cvs	svn
its top-level tool coderev.sh is set up to work with cvs or svn repositories but it s just a driver for codediff.py which does all the actual work

185557
traceroute	packets
if this does not work then try to run a tracing test using traceroute -n 8.8.8.8 to see where your packets are being dropped

185598
switching	screens
if you only have a single screens you could try switching it off and on again

185602
mouse	keyboard
i have used the ltunify pairing tool for logitech unifying receiver written by lekensteyn on my logitech m510 mouse and k350 keyboard which works perfectly

185602
mouse	keyboard
in the bios both the keyboard and mouse work out-of-the-box

185602
mouse	keyboard
in the grub boot menu the keyboard works cannot test the mouse as it s not a gui

185602
mouse	keyboard
in the installer centos 7 both the keyboard and mouse work out-of-the-box

185611
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
with the freebsd version of ls also found on osx and available as the colorls port on openbsd and netbsd pass the option -g to display colors when the output is a terminal

185632
postfix	dovecot
when i lgoin into my vps joe mydomain.com can sent and receive email via postfix and dovecot

185696
xfce	cinnamon
what if instead of using a dock like some do in ubuntu unity one would trey to have a panel like in xfce lxde mate cinnamon etc -- what would be the most distro de independent light on resources and not requiring too many dependencies

185697
ati	nvidia
intel nvidia and ati video cards

185705
filesystems	btrfs	umount	btrfs
running btrfs check on that umount filesystems will confirm the

rpm redhat family redhat fedora etc.

185713
debian	linux
or can another any package manager be used on different linux distributions for example using nix on debian

185733
pull	push
is it possible through this mechanism or another to give someone a limited ssh access to a given git repository allowing that person to git clone user server myrepo.git push or pull but nothing else

185745
folder	directory
i ve seen several articles relating to how to change default permissions for all files in a folder or directory but none discussing differentiating by file extension

185762
daemons	launchd
so if your daemons is normally launchd like this

185789
sudo	passwd
is there a way to move the file without using sudo i don t know the root s passwd

185797
int	boolean
the exit code is not a boolean value is an int by convention the zero value is success so you are thinking in negative logic from bash s point of view

185825
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
for sudo you need to be a sudoers and know your own passwd

185831
udp	tcp
this shows me that my nfs server localhost in this example offers versions 2 3 and 4 of the nfs protocol all over udp and tcp

185840
debian	mint
i recently tried to install debian alongside the mint installation i am using to type this

185840
debian	mint
it goes something like mint debian swap tiny free space uefi swap

185889
ubuntu	debian
instead of installing a .deb debian ubuntu the user simply add a personal package archive ppa and he could install remove update the packages using apt-get

185889
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu you can open an account on launchpad and using a personal package archive ppa distribute software and updates in the same way as the original repositories

185889
redhat	fedora
for fedora redhat there is that is barely the same

185899
debian	linux
now i want to install arch linux next to debian i ve manually made a mdadm disk in a free space and made a msdos partiton table

185911
debian	linux
debian is a gnu linux it used apt to install deb packages

185914
cpu	processors
the processors cpu has a mode bit bits

185914
cpu	processors
if you wish to learn how the cpu does things then the arm is one of the simplest contemporary processors

185934
debian-based	ubuntu
i had success with the update-passwd command after i manually edited the etc passwd file on debian-based systems ubuntu

185937
ubuntu	debian
i try to launch debian inside ubuntu

185957
bash	zsh
if you re using zsh there s no need for the shopt which is a bash feature anyway since zsh can do this by default

185958
folder	directory
i can even delete the directory create a file with the same name delete the file and still the old folder comes back

185984
debian	linux
i have just installed linux debian 7.8 on my vmware

185984
debian	linux
can connect via the internet with putty to linux debian

185992
unix	aix
if you use ibm aix you won t have a rename command so in order to batch remove file extensions you ll have to use plain vanilla system v unix commands

186000
folder	directory
i have some existing directory in virtualbox running ubuntu and would like to make this folder a shared folder in virtualbox so that the host os will see it

186000
folder	directory
is it possible to define in virtualbox a shared folder to point to an existing directory

186043
gmail	hotmail
when we are using gmail hotmail mail id for registration mail is going perfectly

186054
rtp	sip
the image below shows a typical sip flow you can see sip protocol in action but when the session is established media channel rtp goes directly between the clients

186064
folder	directory
how is this the case when i just made a directory called sales and when i ls inside of company it lists the sales folder

186104
dpkg	apt
you might want to try using dpkg instead of apt

186126
vim	emacs
editors like ed ex emacs pico and vi vim

186129
daemons	launchd
currently the user logs in and runs their app with hypnotoad app which launchd the daemons

186183
for-loop	arrays
for p do - the first for-loop iteratively assigns the value of each positional parameter in the shell s arrays which are set to the the field-split expansion of as divided by colons

186192
kde	gnome
so gnome is somehow interrupting kde or something like that

186202
debian	linux
operating system debian jessie linux gnu i386 i686

186226
daemons	launchd
to understand what is going on the first step is to launchd the daemons in debug mode

186229
jobs	cron
i had a similar problem - jobs started via cron appearing to work the first few times but then failing

186229
jobs	cron
the answer is that yes if you chose to encrypt your home directory during ubuntu install you ll find that cron jobs will not be able to access files under it unless you happen to have manually logged into the machine to cause the file system to be decrypted and kept mounted

186229
folder	directory
using sudo create a new folder sudo mkdir home chrisc.unencrypted to transfer the contents of your home directory to

186229
folder	directory
copy the contents of my home directory to the new unencrypted folder using rsync -ap home chrisc home chrisc.unencrypted

186240
kde	gnome
it happens that both gnome and kde provide a display manager but the choice of display manager is independent from the choice of desktop environment

186240
kde	gnome
the default on debian if you have both gnome and kde installed happens to be gnome

186244
bash	zsh
if you happen to be using zsh as opposed to plain sh bash ksh â it s a lot simpler to make a robust solution

186252
zypper	yum
then try the zypper install or yum install again

186255
debian	linux
i m trying to install the libfuzzy-dev package on my host machine linux debian 6.0.10 2.6.32-5amd64 x86_64

186263
put	get
but because of the way weird way it is in gnu linux you have to physically put the hdd in the right port to get it mounted

186269
button	checkbox
the volume up down button work and i can mute the sound but when i press the mute button again to un-mute the pcm control in playback stays disabled and also the speaker checkbox under switches become un-checked

186273
mouse	keyboard
when i am in xephyr window and pres the key combination control_l+shift_l xephyr grabs my input mouse keyboard

186276
versioning	upgrade
but the glibc_2.3 versioning was probably developed and upgrade since it was published and i guess glibc_2.0 versioning hasn t changed since glibc 2.3 has been published

186289
mouse	keyboard
i want to play with ipfire on my pi but i don t have a keyboard nor mouse to control it with

186323
stdout	fflush
in gawk 4.0.1 calling fflush without any argument only fflush stdout

186344
postfix	dovecot
the removal wants to start dovecot for some reason and that fails due to a configuration error user postfix is referenced but apparently that user doesn t exist

186347
debian	linux
i installed oald8 on linux 64-bit on debian

186359
filesystems	xfs
notice in my opinion xfs filesystems is much better unfortunately this fs doesn t support shrinking without temporary copying to alternate place but shrink is used rarely

186374
stdout	stderr
if you wan to know exact reason capture stdout and stderr of your crontask script into a log file when setting your cronatsk

186387
versioning	upgrade
since i upgrade my ubuntu to versioning 14 i ve had a lot of problems with sharing my .vimrc file between ubuntu and osx

186393
perl	tcl
some common language interfaces support perl python tcl and php

186393
ubuntu	debian
since you don t mention your distribution i m assuming that it s ubuntu i use debian wheezy and here is apache2 for that release

186401
atomic	lockless
pids are implemented with a bitmap allocation and freeing of pid numbers can be done with lockless atomic operations

186401
cpu	affinity
it will start on the calling cpu it may be rescheduled to another cpu depending on the syscall and what s happening elsewhere in the system unless you have set strict affinity

186401
affinity	processors
depending on the module and hardware efficiency depends on careful and minimal use of correct locking possibly avoiding spinlocks reducing memory copy etc and correct use of processors affinity

186421
debian	centos
the server computer still runs centos 6.6 and the virtual machine is now running centos 7 i also tried it with another virtual machine running debian wheezy but it still didn t work

186439
zypper	yum
zypper and yum aren t compatible

186446
yacc	bison
the bash parser is generated with yacc or typically with bison but in yacc mode

186446
stdout	stderr
the difference in associativity is most easily observed using the operator which pipes both stderr and stdout

186446
stdout	stderr
or more accurately duplicates stdout into stderr after establishing the pipe. for a simple example suppose that the file foo does not exist in the current directory

186449
stdout	stderr
without knowing the internals of this command or shell script how does one determine if is the output was from stderr or stdout

186449
stdout	stderr
how do i ascertain that the first command printed to stdout and the second to stderr did it

186452
centos	mint
i am trying to set up my local development environment and in so doing i notice that on the production vps centos my file directory permissions behave differently than my local setup mint

186458
stdout	stderr
if exit code is 0 it simply means that command is executed correctly stdout here you can find meanings if exit code is different than 0 stderr

186460
tunnel	vpn
can i either tunnel all of my traffic over ssh via the rpi or even just tunnel the vpn connection that i would normally use were the ports it uses not blocked over ssh i m not too worried about latency

186462
stdout	stderr
in this case both stdout and stderr are connected to the terminal so the information about which stream was written to was already lost by the time the text appeared on your terminal

186462
stdout	stderr
what you can do in a case like the above would be to run the command with stdout and stderr redirected to different places and see what happens

186462
stdout	stderr
or run it twice once with stdout redirected to dev null and once with stderr redirected to dev null and see which of those cases results in the text showing up

186462
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout to dev null by tacking on the end of the command line and you can redirect stderr to dev null by adding

186467
gentoo	ubuntu
this is for ubuntu 12.04 + gentoo but i guess any distro which allows to install udev and autofs should work

186467
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs
note i included sample code for vfat probably most common for usb sticks ntfs and xfs filesystems

186469
gentoo	ubuntu
this is for ubuntu 12.04 + gentoo but i guess any distro which allows to install udev and autofs should work

186469
filesystems	ntfs
note i included sample code for vfat probably most common for usb sticks ntfs and ext4 filesystems

186472
gentoo	ubuntu
this is for ubuntu 12.04 + gentoo but i guess any distro which allows to install udev and autofs should work

186472
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs
note i included sample code for vfat probably most common for usb sticks ntfs and xfs filesystems

186480
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout using and redirect stderr using

186484
minix	linux
actually linux was mostly inspired from minix another unix-like system the licensing of which linus torvalds found too restrictive

186499
folder	directory
this can be expanded on though somewhat redundant in it s basic usage to which will display all files and folder but with their working directory hence the pwd - previous working directory

186503
gentoo	linux
alright i m not yet looking for a gentoo linux derived system where i can compile every software with all the cpu optimization that s available to my hardware

186503
debian	linux	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
if not as stated above then i will be looking for a portage-like from gentoo linux system that runs on debian that will let me automate all the compilation and .deb-wrapping of all source packages from the debian repositories

186511
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	freebsd	aix	debian	linux	unix	aix
and it doesn t matter whether you re running ubuntu debian freebsd hp-ux aix tru-64 or any other variant of unix linux on the planet and beyond they all have their version of rnahybrid in that directory

186536
debian	linux
i m running debian wheezy linux wheezy3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.63-2+deb7u1 x86_64 gnu linux as an encrypted lvm with hardware raid 1 adaptec 6405e on a supermicro server

186547
stdout	stderr
0 is the stdin 1 is the stdout and 2 is the stderr

186547
stdout	stderr
if you didn t have the stdout or stderr redirected you d see dev pts 33 in this example at least because they would point to the terminal

186553
disk	ram
that would be user preference although i prefer ramfs because after doing some minimal benchmarking it seemed to me to be quicker than tmpfs then booting off the ram as if it were a normal disk

186553
disk	ram
the second part would involve periodically say once per hour perhaps and on shutdown saving the data from the ram to the disk so that system changes won t be lost upon restart due to the volatile nature of modern ram

186553
folder	directory
first prepare the system copy the system to a different folder hard drive make all the symlinks for the directory you do not want on the ramdrive like boot and usr share man and on arch var cache pacman then edit the fstab appropriately for this boot setup after that compress this modified version of the system into an image file .iso or .img or similar or into an archive tar.gz2 lzma bz2 ... and then on boot load the contents of that image archive onto a ramfs tmpfs and then on shutdown backup rename the image archive that was booted from then compress the contents of the ramfs to an image archive to replace the old one.

186557
sudo	passwd
i m planning to follow the steps described in this answer to have a different passwd to log in and sudo

186557
sudo	passwd
the reason is that i want a high security passwd to access my account or unblock the screensaver but i don t want to type it every time i need to sudo something

186570
stdout	stderr
the second column indicates stdout and stderr with o and e respectively

186570
stdout	stderr
there are many many examples of scripts and shell functions in answers to related questions about colorising stdin stdout stderr the most robust is stderrd which uses runtime modification of most programs to modify data written to stderr

186570
stdout	stderr
this question that anko links to has good answers on that related theme colorising the stdout stderr output

186570
stdout	stderr
can i configure my shell to print stderr and stdout in different colors

186574
unix	solaris
oh and i m new to solaris and unix

186585
ubuntu	debian
systemd 2 once it percolates through from debian to ubuntu supports afaik more of inetd functionality than upstart but i don t know if it will prohibit its use

186628
bash	zsh
if your shell supports the ksh form of parameter expansion ksh93 zsh mksh yash bash

186631
ubuntu	linux
this is how the xkb configuration looks on my gnu linux ubuntu 12.04lts box

186634
stdout	stderr
there does exist dev fd which does contain dev fd 0 dev fd 1 and dev fd 2 and brief piping experiments at the command line seem to indicate that stdin stdout and stderr are all working ok

186638
ubuntu	debian
it s usually ubuntu for the template name but as i am a debian fanboy have replaced it with debian

186642
sudo	passwd
you have to decide that on your own you can forbid sudo from using the su command to bypass that similarly it depends on how you are using sudo if you are giving your user account full access to any desired command through sudo then of course anyone who can access your terminal and find out your sudo passwd will be able to do just that

186643
spaces	delimiter
it solves the spaces problem by swapping delimiter - and it does so very easily

186656
filesystems	xfs
i am trying to defrag a heavily fragmented xfs filesystems on a centos 6.6 machine

186682
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome

186682
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome when you open a page with this panel open it gives you all kinds of details about what happens on the network when that page loads including its page weight

186714
bash	zsh
ksh bash and zsh but not plain sh have an alternate quoting syntax in which backslash begins a c-like escape sequence so you can write n to represent a newline

186721
bash	zsh
bash ksh93 and zsh support ranges in braces

186739
folder	directory
is there any way i can also copy range of folder or directory

186784
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
ceph s recommendation for the choice of filesystems is between btrfs and xfs

186784
xfs	btrfs
we believe that btrfs has the correct feature set and roadmap to serve ceph in the long-term but xfs and ext4 provide the necessary stability for todayâ s deployments

186802
folder	directory
this option told rsync to designate bkp as the backup directory it is in this folder that pre-existing files in dst folder will be moved

186816
sudo	passwd
after exiting vim but i was hoping that there s an option or something that makes sudo forget the passwd automatically

186819
sudo	passwd
set it to 0 to make sudo always prompt for a passwd

186874
jobs	cron
i have to manage several servers with services that can be cron and integration jobs deployments backups

186888
sudo	passwd
a passwd this option will cause sudo to ignore the user s cached

186888
sudo	passwd
as a result sudo will prompt for a passwd if one

186889
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
a safer option assuming there are only a few files you need to modify would be to make your user account have write access to them chown or both chgrp and chmod g+w then you can scp them directly

186890
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
a deb-base debian ubuntu mint ...

186913
stdout	stderr
your app seems to output to both stderr and stdout otherwise you should only get lines matching publish in your output

186913
stdout	stderr
redirects stderr to stdout the output is then piped to xargs which passes each line as an argument to the next command so each line is prepended with a timestamp+comma

186916
rpm	yum
install nfs-utils and check to make sure it is installed yum install -y nfs-utils rpm -qa | grep nfs-utils

186929
for-loop	arrays
you added break in the yes statement so it is exiting the for-loop and therefore not finish testing the rest of the arrays

186954
filesystems	btrfs
to get btrfs into raid1 you create the filesystems like so

186957
udp	mtu
the interface that sends the packet has mtu 1500 enough for 1472 udp

186969
freebsd	solaris
most systems that i have ever used including freebsd solaris and several linuxes simply put in a real user name and don t include any of the other information and don t include the empty subfields

186983
ubuntu	linux
i have three vps linux machines running on ubuntu 13.10 with nginx1.6

186991
bash	zsh
or with ksh bash zsh

187006
innodb	myisam
the myisam storage engine isn t crash safe there is no automatic log write plus recovery like there is for innodb

187025
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	centos	debian	mint	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian	opensuse	mint	centos	mint
for example the debian world debian ubuntu mint etc use dpkg and apt-get while the red hat world rhel centos opensuse etc use rpm and others can use yet other tools

187026
kde	gnome
this will allow you to install a windows manager without having to install gnome or kde

187029
ubuntu	linux
my windows is 64bit and the linux machine is 64bit ubuntu

187076
postfix	dovecot
also note that dovecot and postfix were installed with a standard configuration

187082
centos	linux
i am able to execute the following command from a linux centos machine which i have sudo access

187092
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you would have to already have some sort of root level access either via direct root passwd or your user id sudo rule setup prior to attempting to modify the sudoers file

187095
ubuntu	linux
also you didn t specify a linux distro so my commands will be based on ubuntu

187105
ubuntu	linux
i m not a very experienced linux user but need it for development purposes and would greatly appreciate any help to get ubuntu to ignore the signals from the broken issd and hopefully stop the freezes

187134
udp	tcp
netcat is wonderful let me count the ways -- is to much let me sum up -- tcp ip4 udp ip4 tcp ip6 udp ip6 but what i need is stream unix

187165
mouse	keyboard
if you still have the same problem mouse keyboard not responding then reboot and try again with the next available recovery mode kernal

187165
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse should be working again

187178
centos	linux
the problem is i needed to share an account with a customer to access to specific directory of my centos linux server ftp

187226
apache	nginx
note that the way nginx is built it will basically work without any configuration whereas apache needs config files to tell it what to do as apache basically does not have anything compiled in as default except perhaps the location of the config file

187231
folder	directory
the modification time of a directory like any other file note how directory are called directory a list of name number mappings like a phone directory and not folder is updated whenever the content is modified

187231
filesystems	btrfs
some filesystems like btrfs can give you some clue as to what the most recently modified files were

187237
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu is it possible to limit the locales which have to be configured

187246
ubuntu	debian
the debian solution doesn t work with ubuntu probably because the locales package comes from the langpack-locales source instead of glibc or eglibc

187261
ubuntu	debian
btw this is on debian but we need this to work on ubuntu too

187276
bash	zsh
works with ksh bash zsh

187291
ubuntu	debian
if you re on a debian based system ubuntu you can use the apt-cache command to obtain the description of the package

187291
ubuntu	linux
see ubuntu manual project or the linux documentation project

187292
centos	linux
i have a fairly simple apache 2.4.7 config on centos 6.5 linux and an active web server

187292
put	get	post	put	post	get
allow get delete post put

187304
postfix	dovecot
a centos 7 web server has postfix dovecot and mailx installed

187314
g++	gcc
i ve installed gcc and g++

187345
ubuntu	debian
you can try the lshw command in debian ubuntu it is in a package with the same name

187363
stdout	stderr
this will capture all the stderr and stdout messages into the logfile and email it to you with the md5 checksum added to the bottom so you could put the output back into a file and re-checksum it to make sure it matches

187398
pull	push
and then i push up and then pull changes to implement

187420
kde	gnome
to use it you run x2goclient it starts a gui where you can create a new session you provide the dns name of the server port ssh data etc and then you select the session type ie if you want a full remote kde or gnome desktop for instance or just a single application and there you enter firefox

187436
udp	tcp
first - this means that the dnsmasq process will listen for dns queries on udp and probably tcp port 5555

187456
kde	gnome
example qt and kde libraries can be pulled in while you are gnome user

187466
starttls	smtps
port 587 was designated specifically for smtps communication between muas and mail servers is expected to support smtps auth and starttls as necessary and has already been in existence for many years

187486
redhat	fedora
on redhat fedora i know they are located in usr src debug according to fedora s packaging debuginfo

187490
sudo	passwd
question sudo didn t ask for a passwd

187490
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
the sudo package and the sudoers file wasn t updated the user s passwd isn t expired

187493
mouse	keyboard
they are environmental temperature sensors disks user mouse keyboard time the clock and network

187498
sudoers	visudo
or add the line below to the end of sudoers using visudo

187507
bash	zsh
note the extra space in front of the export command - this is an option in most shells such as bash or zsh that will prevent the command being recorded in the shells history

187508
debian-based	ubuntu
in debian-based systems including ubuntu modules are configured using symlinks in etc apache2 mods-enabled pointing to files in etc apache2 mods-available

187520
folder	directory
i m trying to set up a deploy user on my vps running centos 6 and cpanel which needs to have access to a specific folder from another home directory home nazeem public_html staging

187521
folder	directory
you can achieve this by doing a chgrp to group deploy on both folder and setting the execution rights for the group on these folder execution permission on a directory gives the right to go through it

187573
google-chrome	firefox
760p flash on firefox works fine with the onboard intel gpu while on google-chrome everything flash related is very slow

187576
folder	directory
when you uncompress it it will create the compress folder in the current working directory

187584
chown	chmod
one idea was to chown and chmod the binary usr lib pepperflashplugin-nonfree libpepflashplayer.so so that only root and the one user can read it 640

187585
mouse	keyboard
this requires to move the mouse or hit keyboard periodically when watching a movie

187602
bash	subshell	subshell	dash
i upgraded a debian box from stable to jessie and i noticed that shell is no longer exported so screen and similar programs start dash for subshell instead of bash

187611
ubuntu	linux
in order to create my own custom linux iso ubuntu i have decompressed the squash file system and would like to make the changes to leave it with a installed and working openssh-server before re-squashing it again to iso

187611
daemons	systemd
some changes to the systemd files in order to make the ssh daemons start on boot

187643
sudo	passwd
after creating user and passwd for the user using the following command sudo smbpasswd -a user

187691
sudo	passwd
that being said you could instead use sudo within the script which provides an option to read the passwd from a pipe

187691
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
alternatively you could have the whole script run by the root user using sudo - configure sudo using visudo as the root super user to allow the script be run with no passwd by adding the following into your sudo config file

187706
ubuntu	debian
with debian ubuntu

187706
redhat	fedora
with redhat centos fedora

187719
sudoers	passwd
also if you have superuser passwd you could add yourself to the sudoers file and set it up to run your script with privilege and without passwd

187737
filesystems	ntfs
for example if i access an ntfs filesystems then the data is first written to mount.ntfs-3g which writes it to disk

187738
bash	zsh
as an alternative to this whole issue i m thinking of munging the . bash zsh rc to identify problems with the path

187739
rpm	yum
note though that mixing pip and rpm yum installation can give confusing results and possibly install duplicate versions of things.

187745
sudo	passwd
note this also has the security problem of hard-coding passwd and is usually better to set a sudo rule for the passwordless execution of the command

187765
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
run glassfish v3 as a non-root service on linux ubuntu debian

187772
stdout	stderr
i would bet that the variables contain a trailing newline because they are the stderr stdout of popen.

187778
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
that all being said i would consider putting a passwd on the account of anyone with full sudo access and configure sudoers to require a passwd from them

187783
openvpn	iptables
i m setting up a server running debian jessie with some applications like iptables firewall fail2ban openvpn apache .

187801
openvpn	iptables
ensure that you avoid printing a log message from iptables for openvpn traffic on 1194 tcp so fail2ban has nothing on which to trigger

187807
postfix	dovecot
a centos 7 server has postfix dovecot and mailx installed

187832
jobs	cron
a common filesystem would let you dump files in dedicated areas and then pick them up in cron jobs from the relevant systems

187845
folder	directory
the solution is to examine your folder directory and fix whatever circular link that you have

187878
move	drag
however if you click where you want to start then simply drag the mouse down then everything should highlight as the mouse move and the page should scroll down automatically as well

187954
bash	zsh
my user was not configured to use bash as shell it used zsh as shell instead therefore the bash dot files were not run at login

187954
bash	zsh
notice it says bin zsh instead of bin bash

187977
folder	directory
this will search for all files and sub folder under directory that have the group permission of write logic match to 0020 octal chmod format it would then erase that file

188000
kde	cinnamon
i m using linux mint 17.1 with cinnamon though i do have a live cd for the kde variation of linux mint that i ve been testing out

188004
iscsi	dhcp
it can also do arbitrarily complex things such as bring up the network and obtain a dhcp lease in order to access an nfs or iscsi root

188030
kde	kubuntu
is it possible to run kde or kubuntu

188036
ubuntu	debian
with it you are able to download and install ubuntu as well as debian and kali

188052
folder	directory
connect to the remote machine via ssh and navigate to the directory where that you couldn t create the folder or files in

188060
symlink	realpath
realpath will give you the absolute path to which the symlink points

188060
symlink	realpath
using ensures that the symlink is only replaced if realpath succeeded it fails if the target doesn t exist

188064
postfix	dovecot
i just finished to install the horde framework git version on my server debian7 + dovecot + postfix + apache2

188070
ubuntu	debian
the client is a raspberry pi running debian wheezy vps is ubuntu server 14.10. the ssh command used alone does work properly so i don t know why the start script would not work

188071
zlib	libjpeg	libxml2	libxslt
yum install -y pciutils system-logos which libxml2 dmidecode net-tools virt-what apr apr-util curl mailcap libjpeg libtool-ltdl unixodbc libxslt zlib

188078
ubuntu	debian
i want it to run in a bash script on modern debian ubuntu systems

188134
ubuntu	debian
one such tool is avprobe which is available in debian based linuxes in package libav-tools i use ubuntu 14.04

188139
switching	airplane
fn + f10 for the airplane mode switching off all wifi connections under kde fedora 20

188142
chunked	transfer-encoding
the corporate proxy always sends its responses with transfer-encoding chunked which i suspected to be the cause

188168
decoder	encoder
both encoder and decoder

188169
disk	ram
in freebsd md devices are memory disk aka ram disk

188184
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

188196
bash	zsh
try bash zsh ksh93 syntax

188250
debian	linux
i ve heard that linux kernel has native can bus support at network layer since some years with a lot of drivers for both embedded and usb can bus controllers how do i check whether they are presented in my debian wheezy

188253
debian	linux
i m running a debian linux on a cubietruck running off a sd card

188275
filesystems	btrfs
unless i ve missed something there appears no way within btrfs to merge these into a single filesystems also many discussions imply the raid5 implementation is fairly new and may not be up to production standard

188275
filesystems	btrfs
is there a way to configure btrfs to use to get a single filesystems across 4 disparately sized disks with redundancy for the loss of any single disk and getting 2 3 of the space available for storage

188275
lvm	mdadm
or is my choice restricted to zfs or my existing ext lvm mdadm stack

188279
switching	screens
alternatively you can log in to text mode press ctrl + alt + f1 to switching to a text console ctrl + alt + f7 to go back to the gui login screens or the session started there and run the command startx to start a session

188284
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
short story i followed a windows 7 from ubuntu guide hoping it would all work for windows 10 technical preview from linux mint 17.1

188296
ethernet	wireless
the system does not have wireless the ethernet is the only networking resource

188306
osx	yosemite
i m trying to temporarily without restarting the machine just for test that starts a jvm increase the number of processes to 2048 in osx yosemite but i m unable to do so

188314
tunnel	vpn
if you can connect to your ssh server from the hotspot you can tunnel forward a local port to the vpn server

188314
tunnel	vpn
if your vpn is using udp i don t know any clean off-the-self way to tunnel udp datagrams over ssh

188315
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is cow filesystems and one object stored on hard disk can be referenced by many files

188328
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
as far as i remember i ve seen pcre on a lot of linux distributions such as centos ubuntu redhat debian and other distribution based on these

188332
folder	directory	umask	mount
i am successfully mount the remote directory on my local directory i have to created folder and files with 777 permission so others can able to access this files so that s why i used umask 000 option during mount process

188340
daemons	systemd
both of these points however should be tempered by the fact that not all init systemd offer an rc.local mechanism and not all cron daemons offer an reboot psuedo tag

188340
sysv	systemd
as mentioned init.d is the directory that contains the scripts that control services that can be started or stopped on your systemd at least on machines that use a sysv type init systemd

188364
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i ve even changed linux distribution from ubuntu to mint nothing

188379
opensuse	linux
i have opensuse 13.2 and i prefer if there is a linux capability that would help if applicable of course

188390
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian mkpasswd is part of the package whois and implemented in mkpasswd.c which as actually just a sophisticated wrapper around the crypt function in glibc declared in unistd.h

188390
crypt	salt
crypt takes two arguments password and salt

188390
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
password is test in this case salt is prepended by 6 for the sha-512 hash see sha-crypt so 6 zem197t4 is passed to crypt

188390
hash	salt
this is the first hint why the result would never be equal to the simple concatenation of salt and password it s not hash only once

188390
ubuntu	debian
in this case 6 rounds 5000 zem197t4 is passed to crypt and the implementation in glibc which is the libc of debian ubuntu extracts the method and number of rounds from this

188390
crypt	hash
what happens inside crypt is more complicated than just computing a single hash and the result is base64 encoded in the end

188411
kate	gedit
also you may check etc default grub using livecd gedit kate after mounting the ext4 partition for any incompatibilities

188418
spaces	delimiter
it replaces the value but the delimiter is missing or replaced with spaces in the output as such

188427
bash	tcsh
bash and tcsh will not let you pipe into oblivion. the command isn t even run

188439
unix	bsd
if we write a script that sets the date on a unix desktop so linux bsd to a random one example in every minute a new date is set 1983.03.12 15h 17

188457
ubuntu	linux
2 install linux ubuntu as the operating system

188481
uniq	grep
i figured it out sort | uniq -c | grep 1

188490
ubuntu	opensuse
the packages for openssh apparently have different names in opensuse than they do in ubuntu and fedora and maybe others

188498
freebsd	linux
if you re only interested in osx and freebsd which is where most osx utilities are from and non-embedded linux you can count on more commands and options both are have more features than average

188501
jobs	cron
how do i temporarily disable one or more users cron jobs

188501
jobs	cron
in particular i do not want to suspend the user s cron rights - merely not fire any of their jobs

188502
mouse	keyboard
vnc doesn t forward sound only keyboard mouse input and windowed display

188509
kde	gnome
i would expect that on kde and gnome this should work out of the box if not you should create a bugreport on the opensuse bugzilla if you are using a different dm wm try running one of the above agents and see if that resolves your issues there is a chance that your de wm does not yet support polkit in which case you are going to struggle to do most of these things it is hard to provide more specific answers to your questions without knowing the de if you tell me i will try to update this answer accordingly

188519
switching	screens
if you would rather not send it to the background that is you want to see it working in your terminal then just start it normally - but then you will want to switching to a new screens

188533
folder	directory
can copy all the modified files to a directory but what i expect is i want the folder holding the modified files should also be created

188548
folder	directory
assuming that with folder you mean directory and assuming you have no spaces or special characters in your file and directory names

188572
cpu	processors
processors uname -p cpu architecture depends on the instruction set

188608
debian	linux
on debian gnu linux for example you merely need to install the qemu-user-binfmt package and then you can run tghese binaries like native ones

188617
xfs	btrfs
at the moment i have a partition with btrfs and home partition with xfs

188618
ubuntu	yosemite	ubuntu	linux
i m a newbie to linux trying to install ubuntu via a usb stick on my 2009 macbook pro 5 3 currently running the latest version of yosemite

188618
ubuntu	linux
is the error something that will happen with all versions of linux or just ubuntu

188662
mouse	trackpad
however if i completely unplug the mouse i can use the trackpad successfully both in xfce and in firefox

188672
spaces	delimiter
...which generates a string of 5000 spaces - which at least are usually only a single byte per and cost nothing to delimit because they are not delimiter

188672
for-loop	loops
...when you think about it is really two for loops - the first is internal and implied in that the shell must loops in some way to generate those iterators before saving them all and iterating them again for your for-loop

188690
bash	zsh
and instead of using print â | â you can use a here string assuming your local shell is ksh bash or zsh

188731
ubuntu	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux
or by getting and booting another linux live os such as an install disc for ubuntu or fedora - gentoo has relatively small live environments since it s also a from-source distro though system rescue cd which is gentoo based reportedly has better hardware support

188739
children	parent
it is basically the same thing - except that rather than reporting on the processing time for a pipeline handed it as arguments it instead reports on the processing times used by its parent shell read the command subshell and all of its children since its parent shell was invoked - and it should write to stdout

188741
virtualenv	tox
if i have the python binary installed then tox will take care of using virtualenv for each python version

188741
ubuntu	debian
so what s the debian equivalent of ubuntu s deadsnakes ppa

188774
switching	screens
i have a not very well working gfx card nvidia geforce go 7400 in my old laptop which prevents the screens from switching back on after waking up from suspending

188774
mouse	keyboard
the system ubuntu 14.10 resumes so i can hear sounds use mouse keyboard etc but the screen stays black without lights so completely off

188778
ubuntu	linux
in the past i have had great experiences with ubuntu studio and kali linux but had them both installed separately

188789
spaces	delimiter
if the previous iteration resulted in two n ewlines in pattern spaces - both ends of your delimiter text then it is p rinted up to the first occurring n ewline

188794
ubuntu	linux
to be honest the only difference between the various ubuntu versions and kali linux are the preinstalled programs and the ones already configured in the repos

188794
ubuntu	debian
you can easily install ubuntu packages in kali or rather debian packages which work in most any debian based distro and the reverse

188819
ubuntu	debian
pick an ubuntu version that s from slightly before your debian version and it should have all the necessary libraries

188825
sysv	systemd
init.d also known as sysv script is meant to start and stop services during systemd initialization and shutdown

188825
daemons	systemd	sysv	systemd
on a debian systemd with sysv not systemd crontab 5 mention please note that startup as far as reboot is concerned is the time when the cron 8 daemons startup

188825
daemons	systemd
in particular it may be before some systemd daemons or other facilities were startup

188825
sysv	systemd
on a debian systemd with sysv not systemd rc.local was almost the last service to start

188849
stdout	stderr
during compilation of most if not all software packages the output on stdout and stderr is created by multiple individual processes and the files that are processed changed created in the course of a build are handled by multiple different processes as well

188849
stdout	stderr
which process was it that produced what information on stdout and stderr and what are the ancestors of that process

188852
debian	centos
usually the distribution chose a default location for a service data redhat centos use var svn debian tend to use var lib svn

188896
cpu	processors
my cpu is a core i7 3820 which has 8 processors with ht

188903
ubuntu	debian
and if they really do then why doesn t debian get the debugged code from ubuntu

188903
ubuntu	debian
since ubuntu uses debian s testing unstable as base and then make their release

188905
ubuntu	debian
second because debian s branches are more defined then ubuntu

188905
ubuntu	debian
there are more steps to mark a bug finished in debian then in ubuntu

188905
ubuntu	debian
meaning that they can get all the bug fixes debian has so that they can focus on other bugs where debian effectively is fixing debian bugs and ubuntu bugs

188905
ubuntu	debian
for example a bug in foo.deb in ubuntu gets marked upstream and needs to be fixed by debian

188905
ubuntu	debian
a bug in bar.deb is something that needs to be fixed in ubuntu and debian

188905
ubuntu	debian
the ubuntu team can ignore foo.deb and focus on bar.deb while the debian team needs to work on foo.deb and bar.deb

188905
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu s release cycle is much simpler then debian s

188908
ubuntu	debian
the release process between debian and ubuntu is very different

188908
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu releases are based on a time schedule set release date while debian uses a when it s ready model

188908
ubuntu	debian
most packages ubuntu pulls in from debian are not officially supported universe repository

188908
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu supports 2 architectures while debian supports 13 some release critical bugs are specific to an architecture

188922
ubuntu	debian
as jordanm has pointed out the release cycles are different ubuntu releases every april and october come what may whereas debian releases when testing is ready to become stable as determined by the release team based partly on the release-critical bug-count

188922
ubuntu	debian
there is another huge difference canonical employs people to support the core of ubuntu whereas debian has no infrastructure to pay for people to work on its distribution

188935
post	get
if so i will post configuration details to get your help in debugging this

188938
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
when you want a package missing from redhat enterprise linux rhel which centos un-brands start with fedora epel e xtra p ackages for e nterprise l inux

188938
redhat	fedora
this involves looking at distrowatch for redhat or the identical centos and compare with fedora s libraries which in this case would probably

188938
centos	linux
in the event there isn t an appropriate fedora package my old standby was to try pbone rpm search which encompasses most rpm-based distros including fedora and the more directly rhel-compatible epel repoforge centos scientific linux and more it supplants the venerable rpmfind

188938
rpm	yum
you should be able to install that rpm rpm -i file.rpm though traversing the dependencies can be a bit hairy since you re not using yum or even apt-rpm

188939
bash	zsh
ksh93 bash and zsh support process substitution

188944
versioning	upgrade
i m using the broadcom-sta wl driver manually upgrade to the latest versioning

188953
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
keep in mind that if your script is sourced it will be executed by the user s shell not by bash so users of other shells zsh fish tcsh â won t be able to use your script

188953
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
it s relatively easy to write scripts that work in bash and zsh start your script with and most things will work markedly less so to write scripts that also work in fish and tcsh

188953
fish	tcsh
or a tcsh fish â analog

188955
daemons	systemd
i want to make the dumping of the filter daemons in the background and also want to make it in so that every time the systemd is rebooted it is done automatically

188956
chown	chmod
i ve forgot to mention - var www myapp is symbolic link to home myfolder projects myapp --- this has been chmod ed and chown ed as well

188974
mouse	keyboard
so i was wondering if it would be possible using xfce and without virtual machines to essentially make one computer act as two by having two monitors with different workspaces and separate keyboard and mouse input

188983
debconf	apt
for example debfoster finds that tcpdump depends on apt via libssl1.0.0 debconf and apt-utils but apt-rdepends doesn t.

188986
icmp	udp
i checked with wireshark and see it uses udp test packets and corresponding icmp replies are delivered correctly

189049
gentoo	linux
i am using gentoo linux with cifs-utils 6.1 kernel 3.18.7

189084
folder	directory
cpanel created the directory folder for sottovoci.net with nothing in it

189092
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i could add the user on the remote machine to the sudoers file for full permission without passwd prompting but i don t think this is a safe idea and again i imagine i d still need some form of sudo to actually save

189101
joystick	keyboard
i already managed to map the input of a joystick to keyboard inputs by writing a file in my xorg.conf.d directory the file is named 51-joystick.conf

189101
joystick	keyboard
- if i give a higher number to the config file of the first joystick 52-joystick1.conf and 51-joystick2.conf only the first joystick s inputs are mapped to keyboard inputs

189103
sudo	passwd
remember that you use your user s passwd with sudo - not root s passwd

189104
chown	chmod
is there a way to back up and restore file ownership and permissions the things that can be changed with chown and chmod

189107
chown	chmod
and to clarify i mean acls in linux i do not mean the default permissions modified with chmod chown

189116
debian	linux
while playing quake 4 on linux debian jessie i noticed that one of the left side buttons isn t recognized and the right side button kinda shoots only one shot

189166
ansible	puppet
if you have a configuration management tool like puppet chef ansible fai.

189166
debian	centos
reboot your server in single user mode red hat or specify debian and rhel centos 7 then fix the permission

189180
debian	mint	debian	linux
my environment is fairly stock linux mint 17.1 so ubuntu-trustyâ like debian gnome 3 and the rest of the stack that i am less familiar with

189197
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
according to ceph documents they recommend configuring ceph to use the xfs filesystems in the near term and btrfs in the long term once it is stable enough for production and at the end ext4

189229
for-loop	arrays
so split does not fill the arrays with values but fills it it with one value the str2 so in your for-loop you print b i but actually you print once b 1 which is your entire str2 and because it has new lines you think it prints members of arrays b but if you check m the retrn value of split it is 1

189295
ubuntu	linux
now the machine is ubuntu 12.04.05 lts with linux 3.2.0-77-x64 kernel

189313
ubuntu	linux
then when you install choose e to install ubuntu or whichever gnu linux distribution you want to do then you will be able to see your ms-windows partitions once you have installed the ntfs-3g driver

189317
rpm	yum
my recommendation having encountered this before it to rpm -e --justdb the newer duplicate package installed then yum upgrade the package then rpm --rebuilddb just because i m a bit of a paranoiac

189317
rpm	yum
you may want to yum clean all right after the rpm -e --justdb to be sure of that - and make darn sure you specify --justdb or you could do all sorts of bad things to your system

189321
rpm	yum
my issue revolved around yum finding inconsistencies when getting the rpm s from the repo s i was pointing to

189358
bash	zsh
wouldn t that just be assuming bash or zsh or ksh for which the base posix shell does not support

189364
gif	png
i would like to create a shell script to check all files in the directory to make sure they are real jpg gif or png files

189393
post	get
if i could at least get suppliers to have static html served through https then the firewall question could be considered solved and i could post the reverse proxy question separately if necessary

189400
folder	directory
and a few other folder that match some found inside the usr directory on the computer

189404
kerberos	ldap
scenario my home dir is on nfs identities are in ldap and authorization is via kerberos

189404
kerberos	ldap
my nfs ldap and kerberos servers are all vms -- i m stretching a little hardware a long way at home

189415
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr for rc.local to somewhere you can check

189419
hash	md5
i m looking to create a md5 hash to use in etc shadow

189419
put	get
every time i put the same password in i get a different hash

189427
filesystems	btrfs
resize the btrfs filesystems on dev md 5 so that it occupies no more than half the device

189427
filesystems	btrfs
use blockdev --getsize64 dev md 5 to find out exactly how many bytes the device contains and make the btrfs filesystems smaller than half that

filesystems	btrfs
you can see devids with btrfs filesystems show mountpoint

189427
filesystems	btrfs
i expect that for this procedure you are using a btrfs filesystems with only one member device

189427
filesystems	btrfs
double check the size of the btrfs filesystems

189427
filesystems	btrfs
now it s time to get rid of the btrfs filesystems

189431
bash	zsh
bash and most other shells except zsh don t allow nested substitution

189441
bash	zsh
i finally understood discovered why i never got to using bash s and also zsh s brace expansion range properly the syntax is instead of what i assumed to be an ellipsis

189455
bash	zsh
you can change it in bash using shopt -o failglob which will then give an error as zsh does and help you diagnose the problem instead of misbehaving

189477
screens	tablet
i have tested the tablet modus once and the played a bit with the buttons under the screens so rotated the screens

189485
stdio	fflush
you can see that dd fflush its last input buffer as well 949+1 records were read in but 950 were written out - dd synced it s last input block to the full 4k size w nulls which is a generally reasonable block size to choose when accepting piped input from tools that use stdio - such as grep

189503
mouse	keyboard
when watching a flash video in a browser a youtube video in iceweasel for example if i interact with the flash element with a mouse click to play or pause or something the flash element seems to steal subsequent keyboard inputs meant for the browser

189509
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
i m really new to freebsd in general coming from debian linux

189538
google-chrome	firefox
this includes all of youtube on both firefox and google-chrome

189574
debian	linux
i am using debian distribution and i m interested in the debian-modified linux kernel rather than in the vanilla kernel form kernel.org

189607
apache	nginx
i have long since documented the steps required to configure my servers apache nginx samba postfix whatever

189608
ansible	puppet
i would strongly discourage you from writing your own but tools like puppet chef and ansible are designed to solve this precise problem

189609
kde	gnome
there is a good backup solution for linux with gnome or kde qt called backintime here

189624
debian	linux
you re actualling installing a binary package which happens to contain the source code of the linux kernel with the debian patches applied and none of the debian packaging infrastructure

189626
debian	linux
i am running debian gnu linux in virtual box i wish to use seemless mode

189637
stdout	stderr
tzselect prompts via stdin stderr with the result going to stdout

189668
ftp	telnet
connecting to other open ports 21 ftp 22 ssh 23 telnet â may also offer the hostnames but always in a protocol dependent way â and the hosts may theoretically call themselves differently on all ports

189682
ubuntu	debian
the following works on ubuntu 14.10 and debian 8

189696
sysv	systemd
distributions which use sysv init scripts where systemd is not available used to load modules on init listed in etc modules or etc modules.conf from the kmod job

189716
spaces	delimiter
the result is that a match for any range the first sed scripts for the second begins when the block heading is at the head of pattern spaces - an iteration after it is pulled in w n ext and the previous line is d eleted - and ends when the next block heading first appears and is still trailing pattern spaces as delimiter by a n ewline character

189716
temp	tmp
to the file tmp temp where the numeric portion of the string is incremented from 00000512 through 99999999 at an interval of 512 per block

189716
temp	tmp
if you use this you should substitute in fileb for tmp temp and filea for tmp tempa

189717
ubuntu	mint
most probably you have disabled the ubuntu repositories which should be present for mint installations

189721
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	unix	aix	rhel	suse	solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
there are many variations of unix bsd aix solaris for and many linux-based operating systems rhel ubuntu suse for

189745
folder	directory
this main directory has some folder among which are three folder named ccc ddd and lll which are the only folder i want to target and work on

189747
disk	ram
since a few months i notice than my machine constantly freezes for i o from the disk my machine isn t old i5 6gb ram and it s weird this behaviour it worked perfectly before

189765
udp	tcp
to allow java binary to open tcp udp ports below 1024

189797
filesystems	btrfs
on my system partition containing a btrfs filesystems i do have the following layout

189808
disk	ram
rd.fstab is honored only by initial ram disk initrd while fstab is honored by both the main system and the initrd

189837
postfix	dovecot
i m currently trying to set up postfix with dovecot but something does not seem to work the way it should be

189851
kde	gnome
the session manager is typically tied to your windowing system gnome and kde each have their own session manager

189865
sudo	passwd
i figure the only way to run the shim without already being root or knowing the root passwd is through sudo and i can trust sudo to set sudo_uid and sudo_gid to the right values

189871
folder	directory
how to prevent a user from deleting the folder and files on his own home directory

189885
pull	push
push data but need to pull them and the files are called digits.png

189893
folder	directory
i have a directory which includes some files and some folder containing other files

189893
folder	directory
i m trying to remove these files in the main directory without touching the folder or their contents

189915
ubuntu	linux
as you did not mentioned which linux distribution flavour ubuntu

189927
folder	directory
the -l switch is important because using ls without it will only display the names of files or folder in the directory

189927
folder	directory
d denotes a directory a folder containing other files or folder

189927
folder	directory
w write stands for the ability to write the table of contents of the given directory create new files folder

189927
folder	directory
x execute stands for the ability to enter the given directory with command cd and access files folder in that directory

189927
subtract	add
the chmod command lets us add and subtract permissions from an existing set using + or - instead of

189927
folder	directory
most folder directory are set to 755 to allow reading and writing and execution to the owner but deny writing to everyone else and files are normally 644 to allow reading and writing for the owner but just reading for everyone else refer to the last note on the lack of x permissions with non executable files - its the same deal here

189948
postfix	dovecot
you need to tell postfix to use dovecot as the transport for local deliveries

189971
debian	linux
if i understand right if we execute a binary program by a script file it will be able to see environment variables because environment variables that are set through terminal in linux let s say debian are visible to all programs run by a script file

190012
ubuntu	linux
in my particular case i will be using ubuntu however i asked on unix linux rather than askubuntu in the hope of finding an answer that would work across distributions and not just in my particular case

190015
opensuse	mint
with opensuse kde there is no problem with the alps touchpad but enough other problems to keep me struggling with mint

190020
rtp	sip
ssh 22 rtp 10000-20000 http 88 sip 5070

190033
put	get
job control lets you put it in the background and get it back in foreground again

190046
bash	zsh
in ksh93 bash and zsh you can use instead of

190083
ubuntu	linux
arch linux ubuntu 14.04 the behaviour is the same on both systems

190089
debian	linux
you can also install synaptic which is the package manager of debian kali linux

190110
installation	upgrade
the installation has been upgrade on a regular basis using apt-get

190158
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu and derivatives you can use the rename perl script

190166
freebsd	linux
with freebsd and linux iputils sends a single ping and wait 1 second

190170
debian	mint
if you try update-rc.d i m not a mint user but i m presuming it s debian derived and still uses this stuff on some particular service so that it is only on in one particular level k scripts for it will appear in the other levels

190177
debian	linux
i am using debian linux as os

190203
rpm	yum
i compared the packages list reported by rpm and yum on a centos 6 and 7

190203
rpm	yum
see listing installed packages with yum and rpm mismatch on how to compare therpm and yum lists

190204
rpm	yum
when a key is imported by the system administrator using rpm --import etc pki rpm-gpg rpm-gpg-key-epel-7 rpmkeys or yum install the fake package is created read where does rpm install custom gpg keys

190249
sudo	passwd
sudo will cache the passwd

190252
kde	gnome
most gnu linux distros are made of gnu tools + linux kernel + x11 windowing system + kde or gnome or unity or

190264
debian	linux
the raid is set up using what-ever debian did when i installed the os sorry not a linux techie

190290
width	height
i am not sure if that is the correct way to go through a directory and i cannot find an efficent way to get the height and width of a specific file

190308
mouse	keyboard
any help would be appreciated or the name of different software to share my mouse and keyboard with a windows machine

190340
ssl	https
due to the fact that ssl is end-to-end encryption a proxy such as squid normally knows much less about an https request than it does on http

190340
ftp	telnet
the url scheme or protocol ftp voip itunes or telnet

190354
minix	linux
have a look at elks embeddable linux kernel subset or verison 1 of minix

190372
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo
there are several reasons not to edit etc passwd etc shadow etc group etc gshadow or etc sudoers directly but rather use vipw vigr or visudo

190383
folder	directory
i m trying to copy only the files from one directory not including folder or any files in its subfolders to another location using

190400
disk	ram
only if you want to be able to hibernate to swap this feature is also called suspend to disk and involves saving the entire contents of ram and turning off the power

190428
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
i have a remote connection through nx client remmina from my local box ubuntu 12.04 onto a remote linux box centos 5.3 with no root privilege and it only has a strictly restricted internet access

190437
zypper	yum
i m currently trying for fun to build a package management system similar to apt yum zypper etc... using the git revision system and i searching for a way to know what is the latest stable version of the current branch

190479
bash	zsh
bash and zsh for the sake of completion

190491
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
browsing on the internet i found some code to install it by using ubuntu 12.10+ through the terminal but nothing adapt to linux mint or at least i think it was not

190497
disk	ram
these factors together bring me to personally believe that it is better to have some swap on almost every normal system however for large ram sizes i ignore the ram 2 rule and simply cap my swap at 4-8gb depending on the size of the disk

190529
debian	linux
i am new to linux and as mentioned i am working on the beaglebone black with debian running on it

190537
centos	linux
linux distro is centos 6.5

190542
google-chrome	firefox
other user that can t load desktop but can open some gui software like firefox google-chrome libre office and so on

190542
ubuntu	centos
distros could be ubuntu centos etc

190551
children	parent
within the parent script trap the kill signal and have it kill all the children

190555
ubuntu	debian
getting the same error on debian and ubuntu

190563
folder	directory
i want make a backup of my home directory and i ve read a good method is to use the tar tool and i think it suits me well since all i need to do is create a .tar of every folder in the home directory desktop.tar documents.tar etc and then transfer if to the external hard drive ehd

190563
folder	directory
so i m was thinking to follow this procedure to verify the integrity of my data i will use the desktop directory as example but it is exactly the same for every other folder

190563
hash	md5
calculate md5 and sha-2 hash for desktop.tar

190563
hash	md5
calculate md5 and sha-2 hash for backup desktop.tar and verify they are the same as the ones calculated in the second step

190563
hash	md5
i know the tool used to calculate the md5 hash is md5sum but i m not really sure what tool to use to calculate the sha-2 hash function

190568
hash	md5
since the probability to get a hash collision due to random bit errors is very low - even with md5 you don t really have to upgrade to sha-2

190576
apache	nginx
besides my source installed applications i was thinking about trying to move my dns dhcp iptables nginx apache configurations there as well - applications that have extensive configurations and need to be backed up and if i rebuilt the server for whatever reason i would want those configurations to be retained

190588
ansible	puppet
if you re going to manage multiple machines though you should really look at centralised configuration management with tools such as cfengine puppet chef ansible .

190596
sudoers	passwd
add your script to the etc sudoers file with the nopasswd attribute so that it is permitted to run without prompting for a passwd

190621
bash	zsh
this requires your interactive shell to support process substitution it must be bash ksh93 or zsh

190639
stdout	stderr
the following will send any cron output to usr bin logger including stderr which is converted to stdout using 2 1 which will send to syslog with a tag of date_logging

190670
filesystems	btrfs
how do i detect changes additions deletions modifications to a directory tree without filesystems support like btrfs snapshots

190700
jobs	cron
op at the top of my crontab just before any jobs i have these comments to remind me of the cron format followed by the mailto variable setting

190705
min	max
it ll roll up data points to make a min max average for a sampling interval and allow you to scale your sampling intervals - so you might keep 5m resolution for a week 1hr resolution for a month and daily resolution for a couple of years

190723
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux ubuntu eclipse

190728
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately tlp isn t currently available via standard ubuntu or debian repositories

190751
jobs	cron
no cron jobs are running at those offline times and it also doesn t happen at the same minute or so indicating some regular cron job

190757
ubuntu	linux
last time i used linux in a desktop environment was ubuntu in 2009 and at that time i seem to remember a full screen zoom feature through compiz-fusion or something to that effect

190757
ubuntu	linux
since bodhi linux is based on ubuntu i am wondering if there are others out there who have found alternatives to the full screen magnifier that was once bundled with ubuntu

190767
ubuntu	debian
that way no need to edit the def_https_mirror back and forth for debian ubuntu containers.

190779
ethernet	wireless
that s a wireless card but the same sort of file will exist for an ethernet card

190834
mouse	keyboard
i have using a windows computer mapped each key combo on the mouse to something on a normal keyboard

190837
imagemagick	pdftk
if you would like to try imagemagick s compare but multiple pages cause a problem you could also use pdftk to extract single pages and compare all of them separately maybe just comparing a single one is enough though

190841
tesseract	ghostscript
i have a script which looks at a pdf and first tries to extract text using pdftotext but if this fails as it will with a scanned document it uses ghostscript to turn a multi-page scanned pdf into a series of png files and then uses tesseract to convert this series into a single text file

190841
tesseract	ghostscript
ghostscript and tesseract are both open source and work from the command line

190849
ubuntu	debian
this looks like a peer-to-peer solution for debian and possibly debian derivatives like ubuntu repositories

190857
bash	subshell
the main bash process starts a subshell to execute sleep 1

190866
centos	mint
i have a dual boot system with mint 17.1 and centos 6.6

190866
centos	mint
i want to access a file in my centos user s home directory from mint

190884
centos	mint
you can can mount a centos partition in mint

190887
ubuntu	linux
is swapping in general disabled on common linux distributions ubuntu

190889
ubuntu	debian
most os installers including the ubuntu debian installer will create and enable a swap partition if you select all of the default options in the installer in particular if you use automatic guided partitioning

190899
ubuntu	debian
in the debian ubuntu world you should not provide individual .deb file to download and install

190899
redhat	fedora
in the fedora redhat centos world i would make a similar advice to provide a yum repository

190991
mouse	keyboard
there is an unofficial patch that adds the -u option where you can specify a lazy grab and with the combination release the keyboard and mouse

191008
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if you are in the sudoers you can sudo bash and then passwd to change root passwd

191010
xfce	cinnamon	xfce	kde	kde	cinnamon
currently the available desktop environments the distribution offers are cinnamon mate kde and xfce

191010
kde	cinnamon
so my question is from the remaining desktop enviroments cinnamon mate and kde which one consumes fewer resources

191011
kde	cinnamon
both cinnamon and kde are relatively heavy

191011
ubuntu	mint
mint uses its own repositories and the ubuntu ones which means that you will find blackbox openbox fluxbox windowmaker lxde and probably a good deal more

191029
vlan	packets
the default behavior is to add a interface that will only accept packets where the 802.1q field is the same as the vlan id to this given interface

191044
ubuntu	linux
it works extremely well in ubuntu but when i manually install it on amazon linux and other distros it often comes up with two bars rather than a single one as demonstrated in the screenshot below selected in red

191055
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have ubuntu 12.04 lts and installed drivers for canon mx 920 according to the instructions canon drivers for ubuntu and linux mint

191086
centos	mint
if you mount the centos home directory on mint the filesystem records centos user ids but user ids may have been assigned differently on mint

191086
centos	mint
let s say your centos user id is 500 and your mint user id is 1000 and mint has no user 500

191086
centos	mint
after mounting the centos home directory on mint you ll see the files as belonging to user 500

191094
rpm	yum
run rpm -qf usr share zoneinfo etc utc to see which package contains that file and reinstall it with yum reinstall

191119
debian	linux
my current system is debian but i am interested if any linux flavor supports this feature

191121
chown	chmod
if a or root wants to grant permissions to b then they should do so with chmod or chown if root does it

191125
spaces	delimiter
the above cut s the echo output with a spaces delimiter -d and outputs the first field -f1

191149
debian	linux
the closest you can come with on-machine resources on a debian type linux is to verify the package database via debsums

191168
debian	centos
i have a new debian server by linode and my previous server was a centos run by hostgator

191228
ubuntu	debian
this is what i see on both ubuntu and debian

191229
ssl	https
ssl is a parallel protocol used with https servers

191261
stdout	stderr
this allows shells that don t easily allow duping stderr to stdout i m looking at you csh tcsh to avoid the noise

191271
sudoers	visudo
you can use the visudo command to safely edit the etc sudoers file with some syntax checking before the file is really saved

191274
spaces	delimiter
i know that if i was just using find i could use the -print0 argument along with the -0 argument on xargs to keep xargs from treating spaces as delimiter

191296
ubuntu	linux	disk	ram
is there an easy to use version of linux ubuntu preferably that can be booted via optical or usb disk and be run completely within ram

191297
folder	directory
what could be an efficient way to copy or move the directory to another folder

191304
disk	ram
if the target system applies write-caching and is able to fit a significant part of the file in ram in your case it should be since ram is much bigger than your test file then it can claim the write is complete before it has actually reached the disk this could mean that your measured 200mbps is

191341
umount	btrfs
one is mounted the working btrfs disk the other is umount

191341
filesystems	btrfs
the result of sudo btrfs filesystems show

191361
hash	md5
etc localtime and usr share zoneinfo australia perth have the same md5 hash

191361
ubuntu	debian
this is in contrast to debian ubuntu which have etc init.d hwclockfirst.sh that runs early in the userspace part of the boot process and fixes the system time according to etc default rcs which has or

191398
spaces	delimiter
the default fs field separator delimiter is a single blank spaces

191408
put	get
you may get some milage put of examining the output of

191440
switching	screens
now i want to switching to the window bash on the split screens

191442
width	height
that can squeeze that font to say 70 of the height while keeping the width in a format that is understood by konsole

191446
mouse	keyboard
the usb mouse and keyboard continues to work

191447
bash	zsh
without gnu ln but with gnu bash -o extglob or zsh -o kshglob or ksh93

191466
cpu	processors
run uname -p to see what processors type your system has and make sure you downloaded java for that type of cpu

191472
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	fish	ash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash	ash	tcsh
while this is not defined by posix it is available on all shells i tested on ash bash dash fish csh ksh tcsh and zsh

191485
sudo	passwd
since your computer is not connected to the internet most security concerns are moot and you could just use sudo s -s option that allows passing the passwd from stdin

191485
sudoers	visudo
first run visudo to edit the sudoers file and add this line

191485
sudo	passwd
that will allow the user nate to run sudo sbin shutdown without a passwd being requested

191488
ubuntu	centos
i think they are standard on centos but should be available for ubuntu

191493
disk	ram
these may be very much larger than the ipc overhead but there are many variables here cpu type disk type and fileystem type available physical ram os and version libc and version â at least

191503
folder	directory
so if your includes usr local bin which it most likely does that folder is full of symbolic links like ruby which point to the specific directory where the code to run ruby is found like .. cellar ruby 2.1.3 bin ruby

191516
stdout	stderr
the message isn t being written to stdout it was probably being written to stderr instead

191554
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu and other systems where rename is a perl script as opposed to the one in util-linux this command will be sufficient as long as the files are from 1 to 99

191576
chown	chgrp
chown chgrp all the files back to what they should be

191595
freebsd	linux
note that this should work both in linux and freebsd

191615
debian	linux
what command-line options would provide the lowest memory-footprint jvm in openjdk or possibly other jvms linux debian

191647
chown	mount	chown	chmod
then attempt to mount the drive after mounting the drive you will need to use the chmod command to assign the appropriate permissions or chown to make yourself the owner whichever you feel is appropriate

191647
sudo	passwd
what is the output when you issue sudo su and press return and use the passwd for your user account

191652
mdadm	btrfs
this can be done with either btrfs or mdadm

191652
filesystems	btrfs
so a snapshot must be created on the same filesystems as the btrfs subvolume for which the snapshot is to be made

191658
icmp	udp
unfortunately firewall or router often drop those icmp packets so you won t be sure what state of udp port

191676
ubuntu	debian
it s available as a separate package not part of the default installation in debian since wheezy and in ubuntu since 12.04

191676
dpkg	apt
if you only use apt to manage packages like most people then var lib dpkg available is not kept up-to-date

191676
dpkg	apt
note that cloning a package installation with dpkg --set-selections doesn t restore the automatic manual mark in apt

191680
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu and derivatives rename is a different more powerful utility and the util-linux utility is called rename.ul

191698
solaris	bsd
it s a minor variant of the bsd linux solaris â œmd5â which is the one generated by openssl passwd -1

191698
salt	md5	bsd	aix
from reading the code it seems that the difference is that the bsd md5 variant effectively prepends the string to the salt in one place whereas the aix variant doesn t

191698
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
note that ldap salt md5 is not a good password hash because it isn t slow

191698
bsd	aix
the bsd and aix â œmd5â algorithms are slow to ideally slow but way better than non-slow algorithms

191700
ubuntu	mint
edit this should work on mint as well ignore my ubuntu comment

191703
single-quotes	double-quotes
the various quoting mechanisms are the escape character single-quotes and double-quotes

191723
udp	tcp
unlike tcp udp is connectionless

191768
stdout	stderr
therefore i assume that openssl can handle password prompt and input from the terminal without interfering with stdin stdout probably prompt goes into stderr and password reading is implemented using some tty magic

191775
debian	linux
i m running linux debian 8 distribution on my notebook

191780
centos	linux
i ve the same issues on haswell i7-4790 fourth generation running 32 bits linux kvm machines on centos 7 x64

191791
putty	winscp
iâ m trying to do something with putty or winscp but i donâ t know how

191830
bash	zsh
this uses process substitution which is available in common interactive shells bash zsh also in ksh93. if you have the column utility it s a convenient way of aligning the columns

191835
trash	tmp
i know my root partition is becoming too small yes i already emptied trash and tmp there is no real folder taking up too much space

191842
filesystems	fat
without any more information than this i am going to guess you are trying to copy a 4.4 gb file to an external drive with the fat filesystems

191850
google-chrome	firefox
the windows version has a lovely auto-copy to clipboard on highlight right-click to paste behaviour and there are excellent plugins for both google-chrome and firefox to enable the same behavior but on linux no copy love afaik

191862
debian	linux
i d like to be able to access the debian or other linux desktop environment via a web browser like you can do for a printer or wireless router etc

191910
bash	zsh
i use zsh where i can but a solution that works on bash as well would be appreciated

stdout	stderr
...which rendered no output on stdout so grep matched nothing other than 0 or 1 and the following on stderr

191923

192203
gentoo	linux
the cross-development toolchain is gentoo linux

192203
mouse	keyboard
so i was wondering about the most straightforward way to send local keyboard and mouse touchpad events to the remote host given that i m no kernel developer

192203
mouse	keyboard
for instance i could figure out using netcat to send local keyboard mouse events from to a remote machine but as far as i understand there must be a keyboard and mouse plugged on the remote machine.

192317
bash	zsh
this must be for a regular bin sh script not bash zsh etc.

192320
folder	directory
for instance cat 2x tab would list all files and folder in the present directory and cd proj 2x tab would list all the directory starting with proj

at this point i can ssh from my ubuntu host to my centos guest but i

double-quotes rather than single-quotes

192846
ubuntu	mint
from what i ve gathered from mint s repositories mint 17 qiana is based on ubuntu 14.04 trusty tahr and instead of hosting everything themselves mint rely on the ubuntu repositories to provide all the packages that haven t been modified by mint

192846
ubuntu	mint
it seems that mint installs the ubuntu version of the package then overwrites the affected files with its own versions without using a package

192846
ubuntu	mint
now ubuntu have updated base-files for 14.04.2 and because mint uses the ubuntu repositories that update gets picked up by mint installations

192846
ubuntu	mint
you can either keep the mint versions or use the ubuntu versions

192846
ubuntu	mint
the only consequence in the latter case is that software which needs to determine what distribution it s running on will find ubuntu rather than mint but mint is similar enough to ubuntu for that to have no real impact

192859
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu debian and fedora the package is called python3-sphinx

192876
stdout	stderr
if no error but you still don t get your compilation errors in the out file then your makeall script is almost certainly doing something very strange with the stdout and stderr file descriptors

192877
dpkg	apt
my goal is to log apt dpkg activity using syslog rsyslog so that log entries are sent to central syslog server

192877
dpkg	apt
dpkg writes to var log dpkg.log apt writes to var log apt directory

192877
dpkg	apt
i did some research and it seems that apt nor dpkg are able to use syslog

192886
filesystems	btrfs
to complete lambert s answer there is also btrfs a linux filesystems which allows to create and restore snapshots of subvolume of the filesystems

192886
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is included into the linux kernel and you can use it a you root filesystems

debian	linux
it s changed the linux version information on the machine from debian to kali and grub shows kali although the system appears to be working fine thus far

osx	yosemite
my issue is when i mount a folder from my desktop to virtualbox on mac osx yosemite it sets the permissions to drwxr-xr-x

in my case it was a curl bug found in openssl so curl needed to be upgrade to the latest versioning 7.40 and it worked fine

192956
centos	linux
here is an example on centos 6.5 which should be the same as scientific linux

192993
daemons	systemd
ironically since daemons management is done differently with systemd all of the log_daemon_msg commands become irrelevant since any management script that sources lib lsb init-functions ends up diverting all control commands to systemctl

lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
some advanced filesystems such as zfs and btrfs have them as a built-in feature as do some disk layers such as lvm

193019
debian	linux
the easiest way to do that is with recent enough versions of the chpasswd tool from the linux shadow utilities suite debian wheezy is recent enough with the -r option

193019
crypt	hash
if your build environment doesn t support chpasswd -r you can use a tool that generates a password hash by calling the crypt function and inject that into the shadow file by text manipulation

good day yesterday i tried to extend my swap partition cause suspend hibernation didn t work and i needed to decrease size of my debian linux disk i don t ever remember if it was ext2 et3 or what i used parted and waited about 1 hour until it was moving data to right okay it still didn t work so i wanted to get back to status quo it said it was moving data to left and i canceled resizing

193075
ubuntu	debian
i m assuming you are using a debian ubuntu based system as they do not automatically remove older kernels whereas fedora and family do

193075
versioning	upgrade
it might be wise especially if you ve just upgrade a kernel to keep a previous versioning installed too - just in case

193088

even on linux operating systems it could be the debian almquist shell or the policy-compliant ordinary shell

193210
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
on freebsd it is the almquist shell like on debian linux

193231

you need to direct both stderr and stdout into the file

it s a ksh thing that was adopted by bash and zsh

in my opinion your best bet will be to use a configuration management tool like puppet chef cfengine or ansible so you can define your policies based on the host type and apply it to any new host

193390
mouse	keyboard
by default the x server would attach keyboard and mouse to display 0 0 but how to change it to another screen such as 0 20

193407
hex	binary
if you want the binary output for a string of hex digits xxd -r -p

193414
versioning	upgrade
for example if the shell executable responsible for that while loop is upgrade the kernel will not be able to release the disk space for the old versioning until that script quits because it needs to maintain the descriptor as long as it runs

193431
sudo	passwd
it fails because sudo is trying to prompt on root passwd and there is no pseudo-tty allocated

193436

over the years i have accumulated many directory -- i guess folder is windows mac terminology

is there a way that i can assign the cpu affinity as i launch the process

193469
versioning	upgrade
that will ask apt-get to upgrade rhythmbox to the latest versioning and will show what s preventing that if anything

193493
folder	directory
in an extreme example of the principle one of the old unix mailreaders that almost nobody uses anymore elm asks for your approval before creating the directory that it will use to hold its config file .elm and mail folder mail

193497
sudo	passwd
the ubuntu user on this same system doesn t prompt for passwd on sudo and is member of the same groups

193534
bash	zsh
now i know that different shells do the coprocess thing in different ways - and that there is a specific syntax in bash for setting one up and probably one for zsh as well - but i don t know how those things work

193534
bash	zsh
i just know that you can use the above syntax to do virtually the same thing without all of the rigmarole in both bash and zsh - and you can do a very similar thing in dash and busybox ash to achieve the same purpose with here-documents because dash and busybox do here-documents with pipes rather than temp-files as the other two do

centos	linux
i want to run some of my python scripts on my new linux centos 6.5 machine that i developed on another linux machine also centos 6.5

193619
filesystems	btrfs
is there a convenient way to get information on all btrfs filesystems subvolumes without resorting to c in posix shell

193619
filesystems	btrfs
sys fs btrfs contains info only on filesystems nothing on subvolumes so currently i end up mounting all filesystems in a temp folder scanning them with btrfs subvol list then parsing the resulting output

193640
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
the cloud-init application commonly used on aws instances places a sudoers configuration in that directory for allowing the default user to sudo without a passwd

193650
lvm	umount
and since you have lvm your file systems will be listed as linked files in the directory dev mapper so don t try to umount or use e2fsck on dev sda2 for example but rather on dev mapper whatever like dev mapper vg_hostname_lv_root dev mapper vg_hostname_lv_home .

this will open up your perception if you find differences on scroll and color behavior while reading man 1 on linux less -is pager or freebsd man 1 for example

bash	zsh
for example bash ksh and zsh allow provide here-strings

bash	subshell
in that second case readlink is executed in the same process that interpreted the command line because that s the last command run in that subshell so bash optimises out a fork

194285
disk	ram
there is a tiny chance that there are fragments of the file itself in freed ram that hasn t yet been reallocated or returned to the os but it s probably not worth your time to try to construct a program to dump the contents of ram to a disk file and then plow through it to try and find your file contents

luxtrust says that the device works on windows and mac but support for linux is weak however they support ubuntu even though gemalto itself offers support and drivers for the device

194654
rpm	yum
there are cases where you use rpm first to perform some preliminary stuff before yum

194679
rpm	yum
you can also use yum to install a local rpm so it is still helpful if you prefer to manually download all the rpms helpful if you are looking to install specific versions of everything - as long as the dependencies are met

194706
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
if your find command has the -maxdepth option linux gnu or busybox freebsd netbsd osx

bash	zsh
in shells that support arrays ksh bash zsh but not plain sh you can put the list of arguments in an array

195018
daemons	systemd
depending on what exactly you need to do various alternate solutions might apply such as using a version control systemd or having a daemons that watches for changes using inotify

195020
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs isnâ t too much stable to be used as deafult filesystems

can anyone tell me if dovecot postfix support connecting to mysql using ssl and if so how to do it

195105
hex	binary
there are two options i could first obtain a plain xxd hex dump like the one shown above and convert that to binary or may be there s some tool or utility in bash that i don t know about that could do this

centos	linux
i am running oracle linux 7 centos redhat based distro in a virtualbox vm on a mac with os x 10.10

195151
folder	directory
my goal is to output a list of users who have a home directory set in etc passwd that points to a folder that doesn t exist

195171
stdout	stderr
you can swap the stdout and the stderr stream

195174
stdout	stderr
in theory this could rarely cause a loss of ordering between stdout and stderr

195187
fflush	gets
so i added a udev rule which fflush the addresses of each eth-device that gets taken down

195214

it is supported by bash zsh and other common shells

195301
debian	linux
i am using latest version of kali linux and it is based on debian

195307
spaces	delimiter
this is one of only a few ways to get a n ewline in a sed pattern spaces - the n ewline character is a sure delimiter to a sed der who has been doing it awhile

195307
spaces	delimiter
this means that each time a n ewline is appended to pattern spaces which does not match your end delimiter the t est command fails and branches back to the l abel which results in sed pulling in the n ext line and looping until successful

195350
punctuation	words
if that words contain punctuactions and punctuation are words don t cause much trouble you could try this way

195373
subnet	packets
at first you have iptables -a forward -s 192.168.10.0 24 -d 0 0 -j accept this will make iptables forwarding packets originating from 192.168.10.0 24 subnet destined to 0 0 meaning every other networks

195404
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you can use the ciopfs stackable filesystem which implements a case-insensitive filesystem on top of a case-sensitive one

195472
folder	directory
i am copying all the newest .zip files each recursive sub directory inside this original folder

195472

i want to see if the formatting details i specified are doing what i thought and generally inspect things after a huge amount of copying to the btrfs filesystems

195583
debian	centos
recently i ve installed centos 7 on my pc previously i had debian 7 and manjaro installed

195583
debian	centos
when i installed manjaro i overwrote the bootloader of debian and manjaro s grub recognized the two systems and all worked perfectly now that i installed centos i overwrote boot efi and the new grub recognized the three systems but only centos works

195608
udp	tcp
i know that there are different type of port like tcp and udp

195608
udp	tcp
should i close all tcp and udp ... the open listing port to keep my computer save from hacking

195616
spaces	delimiter
for each line read sed also gets the n ext appended to pattern spaces following an inserted n ewline delimiter

195629
folder	directory
here --relative option link ensured that the directory structure for the affected files at the source and destination remains the same inside data directory so the command must be run in the source folder in example data projects

195648
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
trying some other gnu linux distribution to see if it has the same problem easiest using live cd like debian or ubuntu

195658
kde	gnome
in desktop it s just shipped with gnome kde packages

195660
opensuse	linux
a distribution can include software that s more suited to server use in its repositories but at the end of the day it s linux and if you really wanted to you could install frogatto on sles although you might have to compile it from source or get it from opensuse

195660
filesystems	xfs
on a side note fedora 22 server unlike the desktop edition but like rhel centos 7 will use the xfs filesystems by default

195660
filesystems	xfs
of course the fedora installer allows you to choose the filesystems of your choice in both cases so if you want xfs on your desktop you can have it

195675
decoder	encoder
if that didn t work it s because you don t have a swf decoder or a gif encoder

195681
daemons	systemd
later the book went on to describe the svr4 print systemd which usesthe lp command to send a file to the print queue and the lpsched daemons to print

for-loop	loops
this for-loop will use seq to loops specified number of times to get the job done

195701
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i was wondering since recently i ve decided i want to move from ubuntu 14.04 to xfce mint linux if games installed in ubuntu will run in mint

195706
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
linux mint is based on ubuntu or debian which ubuntu in turn is based on but they don t always make releases at the same time so the version of ubuntu that you had and the version of mint that you have now may not include the same libraries

195712
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
on debian and derivatives ubuntu mint â the rename command is a different one

195716
sudo	passwd
press ctrl + alt + f1 and enter your user name and passwd at the login and passwd prompts then run sudo -s to get a root shell

195717
filesystems	ntfs
i tried recovering moved files with success both in case of files that are moved to a directory within the same partition or to a directory in a different partition with a different filesystems ext4 to ntfs

195734
folder	directory
the first allows the owner and users in the folder s group to access the directory and add new files to it while the second only allows the owner to access the directory

195734
folder	directory
do note that even if users can add files and read the directory list they may not be able to read or modify any other files or folder inside that have different permissions that prevent them from reading or writing to it

195735
filesystems	btrfs
there are reports that because btrfs causes fragmentation of files on a filesystems level virtual machines may run slow

195765
ubuntu	linux
i want to create a usb-to-usb data transfer system in linux preferably ubuntu

195775
bash	zsh
does any one know some other way to do multiline strings in bash zsh

195803
disk	ram
what s important to confirm your hypothesis slow because lack of available ram is if it s currently swapping in or out to disk

195816
sctp	tcp
or - given the large similarity between tcp and sctp - is enough of the kernel s implementation of these stacks shared such that sctp also partakes of tsq

195831
debian	linux
i m working with the beaglebone black which runs debian linux and sometimes i will lose wireless connection to it while i am testing my programs

195848
filesystems	ntfs
unable to mount windows ntfs filesystems due to hibernation

195848
debian	linux
as mentioned in debian wiki ntfs page ntfs linux kernel ntfs driver provides read-only access and ntfs-3g userspace ntfs driver via fuse provides read and write access

195888
filesystems	btrfs
for some unknown reasons my btrfs filesystems is corrupted

195965
folder	directory
so is it possible to allow users to only create directory in the root scripts folder but allow them to create scripts only in those sub-directories

196007
vmware	virtualbox
in my case i found that virtualbox was interfering with vmware fusion 7.1 on yosemite

196012
folder	dir
the folder . dir is empty and the two files . a.cpp and . b.cpp exist inside the folder with the make file s

196102
freebsd	linux
a userspace virtual terminal aimed at replicating linux and freebsd pc-bsd kernel virtual terminals

196111
cinnamon	gnome
this happens only with xfce4 using cinnamon or gnome doesn t reproduce this behaviour

196116
tunnel	vpn
this script will create the vpn tunnel interface inside a network namespace called vpn instead of the default namespace

196118
centos	linux
in a linux terminal centos i am using the command in order to see the logs of my application

196147
bash	zsh
shells like bash and zsh do in fact track the cursor position and the number of columns they believe the terminal has and output various terminal control sequences at the ends of lines but only so that they can implement some of their fancier line editing features like right-hand prompts horizontal scrolling displaying and erasing tab completion menus rewriting refreshing the current line etc...

196166
debian	centos
however i m not sure about e.g debian squeeze or centos 6 or 7 and so on

196170
ubuntu	linux
i have a samba share on win server i have no access to the server settings with many symlinks in it and a pc with linux ubuntu from which i try to access the share i mount it via mount.cifs

196173
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
use imagemagick or graphicsmagick

196183
sysv	systemd
because ubuntu just switched to systemd from upstart in that version but keeps upstart and sysv init for backwards compatibility

196204
filesystems	btrfs
please do note however that while raid0 1 10 are fairly stable they have been in the kernel for a long time now and for example suse linux enterprise server 12 officially supports these modes the raid5 6 code only became semi-complete in linux 3.19 and raid5 is at this time still susceptible to the write hole so if you do try out btrfs raid5 then do make sure that you have good backups of any important data which everyone should always try to do anyway regardless of filesystems

196218
filesystems	btrfs
i m working on automating creation of btrfs filesystems for my purposes in the cloud

196242
rpm	yum
if bind is the correct source rpm then why is yum update bind saying that the bind is not installed on the system

196249
put	get
the problem is the way tou get the result of your command and put it in your variable

196252
debian	linux
on debian linux for example one can install the systemd package but it is the installation of the separate systemd-sysv package that makes it the active system

196252
debian	linux
indeed the debian linux crowd has taken steps in debian 8 to shift towards every program having a different name lib sysvinit init lib systemd systemd sbin runit-init sbin minit sbin system-manager and so forth for this very reason that the non-activating packages don t conflict on the name sbin init

196252
debian	linux
the debian linux crowd wanted to shift towards every program having a different name as mentioned earlier

196252
debian	linux
ironically as explained at one way on debian linux at least for detecting the absence of system 5 init is the absence of etc inittab

196256
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is designed to perform a lot of different operations online with the filesystems mounted

196256
filesystems	btrfs	umount	btrfs
the other method i thought of would be to create a tiny btrfs filesystems with all the settings and subvolumes you want umount it and take a block-level image of it

196279
stdout	stderr
to avoid this you can use to redirect all output stdout and stderr to a file

196288
opensuse	linux
i am trying to install opensuse but i m not quite confident where i should designate the linux partition

196326
udp	tcp
in udp - the packet would be dropped but what happens in tcp

196339
bash	zsh
though if you re doing numerical computation and are using ksh or bash or zsh you might prefer to use this syntax for clarity

196359
for-loop	arrays
now what i want is to somehow put these extension names .jpg .jpeg .txt .dummy in an arrays then use that in for-loop something like but i tried it and it does not work the shell seems to not allow arrays in for-loop

196372
opensuse	linux
i know there are a few sync tools available in linux i use opensuse os btw but i think they all do a pure sync and i am looking more for a backup function which is not synced i could be mistaken

196374
lan	intranet	wan	lan
i do not utilize the wan interface but rather one of the 4 lan ethernet interfaces which is connected to the rest of my intranet and where internet gateway lies and basically use the antennas of my unit to provide access to intranet and internet for wifi devices

196378
sudoers	passwd
in the sudoers file i can specify that a user bob can run as a non-privileged user jailed_user without passwd

196412
imagemagick	mogrify
imagemagick tools convert or mogrify will do the job

196417
kerberos	ldap
the same kerberos password is used to log in through ssh and there is a ldap backend for user info group home default shell

196429
daemon	cron
it s a daemon that checks items in the crontab cron table and runs them at the appointed time s

196431
stdout	stderr
presuming you re attempting to use the shell from your parent process you need to call pipe twice and both in the parent one of the pipes you write to and the shell reads from on stdin and the other the shell writes to stdout stderr and you read from

196438
daemons	systemd
or if its set up the other way you can add in members of the lock or whichever group which is generally only users for systemd daemons

196451
centos	linux
as title says i am remoting on to a linux box centos 6 using x11vnc

196471
unix	bsd
system 5 unix had a bsd compatibility toolset

196471
unix	bsd
unix system 5 release 4 bsd xenix compatibility guide

196471
unix	bsd
but like the bsd compatibility tools on unix system 5 they aren t exact workalikes and things have been largely flattened

196471
openbsd	netbsd
the often nowadays incorrect received wisdom that shutdown execs halt reboot in fact still holds on netbsd and openbsd

196483
debian	linux
i am experimenting with capabilities on debian gnu linux

i want to copy this folder in a new folder copy where i need to copy the directory structure but keep the files as symbolic links to the original files in source and its subfolders

196576
vmware	virtualbox
i am running kali linux in a virtualbox vmware and although the resolution fits my screen properly the icons windows text is so small

gentoo	linux
i have gentoo linux installed on a 25.93gb 62.43gb partition dev sda4

196599
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i can use the following command without any problem on backtrack 5 based on ubuntu but not in kali linux based on debian

196608
osx	yosemite
on osx 10.10 yosemite you can have to use these attrx parameters

196633
folder	directory
what it does is for the current directory search for any then declare the output to have its extension to be .mkv then afterwards delete the original file then the output should be saved to the very same folder the original video is in

196636
kde	gnome
i don t want to install any gnome or kde dependencies to perform this simple task

196667
ubuntu	linux
the core of the system is based on linux and ubuntu

196680
ethernet	wireless
a unix domain socket is probably a bit more secure than a tcp socket open to the world and probably a bit faster as the kernel does it all and does not have to rely on an ethernet or wireless card

196714
versioning	upgrade
kernel modules whether in-tree or out-of-tree are installed in directories specific to given kernel versioning so you shouldn t need to clean up modules to upgrade to a new kernel the new kernel simply won t consider the old modules

196731
cpu	processors
i suspected the processors of being overloaded playing the files but the top command reveals less than 20 cpu utilization

196737
centos	linux
linux kernel new feature called transparent huge pages thp which is by default enabled on centos 6.x and above os

196752
undo	yank
this may be false hope but undo seems to be possible with the 7.16 rpm source from fedora likely the debian packages sources with the yank and pull features and some strategic tweaks

196758
daemon	cron
stop the cron daemon and check your etc crontab and files for multiple cronjobs that create those files

196766
x86	mips	microblaze	blackfin	powerpc	microblaze
it is available for a number of computer architectures including 68k arm avr32 blackfin microblaze mips nios powerpc and x86

196775
ubuntu	linux
however ubuntu and probably most other linux distributions now implement trim as a cronjob to improve performance so this is not of any practical concern

196780
put	get
right now i have to do hexdump to get hex number and put into sed as follows

196782
free	realloc	free	malloc	realloc	malloc
write an ld_preload library overriding the functions you want to trace example with malloc realloc free override here and use libunwind to display the calling stack

196787
filesystems	xfs
on the other hand if you copy all the files from a filesystems of type ext4 to a filesystems of type xfs that s not a clone but you will have copied all the data and your underlying filesystems type will remain as you have configured it

196792
vpn	lan
my end goal is to have the pi connected to the vpn bridging the local lan to the vpn and then having the laptop connect to the vpn for both secure internet browsing via the vps nat and local lan access

196824
filesystems	btrfs
on my btrfs filesystems i have a problem with block id #43231330304

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
when i try to download some applications like vlc it shows in download options various operating systems which includes linux mint ubuntu etc

196942
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
though linux mint s kernel is from ubuntu still they have compiled the application for both the distros

196942
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
but when it comes to ubuntu and linux mint though the base kernel is same why is there a need for recompilation

you have a conflicting ssl virtual host from the ubuntu debian default-ssl virtual host

196953
ubuntu	debian
usr share doc apache2 readme.debian.gz contains some documentation on the debian ubuntu apache config handling

196955
ethernet	wireless
i am currently connected to said laptop through an ethernet connection which is sharing the wireless connection to the router

196966
tar	gunzip
does tar or gunzip does have problems in reading from ntfs

196971
ubuntu	mint
i am installing elementary os i had the same issue with plain ubuntu and fedora mint and some other distros on a sony vaio vgc-js1e s and everything works perfectly ok except i cannot change the resolution to 1680x1050 which is the default

196972
debian	linux
i m using kali linux which is based on debian and wrote an script to copy some files from where the script is based to a specified directory

197004
versioning	upgrade
upgrade linux to versioning 4.0+ and

197008
sudo	passwd
both commands just ask for my passwd for sudo then write

197019
width	height
also notice that gnome-terminal sets width and height in columns and lines while xload sets those in pixels

197019
width	height
so in the screenshot above you see me create a startup entry for 30 colums width and 20 rows height

197019
width	height
the formula for wmctrl is gravity xoffset yoffset width height don t ask what gravity of the window is since i ve no idea myself just use 0 and -r parameter implies by reference to a window with specific title

197020
google-chrome	firefox
my webcam is working properly using other programs - camorama guvcview and web browsers firefox and google-chrome

197039
ubuntu	debian
the ubuntu based version the default one is guaranteed to work with ubuntu packages and the lmde is guaranteed to be compatible with packages from the debian repository

197039
ubuntu	debian
even though most debs of debian works in ubuntu it still some non-compatible packages due to file system hierarchy changes between debian and ubuntu or some specialized libraries

197039
ubuntu	mint
for that you find two different debs for mint and ubuntu to ensure that no problem will face u if u use the lmde mint

197050
ubuntu	yosemite	osx	yosemite
i am running ubuntu 10.4.04 lts as guest in virtualbox on osx yosemite

197061
daemon	cron
that however will not guarantee that the script will run after xfce4 since it will be executed when the cron daemon starts

197064
anjuta	gnome
when i attach an external hdd gnome suggests opening it with anjuta

197071
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	mint	centos	mint	centos	linux
you should replace home username with your home directory and adjust .config if you don t have that on your centos i did this on ubuntu and linux mint

197081
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
as i had previously successfully installed different versions of ubuntu s linux mint s

197095
debian	linux
linux debian 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.65-1+deb7u2 x86_64 gnu linux

197137
folder	directory
for local projects or collections it s common to archive a directory tree from the desired folder s parent so as to avoid cluttering the current directory in case the archive is accidentally unpacked in-place

197137
folder	directory
if big_folder lies somewhere deep in a standard nix hierarchy it may make some sense to start archiving the first non-standard folder where big_folder deviates from and its directory tree from there

197141
folder	directory
i m assuming that the directory is supposed be auto-created so it can be connected to the account to serve its function and that simply creating an appropriately-named folder in mnt won t do anything

197154
ubuntu	debian
normally ubuntu has a system inherited from debian called alternatives which ensures that when there are multiple implementations of a program the choice of program and the choice of man page are consistent

197155
daemons	systemd
it s only systemd daemons that run under their own account

197158
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
this command is available as rename on debian and derivatives ubuntu mint â

197166
internationalization	localization
internationalization and localization often referred to simply as i18n and l10n is when software is adapted through translating the text and interface and smaller things like how numbers are formatted to better suite other languages and cultures

197170
switching	screens
this should return the permissions to the default case and allow you to log in normally to switching back to graphical screens after switching to the vt press ctrl + alt + f7

197209
filesystems	ntfs
if you are using kernel ntfs driver it does not mount filesystems read write as that is considered unsafe

197220
ubuntu	linux	filesystems	ntfs
i would have used rsync -avrz storage3 storage4 and then deleted the files afterwards but i got another question why do you have those shares using ntfs filesystems if you are using linux ubuntu then i would have gone for ext4 or reiserfs butterfs

197220
filesystems	ntfs
i suspect something should be fixed inside the ntfs filesystems drivers you are using in your ubuntu installation which distribution of ntfs are you using how did you mount the disks are they local attached to the ubuntu box you are sitting on or are they mounted using iscsi from a san

197238
copying	overwrite
it says that an existing copying file will not be overwrite but doesn t say anything about the install file so it seems like it will be unconditionally overwrite

197253
versioning	upgrade
i have linux mint 17.1 cinnamon versioning on my notebook hp compaq 15-h050nl and about 1 month ago i upgrade the linux kernels to the current versioning 3.18.2-031802-generic from the last versioning

197254
automake	autotools
this will tell autotools that you are not following gnu coding standards and automake will not create the usual gnu project text files including the authors copying install news readme and changelog files

197259
gentoo	linux
i am a newbie on linux and i have chosen gentoo for my linux distribution

197263
gentoo	linux
gentoo is a linux distribution that compiles packages from sources

197263
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
to give you an example chromium-browser in linux mint based on ubuntu takes only 44mb of space in disk instead of 5gb that will take on the system of the mint developer that maintains this package and compiles the updated binaries for the mint users

197263
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	mint	centos	mint	centos	linux
if you have disk space restrictions maybe you could test a different linux distribution that provides precompiled binaries centos ubuntu mint etc also with another distribution you will install and update packages faster and easier as they don t have to be recompiled each time

197285
division	modulo
is modulo perform division operator

197304
ubuntu	openbsd
similar questions have been asked for openbsd and ubuntu although not answered particularly conclusively

197304
debian	linux
os uname -a on the pavilion gives linux crunchbang 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.65-1+deb7u2 x86_64 gnu linux

197316
bash	zsh
in bash and some other shells like zsh you can use which contains the last argument to the previous command

197337
ubuntu	debian
i wrote a schroot guide in how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

197344
openvpn	iptables
my setup is rtorrent running under a dedicated user account with all internet traffic for that user only directed through the vpn via openvpn and some iptables rules

197344
openvpn	iptables
i have tried the port forwarding with openvpn running system wide and the rutorrent webui shows the port as forwarded â so i m guessing my issue stems from the fact that the vpn is only active for one user and that i m using iptables to achieve this â but i can t figure out how to make it work

197348
debian	linux
i am new to unix linux and corrently setting up a debian wheezy server for my domain name

197381
freebsd	debian
first alternatives is from debian and will not work in redhat freebsd or many other systems

197382
bash	zsh
since bash 4 also including zsh a new globbing option globstar has been added which treats the pattern differently when it s set

197387
awk	ksh
it is supported at least by bash and ksh . use awk if you want to post-process the data to extract only the function names

197403
filesystems	btrfs
then i converted the ext4 filesystems on the disk to btrfs with label raid using btrfs-convert -l raid dev sdb

197403
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs filesystems show shows me the three disks all working

197408
lvm	umount
with lvm you could easily enlarge it across another disk but you are going to umount the room filesystem first

197418
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
i have rc files for nearly every popular shell bash tcsh zsh ksh and i intend to apply the solution in all of them

197424
debian	linux
2 days ago on my debian linux i have installed steam with about 50 packages with it

197426
daemons	systemd
the cleanest would probably be to make whatever you want to run when the systemd is going to sleep hook into logind â s inhibitors and then run it as a background daemons

197426
daemons	systemd
a more general solution would be to have a daemons hooks into the logind inhibitors see systemd-lock-handler and xss-lock and then when the systemd is going to sleep it will activate a user session target that you can order your services under

197433
fish	bash
you can of course configure your shell to use awk with minimum typing like calc 10 3 see notes on how to do it for bash 1 and fish 2

197434
sudo	passwd
it can do ssh public key management along with a lot of other things like setting up central sudo policies automount policies passwd policies managing user x509 certificates and do host-based access control

197450
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
zsh bash ksh but not tcsh

197452
debian	linux
i have a sun type7 keyboard on my debian linux etc debian_version 7.8 box and since it appears to be much like the sun type6 i attempted

197454
folder	directory
i changed the datadir location by copying everything to the new folder and set a symbolic link in the default directory to my new folder

197464
folder	dir
also i hope not to mv each file to a new dir because even ls is very painful for this huge folder

197476
for-loop	arrays
next the for-loop slices this arrays and forms strings from the slices

197491
bash	zsh
you can have it call whatever interpreter you wish bash csh zsh sh perl or anything

197497
bash	tcsh
specifically i want to do the equivalent of this bash code in tcsh

197504
jobs	cron
i ssh to a server and want to add some daily jobs specifially to renew kerberos tickets even when i log out and i still want my programs in screen or tmux continue to run to cron

197512
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
debian and ubuntu and other derivatives divides linux kernel packages into several parts

197513
folder	directory
to tell the sizes of files and folder in the current directory in mb and gb

197521
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
if you use one a mainstream filesystems ext4 btrfs on lvm you can do it while your system is running enlarge the lvm volume arrange to have some free space on the physical volume s then run lvextend then enlarge the filesystems on it to fill the volume run resize2fs or btrfs filesystems resize

197526
folder	directory
when it is complete your new tb drive should appear as a folder in the directory structure probably in alphabetical order between pictures and videos

197526
folder	directory
you don t actually need to configure the drive to appear to be a folder in your directory structure but it will appear rather seamless

197554
centos	linux
actually on centos 7 bin sh is a symbolic link to bin bash which is the shell available by default on most linux distros

197585
bash	zsh
zsh bash yash and newer versions of ksh use this syntax instead

197609
clang	llvm
i need to use different llvm related executables clang llvm-config etc that are under project local directories and i need to use 1 default version for general purpose compiling etc

197617
daemon	cron
it is not necessary to have a screen or tmux session running since the cron daemon will execute the scheduled tasks in separate shells

197627
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu 14.04.2 lts with subversion 1.8.8 and attempting to set up remote svn access via apache2 with mod_dav_svn - this is a migration to linux from a windows server running apache2

197637
sudo	passwd
i understand that running mount -a will do the same thing that would ve been done at boot but when i run sudo mount -a as my user just mount -a says i need to be root i do get asked for a username passwd

197667
spaces	delimiter
telling paste to use spaces as delimiter

197673
debian	linux
why is the same .nanorc file not working the same on four linux systems fedora 21 is working two fedora 21 not working and debian wheezy not working at all

197681
daemons	systemd
systemctl enable works by manipulating symlinks in etc systemd systemd for systemd daemons

197693
daemons	systemd
system-wide locale settings are stored in the etc locale.conf file which is read at early boot by the systemd daemons

197693
vim	gedit
for those who haven t chosen their favorite editor yet and vim is not their cup of tea can use gedit

197698
disk	ram
modules are loaded when the system boots via the initial ram disk a.k.a the initrd

197710
ubuntu	linux
i want to deliver a linux tool as a bootable usb stick and so i am trying to create a usb stick with the ubuntu core

197718
ubuntu	centos
i am trying to work with control groups on two different operating systems ubuntu and centos

197723
stdout	stderr
you shoud redirect all stdout and stderr of all your crontab jobs to dev null or some logfile when you are interested in the output

197725
daemons	systemd
if the loginuid immutable value is set the init script or admin can t make the systemd call which either clears or resets the lognuid attribute before starting the daemons and now the daemons is running with the admin s loginuid screwing up audit logs etc

197725
daemons	systemd
if the value is modifiable then there is a systemd call audit_setloginuid which can be made by a process with appropriate capabilities perhaps sbin service for example to clear or set a reasonable value for loginuid on the given daemons

197728
harfbuzz	freetype
1 harfbuzz and freetype apparently have an infamous circular dependency

197728
harfbuzz	freetype
c build new freetype with harfbuzz

197728
harfbuzz	freetype
d finally build pango with the freetype in step c plus harfbuzz explicitly

197728
harfbuzz	freetype
i might pass on harfbuzz entirely unless you re sure you need it since it appears introducing it implies rebuilding freetype too

197736
centos	linux
i am a little stumped on this one and maybe i have been staring at this for too long...but i cannot get my mac 10.10.3 machine to connect to my oracle linux 7 centos rh 7 server with its firewall up

197739
hex	binary
so you need to use hex first to break out of binary mode

197752
daemon	cron
if you need to run a job more frequently than this you may want to consider either a standalone daemon or two lines in cron one of which is preceded by sleep 30

197757
jobs	cron
the second problem is that cron jobs run in a very limited environment

197772
ethernet	wireless
then either 1 add a virtual wireless interface with the same ssid as your wireless network and connect those routers with wds or depending on location of the routers 2 connect them via ethernet

197776
disk	ram
i believe i can use --parallel 15 leaving one core free can use something like -t run shm sorttmp to keep temp files on a ram disk so it s fast 1 can use -s 50g to utilise available memory and can tweak to reduce the use of temp files here i m not sure what a good value would be..

197776
disk	ram
1 -s in combination with the ram disk for temp files is a bad idea

197776
disk	ram
the kernel will likely kill sort when it writes to the ram disk and memory is almost full see this comment

197798
folder	directory
trash folder are just directory

197821
ubuntu	yosemite
i tried it on mac os x mavericks yosemite ubuntu 2014-04 with awk being the default awk which is nawk because both awk and nawk point to usr bin mawk or gawk and they all worked

197828
chown	sudo	chown	mount
i ve reformatted it ext4 and tried re-mounting it in media owncloud following sudo chown -r pi pi media owncloud but hit an error with the mount

197829
filesystems	fat
the uid and gid options are intended for filesystems which don t track ownership themselves fat for example

197841
bash	tcsh
in some shells like tcsh or readline -based ones like bash the emacs one is the default and probably the one you expect

197841
vim	emacs
with zsh you get emacs mode by default unless or contains vi if you re a vi nvi vim elvis user though also vimacs and if is home vi ctor bin emacs ... zsh assumes you prefer the vi mode

197850
width	height
there are certain exceptions a cjk letter takes up two adjacent cells and xterm even supports printing a normal letter in double width and or double height i ve never seen it being used anywhere except for terminal tests but then it s still aligned to the basic grid

197865
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
i just upgrade my manjaro installation to versioning 0.8.12

197878
bash	zsh
and that is what i see in bash zsh ksh and dash

197880
stdout	stderr
or what if you just want to throw away stderr and leave stdout

197893
stdout	stderr
so you can use to redirect both stdout and stderr diagnostic output

197893
stdout	stderr
this works by redirecting stdout to dev tty which is the current tty in a subshell the parens do the same as in bourne shells and the output of the subshell which is only stderr since we redirected stdout is redirected to dev null but this can be anything like a file

197898
jobs	cron
how to set default umask for cron jobs please

197898
daemon	cron
is the default umask hard-wired in shell or it is inherited from cron daemon

197936
versioning	upgrade
glibc upgrade often require restarting running daemons because the name service switch nss abi changes or just to get the daemon to actually used the upgrade versioning

197960
google-chrome	firefox
visiting the website using google-chrome and firefox as well as using the vpnui client still produce the same certificate validation failure

197993
filesystems	hfs+
on a case-insensitive filesystems say extfat or hfs+ specifically non-case sensitive how does the filesystems provide access to the same file with both upper and lower case versions of the filename

197999
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
when you use a case-insensitive filesystem on a unix box various utilities will do weird things because unix traditionally uses case-sensitive filesystemsâ so they re not expecting document1 and document1 to be the same file

198016
stdout	stderr
on a practical level programs are coded to handle stdout and stderr

198036
versioning	upgrade
later the library gets upgrade to a new versioning

198036
versioning	upgrade
later the library gets upgrade to a new versioning with an incompatible abi

198041
next	except
what i figured out is that all of the files have the same name except for the number next to chm and chr

198050
sorting	filtering
find is of course much more flexible than ls when it comes to listing and filtering files but it doesn t do sorting by itself

198098
gtk	motif
another option is using gvim with a motif athena gtk gui

198121
tunnel	vpn
i ve already done a vpn bonding of ssh tunnel but it will be better if i use ipsec

198134
kde	gnome
gnome and kde are examples of linux desktop environments

198163
gentoo	linux
on one of my systems i m running gentoo linux and i ve installed x11-libs gksu-2.0.2-r1

198163
sudo	passwd
i ve disabled the root account using sudo passwd -dl root and i want to be able to run gui apps which need root privileges using sudo

198163
sudo	passwd
i ve set gksu to use sudo for authentication using gksu-properties but it s still asking me for root passwd when i launch an application that needs root privileges and not mine

198169
sudo	passwd
after using sudo and entering a passwd to do so sudo remembers that we have entered a passwd and we do not have to enter a passwd the next time we use it

198169
sudo	passwd
i used sudo to do so so from now on assume we are in the remember that the user does not need to enter a passwd to use sudo state

198169
sudo	passwd
in testdir i created a testfile using sudo after this we don t need to enter a passwd to use sudo anymore

198181
unix	solaris
unison runs on both windows and many flavors of unix solaris linux os x etc. systems

198185
daemons	systemd
the main reason for this is so that the logs from the systemd startup get saved until the syslog daemons gets a chance to start up and collect them

198187
daemons	systemd
the kernel log is stored in a memory buffer so that boot logs have somewhere to be until the systemd has bootstrapped itself to the point where the syslog daemons can take over

198188
stdout	stderr
the network is not reachable message is printed to stderr not stdout so it isn t captured by your substitution

198188
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stderr to stdout when running ping not when you log

198228
stdout	stderr
for example in csh you can t redirect stderr to stdout

198240
filesystems	btrfs
sudo btrfs filesystems defragment -r -clzo home

198246
bash	zsh
whether dash bash ksh zsh posix sh or posh a reimplementation of the bourne shell sh

198267
bash	zsh
here is shell code bash ksh or zsh that may do what you want

198283
folder	directory
the above downloads readme.md to the temp directory in the current folder but preserves the original readme.md and numbers all subsequent readme.md files

198290
ubuntu	debian
if not so i wonder how these huge amounts of packages in different branches of debian and ubuntu are built

198310
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
also distributions like ubuntu linux mint and so on which are based on debian have that file

198317
sudo	passwd
if i try to open sublime text editor using the command sudo subl filename it is asking for the passwd

198320
octal	hex
i use od to print me the octal or hex of a file stdin string

198323
debian	linux
i m with debian testing 3.16.0-4-686-pae #1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt4-3 2015-02-03 i686 gnu linux

198340
versioning	upgrade
as i did past times in ubuntu i ve waited to the package manager to notify me the new versioning is out and to upgrade the os but elementary simply does not do this

198384
debian	mint	debian	linux
i have a machine with linux mint debian edition 2 betsy installed as rc with all available updates applied and mate desktop environment

198387
folder	directory
then if there are no subdirectories in that directory cat all files to one give that file folder name because it s the actual file name transfer it one directory upwards .. and then delete that directory the one used to create a file with filename

198413
spaces	delimiter
if so you might then use explode with a spaces delimiter to get the job number

198428
erlang	elixir
i tend to think they have a typo on their documentation and wrote apt-get install elixir instead of erlang because all other blog posts i found that use the same .deb do install erlang and then install elixir manually

198431
uptime	reboot
windows loses memory with time in about 20-30 days of uptime i get to a point when i prefer to just reboot

198431
google-chrome	firefox
firefox deals way better with little memory than google-chrome

198431
google-chrome	firefox
firefox warns you and still runs google-chrome just crashes

198442
opensuse	linux
scenario i am writing a linux installer based on opensuse 12.2 that runs in an initrd actually initramfs and i m trying to update the bootloader

198464
mpfr	mpc
as listed on this documentation page gmp mpfr and mpc are prerequisites to gcc

198481
filesystems	ntfs
i m currently storing the sub-folders of my home documents music on an ntfs filesystems and it appears to be

198481
folder	directory
now delete the documents directory and create a link to that ntfs folder in its place named documents

198508
disk	ram
it includes multiple tools to measure performance on a wide range of storage formats including disk memory cards etc and memory ram l1 and l2 cache etc

198516
stdout	stderr
they are the streams pseudo files stdin 0 stdout 1 and stderr 2

198518
fish	bash
for these commands in both bash and fish

198525
maven	pom.xml
in an eclipse web application project that uses maven i am getting the following compilation error in the pom.xml

198527
folder	directory
to set read write execute permissions to the home user workspace minimaldbaseexample directory and all files and folder within it choose which permission set you want and do the following as an example

198535
bash	shellcheck
fwiw shellcheck can be very handy when writing bash scripts

198536
ubuntu	linux
if this is correct is there any difference between these commands or reasons to use one over the other for primarily ubuntu server hardening script but also trying to be as generic as possible eg different linux versions or distribution compatibility

198538
ubuntu	debian
ultimately debian s and therefore ubuntu s adduser calls gpasswd

198538
freebsd	debian
the one you see is from debian while slackware and freebsd at least have their own

198538
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
i d expect a consistent interface with the lower level commands like usermod and gpasswd since they seem to originate from a common set of tools according to the origins of the package in debian and thereby ubuntu arch linux fedora and centos and slackware

198568
bash	zsh
in this answer i m going to use zsh because it s a lot easier to use than a combination of bash and other tools

198574
width	height
here s a way to get the height and width in one step

198575
config	ini
semicolon starts a comment that extends until the end of a line because git config files are written in the ini format

198581
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m a long-time ubuntu user who recently started trying out linux mint on a laptop

198591
openbsd	netbsd
the nullfs filesystem may be usable under other bsd variants osâ x openbsd netbsd but it is not compiled as part of the default system

198591
filesystems	btrfs
suppose that you have a disk created with a multi-user filesystems ext4 btrfs zfs ufs â on a system where alice has user id 1000 and bob has user id 1001 and you want to make that disk accessible on a system where alice has user id 1001 and bob has user id 1000

198591
ubuntu	debian
see how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

198591
ubuntu	debian
for an example on debian ubuntu

198591
mp3	flac
mp3fs â transcode flac files to mp3 when they are read example

198600
debian	linux
i m new to linux and recently i installed debian 7 in my laptop

198663
switching	screens
you now have a keyboard shortcut to switching a window from 1 screens to another

198674
gentoo	linux
my example is valid on gentoo linux but the same directory structure seems to exist on arch

198678
redhat	fedora
this question applies to redhat el 6+ centos 6+ and fedora

198717
disk	ram
read from the main memory ram rather than from a hard disk drive

198719
disk	ram
since disk tend to be magnitudes slower than ram this is

198724
vpn	lan
but if the vpn client establish a connexion directly to the home server and the response going across my firewall pfsense the vpn server doesn t route the packet from the lan interface eth0 to the vpn interface tun0

198740
zsh	subshell	subshell	dash
in dash each command in pipelines run in subshell zsh and at t ksh the rightmost command in pipelines doesn t so variables x and y are no longer existed when your command done

198742
ubuntu	debian
i m running ubuntu 14.04 but this is also happening on debian wheezy and other ubuntu versions probably using the same driver

198761
width	height
i want the command to determine which jpgs are larger than a certain height taking the width out of the equation

198762
zsh	subshell	bash	zsh	bash	subshell	subshell	dash
in dash like bash but contrary to at t ksh or zsh all parts of a pipeline run in subshell they need to run in different processes anyway since they run concurrently

198776
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is not a native filesystems for any unix linux type os so the tools available for it are going to be...substandard

198780
installation	upgrade
these alone are not automatic by default as far as i am aware in my environment however i have the apt-get upgrade set to run weekly as a cron job as i had stable in my sources.list this basically made some of my servers automatically upgrade to the minimal jessie installation

198791
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i m running ubuntu 15.04 64-bit desktop edition a debian based linux

198794
ubuntu	debian
i m running ubuntu 15.04 desktop edition debian based

198803
afp	smb
but like i said after a while it becomes slow mounted images over afp or smb get almost unusable

198825
disk	ram
when the operating system runs out of ram it will attempt to use the hard disk

198843
ubuntu	linux
if you don t ask arch linux to install his grub bootloader you ll have to run grub-mkconfig -o boot grub grub.cfg in ubuntu if you have os-prober installed it will find your arch installation and update all the config files automatically

198843
ubuntu	linux
you may find information you need about grub in arch linux wiki almost all the instuctions are applicable to current versions of ubuntu

198851
disk	ram
the boot process in linux typically involves using a boot loader to load a kernel and ram disk which eventually mounts the root file system and lets you do things

198855
versioning	upgrade
i wanted to upgrade my glibc to a newer versioning on my remote server to which i only have ssh access so i added the test branch of debian to my apt sources

198859
filesystems	ntfs
i have a directory on a ntfs filesystems which contains files with short and long names i entered copy command for that directory to be copied on a ext2 filesystems files with short names copied whitout problem but copy files with long names was failed i recived file name too long error because number of these files is too high i need a shell script to solve the problem in two steps

198860
kde	gnome
start by booting your system always in linux and configure the window manager of your choice gnome mate kde whatever to suit your needs

198860
vim	sublimetext	vim	atom-editor	atom-editor	sublimetext	komodo	sublimetext	komodo	atom-editor	google-chrome	firefox
then setup your favourite webbrowser google-chrome firefox ... and install a text editor or an ide on which you feel comfortable i myself use vim but in your case initially i would start with komodo atom-editor sublimetext or similar

198863
ubuntu	linux
i have a shell script and i need to run it in order to connect to a remote ubuntu linux machine having encrypted hdd in order to enter the passphrase

198900
openssl	libcrypto
so find those libraries they will all have identical timestamps -- i think there s actually just two libssl and libcrypto with symlinks and move them to opt openssl lib

198904
wan	lan
a hairpin is the name given to the scenario when you start on a lan host and try to connect to a wan address served by the same firewall that serves your outbound session

198904
wan	lan
these situations can be identified by attempting to connect firstly to a different server and then secondly to the wan port from a system that is outside the lan on which the server is located

198907
wan	lan
you have to get into the configuration of the equipment s router nat firewall between lan and wan and map the incoming port on the wan side to the address port of the server on the lan side

198956
ubuntu	centos
when testing strongswan performance we saw that the performance differed by a lot between an ubuntu server and a centos server with everything else being the same

198956
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu had it disabled and centos had it enabled

198970
versioning	upgrade
also you should also make sure that if you have unstable or experimental sources installed you have a suitable entries in your etc apt preferences file otherwise your packages will be upgrade to the unstable experimental versioning

198979
spaces	delimiter
is it possible to modify this so that the only word delimiter is spaces character

199021
bash	zsh
you can usually rely on it to work in current versions of zsh bash yash and ksh93 but not elsewhere as far as i know

199021
bash	zsh
and it is very like convenience-syntax forms which might be used in ksh93 zsh or bash like

199036
folder	dir
so i have dir named initrd-tmp and contain all files and folder from initrd.gz and i have a file called httpd-2.2.29.tar.gz apache

199059
folder	directory
i want to add the files of the folder directory not the directory itself how

199062
ubuntu	centos
hope it can help you but i don t know why it is disabled in ubuntu kernel and enabled in centos kernel

199103
for-loop	arrays
however if i create the arrays using the same for-loop print it on screen and then assign it explicitely to the same variable uncommenting the commented line it works fine

199127
debian	linux
on gnu linux btrfs may be a good bet since i looked online and apparently support was introduced in debian 6

199131
gentoo	ubuntu
the internal display is connected to the intel card while the vga is connected to nvidia from information from my previous installs of gentoo ubuntu ...

199131
post	get
i will post the configuration file if i get it to work

199142
postfix	dovecot
i set up the server with an ldap db and i m using postfix and dovecot for the server and transfer agent

199172
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
edit i realize there s no such file or directory on linux mint hence neither on debian nor ubuntu shall i deduce

199180
stdout	stderr
i would like to prevent my program from sending stdout and stderr to any terminals files or devices

199184
stdout	stderr
this redirects stdout to dev null but it doesn t do anything at all with stderr

199184
stdout	stderr
since you asked to redirect from stdout and stderr this does not do what you want

199184
stdout	stderr
this redirects stdout to dev null and then it redirects stdout again to wherever stderr points to which is probably the terminal and is probably where stdout pointed to before you redirected it

199184
stdout	stderr
so the net effect here is probably no redirections at all for stdout and as for stderr you still don t do anything with it

199184
stdout	stderr
this redirects stdout to dev null and then it redirects stderr to wherever stdout points to which is dev null because that s where you just redirected it

199198
daemons	systemd
an actual http daemons properly installed on your systemd in this case it s probably running monitored in a way that it gets automatically restarted when it goes down

199208
stdout	stderr
so likely i ll make a function for the stderr and stdout just like mentioned here

199218
disk	ram
if it keeps the pages in ram and you run top again it doesn t have to load the problem from disk

199226
ubuntu	centos
in remote server is running centos 6 and in my desktop ubuntu 14

199241
spaces	delimiter
we then paste this using spaces as a delimiter to file1 from which we cut the first 5 characters

199246
folder	directory
external usb drives can only be shared via nfs if the drive is mounted to the users home directory and not the default music video folder

199250
ubuntu	debian
switching from ubuntu 14.04 to debian jessie lxde on a thinkpad t500

199250
debian-based	ubuntu
ubuntu is debian-based but gets the job done

199255
unix	solaris
i think this covers at least solaris tru64 aka digital unix aka osf 1 and hp-ux

199259
ubuntu	debian
debian is much older than ubuntu and is hesitant to break things that work particularly when the replacements require user intervention

199259
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is designed to be easy to use debian is designed to be powerful

199259
ubuntu	debian
my favorite example of this is there was some talk of having debian adopt ubuntu s installer because it was prettier

199272
folder	directory
i then used and the folder got downloaded to the directory i had previously specified as my downloads directory for spideroak

199289
put	get
but also checks all the other records and since the older records aren t in the last hour period they are put into the else category and i get a lot of there is no updates this hour

199301
folder	directory
now suppose i want to move all from all directory mentioned 161901.pdf to a specific directory say xyz with renaming to it s parent folder s name.pdf

199319
debian-based	linux	debian-based	mint
on a debian-based distro such as yours i am on linux mint 17.1 rebecca i found that installing network-manager-openconnect-gnome provided a helpful configuration interface for dns parameters and the like and provides a very smooth integration in linux mint anyway right down to task-tray widgets status

199346
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu there is a nice feature in the panel where i can connect but only the wired one is showing up in debian

199350
installation	upgrade
i can see it pretty clear cause after installation i have lib modules 3.16.7.11-1-arch folder created currently i have running kernel as 3.16.7.3-1 so the repo headers are not compatible or similar demanding me to upgrade

199355
ubuntu	linux
returning to linux after some years away i installed ubuntu 15.04 desktop on a small pc

199379
stdout	stderr
you can also modify the command so that it captures stderr as well as stdout like this the attaches stderr to stdout so you get both written to the logfile.log

199390
daemons	systemd
now the problem after the daemons installation if i shutdown the systemd once k scripts are not receiving stop argument

199401
unix	aix
i have an issue transferring files between unix aix and windows

199402
hash	md5
unfortunately my test.txt.md5 only contains the md5 hash without the spaces and filename

199408
bash	zsh
bash zsh yash count characters dash count bytes

199454
openbsd	linux
i m using synergy to control an openbsd desktop from a linux computer think of it like a vnc client server

199454
openbsd	linux
i m working on a worst-case scenario where the linux box i m using to control the remote openbsd machine is compromised with a keylogger

199454
openbsd	linux
note that synergy works in a reversed client-server configuration the openbsd machine is the synergy client and the linux box is the synergy server

199484
lsyncd	unison
i know some mechanisms like lsyncd incron the inotify and ofcource rsync or unison but it is hard to tie them togoether

199507
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu has this option which can install all mising packages from ethernet of wifi while debian has only ethertnet option

199539
putty	winscp
winscp is just a gui which works similarly to putty but you can browse files on the remote server

199539
ubuntu	linux
i ve found it fairly acceptable and it s a gui so you can just drag and drop files folders between your local windows machine and the remote ubuntu linux machine

199549
folder	directory
i tried all options available on stack exchange and elsewhere on the internet like reinstalling compiz gnome searching the directory name prefixed with a dot and also searching for the hidden files and folder but nothing really worked

199552
ubuntu	debian
this problem was in ubuntu but now i use debian it s awesome indeed

199572
debian	linux
var log auth.log logs among other things failed login attempts to my debian linux

199578
for-loop	while-loop
you can do this with a while-loop as well in personal i just like the for-loop here more

199582
put	get
i suppose something is missing in the shell initialization if i put bin bash in rc.local i get no job control in this shell message and can t send signal to processes nor get pids i get question marks instead of pids in top

199584
sysv	systemd
exposed by the sysv init systemd as implemented by many distributions

199584
sysv	systemd
so the answer to your question would be when compatibility with sysv is removed from systemd .

199591
ecdsa	rsa
at this time openssh does not let you choose which hostkey algorithms to enable explicitly as with say kexalgorithms they are enabled implicitly when viable host keys of each type rsa dss ecdsa are found at startup

199620
hex	binary
this is because in this order the obase value is interpreted as a binary number so you need to give 10000â 16 to get output in hex

199626
disk	ram
additionally if the panic occurred due to a hardware issue bad ram syncing the disk could also write corrupted data from memory to the disk

199634
ubuntu	debian
the below is from ubuntu but the same technique obviously works on debian as well

199645
cvs	svn
the repositories are mostly git but there are svn and even cvs repos

199645
ansible	puppet
are config management tools chef puppet ansible good fit for this problem

199666
bower	npm
there are several attempts to create package managers for the web in order to better solve this bower jam npm nuget etc

199685
ubuntu	linux
i m having this problem with both ubuntu and kali linux

199713
filesystems	fat
this could be bad at least on fat filesystems and be unbearably slow as well.

199725
post	get
also sent to db support will post answer here if i get one

199726
put	get
abort if any of the following commands fail get put reget reput

199726
chgrp	mkdir	chgrp	chdir	chgrp	chmod	chmod	chdir	chmod	mkdir	chown	mkdir	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod	chown	chdir	mkdir	chdir
rename ln rm mkdir chdir ls lchdir chmod chown chgrp lpwd

199733
jsch	openssh
update it appears that jsch - invalid private key confirms that the key is expected to be in openssh format - which is what it appears you are already using

199738
debian	linux
from man dpkg 1.16.16 i386 on a debian 7 based linux distro

199738
stdout	stderr
i think to know the file descriptors stdin 0 stdout 1 and stderr 2

199743
disk	ram
having a 32-bit processor does not limit the size of the hard disk it can use only of the amount of ram it can easily address

199754
ubuntu	debian
works for me debian wheezy - ubuntu trusty

199766
solaris	aix
originally command-line history behavior was similar to what i grew up with on platforms like aix and solaris

199770
fish	zsh
however perhaps you should also check out a shell with more powerful history filtering like zsh or even fish

199787
bash	zsh
either bash or zsh is ok

199794
rar	zip
use this tag for questions about files containing other files and or folders that are not covered by a more specific tag like tar cpio zip rar ar 7z in that case only use the specific tags

199839
ubuntu	mint
after some issues with ubuntu i have decided to go to mint

199876
readonly	temporary
currently i have the entire folder set to readonly which is a draconian fix to temporary stop any new uploads

199890
doc	rtf	xls	ods
it handles pdf doc docx xls ppt rtf odt ods odp csv and many other formats

199893
packets	multicast
once the host receives a multicast frame because the ethernet switch has forwarded it and because the mac layer has let it in the ip layer looks at the ip address and directs the packets to the appropriate socket

199893
packets	multicast
this means that the above-mentioned filtering is not perfect when the hardware is configured to permit one mac address this actually allows in packets addressed to a bunch of ip multicast addresses

199895
debian	linux
pc2 os gnu linux debian

199920
switching	screens
i think you re looking for energy saving â screens energy saving â switching off after

199935
filesystems	btrfs
i created a single-device btrfs filesystems

199943
stdout	stderr
the buffering is on a per basis so stderr is typically unbuffered while stdout is typically buffered

199943
stdout	stderr
that s why output to stderr and output to stdout end up appearing out-of-order when they are both directed to the same file as per your example

199943
stdout	fflush
i ve ended up putting lots of fflush calls into programs that crash so that the output to stdout actually makes it into a log file before a crash

199945
titlebar	window
some tweaks to window titlebar color i like for breeze-dark

199947
sudo	passwd
when you execute sudo command the system prompts you for your current user account s passwd before running command as the root user

199953
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	solaris	netbsd	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
common operating systems include solaris and linux though freebsd netbsd and openbsd are available

199954
cpu	processors
sparc from scalable processors architecture is a risc cpu architecture developed by sun microsystems now oracle

199965
multiplying	division
if you were to do the multiplying by 100 before the division i think you ll get what you want

199980
ubuntu	debian
you can use this ppa for ubuntu debian

199989
for-loop	loops
you should be using continue which will stop the current loops from going on but will go to the next element in the for-loop

200003
daemons	launchd
now if you launchd an app that tries to write settings like gedit the session daemons will report

200016
ubuntu	linux	kde	kubuntu
is a linux distro tied to a particular desktop ubuntu has unity but to use kde i have to use kubuntu

200017
kate	kde	kate	gedit
1 desktop has a set of utilities tied to it in kde you have kate as text editor while in unity it s gedit

200017
kubuntu	gnome	kde	gnome	kde	kubuntu
i use ubuntu but i ve been using openbox blackbox gnome kde which is default in kubuntu lxde and motif interchangeably

200017
cinnamon	gnome
my older laptop can t handle gnome properly with fedora so i ve been using cinnamon desktop which is default for linux mint there

200023
spaces	delimiter
used unquoted command substitution the result will be split into words so you get content of etc hosts as all words delimiter by spaces

200026
ubuntu	linux
my question here is specifically about ubuntu but i m posting it on unix linux because i think the answer will apply to linux in general

200027
apache	nginx
i would recommend lighttp or nginx if you are using embeded hardware because process based web servers apache in default configuration will use more resources for each connection

200032
folder	directory
terminal is telling that no such file or directory when i m in the folder and run the ls command

200036
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
which made cloning my existing btrfs filesystems which was in an lvm logical volume onto a new partition a doddle

200047
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	debian
i was wondering if it is possible to alter debian k freebsd so it becomes ubuntu

200047
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	debian
i know there are builds of debian 7 running on freebsd so would it be possible to get a working ubuntu system with the experimental dkfbsd 7 with the 14.04 userland

200053
versioning	upgrade
there hasn t been any security support for this release for quite a while so you should really upgrade to a newer versioning of mint.

200062
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
or with the perl-based rename command on debian ubuntu and derivatives prename on arch not the linux rename command on other distributiosn

200067
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
additionally you could configure apache lighttpd or nginx or any other http or ftp server to host the mirror location

200071
rpm	yum
yum repo file etc yum.repos.d churchyard-chromium-russianfedora-fedora-21.repo - provided by rpm on the page

200071
dnf	yum
yum then downloads and checks the package and installs it if it needs to dnf may do the same not a clue

200081
dmz	was
if your host machine was in the dmz and you were still getting failed connections it s possible that your isp blocks some traffic - in particular traffic that is commonly associated with servers

200108
filesystems	ntfs
i shrunk the single ntfs filesystems that spanned the entire hard disk so that i could then install ubuntu on a new second partition

200169
ubuntu	linux
if i wanted to run an application from the terminal linux ubuntu how do i do so so that the terminal is still usable or that so if i close the terminal the application still runs

200170
stdout	stderr
all stdout and stderr will be redirected to the file

200182
bash	zsh
try to use the expansion of sh bash zsh

200182
bash	zsh
you can test if a file exists for example a makefile in the shell sh bash zsh with the test or command or the builtin

200188
centos	linux
enterprise linux 6.x redhat centos scientific oracle

200197
bash	zsh
the same goes for zsh which while supporting most bash syntax offers additional expansion and syntax that is not supported by the bash shell

200205
sysv	systemd
trying to reuse an existing sysv init script with new linux version that uses systemd rhel 7

200205
sysv	systemd
where should sysv init scripts be copied to on a systemd that is using systemd

200205
daemons	systemd
where should any custom systemd scripts for systemd user service daemons be created

200215
filesystems	ntfs
would there be any problems in copying files on my linux system with ext4 filesystems to an external drive that is formatted in ntfs

200216
google-chrome	firefox
i wonder if i can browse webpages in google-chrome or firefox using the external ip address of the server

200217
gentoo	linux
i m unable to start tomboy on my gentoo linux system

200234
centos	linux
we can connect to a specific url with linux centos 6 commandline curl wget ...

200235
stdout	stderr
what is happening is that the program outputs to stdout i m pretty sure it s not writing to stderr as it normally would even if it s piped through sed

200236
vmware	virtualbox
how can i quickly check what virtual environment vmware virtualbox lxc etc. if any is currently running on this machine

200264
centos	linux
i m on scientific linux cern 6.6 like centos and this was presumely the default for new users

200275
kde	gnome
so basically i am trying to switch from gnome to kde in fedora 21 workstation

200275
kde	gnome
during the default login process you can use the session menu to choose a kde login instead of a gnome login

200277
folder	directory
but i still have a .wine folder in my home directory and it is not empty 200+ mb

200281
ubuntu	linux
this is an ubuntu linux question and version 15 is now released

200281
ubuntu	debian
# ubuntu debian convention

200281
ubuntu	linux
don t start with system v rc especially not on ubuntu linux

200315
bash	zsh
this is called process substitution and is a trick that some shells bash zsh and ksh but maybe others as well have which enables you to treat the output of a process as an input file to another command

200321
ubuntu	yosemite	osx	yosemite
due to a new job i m switching from working on ubuntu 14.04 to osx yosemite

200377
bash	zsh
any shell is going to have a number of dynamically loaded libraries but zsh and bash will load in a large number

200395
versioning	upgrade
the only thing you have to manually update is the additional copies of grub core should you ever upgrade to a newer versioning of grub

200452
debian	linux
linux version 3.16.0-4-amd64 debian-kernel lists.debian.org gcc version 4.8.4 debian 4.8.4-1 #1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt9-3 2015-04-23

redhat	fedora
i want to install audacity in my machine redhat 6 fedora when i try to install the following error shows

200504
bash	zsh
with ksh93 mksh bash zsh in sh emulation

200514
disk	ram
run shm is a ram disk so when sort needed to cache partial results on disk which it does when memory is almost full memory ran out

200514
disk	ram
using a location stored on a physical disk instead of the ram disk solved it

200542
chown	sudo
sudo chown sid sid var lib matlab

200542
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd sid

200554
debian	linux
the server is linux debian

200559
versioning	upgrade
now the versioning of apache and php have been upgrade 2.4 5.6

200574
ubuntu	linux
i did successfully in ubuntu 15.04 using linux 4.0.1-040001-generic

200580
ubuntu	centos
i know that it loads variables from etc security pam_env.conf that by the way in centos and ubuntu have all its lines commented out

200583
ubuntu	debian
we currently run mostly debian wheezy except for some software only supporting ubuntu

200583
debian	centos
something like centos or debian stable without systemd

folder	directory
sometimes there may be more than one duplicate file and i have no idea if there are duplicate files across folder for example duplicates of album directory

many distributions integrate it directly such as debian or ubuntu which automatically add such a directory in the path if it exists in the default .profile file they ship

filesystems	ntfs
ntfs and ext3 4 filesystems differ substantially in how they store metadata

all the users can sudo to all the commands only their passwd is needed

201862
chown	chmod
as to when the ctime of a directory is updated that s the same as for a regular file when its content is modified entries added or removed or renamed or its metadata except atime upon reading is modified like upon chmod chown acl modifications...

versioning	upgrade
i am using kali and i tried to upgrade libc6 because it comes with a lower versioning than i need

gentoo is a rolling release which means all packages are continuously updated there s no global system version like ubuntu or fedora

202171

unlike other linux distros you don t just get a gentoo iso hit setup and sit back having a coffee while setup does everything

luckily for those who only need to get a feeling of gentoo there s a live release from time to time already compiled and put together

202199
daemons	systemd
the reason i would still use rc.local and not worry about moving it s location is that the time between the ssh daemons starting and users realizing the systemd is available is in all likelihood far longer than it takes the systemd to get to and execute the rc.local script

202213
folder	directory
i am afraid that running tar as root will modify the ownership permissions of the files and directory in the rootfs folder

202226
titlebar	window
the clicked-in window s titlebar color will change and the window will move to the foreground if anything is obscuring it but at seemingly-random intervals usually 3-5 times per day the newly-activated and raised window won t actually get keyboard input focus unless i click on it a second time

versioning	upgrade
the reason that s the case is because it is not easy to upgrade to the current versioning in fedora at least v16 and it requires a complete reinstall

202296
versioning	upgrade
meaning that there are no upgrade to higher versioning you always have the newest versioning

debian	linux
although damn small linux is debian based there are several concepts unique to this distro

202333
mouse	joystick
the xinput mode works fine loads xpad driver but in the dinput mode the kernel identifies the device as a mouse instead of as a joystick

202354
stdout	stderr
when you run cat dev stdout that does exactly the same thing as cat dev stdin or cat dev stderr because these three file descriptors are connected to the same file it tells cat to read from the terminal

202359
sudo	passwd
this will be too quick to see unless sudo prompts you for a passwd

if you need a filesystems to be robust in the face of power failures you should use a journaling filesystems such as ntfs ext3 or xfs

recently i upgrade the system from ubuntu maverick to debian jessie which involved the removal of a bunch of incompatible packages and the installation of a bunch more and could have broken stuff

202543
bash	zsh
whenever i m ending the session daemons started in .xinitrc will not be killed when logging out regardless of using bash or zsh

an easy hack is to print either to stdout or stderr depending on whether the target pattern has been matched

the command i use now is cat datadump.sql | cut -d -f 1-3 | grep create table | uniq | cut -d -f 3

202620
umount	mdadm
i find that if i umount an mdadm-managed array and then either 1 unplug the array 2 power off the enclosure housing the array 3 reboot the system or 4 shut down the system then mdadm issues an alert about a fail event having been detected

202620
umount	mdadm
to avoid generating this alert must i execute mdadm --stop dev md0 after umount and before either disconnecting or rebooting

202633

but when i try to run the same command on ubuntu 14.04 with bin bash shell or zsh as well it throws error

they are totally unnecessary on ubuntu linux versions 14 and 15 which have upstart and systemd respectively

202731

don t write system 5 rc scripts on ubuntu linux

202731
debian	centos
and on version 15 one now has systemd just like on centos 7 rhel 7 and debian 8

202731
ubuntu	linux
there hasn t been a good reason for writing system 5 rc scripts on ubuntu linux for a long while

202731
ubuntu	linux
and one certainly should not start from there if one is coming to ubuntu linux anew

202731
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
write an upstart job file for ubuntu version 14 or a systemd service unit for centos 7 rhel 7 debian 8 or ubuntu 15

it ll cost you maybe a couple of gb of disk space but it s pretty painless especially on debian and derivatives where schroot does the job of setting up a usable chroot environment and debootstrap can install an older or newer release of debian or ubuntu in that chroot environment

for glibc 2.14 you can pick jessie debian or precise or trusty ubuntu as the release to install with debootstrap

203105
bash	zsh
in fact these shells typically work very like your example case under the hood - bash for example sets up readline to handle the terminal i o nitty-gritty on its behalf zsh invokes its zle line-editor and dash if not compiled with the build-time option small links in bsd s libedit library

there are hundreds of lines like this though and the number of spaces can t be used as a delimiter to get the dataid field because it varies from line to line

203373

if you would really want to add a custom button to the titlebar you would need to customize or create the window decoration in an existing or new theme for that

in your application call the system s crypt function to verify these hash

if the programming language you re using doesn t give you access to the standard library crypt function use a pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt library and use that library to generate the converted hash as well again do not use plain sha-256 or sha-512

when i switching it on boot messages crawl on the screens

203768
ubuntu	debian
i have updated my kvm management script for ubuntu 14.04 kvm hosts to support debian 8 guests

203769
daemons	systemd
and you can use one of the several debian kernel log daemons or systemd log daemons busybox-syslogd dsyslog klogd inetutils-syslogd sysklogd socklog-run syslog-ng or rsyslog which push kernel log messages to hellip

203770
ubuntu	debian
my goal is installing ubuntu 14.04.2 lts under debian 7 wheezy with full gnome desktop

203770
ubuntu	debian
to be more precise under this ubuntu i want to install one application nupic if anyone interested seems that installing this on ubuntu is less painless process than installing it on debian

203778
mouse	keyboard
there seem to be some issues with xbindkeys when we use a modifier key to trigger mouse or keyboard events so we will first rebind the super key to a non-modifier key using xmodmap

203822
nerdtree	netrw
the nerdtree plugin is similar to netrw but it is built around a tree-style display in a sidebar

203839
sudoers	passwd
i crated a new user with passwd called e and tried to add him to the sudoers file

203841
sudo	passwd
and i was able to use su - to become root without using sudo because i know the root passwd

203875
post	get
but all i get when system pass through post is the same error

203884
put	get
the hard drive resize any of the partitions var tmp to get the free space after i deleted boot and put a new bootloader on the usb stick

203913
button	checkbox
the play a sound checkbox is checked but the play preview button does nothing

203915
unix	solaris
with some unix man outputs some information during its work eg solaris man says reformatting page

203917
ubuntu	debian
i ve just replaced my debian installation with ubuntu today

203928
ubuntu	debian
is there a 32-bit debian or ubuntu package that contains x86_64-linux-as

203930
bash	zsh
assuming you are using bash or zsh and your mail agent is sendmail then

203932
post	get
the post goes on to show some zstyle declarations that achieve the completion but i would strongly suggest using a zsh package such as the aforementioned oh-my-zsh to get this stuff maintained by the oss community for you

203940
ubuntu	debian
you can use binutils-x86-64-linux-gnu available in debian jessie but not ubuntu

203944
post	get
and some other post saying how to get around this after doing as the guide said i launched the intel installer but it still came up with the same error

203975
ubuntu	linux
since i am using linux ubuntu 14.04 to be precise i want to use the format understood by localedef as input

204011
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

204011
vmware	esx
vmware esx

204027
hash	whirlpool
so whirlpool refers to a hash algorithm similarly to the preceding sha hash

204034
jobs	cron
at a guess i m not a unix expert but have had a similar issue with cron jobs not running what user are you executing the task as

204037
jobs	cron
or do i have to write 2 separate cron jobs for this

204042
mouse	keyboard
keyboard pairing was fast and dead simple but due to a weird behavior in the gui i m not able to enter the code for pairing my mouse

204043
ubuntu	linux
the last said because i ve found that av linux ubuntu studio and other media linux distros tend to be cluttered with pre-installed programs

204044
hash	whirlpool
the specific list you are seeing sha256 sha512 whirlpool size tells you that portage successfully verified the hash sha256 sha512 whirlpool and in addition the file size

204098
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
the result is very different though when i try to connect from my linux mint or ubuntu machines

204165
fat	btrfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	btrfs	filesystems	ntfs
ext4 btrfs fat and ntfs are filesystems in this sense but also in the unixy senseâ they implement the filesystems api

204212
bash	zsh
assuming that your shell is bash this can be adjusted for ksh or zsh

204215
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu ship a number of metapackages that are there just to depend on certain categories of packages and which it s useful to install explicitly

204222
folder	directory
although the directory rights are listed as drwxrwxrwx for the folder

204223
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
i ve noticed this behavior with centos 7 and turnkey linux debian 7 guest oses

204227
daemons	systemd
starting the daemons only requires a pointing it at your custom config and specifying a different pid file to keep it separate from the systemd rsyslog and ensure you have write access

204242
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
if you are using a debian-derivative debian ubuntu linux mint you can use the command

204271
mouse	keyboard
and even my mouse and keyboard were not working

204279
jobs	cron
referring to this i tried etc init.d cron stop and pkill cron which kills all cron jobs - which i don t want

204279
ubuntu	linux
i am running this cron in ubuntu linux

204281
daemons	systemd
don t kill the cron daemons as it does a lot of tasks which are necessary to the systemd

204281
daemon	cron
fyi you do not need to restart the cron daemon after editing that.

204288
daemons	systemd
generally stopping and starting the systemd cron daemons is a bad idea

204292
stdout	stderr
same as for cron simply redirect stdout and stderr to some file or to dev null if you don t need the output but then you should be pretty sure what job you re running and how to check the results

204304
folder	directory
note that if you want to know all sub folder size inside a directory you can also use the -d or --max-depth option of du which take an argument the recursive limit

204329
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
my description is for ubuntu but will likely work on debian and mint

204329
put	get
don t put your changes into the respective en or de file in that folder as they may get overwritten as soon as the and packages on your system receive an update

204352
debian	linux
so i m an involuntary it guy at my current position and we have come across an issue with caldera s flavor of debian linux

204408
kde	gnome
as of debian jessie that s gdm3 gnome kdm kde lightdm lightweight but themable slim lightweight but themable wdm lightweight but themable oldish xdm old-style bare-bones

204429
jobs	cron
cron jobs run with a minimal environment your .profile is not loaded

204429
jobs	cron
on many systems .pam_environment is read even for cron jobs

204431
jobs	cron
i know how to redirect all cron jobs events to a different log via etc rsyslog.conf and it s easy to heavily restrict the logging to say just error events via etc default cron

204431
jobs	cron
but this affect all of cron jobs

204431
jobs	cron
what if i want to restrict the logging of certain cron jobs said frequent every-1-minute jobs

204433
ubuntu	debian
as muru says you can create a script named apt-get in usr local bin which is before usr bin in debian and ubuntu

204440
bash	zsh
in ksh bash or zsh you can test whether a string matches a wildcard pattern by using the double bracket construct

204523
tiff	png
i have a huge list of images without extension most of them are png but there are jpg files also and maybe tiff

204535
stdout	stderr
running a outputs to stdout and stderr

204545
tiff	png
to filename.type where type is jpeg png tiff etc

204545
tiff	png
or to rename only files of type jpeg png tiff that have no extension

204583
stdout	stderr
the first 3 are automatically created for a process as stdin stdout and stderr

204598
for-loop	loops
one can often accomplish the same task with a for-loop where the command producing the list to iterate over is run in the subshell instead of loops

204602
folder	directory
i m trying to backup the folder in windows pictures to a remote linux directory

204619
put	get
so if we put all of that together we get

204627
mouse	keyboard
i would like to associate a specific action in nautilus namely open in terminal with a keyboard shortcut so that i don t have to use the mouse to open the current working directory in a new terminal

204641
chown	chmod
can i simply just use chown or chmod to control the access

204649
filesystems	fat
if the filesystems type is one that doesn t have permissions such as fat you can add umask gid and uid to the fstab options

204677
ubuntu	debian
precising my search i found those two more or less same articles about sound driver setup on debian ubuntu

204677
debian	linux
though not really knowing anything about alsa and or linux debian sound driver architecture i assumed that with this information i will be able to solve my problem

204686
ftp	telnet
expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin tip etc

204696
spaces	delimiter
since those three strings are not separated by a delimiter usually a spaces they will be seen as a single continuous string

204718
bash	zsh
in bash or zsh press ctrl + l to redisplay the prompt and the current input line

204738
macports	homebrew
perhaps the closest thing to what you are looking for is macports or some other package management system like homebrew

204756
ubuntu	linux
if he knows nobody using linux around him the simplest and user-friendlier distro is probably ubuntu

204767
ubuntu	linux
it should be compatible at minimum with os x and at least some major linux distros ubuntu arch linux rhel etc.

204781
kde	kubuntu
kde might be another good choice for a windows-like desktop with kubuntu or linux mint s kde edition

204781
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
my personal favourite would be mate again with linux mint or ubuntu mate edition which by default has a slightly different layout than windows users are accustomed to but can be easily tuned to resemble windows experience

204784
macports	homebrew
it is not a part of debian s apt repository and it is also not part of the two major packaging tools homebrew and macports

204801
versioning	upgrade
my question do i have to upgrade debian wheezy to the next versioning

204808
folder	directory
select the default install location c program files x86 1password 4 it will be installed to the wine folder in your home directory

204808
button	checkbox
check the checkbox for create a desktop icon if you want one and click the next button

204808
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
after i installed the browser extension it worked as expected on all those firefox opera and google-chrome

204813
mtu	icmp
path mtu discovery and filtering icmp

204826
xfce	gnome
important note -- de means for me something on par with xfce lxde gnome 2 not pure window manager where you move windows using keypad

204842
interpreted-language	compiled-language
both python bash script are interpreted-language and the time overheads involved in executing scripts will generally be greater than with a compiled-language otoh python scripts are compiled to python bytecode before execution which generally makes them more efficient than bash scripts which do not have any form of compilation

204851
freebsd	linux
is it possible to configure my freebsd or linux so that all frames are sent in the 802.3 frame format with the llc part of 802.2 rather than ethernet 2 frame format

204867
unix	bsd
the unix linux bsd kernel has always kept track of working directory

204919
versioning	upgrade
the only solution is to upgrade to a more recent ejabberd versioning debian 8 jessie s ejabberd 14.07 for example

204922
children	parent
when launched via systemd if the parent process exits the children all exit too well the screen s that they launch in die and appear as dead

204938
ubuntu	linux
i recently installed linux ubuntu 14.04 to my computer

204944
bash	zsh
the nullglob option which btw is a zsh invention only added years later to bash 2.0 would not be ideal in a number of cases

204944
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
a more sensible default and the one of csh tcsh zsh or fish 2.3+ and of early unix shells is to cancel the command altogether if the glob doesn t match

204944
bash	zsh
bash since version 3 has a failglob option for that interesting to this discussion since contrary to zsh or ksh93 bash doesn t support local scopes for options though that s to change in 4.4 that option when enabled globally does break a few things like the bash-completion functions

204944
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
note that csh and tcsh are slightly different from zsh fish or bash -o failglob in cases like

204944
fish	bash
versions of fish prior to 2.3 would work like bash -o nullglob but give a warning when interactive when a glob has no match

204952
unix	aix
at least one unix aix has documented that backticks are obsolete

204963
sudo	passwd
if i m asked for the sudo passwd after typing it in correctly the terminal moves on almost instantaneously

204994
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for root

205012
switching	screens
i use i3 and as it turns out i miss the screens switching mechanism in a big way

205046
bash	zsh
that syntax is not standard sh syntax yet and only supported as of 2015-05-22 and afaik by ksh93 where it originated zsh bash recent versions of mksh and the sh or recent versions of freebsd

205057
centos	linux
i am fresh to linux and centos

205153
bash	zsh
it works out of the box in zsh but in bash you need to enable it first with shopt -s globstar

205158
spaces	delimiter
the reason that it does not behave as desired is that in cut i defined delimiter to be blank spaces -d but since the number of links second column of ls -lh of the first file is a 2-digit number 20 ls -lh adds another blank spaces to the link counter of the files with 1-digit link counter to adjust the columns positions

205160
children	parent
note that the process must still be running or must be a zombie otherwise the children s parent process id will be reset to 1 and you can t track them this way any longer

205169
tar	bacula
with bacula dd tar cpio amanda whatever you want

205201
debian	linux
i have recently installed linux debian and i have copied from an old windows-xp pc some .doc word documents archives

205218
ubuntu	debian
you can probably fix this by setting the java_home variable in etc default tomcat6 i m assuming elementary os still has the debian ubuntu tomcat package

205253
ubuntu	linux
i operate an hp microserver n54l for offsite backups operated by ubuntu 14.04 lts running linux 3.16 which i recently equipped with an hp microserver remote access card 615095-b21

205253
ubuntu	linux
after an upgrade to ubuntu 15.04 running linux 3.19 i only get a single line per event

205260
switching	screens
a lines to appear on the main screens as they come in then switching to the alternate screens once scrolling is needed so the first of output will always appear in your scrollback

205260
cat	tee
it tee s the input to a temporary file then once less exits it cat s the temporary file if it contains fewer lines than the screen height

205262
switching	screens
a lines to appear on the main screens as they come in then switching to the alternate screens once scrolling is needed so the first of output will always appear in your scrollback

205275
vim	emacs
can tell programs emacs grep less ls and vim

205378
bluetooth	usb
it is inconvenient for me to use usb or the audio jack so i am left with bluetooth

205385
sudo	passwd
i have an ssh standard user account on my personal server and it has sudo access via its passwd

205385
sudo	passwd
i am the only one logging in and if i break something with an update i can always sudo with a passwd to fix things

205386
width	height
however i also use ipython for computations and development in python but when i load this interactive shell it seems to size the shell s width and height at the current terminal window s bounds but then will not resize dynamically if the window is resized

205388
filtering	grouping
the rs variables that were filtering out would get the same number as the previous one in the list ie rs888 has the same grouping assignment as rs009

205407
ubuntu	debian
for example on debian ubuntu â install the fuse package

205409
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
tcsh zsh and fish have somewhat similar mechanisms everybody got their inspiration from tcsh but different builtins syntaxes and capabilities

205412
pull	push
alternatively you can push software from the server instead of trying to pull it from the client

205416
bash	zsh
this is a bash feature from ksh93 also present in zsh but not in plain sh that generalizes pipes

205424
ubuntu	centos
this process i am going to explain is valid for a ubuntu based system but i hope there wouldn t be much differences for centos

205427
ssl	https
if you face some troubles for your https website due to ssl errors run your script like this

205446
bash	shellcheck
an external linting tool like shellcheck can detect problems and may have better messages and locations than bash itself

205446
vim	emacs	vim	sublimetext	vim	atom-editor	emacs	sublimetext	emacs	atom-editor	atom-editor	sublimetext
shellcheck works with vim emacs sublimetext and atom-editor among others

205453
centos	linux
using vmware i installed an image of linux centos 5

205472
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu and derivatives with the perl rename sometimes installed as prename

205493
ubuntu	debian
i am trying to setup a systemd service on ubuntu 15.04 and debian 8

205554
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
on debian and derived distributions ubuntu mint â that ship a perl script as rename either call rename.ul instead of rename or replace rename _create _bak by

205567
fish	tcsh
worse you don t know what shell is going to be used to interpret that string as that s the login shell of user which is not even guaranteed to be bourne like as there are still people using tcsh as their login shell and fish is on the rise

205567
bash	zsh
i can run it locally with ksh zsh bash yash as

205569
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
i ve only tested it with bourne shell from heirloom toolchest dash bash zsh mksh lksh yash ksh93 rc es akanga csh tcsh fish as found on a recent debian system and bin sh usr bin ksh bin csh and usr xpg4 bin sh on solaris 10

205587
stdout	stderr
check for messages in var log xorg.0.log var log kern.log or wherever your distribution keeps kernel logs or .xsession-errors or wherever your session managers directs stdout and stderr

205594
dpkg	aptitude
these days apt-get is better at dependency resolution than aptitude which is better than synaptic though even with synaptic you shouldn t end up with a broken system like you did unless you ran dpkg manually or used --force options this is a bug in the package management tools possibly triggered by oddities in non-official packages

205600
debian	centos
take the oldest supported version of centos currently 5 and the oldest old stable debian release currently wheezy though squeeze might still qualify

205610
bash	zsh
i tried this in zsh but it interacts with the terminal more than bash does so even a proof-of-concept requires more tuning

205618
google-chrome	firefox
in addion to cookies use user agent as firefox google-chrome etc

205622
folder	directory
if there are multiple possibilities like in your folder with projecta projectb and projectc it defaults to the one that is the last in the directory order

205628
filesystems	ntfs
what windows or more precisely ntfs calls mft is what typical unix filesystems call the inode table and what windows calls frn is the inode number

205636
spaces	delimiter
as its default delimiter is white spaces this splits down the cronjob time value nicely

205637
jobs	cron
i have cron jobs set up to write to the pipe and those would go through no problem while me echo ing from a terminal would get nothing

205637
jobs	cron
the cron jobs are set up to be the same user as my terminal anyway so i don t think this is a permissions thing

205648
filesystems	btrfs
i found out that you can compress the whole of a btrfs filesystems by defragmenting it with -clzo or -czlib but is it possible to uncompress it again

205663
debian	centos
i once had such problem on freshly installed distro it was centos or debian .the culprit was avahi deamon mdns don t know what it was trying to resolve on every ping and why

205698
daemon	cron
use cron to start the daemon and to kill it

205743
rpm	dnf	rpm	yum	dnf	yum
when applying updates yum and now dnf and as i recall actually rpm itself via a default plugin takes out a block inhibitor against idle and shutdown but not sleep to keep you from accidentally powering off your machine mid-transaction and potentially messing up the system with a package halfway overwriting an older one

205754
vim	emacs
however based on answers from this thread it doesn t seem to be possible to read text from stdin in emacs which is why the answer to this question is to output to a temporary file when one is determined to use emacs instead of vim

205776
vim	emacs
after learning that the terminal is by default set to emacs mode and that i have been using vim on the rest of my programming life i wanted to shift to vi editing mode on terminal by using set -o vi

205802
ubuntu	linux
welcome to ubuntu 14.04.2 lts gnu linux 3.13.0-52-generic x86_64

205807
stdout	stderr
throws away both stderr and stdout

205815
put	get
anyway to get an explicit message i put the text below as root in a newly created etc acpi powerbtn.sh made executable with chmod a+x etc acpi powerbtn.sh

205853
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
you would need someone to precompile source of all packages and get .debs ready for you the debian binary packages for linux kernels won t work for freebsd kernels and recompiling porting is not always trivial

205853
ubuntu	debian
you can however try to use debian gnu kfreebsd and install the same packages that you d have in an ubuntu system

205853
ubuntu	debian
the same is true for other kernels -- there is debian gnu hurd but there is no precompiled ubuntu packages for the hurd and several debian packages are not available for debian gnu hurd

205870
ubuntu	debian
i use ubuntu and a very close friend uses debian

205882
spaces	delimiter
unless you change it with ofs the output field delimiter will be a spaces

205882
spaces	delimiter
then we setup our output to also use | for the output delimiter default is spaces by making the first block of code the part that matches begin a keyword in awk that matches the start of execution and setting our ofs or output field separator

205890
vim	emacs
if vim or emacs is available both have plugins that will do what you need

205899
bash	zsh
if you re using bash zsh or another similar shell you can use process substition

205916
imagemagick	pdftk
as part of installing imagemagick and pdftk i fetched tarballs and extracted them to my home directory

205916
imagemagick	pdftk
if i run which on pdftk or any imagemagick command i get usr local bin as the location

205921
bash	zsh
to make ind to be array in shell support array like bash zsh ksh

205952
imagemagick	pdftk
if you want to be sure of it before deleting the folders you can rename them and check that imagemagick and pdftk still work.

205958
chown	chmod
for more explanation about above commands check man chmod and man chown

205963
folder	directory
assuming the directory you re in currently the one containing tmp is called folder and that tmp is empty you d run

205987
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
i ve setup a kali linux installation on an sd card and created an encrypted luks partition with a lvm logical volume inside of it then created a btrfs filesystems inside

205987
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs filesystems

206001
debian	linux
both server and client are debian linux machines

206007
ubuntu	debian
but this is likely not needed anymore when talking about a local installation of latest debian or ubuntu for the purpose of basic web development

206026
centos	linux
currently i have intel board with centos linux on it

206047
ubuntu	debian
it goes on to say that condition 2 is common to ssl-enabled debian and ubuntu installations of postgresql 9.1 9.0 and earlier but may affect other users as well

206062
debian	centos
i have a server running debian 7 that exports an nfsv3 share and a client running centos 5 that accesses it

206091
ssd	sata
in the exisiting sata ssd drive we are fetching these info by using smartctl tool smartctl -a diskname

206095
apache	nginx
why using apache and nginx

206096
freebsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
i m currently comparing random pid implementation on openbsd freebsd and linux from security perspective

206096
openbsd	freebsd
as long as openbsd and freebsd are concerned my work is done

206129
freebsd	linux
if you really want to run linux based written script using bin bash in freebsd without modifying them then you can simply copy usr local bin bash to bin bash at freebsd and it will work

206134
rpm	dnf
i tried some rpm --rebuilddb and dnf distro-sync without really knowing what i m doing

206162
udp	tcp
make sure that the log server will only accept traffic from the production server on the port used by the logging software like tcp udp 514 for syslog

206170
stdout	stderr
first you re only redirecting stdout not stderr

206182
freebsd	linux
how can i make a bootable usb stick with freebsd on it and then boot the image from plop linux

206212
folder	directory
is there an easy way to backup your home directory on an online server in an encrypted folder

206212
ubuntu	debian
what would be the commands i need to configure a backup of my folder on ubuntu 14.10 to our online debian server so no other root admin can read my personal backup

206224
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stderr	fflush
why does stderr logs get fflush written before stdout logs when using nohup

206225
fflush	gets	stdout	fflush
redirecting stdout to a file will switch stdout s buffering from line-buffered to buffered and cause the print ed string to be stuck in the buffer which only gets fflush when your program the stream closes

206241
ubuntu	linux
in addition the version of linux the kernel included in ubuntu contains firmware blobs

206241
ubuntu	linux
however that is not a substantive issue about ubuntu as a gnu linux distribution

206247
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu systems run apt-get install pinentry-curses and use usr bin pinentry-curses

206247
ubuntu	debian
note that setsid of util-linux in recent distributions debian 8.0 or later ubuntu 14.10 or later need -w to wait for the subprocess termination otherwise you will get confused with a ssh session running in the background

206267
pstree	passwd
while trying to set this up make sure you run pstree | grep -f pgp-agent to make sure there are not more agents running than you need otherwise it depends on the environment whether pass asks for passwd agains and or between different consoles

ubuntu	linux
i have played with efiboot which has 2 relevant entries now ubuntu and linux one of which gets me to the other to

206296
stdout	stderr
i have got following simple shell script in which i am trying to send stderr stdout to both screen and log it in a file test.log

206309
debian	linux
i have a path on a linux machine debian 8 which i want to share with samba 4 to windows computers win7 and 8 in a domain

206311
rdiff-backup	unison
to my knowledge tools like rsync rdiff-backup and unison don t support this

206336
stdout	stderr
--files-from - reads the list of files to archive from stdin f - tells tar to write the archive to stdout j means to compress the archive with xz and v makes tar print the list of files it archives to stderr

206385
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
on bsd there is no klogd 8 and proc either doesn t exist on openbsd or is mostly obsolete on freebsd and netbsd

206385
freebsd	netbsd
freebsd uses two unix domain sockets var run log and var rub logpriv instead and netbsd has a var run log

206417
stdout	fflush
in particular if you re going to emit an error message that concerns output written to stdout you should fflush stdout first

206434
folder	directory
user home directory as default can be read write and listed only by his owner so other users other that root user can t event list content of home folder of other users

206434
folder	directory
of course you don t want to give write or read permission to other users on your home directory but you want that they can reach destination folder

206435
debian	linux
the debian version of at which is used in many linux distributions was changed in version 3.16 to export only variables that have valid names in shell scripts

206436
tar	gunzip
i tried both tar zxvf output.gz which didn t yield anything and gunzip output.gz which resulted in a corrupted archive

206456
ubuntu	debian
what process do i use to extract a debian binary package from a debian ubuntu based distribution s iso image

206457
xfce	kubuntu	xfce	kde	kde	kubuntu
suppose i am running ubuntu 14.04 lts and i ve iso images of xubuntu kubuntu etc then i can get xfce or kde applications that are pre-installed in accordingly derivative directly from iso

206457
xfce	kde
note - this will helps successfully on same version of derivatives and distribution like trisquel 7.0 and ubuntu 14.04 same version of ubuntuâ s derivative like xfce kde etc for different version and or derivative there may must dependency issue have to be solved

206470
ubuntu	debian
gcc on ubuntu 12.04 for example uses x86_64-linux-gnu debian 7s gcc i486-linux-gnu so it s entirely possible to leave the field empty

206474
apache	nginx
if i install nginx as proxy on my debian wheezy server what steps would be needed to change my apache configuration so all static content is directly delivered by nginx

206490
ubuntu	linux
this is ubuntu linux

206490
ubuntu	debian
or just let debian ubuntu do the heavy lifting

206505
ubuntu	centos
i have installed centos ubuntu in graphical mode and had sufficient practice

206516
folder	directory
note that the last two commands those using find will find all files or directory named in the current folder and all its subfolders

206524
jobs	cron
imho not possible via config files because that as you say would affect all cron jobs for the user

206524
stdout	stderr	jobs	cron
however it s possible to forcefully redirect just the stdout output or both stdout and stderr of specific cron jobs like this

206524
stdout	stderr
the advantage of redirecting just stdout would be that you d immediately get and email with the stderr content when the job ends if that s your preference can equally well be seen as a disadvantage

206527
folder	directory
i m trying to find a script that would basically look recusively at a directory and if the script finds file that are .flac files it will create a subfolder called flac in that same folder and move the .flac files only into that directory

206527
folder	directory
it may find 30 flac files in the same directory so i don t want it to meltdown once it realizes the folder already exists etc.

206527
mp3	flac
the whole idea is that after scanning in a ton of my cds i have a lot of folders with mixed versions...so media players end up playing the song song twice first the mp3 version then the flac version .

206539
switching	screens
when i tried to use the configuration exactly as shown in gilles answer it caused my system to boot to a black screens and wouldn t allow me to switching to a non-graphical terminal

206566
apache	nginx
if you want to have apache behind nginx as proxy and static content server i see 2 solutions

206567
debian	linux
i started two programs glipper 2.4 and clipit 1.4.2 in my gnome 3.12.0 desktop on debian linux 8

206568
gentoo	linux
as an example installing arch linux seems to be one of the recommended projects for linux intermediate users -- with installing gentoo being one for advanced users

206568
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
for reference i ve been using ubuntu and linux mint for about a year now

206573
mp3	flac
an easy version that always creates flac and mp3 subdirectories unless they would be empty using the find command to execute a script to create a subdirectory if necessary and move the file there

206573
bash	zsh
alternatively in bash or ksh93 with set -o globstar instead of shopt -s globstar extglob or in zsh without setopt ksh_glob instead using the pattern

206573
bash	zsh
this is for bash it can be adapted to ksh93 or zsh

206592
sudo	passwd
can i configure fedora 22 so anything needing root privileges asks for a passwd rather than giving an error and needing me to re-run with sudo

206606
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this command worked for me on linux mint 17 ubuntu 14.04 using xfce with a cmstorm keyboard

206607
debian	linux
if you are new to linux you should not blindly upgrade your system to debian jessie

206613
sudoers	passwd
if i want to give someone as broad permissions as possible without them having any permissions to do anything that will clobber the machine clobber sudoers clobber etc passwd which literally just happened to me clobber anything that would prevent logging in via ssh on root etc how would i do it

206618
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
you may want for heavy interactive use have a look into tcsh but in the commonly used posix shells bash ksh zsh you have indeed the concept of a working directory

206646
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to run a program in a server with linux ubuntu 3.16.0-31-generic and it gives me the following error

206675
put	get
by the way it is not very foolproof so if you install it using a wrong device id you will get unexpected behavior like the mouse clicks doing funny things if the keypad is id 13 and you put id 14 but do not worry

206688
dnf	yum
maintainer scripts in a package are run as root whether on apt yum or dnf type systems so installing a package effectively gives the package s author root access to that system

206708
postgresql	mysql
before android studio i comfortably ran smb minidlna plex mysql postgresql apache and chrome simultaneously with no issues

206710
prepare	execute
just make sure that your hard-disk s init process is prepare to execute another later down the road when you want to switch roots

206711
gtk	motif	kde	gnome
most applications use a widget toolkit such as gtk used by gnome qt used by kde motif athena an old pretty basic one etc

206716
bash	zsh
on a bourne-style shell zsh bash ksh etc.

206719
installation	upgrade
if you want to give an untrusted user the ability to install more packages from a predefined list of sources that you approve as safe or upgrade existing packages on the main system that can be safe but you need to take precautions in particular to disable interaction during the installation

206732
bash	tcsh
it is equal to bash as an interactive shell though lagging compared to tcsh

206757
filesystems	xfs
i recall that rhel has a configuration file under etc sysconfig where certain modules can be forced to load such as xfs and vfat but you may not need them if you rebuild the initrd while the filesystems are properly mounted

206759
filesystems	btrfs
i m not sure if your system was installed to use btrfs for its primary filesystems but it sounds like it

206790
daemons	systemd
the standard ntp daemons has taken years to mature and come with sophisticated features such as slowing or speeding up your systemd s clock to have it sync with a network or gps clock

206793
openvpn	iptables
or you can just nat actually masquerade traffic coming from the 192.168.20.0 100 network on your openvpn server interface using iptables

206815
freebsd	centos
on all my unixes centos freebsd macos x i activate the system accounting as a basic security rule

206848
bash	zsh
with bash i think your only option is to check if a dup succeeds like in your approach though that won t guarantee that the fd is writable or call an external utility zsh perl ... to do the fcntl

206859
octal	decimal
which will write string followed by a n ewline either to stdout or 3 and still pass on a non-zero exit status when 3 is not open because the math done on winds up failing to convert the octal 08 to decimal but truncates to nothing at all the octal 00

206868
put	get
but if i put pattern into the variable or backticks i would get

206916
sudo	passwd
if your goal is to su without passwd i recommend using sudo su

206916
sudoers	passwd
allow the user to use su without passwd in etc sudoers with

206916
sudo	passwd
works for most commands other than su but if you use it note that stdin still has the passwd if sudo didn t ask for it because timestamp was still fresh

206916
sudo	passwd
you can use sudo -k first to force passwd query

206916
sudo	passwd
edit also instead of using nopasswd you can also use sudo -s to read the sudo passwd from stdin and use something like

206916
sudo	passwd
sudo takes the user passwd and needs permission to run bin su or all like above

206916
sudo	passwd
like all sudo commands passwd expected is the user s passwd not root s

206917
restrict	shared
i know that i could use the -o flag with pg_ctl to override the unix_socket_directories option to tmp but this script is shared by other developers who do not use ubuntu so i would not necessarily want to restrict everyone to using the tmp directory especially if their configurations differed slightly

206919
sudo	passwd
not for that command but you can create a sudo user with all all no passwd search online on how to cerate a sudo user to run sudo commands without passwd

206926
octal	decimal
unix represents newlines with the character lf line feed n j 10 decimal 012 octal 0x0a hexadecimal

206926
octal	decimal
windows represents newlines with the two-character sequence cr lf cr carriage return r m 13 decimal 015 octal 0x0d hexadecimal

206931
ubuntu	debian
for newer debian ubuntu distros using nvidia i had to do the following

206974
spaces	delimiter
see that will append the n ext input line following an embedded n ewline delimiter to the current pattern spaces on every line which is

206987
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp	gif	png	gif	bmp
cutycapt is a small cross-platform command-line utility to capture webkit s rendering of a web page into a variety of vector and bitmap formats including svg pdf ps png jpeg tiff gif and bmp

206989
ubuntu	opensuse
i have a netbook and i want to install opensuse on my windows 7 just like installing ubuntu in windows 7 using wubi

207002
opensuse	linux
not that i know of but you can always install opensuse or any other linux distro on dual boot

207006
daemons	systemd
and also i doubt that systemd has started both agent and security daemons parallely

207028
mouse	keyboard
this means that i have to get my keyboard and mouse settings there manually

207029
for-loop	loops
when i am trying to access those values within the for-loop using loops variable i the value of i is getting substituted in the expression i.e the statement is getting executed instead of

207053
zlib	libpng	g++	gcc
in a bash script i need to check if gcc g++ cpp make libpng devel zlib devel git java including devel files ant and pkg-config are available on mac os x and if not i need to prompt user to install them

207053
rpm	zypper	debian-based	opensuse
on opensuse i can use rpm -q and zypper in od debian-based distros dpkg-query and apt-get install

207054
freebsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
i run freebsd openbsd windows 10 and several versions of linux in virtualbox on my windows laptop

i have tried to install damn small linux dsl distribution on this server in the same manner as centos 7 and it worked

207068
gentoo	linux
i m trying to configure samba running on gentoo linux to share my external ntfs drive with two other machines one running gentoo as well and the other running windows 7

207073
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
users also install other package management systems such as macports fink or homebrew

207073
g++	gcc
gcc g++ cpp make and git will be installed along with other tools

207080
bash	subshell
or just launch a new shell as a subshell with bash or replace the running process with exec bash -- the hostname will be updated

207083
folder	directory
i want to delete all of the files and folder in a directory while excluding the folder . xfer and its contents

not only bash but other shells including dash and zsh will give the same result

207148
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i do not want to use sudo or su and go through setting them as sudoers or entering passwd

207163
daemons	systemd
i made a daemons that it is started by systemd and inside my daemons i have a python function to get the time

207165
freebsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
this completes my randomized pid implementation comparison between linux openbsd and freebsd

207181
rpm	yum
my upstream yum repo has been confirmed to contain my rpm

207183
centos	linux
in enterprise linux distributions rhel centos scientific linux et al the likely best way to resolve this is to modify etc sysctl.conf with

207187
ubuntu	debian
i suppose virt-install doesn t support debian netinst iso images with --location but somehow ubuntu supported

207192
versioning	upgrade
attempt to upgrade to a 3.16 versioning kernel

207199
gentoo	linux
i am using tmux on a gentoo linux hardened system running kernel 3.18.9

207208
debian	linux
debian s kernel is linux well usually

207216
folder	directory
therefore i deleted those folder in my home directory recreated them on the raid and made symlinks pointing from my home-folder to the raid

207218
profiling	debugging
valgrind can not only profiling detailed memory usage of your program but also detect memory access violations which are common in c and possibly very hard to debugging

207263
bash	zsh
is a ksh operator also supported by bash and zsh

207284
vmware	virtualbox
the next thing that comes to my mind is virtualbox or vmware - i could install

207291
vmware	virtualbox
as for the virtualization software vmware workstation and virtualbox are both capable type 2 hypervisors

207291
mouse	keyboard
depending on the usage scenario i might run into the problem that a windows user and a linux user want to use each operating system simultaneously which might not be able to happen in that configuration - who is control of the keyboard mouse and display

207297
unix	solaris
i have shell scripts that run on solaris unix that use the -e option on ls to ensure the same format for all files regardless of their age

207317

debian	linux
the linux i m running came with the raspberry 2 and is some flavor of debian i d report the version number if i knew where to look

207357
folder	directory
also the displays i have added on mkdir call are not showing up kernel debug level is also set to 8 when i try to create a directory in mounted folder

207377
put	get
i want to get the groups of all the users of the textfile and put this list of groups into a new text file

207404
bash	zsh
dash ksh bash zsh and at least some busybox builds but not plain posix sh have a -ef operator for the test builtin that tests that

207429
disk	ram
however if the server on which the container is running run out of memory because of another container running on the same server and taking to much ram or if there s no free space on disk available etc - then the container is stopped and run again on another server of the cluster

207445
folder	directory
the directory is still there and there are currently folder from a to z but if it was windows i would know what is gone and what is not

207448
filesystems	xfs
filesystems is xfs

207450
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
so the question is this has anybody out there got the stackapps working on linux mint 17.1 or ubuntu 14.04.1

207462
debian	linux
i was reading the list of free gnu linux distro s on and found debian to be optionally free

207474
ubuntu	debian
since lmde uses debian instead of ubuntu as its package base and all debian packages are free software logically the answer to your question would be yes

207477
ethernet	wireless
among the common hardware that i know of are broadcom chipsets nvidia various bluetooth chipsets some ethernet and wireless network cards.

207505
daemons	systemd
if you use systemd you can still use cron but you can also rewrite the rules as .timer files and let systemd worry when to start things instead of relying on a separate daemons

207536
chown	chmod
depending on your init system add the chown chmod command in the relevant init script for postgresql such as etc init.d postgresql

207540
post	get
i would like to get back the question of this post

207552
unix	bsd
try la -help on bsd unix systems to get more information on la

207553
arp	udp	arp	tcp	udp	tcp
well it looks like it was the arp table going stale even though we re streaming udp like crazy that doesn t kick the arp timeouts and tcp traffic is much more sparse under normal operation upping the timeouts stopped the issue from appearing for breaks of less than 2mins at which point the rtsp client session times out anyway

207610
freebsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
linux freebsd and openbsd have mutually exclusive but similar interfaces to allow binding the local end of a connection to an address that is not present on any local interface

i am trying to migrate an init.d script from centos 6.6 server to ubuntu 14.04

i could get there in a very long and convoluted way using awk or cut to get strip as much of my string away as possible and then use specified field separators to put each word in its own column and then print only those columns

207687
mouse	keyboard
an input method is a program that allows any data such as keyboard strokes or mouse movements to be received as input

stdout	stderr
is that correct and will it redirect everything for stderr and stdout

207714
stdout	stderr
it will redirect and append stdout and stderr to that file

207718
ubuntu	debian
or if you use ifupdown debian ubuntu then you can look at etc network interfaces to set up hooks see also

207724
daemons	systemd
daemons are recognized by the systemd as any processes whose parent

207724
daemons	launchd
thus the common method for launchd a daemons involves

207741
ubuntu	centos
now i m using osx with ubuntu in my virtual machine meanwhile our production servers are using centos

207756
debian	centos
as i work more with latest distro versions debian jessie or centos 7 everyday i find 1 thing that was previously configured in some way and now is managed by systemd

207757
bash	zsh
here is an example with implementations for bash and zsh

207762
sudoers	visudo
the root user is the default one when installing arch linux so i created a user named builder that i added to sudoers thanks to visudo

207802
width	height
one such message is pty-req which requests a pseudo-terminal and its parameters include the terminal height and width

207822
stdout	stderr
as i understand it this runs the command but with the stdout redirected to the stderr

207822
stdout	stderr
i think the 1 and 2 are the file descriptors for stdout and stderr respectively but i m not really even sure what that means either

207824
stdout	stderr
in that syntax you are correct that 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

207824
stdout	stderr
so which can also be written takes stderr and sends it to stdout

207824
stdout	stderr
the first sends stderr to stdout then stdout to file.out so you get stderr and stdout in the same place

207824
stdout	stderr
the second sends stdout to file.out then stderr to stdout so you end up with stderr in the terminal window not in the file

207825
stdout	stderr
stdout is almost always file descriptor 1 and stderr is almost always 2

207825
stdout	stderr
both direct command s stdout to the already opened file at file descriptor 2 stderr

207825
stdout	stderr
redirects anything that would normally be written to stderr to file descriptor number 1 stdout

207828
stdout	stderr
0 is stdin 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr as you correctly mentioned

207838
folder	directory
my fault in the file usr share icon theme index.theme i was missing part of the directory that theme had so i was looking for the gnome theme which was inherit by the theme and i did not see that icon so changed the list of directory and done i put them all the folder and it looked like

debian	linux
with stat 8.13 on a debian based linux - among many others - the following format directives are offered

207873
postfix	dovecot
i have quite standard installation of postfix and dovecot on ubuntu 12.10

i want to install ubuntu linux on the e partition

207929

if i want them to monitor an extra snmp mib we would need to go through the costly process of development writing instructions training and testing

207951
centos	linux
i m using bash 4.2.46 on centos linux release 7.1.1503

207968
filesystems	ntfs
since it s a ntfs filesystems you could try ntfsundelete instead in the ntfs-3g package usually

207976
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
because i m running linux mint 17.1 x64 i added repositories for ubuntu utopic trusty and vivid universe

207977
mouse	keyboard
here s the xorg i left out the keyboard mouse sections

207985
rpm	yum
gpg and yum rpm can be quite tricky

207987
chown	sudo
note that when running sudo apt-get upgrade to update postgres you may need to temporarily sudo chown -r postgres postgres var run postgresql in order for the upgrade to succeed

208004
ubuntu	linux
i believe that the windows 8 bootloader can be made to boot linux so you d get it to show a menu to select between ubuntu and windows but i don t know how this works

208004
filesystems	ntfs
dev sda4 partition number 4 on the disk is presumably the one you mean given that it has almost no use space 112mb is presumably the control structures on the ntfs filesystem. ubuntu cannot be installed on an ntfs partition it needs its own filesystems ext4

208011
jobs	cron
most of the questions about cron jobs are out of my league including the answers

208011

and is not only with sis ati and nvidia too

208047

what you want is a daemon not a cron job

208073
filesystems	fat
not all filesystems do - such as fat filesystems

208073
filesystems	fat
i am working on a distribution of debian for a specific embedded arm platform and the boot environment requires that certain files the kernel included are on a fat filesystems so the boot code is able to locate and load them

208163
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
on systems using apt such as debian and derivatives ubuntu mint â use apt-clone

208163
ubuntu	debian
apt-clone may work between related distributions debian and ubuntu

208163
dpkg	apt
if that fails use the manual method with dpkg --get-selections and apt-mark and fiddle with the package list until apt is satisfied

208213
centos	linux
it seems that suse used and maintained that fork for a while but it seems that red hat centos scientific linux never provided it rfe #173002

208213
ubuntu	debian
also debian ubuntu provided it as an extra package but it was removed from jessie because it s buggy and unmaintained grave bug autoremoval supported debian dists with pam_unix2

208234
kde	gnome
how can you determine the user s icon theme without using neither gnome nor kde nor any other desktop specific programs libraries files

208284
vmware	virtualbox
note that you will need the virtualbox or vmware guest additions to copy paste between the host and the guest

208292
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i was looking for linux os based on debian ubuntu that will use the least amount of resources

208304
bash	zsh
in those shells which handle heredocuments with tempfiles to include bash and zsh but not dash busybox or yash the above command will safely overwrite the whole of textfile with itself and include the prepended string

208313
bash	subshell
quoting a subshell at variable assignment is unnecessary too for more info see man bash

208328
folder	directory
if i look at another running server centos it has permissions as above and writes as mysql user so i m wondering how does mysql normally get permissions to access the var log directory and how can i get it to access that folder via normal running

208335
folder	directory
it seems to me that most people create a directory named mysql inside of var log change the owner of this folder to the mysql user

208355
kde	gnome
linux mint desktop environment with compiz that ran fine until the update nvidia driver graphics card that after upgrading all left the dark this problem was solved the driver revert to the previous version the real problem is that the environment compiz and its effects no longer work noting that the graphic environment in use was the same compiz not gnome kde or otherwise try to restore the environment but does nothing to have some positive result everything works as it always normal internet etc

208358
folder	directory
there is also a d attribute on the left which tells us if this is a file or a directory folder

208379
ubuntu	debian
so just pick debian or ubuntu or whatever you fancy as an administrator

208383
bash	zsh
you can obtain one of several from debian bash-static sash no command line edition but several useful builtins such as cp rm mount etc. busybox-static has basic command line edition and lots of builtins zsh-static better command line edition than bash and several useful builtins that you can activate with zmodload zsh files

208441
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu 14.04.2 lts gnu linux 3.13.0-52-generic x86_64

208455
children	parent
with htb to get predictable results you should make sure that the sum of children is always equal to parent

208459
openssl	gnutls	nss	gnutls	gnutls	libcurl
the format of the ciphers used by libcurl depends on the backend which can be at least nss gnutls securetransport schannel openssl

208471
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
if you really need tomcat 8 you can download it from debian or ubuntu and install it on mint

208494
redhat	fedora
i guess the closest redhat version to fedora 22 is rhel7.

208515
folder	directory
then i either set the config_initramfs_source option in the kernel .config to the directory containing all the folder for the initramfs or i run

208523
integer	unsigned
these values shall be added to an unsigned integer initialized to zero the precision of which is not less than 17 bits

208544
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
you want some processors affinity or cpu affinity

208544
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
you might even benchmark in batch mode using batch or at to run the benchmarks while you are not even logged in so don t have any gui sessions ã la gnome or kde or xfce etc.

208560
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	sunos	solaris	sunos
your script could end up running on solaris uname will print sunos then on freebsd freebsd on windows with cygwin cygwin msys or msys2 msys a mingw or mingw-w64 shell mingw64 mingw32 interix interix and probably others i m not aware of

208572
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
other debian based distributions ubuntu mint etc

208572
opensuse	centos
based or suse based distributions centos fedora opensuse sle etc

208590
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
the pipe through tr is to avoid getting bitten by a difference in behaviour between bash zsh and fish

208606
dnf	yum
dnf doesn t autorefresh it s cache like yum does in fact it goes out of it s way to lie to you sometimes

208648
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
depending whether you would like to have gnome kde or xfce as your desktop environment

208651
filesystems	btrfs
i am currently a user of btrfs and would like to take advantage of the cow such that when files are copied on the same btrfs filesystems they are automatically deduplicated by reusing the existing extent

208651
filesystems	btrfs
i assume by having it set to auto it will automatically determine if the underlying filesystems support reflinks and if they are on the same device use reflinks meaning that there won t be a problem when i connect an external ext4 filesystems or am copying between btrfs filesystems

208662
bash	zsh
same with ksh93 or zsh all like bash bloated shells compared to dash though

208674
stdout	stderr
it would seem that tarsnapper just outputs all of its normal output to stderr instead of stdout

208674
stdout	stderr
as a temporary solution i ended up just redirecting all output stdout and stderr from tarsnapper appending it to a logfile using this in cron

208722
rpm	yum
is there a way to exclude removal of files via either rpm or yum

208737
rpm	yum
it s true that you have a jdk but it is not in the rpm database which is used by yum and other similar automatic package managers to know what packages are installed and get there respective versions

208737
rpm	yum
the best solution may be running sudo yum install jdk so you can get a version with yum and rpm

208743
stdout	stderr
http.server writes the first line to stdout then access logs to stderr

208748
stdout	stderr
strings writes to stdout and not to stderr as some programs do so you don t have to do anything special

208763
email	dkim
it then later installs postfix dkim key and asks me all the questions like secret password name email etc

208809
short	base
however do not base your calculation on the short times as when processing large directories cache churning will occur and you ll see times more inline with to the 1st execution

208813
xfce	gnome
i was thinking of installing a new desktop environment because i found the old one rather boring and i was used to xfce with ubuntu not raspberry pi default desktop environment lxde with raspbian wheezy so i went and was looking at the raspbian mate desktop environment a fork off of gnome and thought it would be nice so i proceeded to add deb wheezy main to my etc apt sources.list

208815
debian	linux
debian 8.0 jessie linux 3.16.0 gnome 3.14 skill want-to-learn-basics

208828
octal	hex
so let s create 0xff bytes hex 0xff is octal 0377

208848
spaces	delimiter
i created tab delimiter data ensuring that tabs and not spaces are used

208857
debian	linux
i m so used to the linux version of cal that i went ahead and ported the debian version of bsdmainutils which include the cal and ncal executables to a homebrew formula which you can find here

208858
debian	linux
when i use the usb device on linux debian noobs rpi with the same audio source - i get horrible high level screaming noise - with a very quiet audio signal

208880
bash	zsh
in shell ksh zsh bash you can do

208944
spaces	delimiter
that way it is clear that you need a spaces between the delimiter character specified by the three letters sequence and the following option

208946
spaces	delimiter
escaped the spaces to a spaces literal instead of a delimiter between arguments in your shell and you didn t add an extra spaces so the whole -d -f2 part appears as one argument

208960
folder	directory
how can i restrict this user in their folder and not allow to him to move out and see other files directory

208993
portrait	landscape
i have a four port videocard of which i use three two landscape one portrait as in my avatar picture

209051
sudo	passwd
continue using sudo but configure it to stop asking you for a passwd

209058
umask	mount
as with any mount you might need to set the uid gid or umask especially for something like var log

209073
versioning	upgrade
this also means that if the package is already installed and newer versioning are available it will get upgrade to the newest installable

209116
spaces	delimiter
if it does match it is copied to h old spaces following an inserted n ewline delimiter

209134
vim	emacs
some applications including emacs and vim can transparently edit files encrypted with gpg

209147
ubuntu	centos
it s the wheel group on centos and admin on ubuntu

209154
move	drag
for example when i try to hold down alt and drag it move the entire window rather than doing its supposed action in blender

209161
solaris	sunos
this works on sunos and solaris for example but not on linux

209165
vmware	virtualbox
can btrfs snapshots of root be used and thought of just like vmware virtualbox snapshots

209169
vmware	virtualbox
can btrfs snapshots of root be used and thought of just like vmware virtualbox snapshots

209180
stdout	stderr
my idea was to also read the stdout and stderr of each command line by line and call that log-function

209182
stdout	stderr
should to what you want as the first part sends stdout to a log file via logger and the second part send stderr to a log file

209186
debian	mint	debian	linux
linux mint debian edition kernel 3.11-2-amd64

209186
debian	mint	debian	linux
in summary booting debian testing seems to change the wrapped-passphrase file and linux mint debian edition can t deal with this file

209214
ubuntu	debian
if you want to work with the mate desktop environment and you are used to ubuntu also based on debian i highly recommend ubuntu mate for the raspberry pi 2

209219
bash	zsh
with ksh zsh bash

209234
crypt	hash
if you read that manual man 3 crypt you will see that both legacy des encrypted passwords as currently used hash algorithms can be used

209235
hash	salt
a shadow file can still contain an encrypted with itself and a salt password but it depends on the form if it is hash or not

209235
crypt	hash
if the entry doesn t start with a it is assumed to be output from crypt if not one of the supported hash function has been used

209255
ubuntu	debian
this makes unison on debian and ubuntu useless for cross-platform synchronization

209269
apache	nginx
if you really need to do so you need the http-server apache nginx or whaterver else you are using to start a program that displays on x surface

209274
mouse	keyboard
problem is right now it suspends after 30 minutes even when i am active with mouse and keyboard

209279
crypt	hash
even the original version of the crypt function was in fact a hash function

209279
crypt	hash
although this uses an encryption function as part of the implementation the crypt operation is not an encryption operation it is a hash function a function whose inverse is hard to compute and such that it is difficult to find two values producing the same output

209279
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
within its limitations the original des-based crypt implementation followed the basic principles of a good password hash function irreversible function with a salt and a slow-down factor

209279
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
although some of these algorithms are known as â œmd5â â œsha-256â and â œsha-512â the hash computation is not something like md5 password + salt but an iterated hash which meets the slowness requirement though common methods lack the memory hardness that protects against gpu-based acceleration

209285
switching	screens
i m back at a lock screens when i switching back to x or maybe even logged out but the system stays up

209297
debian	linux
how to launch a gui application on a beaglebone that is running linux debian 7.4 remotely

209309
debian	centos
debian agrees with centos 7 operation not permitted.

209327
chown	chmod
assuming you understand chown chmod so can adapt for your purposes

209338
pop-up	dialog
then it gives you a pop-up dialog where you enter the title you want that window to have

209338
fish	bash
i wrote it in fish rather than bash cuz bash gives me a headache

209341
chown	sudo
i tried sudo chown myuser dados but it doesn t seem to have any affect

209347
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux 4.0.5 on ubuntu 15.04

209363
gentoo	linux
i m trying to install gentoo from the livecd just for fun as well as for getting better understanding what s going on under the linux s hood on my notebook

209368
daemons	systemd
systemd daemons frequently require private runtime directories below run to place communication sockets and similar in

209374
bash	zsh
if you use ksh or bash with extended globbing activated or zsh with ksh globs enabled you can achieve the desired function using only file globbing patterns

209389
execvp	fork
this is necessary if the executable is fork more internal processes executed thru execvp

209393
ubuntu	debian
i am in the process of porting my configure openvpn server from ubuntu 14 to debian 8

209402
post	get
it is simmilar to tim kennedy s post but this way you get race handling by only adding one row to each bash script that needs it

209425
width	height
one has height x width and the other has width x height

209425
width	height
height and width in fontsize

209473
tunnel	packets
the tunnel device gives you a virtual device that encapsulates ip packets inside other ip packets

209480
debian	mint
i get the same problem with isos that use casper ubuntu-based mint lmde1 or debian live clonezilla lmde2

209482
ubuntu	debian
i m interested in a list of all debian and ubuntu preseed options more specifically preseed options for debian

209488
bash	zsh
will work in at least interactive dash bash zsh ksh though apparently not in a conditional statement as requested and mksh shells

209488
bash	zsh
of those - to my knowledge - only bash and zsh will also populate it in a scripted shell

209517
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
note sudo su has been configured to not prompt for passwd using etc sudoers file

209518
centos	linux
i am still fairly new to centos 6.5 and linux in general

209528
mouse	keyboard
i have no keyboard and no mouse attached to it and would like to keep it this way

209546
opensuse	linux	opensuse	centos	centos	linux
i am using arch linux centos and opensuse with the xfce desktop

209548
centos	linux
i have a centos linux release 7.1.1503 core system and i have installed httpd and the corresponding configuration file is

209567
screens	tablet
the android terminal prompted me for my password in the usual way and then i was in my shell on the tablet and everything written to my tablet s terminal prompts my input cat file etc was also displayed on my desktop screens

209603
folder	directory
so basically i have a folder in my home directory that has a bash script to run the server pocketmine start.sh

209604
ubuntu	linux
i use common linux distributions ubuntu arch etc. and mostly graphics software scribus inkscape gimp

209605
rpm	yum
i would like to pass the --excludepath option to rpm through yum since yum doesn t provide an option like that

209609
rpm	yum
for example i would love to have a way in which yum rpm is not allowed to write into usr bin

209619
bash	tcsh
if you are a csh tcsh user rather than a bash user then edit .cshrc and add

209633
sudo	passwd
i m running openbsd 5.7 on virtualbox on my windows 7 to learn more about unix but i can t use sudo with my passwd

209633
sudo	passwd
i ve set up a user called adminvpn but when i try to run any command using sudo it tells that my passwd is wrong

209636
sudo	passwd
unless configured otherwise sudo requires you to type your own passwd

209636
sudo	passwd
knowledge of the root passwd is not necessary that s the point of sudo

209654
put	get
you can put the escape sequences to set the window title as part of your prompt you ll need to tell your shell that the escape sequence has zero width otherwise the shell will get confused about the position of the cursor or you can arrange to print the string before displaying a prompt

209658
freebsd	linux
they are similar in purpose to freebsd jails and linux containers

209663
rpm	yum
yum uses a subset of all the features provided by the rpm command

209666
unicode	ucs
considering that not all fonts might cover all of the unicode code set ucs and considering the relative commonality of iso-8559-1 encodings perhaps it_it.iso8859-1 could be recommended as a locale setting moreover a locale setting not requiring support for utf-8 character encoding

209693
wan	lan
hey if you use the chrome browser you can install the secure shell add on app its quite simple to ssh over lan or wan

209697
ubuntu	debian
anyway on modern systems like current rhel and the next debian and ubuntu releases you cannot rename an interface to a name in one of the kernel namespaces in this case so you should rename the interfaces to different names like wl0

209700
uniq	grep
the above should do instead - it just packs the functions of uniq and grep together into a single little sed script

209702
ubuntu	linux
i see in the linux world often a distro will have two versions server and desktop ubuntu server ubuntu desktop

209704
redhat	fedora
on the various distros such as with anything redhat based like centos or fedora you can use the yum command to get a list of the various groups of software

209712
versioning	upgrade
upgrade don t change the api of the library and when the gets bumped to a higher versioning it s safe to let all the binaries upgrade to the new versioning

209712
versioning	upgrade
upgrade change the api of the library and it is not safe to let existing binary applications use the new versioning

209712
versioning	upgrade
but you can easily end up with multiple versioning of a library if you ve upgrade your system from one versioning of your distritution to another and still have some older packages requiring older library versioning

209714
versioning	upgrade
what if my linux distro gets upgrade do i need to use zypper to add new repositories which are specific to the new versioning of distro

209731
dpkg	apt
i have compared the md5sum of manually downloaded packages and those found in var cache apt archives and the md5sums match up so it must be config yet the config i apply when install via apt-get and dpkg are identical

209749
folder	directory
one of my friends wanted to have more logs in the var log directory and after some time of using the system he tried to access the folder and list it but instead he got the following error

209756
folder	directory
for most file systems directory think of them as phone directory a list of mappings between number and name not folder are exactly like regular files it s just that their content has a specific format and is treated specially and only modified via dedicated apis

209771
versioning	upgrade
if i include a new versioning of the deb with the next logical versioning number and do the dpkg-scanpackages after an apt-get update i am able to apt-get install the new versioning of the package but apt-get upgrade results in the following output

209771
debian	linux
the version of linux being used on the client device in bananian - a debian based arm distribution

209777
sudoers	passwd
i have already added to the sudoers file to use no passwd

209801
freebsd	linux
you can find small vm images for linux or freebsd with which you can create all sorts of zpool configurations

209804
ubuntu	debian
i am running ubuntu 12.04 and trying to build an armhf debian image for jessie

209806
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade to a newer versioning of debootstrap manually by downloading it from launchpad

209820
centos	linux
i have centos linux release 7.0.1406 core

209824
rpm	yum
you can then download the rpm directly and do the re-install using rpm or yum

209830
whatsapp	skype	whatsapp	hangout	skype	hangout
this setup fails when i try to use certain android apps like skype hangout whatsapp which i believe makes use of other ports to connect to their servers

209831
tunnel	vpn
you would need to be able to bypass the proxy for example by using your mobile network or perhaps tunnel through it with an https-aware vpn tunnel such as openvpn

209838
chown	chmod
use chown -h and or chmod -h to operate on the symbolic link

209843
centos	linux
for centos 6.6 on vmware i did the following to increase from 30 gb to 40 gb note i was not using lvm just regular native linux partitions id 83

209868
ubuntu	linux
in the school i need my students to have full access to ubuntu os so that they can learn how to use linux with ability to run sudo etc

209873
spaces	delimiter
it assumes that the is always the 2nd spaces delimiter field on the line it breaks on nested tags and all sorts of other possible complications

209885
vmware	virtualbox
and put it virtualbox or vmware i prefer virtualbox more fast

209885
disk	ram
in this server put 30 vm remind to setup ram disk space etc with ubuntu

209935
debian-based	mint
each rasp has already a system installed mint debian-based

209945
mouse	keyboard
i have a bluetooth mouse and a bluetooth keyboard

209945
mouse	keyboard
note keyboard mouse is an example but i don t care especially about this because a key press is so short maybe more about the general underlying concept of how 2 bluetooth peripherals can talk to a computer at the same time

209954
debian	mint	debian	linux
is it possible to encrypt a linux system mint debian based after installation

209956
debian	mint
i work on a debian system mint actually

209958
mouse	keyboard
your keyboard and mouse are less effected because they have short bursts of data

209958
mouse	keyboard
if you were to have say a bluetooth speaker a mouse a keyboard and a bluetooth hard drive all talking to the same computer then your speaked and hard drive connections would go slower and your mouse keyboard would be less responsive

209977
centos	linux
one day i removed the disks that centos 7 was installed 2 disks with raid-1 layout and i installed another clean disk to the rack in order to install red hat enterprise linux 7

209978
filesystems	xfs
by default centos 7 uses the xfs filesystems

210008
debian	mint
you can find instructions for setting up a debian and presumably mint system with encrypted root from many sources

210025
put	get
i am basically trying to get a third vm nic card interface up so that i can put an external ip for a mobile nagios app

210034
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
i ve tried installing opensuse 13.2 debian 8 8.1 and ubuntu 15.04 all them amd64

210034
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
debian ubuntu won t show disks and opensuse can t format the partitions created on them

210034
ubuntu	debian
during debian ubuntu install i choose manual partitioning option but it won t show my hard drives

210034
ssd	sata
the hardware is a hybrid uefi capable ultrabook dell inspiron 14z 5423 which has both a ssd and a sata hdd

210062
udp	tcp
i am getting very different bandwidth reading for tcp and udp where the udp bandwidth is terribly lower than tcp

210075
centos	linux
i was wondering how it would be possible to have multiple ipv6 default gateways on centos linux

210089
bash	zsh
moddern shells like ksh bash zsh also have extensions over

210093
folder	directory
i need to pass a user and a directory to a script and have it spit out a list of what folder files in that directory that the user has read access to

210093
folder	directory
i found some code that will do this for a specific folder or file but i need it to traverse a directory

210118
ubuntu	debian
common implementations include ubuntu live cd with casper and its derivative debian live with live-boot

210118
debian	linux
debian live has a relatively sophisticated way to build live images live-build so you can easily create your own live linux distribution based on debian live

210127
bash	zsh
some shells bash ksh and zsh for example also provide the syntax

210127
bash	zsh
in ksh zsh and some versions of bash this assignment syntax can be used for child assignments as part of a command

210140
spaces	delimiter
this declaration is applied against sed s pattern spaces which is a string delimiter by default by each n ewline character which occurs in input and which is recursively replaced by default with the next for each occurrence of same

210221
spaces	delimiter
you load a regular expression with words - qw is simply quoted words spaces delimiter

210226
factors	mean
larger chunks mean more throughput with fewer io operations and it s usually your io operations that are the limiting factors on your drive speed and so it is usually beneficial to have larger requests

210234
filesystems	btrfs
is there a way to use an image loop on the root filesystems btrfs as a cache for the 2tb drive

210245
centos	mint
i also tried to export the display from the mint to the centos the oposite way and i still get the same error but this time on the mint

210245
xfce	gnome
could it be that the error is because one system has xfce and the other gnome

210252
vim	emacs
alternatively you can use the extension of the editor emacs vim

210256
mp3	wav
notice that the linux version is outputted directly to mp3 while the mac to wav but i also tried with wav directly on linux and nothing changes

210283
bash	zsh
bash has that usually annoying behaviour that expands to instead of all the elements of the array a behaviour inherited from ksh fixed in zsh but here that would be a wanted behaviour for once

210294
stdout	stderr
it is possible to use --stderr - as parameter to redirect the output from stderr default to stdout

210307
ubuntu	linux
i tried to enter recovery mode by holding down left shift during boot and it allowed me to select a recovery mode up to ubuntu with linux 2.6.32-74-server but this just runs a few things and then takes me straight back to the useless prompts above

210317
centos	linux
i have a vps centos 6 linux web server

210321
hash	md5
please consider changing md5 hash for your desirable password

210330
hide	show
i want to hide the grub menu at boot and show it when a particular key combination is pressed

210330
hide	show
now i am able to hide the grub menu and show it with the esc key working with the etc default grub file but i can t find a way to set this up to work as a key combination

210346
kde	gnome
it seems that the gnome to kde desktop is user specific

210358
bash	zsh
most more fancy shells like bash and zsh also keep track of the length of the prompt on screen so you ll need to add some sugar to tell the shell that these sequences do not move the cursor forward

210358
bash	zsh
in zsh this is done using while bash uses

210371
folder	directory
i am trying to untar a .gz file which is stored in the root folder onto a directory in mnt flash2 example

210381
min	max
that s because there are min 200 milliseconds and max 120 seconds bounds in play when it comes to rto for linux there is a great explanation of this in the article i linked above

sctp	tcp
you can t change the global minimum rto for tcp as an aside you can do it for sctp - those are exposed in sysctl but the good news is that you can tweak the minimum value of the rto on a per-route basis

210383
gentoo	linux
i have installed gentoo linux and i am using native support according to those two wiki pages

210386
rpm	yum
all the packages you can get by yum you can get an rpm

210386
rpm	yum
rpm also is installed already everywhere you find yum

210386
put	get
so just round up your rpms put them in a tar ball and yeah you can just extract it and run a few rpm commands to get the job done

210387
sudo	passwd
this says youruser can sudo and run any command as root without being prompted for a passwd on each command

210445
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
so i m checking ubuntu and linux mint

210445
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
people say the difference between ubuntu and linux mint is basically the default setup and desktop environment

210445
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
so my question is does that mean it really doesn t matter which distro to choose if i know how to customize the system i can turn ubuntu into linux mint by installing the cinnamon desktop or vice versa

210449
ubuntu	debian
it s available as a package on debian ubuntu

210525
sorting	filtering
how do i filtering duplicates greedily without sorting

currently i think i m on a bsd machine and i ve been on most flavors of unix solaris blah blah blah - and probably will be in the future

210561
kde	gnome
i do not want to re-implement nor read all the details of the spec because i am sure there exists some implementation of it already used by gnome kde ubuntu unity etc

210564
google-chrome	firefox
when in a web browser firefox or google-chrome by hitting ctrl-s we creates a html file and a directory named something like ..._files which contains all needed files by the webpage and change the links to the needed files in the html file accordingly

210564
google-chrome	firefox
can firefox or google-chrome be used from command line

210594
freebsd	linux
i figured that linux etc shadow corresponds to freebsd etc master.passwd

210594
freebsd	linux
the open question is what freebsd uses in place of linux etc gshadow file

210613
opensuse	linux
how can i set a wallpaper for a tty console also during boot on arch linux like done on opensuse

210618
kde	gnome
can i assume you are running the x window system and some window manager kde gnome etc.

210620
debian	linux
alarm clock style on a debian derived linux box

210638
jobs	cron
i am trying to put these two cron jobs

210644
disk	ram
this will also generate a new initial ram disk initrd and trigger the use of non-free software

210649
jobs	cron
why do you need to sudo cron jobs run as the user they are installed for

210656
ubuntu	debian
it should be included debian and systems based on it including ubuntu and its derivatives though a few may not have it - in this case you can check files

210656
ubuntu	debian
where debian|buntu|mint is a list of distros names to look for not case sensitively - you can a idea of some of the common derivatives from here though debian derivatives like ubuntu have their own deriatives

210656
redhat	fedora
etc fedora-release and or etc redhat-release for redhat or fedora

210657
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
debian-8.1.0-amd64-cd-1.iso will install gnome debian-8.1.0-amd64-kde-cd-1.iso kde debian-8.1.0-amd64-lxde-cd-1.iso and debian-8.1.0-amd64-xfce-cd-1.iso xfce

210674
debian	linux
in my workplace i m using debian linux

210676
tolower	toupper
you can try to cheat it with using tolower or toupper

210697
stdout	stderr
i m redirecting both the stderr and stdout to different log files but neither gives any indication as to why the jar file is failing

210700
put	get
if the code blocks here are put into . script and it is launched as described above it will write in real-time to your terminal rather than some outfile - and so you can get a pretty clear idea exactly what will wind up in your real logfile when you eventually call it like

210710
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m using linux mint debian v2 64-bit

210721
sudo	passwd
if you can not change the root passwd or revoke sudo access you can only make the rules and tell your team that any violations will be taken seriously

210734
ubuntu	centos
the system is rhel but i m interested in knowing the answer for ubuntu and centos too but i assume the answer for centos would be similar to rhel.

210746
ubuntu	linux
the tutorials are old for ubuntu but i think it can be used for any linux distros

210755
disk	ram
this means that if you write any code and save it it is being saved to a ram disk that will go away when you reboot

210755
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	freebsd	linux
the text installer results in a fairly minimal classic unix os much like freebsd ubuntu server or arch linux

210768
mouse	keyboard
i used to select text via mouse click+drag but i want to know if i can do the same thing via the keyboard only

210790
bash	zsh
you probably shouldn t use that form anyway if the content of the variables is not under your control as that would be an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in many shells bash ksh zsh for instance with values of like

210824
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout and stderr for the whole loop

210824
bash	zsh
with at least zsh and recent versions of bash you can replace with

210837
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m using linux mint mate which is branched off debian

210879
filesystems	btrfs
i have a btrfs filesystems of about 7g in a 10g image file img.btrfs i shrank it using btrfs fi resize -3g mnt

210899
icmp	tcp
ping uses icmp packets which is at the ip level below the tcp level

210912
jobs	cron
moral of the story check your cron jobs

210927
ubuntu	mint
download the cuda 7.0 network installer for ubuntu 14.04 which mint is based on and install it

210932
sudoers	visudo
try to never use anything except visudo to directly edit etc sudoers

210932
sudoers	visudo
note that i edited etc sudoers because usr sbin visudo did not work

210937
mouse	keyboard
but my question now is how to send the keyboard and mouse to the guest

210937
mouse	keyboard
i would like to seamlessly share the mouse and keyboard with the guest if possible like how it works with the spice server viewer

210941
sudo	passwd
sudo will prompt for the passwd of the user running the sudo command and requires setup so that the user is allowed to run the requested commands programs

210941
sudo	passwd
when root runs either su or sudo no passwd is required.

210950
disk	ram
while copying moving either graphically or with cp one many big content anything like big text file tar.gz archive iso file movies some part of the content is written to disk some part cached in memory ram

210950
ubuntu	debian
not a distro specific issue cheked with debian fedora ubuntu slax etc

210950
openbsd	freebsd
not crosschecked with other unix like oss if anyone have had the same issue with freebsd openbsd etc

210977
spaces	delimiter
since your file has a spaces instead you need to specify the delimiter

210983
osx	yosemite
on the osx yosemite i tried it is mem

211001
width	height
1 means northwest then we have x and y positions of the top left corner and finally new width and height

once the card is installed post is fine and as the linux kernel is booting we get

211023
rpm	yum
how to download a rpm package using yum command without installing on linux

211023
folder	directory
to pack that into a tarball involves only a few commands first download the packages then run createrepo in the repo directory and finally create a tarball from that folder plus the yum configuration for the repo

211034
icmp	tcp
block return is the friendly neighbor way to let the client know the address is unreachable by responding in a protocol specific way with a tcp rst reset or icmp unreachable packet

211056

i ve posted a question on how to start ssh at bootup how to start ssh daemon on boot on linux mint debian v2 but everything i ve tried has not worked

211095
ubuntu	debian
i tested this on a clean install of debian jessie but i also have this problem on other machines ex ubuntu 12.04

211104
kde	gnome
if you change your kde icon theme it will not change your icons in your gnome applications

211104
kde	gnome
kde applications when run in a gnome desktop environment will use the gnome theme settings but that is not because of global settings but rather because the qt toolkit has added a mechanism to detect the gnome theme and use it

211124
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
it can call chmod without sudo on own files but cannot call chown

211124
777	tmp
so the things is this in tmp both user and www-data can create a file with 777 permissions upon instantiation to which the other user can append subsequently

211124
777	tmp
note this happens with the containing folder home users group user tmp having 777 permissions

211143
debian	linux
i am running this version of linux debian debian 3.16.3-2 2014-09-20 x86_64 gnu linux

211157

more elegantly is there a way to set up the cron job to know if the daemon is running before initiating it

211157
daemon	cron
in short how do i set up the cron job to ensure that the daemon is running

211179
centos	linux
i am a newbie on linux and trying to host my java project on a remote linux host centos

211257
pthreads	fork
see also pthreads 7 credentials 7 fork 2 execve 2 clone 2

211262
solaris	bsd
this is linux acl handling afaik solaris with zfs is a bit different i am not entirely sure how bsd with zfs handles that

211267
disk	ram
read content cached in ram while writing to disk - linux

211271
mouse	keyboard
of course use the addresses of your mouse and keyboard

211291

211332
debian	linux
i connect to machine b voyage linux debian alix pc engines over ethernet using ssh

211334
ord	chr
chr and ord have been shamelessly stolen from bash script to get ascii values for alphabet

211343
macports	homebrew
you ll want to install reattach-to-user-namespace through homebrew or macports and wrap the call to osascript

211353
dnf	yum
compared to yum dnf offers

211353
dnf	yum
see will dnf replace yum

211358
filesystems	btrfs
annoyingly btrfs filesystems show returns an approximate value if the size isn t a multiple of 1mb

211358
filesystems	btrfs
it also requires a loop device btrfs filesystems show img.btrfs doesn t work as of debian jessie

211358
filesystems	btrfs
tmp img.btrfs btrfs filesystems sectorsize 4096 nodesize 4096 leafsize 4096 uuid 61297945-d399-4fdc-ba9f-750ef9f9dfdb 28672 17084416 bytes used 1 devices

211365
ubuntu	linux
since the driver is only available in ubuntu i decided to try making my own driver i did not programmed and after several attempts i made it i built one driver who you can install generically on any gnu linux distribution

211377
dpkg	apt
when restoring follow the instructions at to restore the dpkg selections then run to restore the apt package marks where auto.backup is the file created earlier with apt-mark showauto

211377
versioning	upgrade
you shouldn t overwrite etc with your backup but compare the new versioning with your backup and apply any necessary changes some files will have changed in the upgrade and you don t want to overwrite those.

211382
filesystems	btrfs
both btrfs filesystems show and btrfs filesystems usage give you the size

211404
post	get
i read somewhere else i could call external scripts in the post section but i can t get a read on the working directory to do so

211423
gentoo	linux
since gentoo isn t your distribution use the linux distros link in the navigation to find the same article i linked for your particular distribution

211442
lsof	netcat
i ve tried with netstat and ss nmap lsof and netcat

211450
mouse	keyboard
mouse works ok but keyboard keep typing chars inside ssh terminal window not inside notepad

211457
folder	directory
now though the disk mount is under the source directory and after mounting it to my local machine i am not able to see anything inside the new disk though the top most folder inside the disk is visible

211510
integer	fractions
you can confirm this by checking the source code the timeout is parsed using atolfp which parses numbers into their integer part and fractions part

211512
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to chain the commands in linux i am using ubuntu 14.04 distribution

211519
fish	bash
if i enter bash commands in the fish file .config fish config.fish it throws errors

211519
fish	bash	put	get
is there a way to get fish to load an sh file so that i can put all my bash things in that file

211529
fish	bash
bash and fish have incompatible syntax so they cannot share startup files

211554
tunnel	vpn
i want to route network traffic that comes from one end of an ssh tunnel constructed by ssh dynamic port-forwarding into one end of a vpn tunnel

211570
ubuntu	linux
i have some experience with linux currently running ubuntu 14.04.2 lts

211570
trojan	virus
so i can like to try and understand being black listed for running a tor exit node - it is under my control but i get black listed for being hacked or have a virus or spamming or natting for a trojan etc

211572
centos	linux
centos is based on red hat enterprise linux and the main goal of a distribution produced for enterprise customers is to provide robust stable and reliable os and system software

211572
versioning	upgrade
when red hat released versioning 6 of their enterprise linux they chose versioning 1.0.0 for openssl but over the course of the minor updates to rhel 6.6 they upgrade to versioning 1.0.1e

211572
versioning	upgrade
for example stories in the press may include phrases such as upgrade to apache httpd 2.0.43 to fix the issue which only takes into account the upstream versioning number

211580
sudo	passwd
said you could always just delete the devish folder devish by running sudo rm -rf devish and then entering your passwd at the prompt

211584
rpm	yum
i get the feeling that yum is somehow misconfigured or that i have two different versions of rpm

211607
debian	linux
i use --print-uris of apt-get to get url download-link of debs i want to download and install on my debian trisquel gnu linux

211609
put	get
if that is impossible how do i manually compile these modules so that i get a r8169.ko and a ath5k.ko file that i can put in libs modules kernel version kernel drivers net and then run insmod. r8169.ko to load into the kernel

211648
debian	linux
for debian linux this is cataloged at

211652
rpm	yum
i would expect on centos 5.11 with yum 3.2.22 installed that your rpm version would be 4.4.2.3 not 4.3.3

211657
ubuntu	centos
recently i am forced to migrate an ancient cvs installation from ubuntu to centos

211660
opensuse	linux
i wanted to install linux opensuse but it doesn t work

211670
ssl	https	next	except
i just set up my apache server with ssl installed on it and everything is perfect except that when i open the page with https i get the following message when i click the padlock next to the address bar in chrome your connection to 192

211720
debian-based	linux
there is also etc bashrc etc bash.bashrc in debian-based linux which contains system wide functions and aliases

211730
dnf	yum
differences in the command line behavior is documented extensively in the dnf docs at changes in dnf cli compared to yum

211734
freebsd	linux	gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	linux
for many years until linux from scratch and it s children of whom gentoo is one users could not get true source code on their system unless they chose to use the freebsd ports system

211734
gentoo	freebsd
for that reason freebsd users viewed themselves as superior but as gentoo and portage matured the stage was set for the battle pictured below and the g is backwards i know

211734
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
linux selinux openbsd freebsd netbsd macosx

211734
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
glibc openbsd freebsd netbsd macosx

211734
gentoo	freebsd
to install freebsd you need to use the handbook provided by freebsd to install freebsd and then inside a fresh install use the gentoo freebsd instructions at the wiki

211734
gentoo	freebsd
gentoo freebsd is a gentoo system based on freebsd

211734
gentoo	linux
software in . contrib and . crypto is replaced with gentoo linux

211734
freebsd	linux
for a brief and i do mean brief explanation of the difference between freebsd and linux see htg explains whatâ s the difference between linux and bsd

211740
ubuntu	linuxmint	ubuntu	debian	debian	linuxmint
to install it in ubuntu or debian or linuxmint or similar type

211754
octal	decimal
apparently we have to convert decimal to octal before printing out to ascii

211772
bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
a etc environment sourced for bourne-type shells bash sh dash will not work for c shells csh tcsh for example

211803
osx	yosemite
i do split -p 0 input.txt in bsd split but i get nothing as output in osx yosemite 10.10.3 gnu bash version 3.2.57 1 -release x86_64-apple-darwin14

211805
debian	linux
you might be interested in rod s efi bootloaders introduction and my alt linux rescue might come handy as it contains both refind boot manager and all the tools needed to mess with partitions and filesystems to create another esp if debian installer didn t do that for you

211812
centos	linux
fail2ban is install on centos 7 with firewall linux 3.10.0-229.4.2.el7.x86_64 x86_64

211815
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
as xtian said for tcp sctp udp you can usually guess which it is as the connection initiator will typically use a high port while the destination will typically be a well known low port

211816
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and ubuntu

211844
kde	cinnamon
the user who used cinnamon before installing kde and who never used kde has an almost instant login

211844
kde	cinnamon
a side note this was reported by me as a bug to cinnamon and kde

211870
bash	zsh
these instructions are for zsh not bash

211870
bash	zsh
the characters in a zsh prompt are very different from the characters in the bash prompt

211870
bash	zsh
bash has characters zsh does not and vice versa

211870
bash	zsh
another key difference is mostly in bash the special characters start with a backslash whereas in zsh mostly the special characters start with a percent symbol for a good list of the more useful zsh escape characters go to this webpage

211876
prng	random
deck defaults to drawing its random data from the linux dev urandom prng but if it is called with an argument it will interpret that as a filename for an alternate source of random input

211879
redhat	fedora
etc bashrc redhat fedora etc

211885
ubuntu	linux
linux i am using ubuntu is a multi-user operating system

211898
ubuntu	linux
my preferred scanning application is simple scan and i have systems running both arch linux and ubuntu that i would like to get this working for

211901
centos	linux
for example is centos 6.5 equivalent based on red hat enterprise linux 6.5

211911
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is a proprietary filesystems ms

211918
sysv	systemd
switch back to openrc sysv init using eselect profile choose a profile without systemd

211936
debian	mint	debian	linux
the problem occurs in all of the browsers i ve tested in linux both debian and mint but does not occur in any of the browsers i tested in windows

211936
debian	mint
one of these is firefox with the same version and add-ons in windows debian and mint

211953
bash	zsh
shell bash zsh ksh variants mksh

211969
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
linux mint 17.1 cinnamon 64-bit or a recent ubuntu debian distribution

211997
mouse	keyboard
for historical reasons sound input and output uses completely different channels from input devices such as keyboard and mouse and from video displays

212011
vim	emacs
a final word about editor wars emacs vim and the like acme rules

212024
dpkg	apt
i skimmed both hints and it looks as if the version you linked didn t contain anything on the configuration files needed in the newer versions of dpkg and apt

212042
chown	chmod
there are some strangers to linux who need to use it in terminal mode but they are helplessly limited to accept that using chmod and chown is dead simple

212057
cat	tee
it would be better to write some setuid commands for tee and cat to write the database in super user mode and at a better location but tmp

212057
cat	tee
note for the noobs when i m talking about setuid here don t set the setuid flag on tools like tee cat or find

212064
sorting	filtering
check if the file s contents remain the same after sorting numerically and filtering duplicated lines

212083
ubuntu	linux
i m totally new to arch linux was using ubuntu before

212085
debian	linux
i am using debian linux unstable repo

212117
ubuntu	debian
i m going to merge a pr to fix the lot of stuff in debian ubuntu

212117
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
ubuntu version 15 debian 8 and centos 7 all use systemd and all need a proper systemd service unit

212117
ubuntu	debian
aside from the fact that that won t work on debian and ubuntu because they try to punt everything back to the service unit

212137
spaces	delimiter
you also need to quote the variables as it will see the spaces in the filename as a delimiter between the arguments for mv

212139
debian	linux
i am using debian linux unstable repo

212160
sysv	systemd
otherwise you can mistake any init systemd for sysv

212168
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m running linux mint 17.1 based on ubuntu trusty

212211
centos	linux
i m about to create a daemon account for running hadoop on centos linux i m just playing around on a home vm but would like to know if there is a commonly used naming convention for linux in industry

212220
daemons	systemd
daemons are usually added as a systemd account using useradd -r which gives them a userid lower than human users on my systemd systemd accounts start at 100 human users start at 1000

212220
daemons	systemd
looking at the user names for systemd accounts in etc passwd seems to confirm the lack of any service daemons or d convention

212220
daemons	systemd
are all accounts for systemd daemons

212221
ubuntu	debian
on arch you can use debootstrap to set up debian or ubuntu chroots

212270
stdout	stderr
...which prints to stderr and returns other than 0 when is unset but prints to stdout and returns 0 when is set

212272
filesystems	btrfs
i am vaguely familiar with a few cow modern filesystems concepts and am nowhere near an expert or even beyond neophyte status when it comes to btrfs

212297
debian-based	ubuntu
to install ubuntu or other debian-based distributions in a chroot use debootstrap

212297
ubuntu	debian
for more details see how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

212300
ubuntu	linux
i personally do not run windows at home and run linux ubuntu 14.04

212313
tunnel	vpn
depending on the vpn implementation it could be technically allowed via config from the vpn server side look for vpn split tunnel

212334
hex	binary
i need to convert binary data to hex octave any suitable format and back to binary when i am splitting one big 1gb file into files containing 777 events each which are not of the same size such that each event is separated by a string fafafafa in hexdump format but note that this separator may not exist in telnet-examples so you can choose any string there for practice

212338
filesystems	btrfs
the replace command doesn t make a backup of sda1 it replaces sda1 with sdb1 in the filesystems but since it s a one device filesystems and btrfs doesn t bother wiping the data from sda1 when it replaces it they end up being indentical copies of the filesystems

212338
filesystems	btrfs
however you do not want to do this as both will have the same uuid and currently it s not safe to mount two btrfs filesystems with the same uuid as it can cause massive data corruption see btrfswiki s gotchas page

212338
filesystems	btrfs
if you want to use btrfs s incremental backup feature you should format you re backup drive dev sdb1 to a new btrfs filesystems

212338
filesystems	btrfs
then you should mount the blank btrfs filesystems and run

212361
gmail	hotmail
you would then have to mark the messages as not spam for services like yahoo hotmail or gmail

212361
stdout	stderr
in the example below the stdout and stderr output is sent to tmp ajob.log

212361
stdout	stderr
another alternative is to send stderr logs to email and stdout logs to a file

readonly	temporary
lastly if you absolutely cannot avoid storing some kind of credentials you could have the credentials readonly and owned by root and root could grant ownership on an exceedingly temporary basis when requested to do so by a script because your script should not be run as root unless absolutely necessary and connecting to a database does not make it necessary

212369
hex	binary
i think the conversion from binary to hex and back to binary is sufficient by xxd -ps

212390
fish	bash
for example it works fine with fish which is not posix compliant and does not follow all the same syntax rules as bash

212390
fish	bash
for example you actually don t need to quote the with bash but if you do the same thing with fish you will get find missing argument to -exec

212398
move	drag
if i drag the drag handle over to the right hoping this would move the divider then the whole notification area including the grey expanse move to the right of the clock

212430
hex	binary
i have binary data which i review by xxd -ps in hex format

212430
hex	binary
example hex data where 48300 bytes between headers fafafafa which you can get here called data26.6.2015.txt where three headers and its nearly equivalent binary here called test_27.6.2015.bin which has only first two headers

212452
filesystems	ntfs
as i commented the ntfs filesystems was dirty as the error message was saying

212477

212532
hex	binary
offsets of your pattern converted from hex to chars xfa in the binary

212532
hex	binary
if grep doesnt manage to work with the binary data you can use the xxd hex dump data

212538
bluetooth	usb
i have usb bluetooth device which is using btusb 0.6 module driver

212539
centos	linux
we have been using centos as the os for some of our linux servers for quite some time now

ubuntu	debian
install gcc and the gtk3 development package sudo apt-get install gcc libgtk-3-dev on debian ubuntu

212581
bash	zsh
if your shell is bash ksh or zsh you can use the pattern to recurse into subdirectories

212607
hex	binary
output is one hex file and 4 binary files

212623
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
be that with fedora ubuntu or debian linux

212627
filesystems	btrfs
i have a netgear nas device which uses btrfs filesystems

212648
kde	gnome
your desktop environment gnome kde etc. should provide a way for you to configure autostarting in gui

212649
filesystems	btrfs	umount	btrfs
sudo umount dev sdxy and then sudo btrfs filesystems defrag dev sdxy

212670
debian	linux
i am using debian gnu linux 7.8 wheezy operating system in my institute

212684
versioning	upgrade
for example if i download a versioning of arch linux 6 months older than the latest on the website and then run update upgrade isn t it the same of running the same command on the latest versioning

212694
rpm	yum
just some more information i used yum install openoffice and then checked that the rpm was there by typing rpm -q openoffice

212695
filesystems	btrfs
i have two separate btrfs filesystems which i would like to consolidate

212696
passwd	chgrp	arp	tftp	chgrp	mkdir	chgrp	mount	chgrp	chmod	chmod	rmdir	chmod	mkdir	tftp	telnet	rmdir	mkdir	rmdir	chown	rmdir	chgrp	chown	mkdir	chown	mount	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod	chown	passwd	uniq	grep	cat	tee

212700
sysv	systemd
but it only needs a few tricky updates like the systemd sysv among the hundreds to get a real mess

212756
installation	upgrade
if 1.9.5 enters unstable and you explicitly request its installation then the package will be upgrade to 1.9.5 but only if dependencies are satisfied by what s already installed or packages from stable otherwise apt will complain about unresolved dependencies

212761
vmware	virtualbox
yes as rocky said you have to virtualize it with virtualbox vmware fusion which will match your cpu type

212776
xfce	kde
there is many other desktop like kde gnome3 xfce lxqt lxde etc

212788
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	redhat	fedora
on arch ubuntu debian family and the later redhat centos fedora systems you blacklist the module by adding at boot time

212833
rpm	zypper
nor is there an option you can pass to rpm which is what zypper uses underneath

212907
dpkg	apt
apt is simple combination of wget and dpkg

212907
debian	linux
for example on my debian x86_64 gnu linux testing stretch installing skype which depends on libc6 i386 results in installing 189 packages

212920
stdout	stderr
one seemingly to stdout and one to stderr since running these commands

212933
ubuntu	yosemite
i get this on ubuntu 14.04 but was able to reproduce the same behavior on yosemite 10.10

212947
debian	linux
i m not usually a debian user but i run linux on a lot of macs my main laptop is an ibook g4 and i find that debian is remarkably good at managing the quirks of apple hardware

212955
stdout	stderr
the problem is that gpg writes directly to the tty instead of stdout or stderr

212966
versioning	upgrade
as such i wanted to upgrade our machines from an older centos 6.3 versioning to 6.5 the reason i don t want to upgrade all the way to 6.6 is that datastax has not certified that versioning yet - and since this is our production environment i m not willing to take even a small risk of something not working correctly with 6.6

212971
installation	upgrade
if you said yum update on a centos 6.0 system on the day centos 6.1 came out the difference between your upgrade centos 6.0 system and a fresh 6.1 installation would be very small

212971
centos	linux
the whole point of using a stable linux like centos is that they purposely do not make any functional changes they don t absolutely have to within the major release series

212971
filesystems	xfs
they took xfs out of beta status in rhel 5 and 6 shortly after rhel 7 shipped since xfs is the default filesystems in rhel 7

212972
urllib	lwp
many programs use the lowercase variant only including lynx wget curl perl lwp perl www search python urllib urllib2 etc

213008
awk	ksh
i have created a solution in ksh and awk that cycles on the table rules and with awk selects whether to print in the output file or not

213027
centos	linux
i ve reinstalled a linux server from centos 6 to 7

213029
cinnamon	gnome
i believe cinnamon is a fork of gnome

213036
stdout	stderr
what i want is for .zshrc to source my .bashrc quietly with all stderr and stdout output hidden

213046
stdout	stderr
nohup automatically redirects stderr to stdout but i want to send it to the terminal it shows progress

213052
tail	nohup
nohup creates a file named nohup.out though you can access that file with tail -f from any terminal and keep whatching the command s output

213061
stdout	stderr
take this script for example which prints a line to stderr and one to stdout

213089
kubuntu	gnome	kde	gnome	kde	kubuntu
with the 15.04 release of kubuntu i switched from gnome ubuntu to kde plasma

213116

i d like to run a cron job to test whether there is an active window session gnome or kde running on my host

213117
solaris	sunos
we have a solaris machine version sunos 5.8 hosting a pivotal script process which has been running for many years without complaint

213119

213124
ubuntu	debian
generated public private key pair in debian server and copied id_rsa.pub to authorized keys in the ubuntu

213179
zsh	tcsh
without the quotes around you d get an error message in csh tcsh or zsh unless the condition below is met and in most shells that would fail if there was a file called s p a c or e in the current directory as is a shell glob

213182
ubuntu	mint
btw these screenshots are from my personal laptop that i used this method with to keep windows update from bonking my non-refind efi discussed in the question i asked recently below after which i replaced ubuntu with mint 17.1 rebecca

213197
sudo	passwd
a login program is a program where you typically type your passwd and that starts a session for you such as login sudo -i su - sshd etc

213198
bash	zsh
zsh doesn t have a bash emulation mode ksh is as close as it gets

213208
stdout	stderr
the problem is that tar s stderr got mixed in with its stdout so the file looks like this

213215
stdout	stderr
as long as stdout and stderr are line-buffered and the lines of one of the two are always spottable mixing them is not a problem consider the output of a program where both stdout and stderr are line-buffered and where stderr is easily spottable

213229
octal	hex
the tr variable there is made up of octal escapes ascii chars for the byte values of your hex string because i wanted tr to -d elete its complement

213272
zsh	tcsh
the only shells i know which has a builtin command called where is the tcsh and zsh

213272
bash	tcsh
therefore it is the tcsh -equivalent of the bash builtin type tcsh has no type

213297
debian	linux
server is linux debian squeeze

213304
ubuntu	mint
i have been able to set this up in ubuntu but i have no success with mint

213321
mp3	flac
i have tried renaming an mp3 to your stated problem filename and running the script only to find it was fine up until oggenc didn t like encoding flac from stdin

213354
zypper	yum
in the zypper .repo file specify type yum

213373
stdout	stderr
note also that foo writes human-readable output to both stdout and in debug mode stderr

213373
stdout	stderr
have the parent process looking for something special in the child s stdout or stderr and block until it s seen

213441
ethernet	wireless
ifconfig shows only loopback device lo and no actual network devices there should be also ethernet enp3s0 and wireless wlp4s0 interfaces

213446
cpu	processors
this processors can run 64 bit versions i compared your cpu flags with mine that is running 64 bit and none of the differences are important features

213457
debian-based	linux
i have a small embedded project where i had to make some minor tweaks to a linux kernel to support different hardware and minor tweaks to a debian-based operating system my rootfs

213494
pull	push
you can use either a pull cron job on each webserver or push hooks in the version control system which trigger an update mechanism for that

213510
bash	zsh
if it s just the esc 0x1b character you want to convert to e then with ksh93 zsh or bash typically the same ones that also support that non-standard q you can do

213544
stdout	stderr
that is a subshell still has an stdin stdout and stderr so you can pipe things to and from a subshell

213573
filesystems	btrfs
how can i get different filesystems formats configured on my machine such that i can run mkfs and specify this new type mkfs -t btrfs ...and so on

213573
filesystems	btrfs
in the example used above i cannot make use of btrfs because my machine has not been configured to recognize btrfs much less have mkfs be capable to creating a filesystems using that format

213585
filesystems	xfs
mounting an xfs filesystems

213591
bash	zsh
you can compare file timestamps directly in bash zsh ksh with the test operator -nt newer-than

213601
switching	screens
i reconnected to my server and i did screens -r to get my screens back but now i don t see them split i only see the first screens and i have to switching to my other screens with the ctrl+a+space

213609
bash	subshell
upd in bash 4.3 background subshell does not ignore sigint other background programs still do

213627
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux # reboot

213628
ubuntu	debian
all i ve been able to turn up so far is that on ubuntu debian the list comes from the wordlist packages but their descriptions offer no clue on how the lists were actually generated

213634
pulseaudio	mixer
contains all the explanations and the basic settings on how pulseaudio will tinker with alsa mixer settings

213654

213678
centos	linux
the target embedded linux is arm xilinx zynq and i am working in centos to compile to arm using xilinx s tool

213690
bash	zsh
for that to work in bash you need to enable the extglob option shopt -s extglob and the kshglob option in zsh set -o kshglob

213712
debian	mint	debian	linux
i have installed tmux on linux mint debian edition and every time i start it or create a new pane window it displays a random quote or message above the prompt

213733
ubuntu	debian
even more fortunately in debian and ubuntu this can be done as easily as

213737
udp	tcp
my internet access is through a proxy my os is debian 8 each application must configure it to use the proxy but there are some that are a headache to make it work with a proxy then my question is is there any way or a program to send all my connections tcp udp etc. to the proxy

213747
submit	submission
in the past i ve had changes included in the magic file by submission a debian bug report but it s probably faster to submit them upstream directly

213760
sudoers	passwd
it is configured in etc sudoers and allows a more finer control such as only allow to run a single program as root to a specific user which may be set to require their own passwd again and also provides logging facilities eg

213772
sudo	passwd
now there is a possibility that the drive installed a keylogger or a malicious su sudo and you wanted to get root access in your de entered your root passwd from a user environment and your logs were altered

213802
freebsd	linux
for example when using a freebsd athlon system to build gnu linux m68k binaries

213804
bash	zsh
you can stop this behaviour by removing fortune apt-get uninstall fortune and then looking through your shell initialisation files for example depending on your setup with bash check .bash_profile or .profile and for zsh look at .zprofile or .zlogin and removing the call to fortune

213821
bash	zsh
however bash contrary to zsh doesn t have support for such a wait-until-the-response-arrives that doesn t read the response

213840
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	cinnamon	gnome	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
i would like to disable the default behavior that seems to happen with every linux distribution that i ve ever tried that any selected text is immediately sent to the clipboard mint ubuntu fedora suse etc. and every window manager gnome kde cinnamon and instead to behave more like the windows implementation

213868
opera	google-chrome
i tested it on google-chrome and opera and it works fine but often it freezes and i have to reload the page

213883
stdout	stderr
i tried piping stderr to stdout and vice versa both of which produce awry results but enter nothing into the file

213890
dpkg	apt
apt and dpkg absolutely can remove software that is required by locally installed other software that is outside the scope of the package management system

213890
dpkg	apt
there is simply no way for apt and dpkg to know that such software might exist

213890
dpkg	apt
technically apt or dpkg could even remove software that is required by other software that is part of the package management system if the latter software fails to declare that it depends on the former software

213895
udp	tcp
but openvpn should work it uses udp by default and its documentation mentions how tcp for a vpn is not a good idea for unrelated reasons

213905
ethernet	wireless
a wireless ethernet adapter for connecting multiple devices to it

213927
minimum	max
it contains negative temperatures in some places with max voltages lower than the minimum

213951

systemtap	perf
there is a large number of tools available to do it with various levels of features usability and stability including sysdig ftrace perf dtrace4linux ktap systemtap and others

214014
daemons	systemd
as nzbget -d runs it in the background as a daemons you need to tell systemd

214035
folder	directory
which will glob all index.html files in folder in child directory of . files_input named with two characters then a dash then the string 2015 and copy all of those files into the newly created files_output folder with names like

214062
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
on ubuntu and linux mint most ways to start a gui session including i believe the default one cause etc profile and .profile to be read by bin sh not by bash

214068
bash	zsh
right now i have my iterm session configured to use zsh usr local bin zsh but i m trying to configure tmux to use zsh as well instead of bin bash which it s currently defaulting to

214108
sunos	aix
the posix execve specification does not mention any shebang specific processing but all the unix-like systems i worked on linux sunos hpux aix ... did process it specifically in execve

214150
bash	zsh
but on bash or zsh the is a builtin and that does not seem to be an issue

214171
sysv	systemd
be aware that initscripts is not sysv specific removing it will almost certainly destroy your systemd

214178
debian	linux
i have configured a debian 7 linux router named server with 2 wifi adapters

214178
debian	linux
i connect to my linux router server with my laptop debian 8

214263
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
if you want to keep it short and simple use one of the easier to use distros like linux mint or ubuntu

214283
jobs	cron
but i m likely missing something here like about what user or user types cron jobs run with

214287
min	max
what i need to do now is write the tty usb0 file to a file then when i invoke my script i want it to echo a min max avg for certain comma delimited fields

214289
folder	directory
use the 7z format and encryption with fileroller which also supports directory folder encryption in contrary to zip files

214291
ubuntu	debian
also the requirement for taiga is ubuntu 14.04 which translates to debian jessie

214307
chown	chmod
of course you should chown and chmod the file so only the target user can access it

214336
centos	linux
i use the following commands to set the timezone on our amazon linux centos server

214363
daemons	systemd
but don t go full-hog -- for example there are important systemd daemons that runs with nice-values of just -5 or -10 negative-values higher better priority that probably shouldn t be preempted by you suddenly giving gnome a nice-value of -18

214375
subshell	ifs
then to put together the command you want to echo to bc we ll play a little game with a subshell and ifs like

214377
mp3	flac
this converts flac files in a folder into mp3 files and moves then to an existing mp3 folder

214390
udp	tcp
snmp is udp vs tcp

214399
udp	tcp
using udp 161 not tcp

214496
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i d like to install linux debian or ubuntu but keep the preinstalled windows that came with the computer apparently the installation files are in a hidden partition obviously i don t have any installation dvd or cd

214499
stdout	stderr
and so the above statement will return 1 for any cmp run which produces any line of output on stdout or stderr which does not match or 0 otherwise

214529
filesystems	ntfs
on unix linux filesystems file attributes normally don t include a creation time field as they do on vfat and ntfs

214539
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
sure you can shrink the partition size of preinstalled windows and install linux debian or ubuntu as your wish side by side with the windows

214539
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	gentoo	mint
i personally have been using linux for about 8 years 6 years on gentoo and last two years i use ubuntu linux mint

214551
ubuntu	mint
as mint 17 derives from ubuntu 14.04 jessie release april 2015 freeze november 2014 is the more natural source than wheezy release may 2013 freeze june 2012

214558
daemons	launchd
one is a winforms app gui app which cannot be launchd through ssh since it requires a desktop environment and the second is a console app still running waiting for remote commands editor s note probably a daemons

214562
filesystems	hfs
i installed tmfs by apt-get install tmfs which is some filesystems of hfs made for time-machine backups

214573
snmp	mib
or am i correct that mib databases have nothing to do with snmp agents

214574
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
for linux mint 17 based on ubuntu you have to use this because it uses upstart as it is the way on ubuntu 14.04 lts

214574
debian	mint	debian	linux
for linux mint debian edition it uses system v init so you can issue

214589
x86	64bit
as of xen 4.3 xen requires at least x86 64bit for the hypervisor

214589
cpu	processors
on x86 xen project requires a p6 or newer processors that s any intel or amd x86 cpu purchased in the last seven years

214619
email	dkim
also you need to authenticate your email using different technologies like domainkeys identified mail dkim spf and sender id

214622
free	malloc
the unifying characteristic is that every crash corresponds with a new malloc or a delete free

214636
xfs	btrfs
i would stay with xfs ext4 or btrfs

214637
snmp	mib
i plan to write a mib module for net-snmp snmp agent so that my nms can ask a value of certain custom oid from snmp agent

214649
bash	zsh
i found the following command runs on zsh but not on bash

214649
bash	zsh
if not why is the above command not running in bash but running in zsh

214687
mouse	keyboard
i have also tried lsusb but this includes my keyboard mouse and other non-storage devices

214688
post	get
in order to help you get the script to do what you want you need to post the script

214723
mouse	keyboard
after dual booting my system with ubuntu my mouse and keyboard no longer work in windows 8.1

214754
ubuntu	debian
how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

214754
ubuntu	debian
you can follow similar instructions to install a debian or ubuntu system on another distribution you ll just need to install schroot and debootstrap

214754
ubuntu	debian
debian jessie and ubuntu trusty both have glibc 2.19

214756
sudo	passwd
you don t need the -t option to ssh unless you want to interact with the remote commands this includes the case when you need to type a passwd for sudo
