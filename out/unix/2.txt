53744
folder	directory
based on this you could perhaps create a folder or move the directory etc etc

53748
ubuntu	debian
i decided not to post in the ubuntu forum because i felt this issue might be relevant to other distros as well especially debian based ones

53750
folder	directory
saying that the files could be present anywhere in a certain folder implies that you want to recursively descend all directory folder within the starting directory folder

53750
folder	directory
unless your directory folder contains a very large number of files you should have one list and thus one process forked leading to the result you desire

53758
ubuntu	debian
firmware for wireless card on ubuntu debian

53767
daemons	systemd
all of these operations should not be done from the systemd you are intending to change especially the move of tmp and or var to a different filesystem - daemons may keep their files there and it could damage the running systemd - a live cd or another minimal installation should do the trick

53800
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu linux if that helps

53806
dpkg	apt
dpkg error processing var cache apt archives mint-backgrounds-lisa_1.1_all.deb --unpack

53878
folder	directory
by leaving only execute permissions on the parent folder and normal permissions on the child directory you can enter the parent directory but be unable to view its contents unless you know the exact filename

53905
unix	solaris
there are some differences between older unix versions of tar such as the non-gnu versions of tar that have shipped with solaris and the gnu tar that ships with linux etc

53905
stdout	stderr
if you re making an archive in cron and you re using -v with tar try redirecting stdout to a file and stderr too

53916
ubuntu	linux
ipw2200 cards should work just fine under linux judging from your kernel you run ubuntu

53918
mouse	keyboard
fwiw with xterm click on the left mouse button while holding the ctrl key to bring a menu where you can select secure keyboard

53922
hide	show
i think it can be done using some event handlers and show hide it manually but isn t it implemented in some module and if not what s the best way to do it

53938
debian	centos
tried the current beta of debian wheezy for host and guest and centos 6.2 for host

54958
config	ini
ini is a config file standard

54958
config	ini
a .conf file could be an ini file or it could be any other config system that the application supports

54958
config	ini
mysql for example uses the file my.cnf by default for config which is an ini file

54971
rpm	yum
if you use yum to install the rpm it will install dependencies from remote sources if the packages are available

54974
stdout	stderr
i think logging stdout and stderr to two different files is a splendid idea

54975
openbsd	linux
os openwrt or scientific linux or openbsd

54990
debian	linux
debian gnu linux has ethtool and net-tools to set ethernet speed

54998
opensuse	mint
i am considering mint 13 or possibly switching back to opensuse with xfce perhaps even trying out fedora

54999
debian	linux
mail.viathinksoft.com runs postfix cyrus and debian linux

55006
disk	ram
ram is cheap and disk is slow and the that slowness has become so great these days disk have only tripled in speed while ram has become 100 times faster that if you do ever actually start swapping the system will become unusable

55006
disk	ram
if you don t have enough ram to run what you want to run you just need to add more not swap to disk

55008
config	ini
ini -style config files may have a format similar to this

55017
ubuntu	linux
just so you have an answer from someone who experienced it - i hacked my prototype chrome book with ubuntu and later bodhi linux and did not use swap on it since it only had a 16gig drive

55044
filesystems	btrfs
a btrfs filesystems can be shrunk live

55045
mouse	trackpad
secondary click on the icon on the dock ctrl+click or right mouse button or two finger tap on trackpad magic mouse and choose to quit that way

55046
apache	nginx
for example for wordpress apache nginx and so on

55057
put	get
so put your command in an editor replace server1 by server2 replace by and by as described above and add ssh server1 at the beginning and at the end and you will get

55070
chgrp	chmod
for #1 if this is the only file you care about create a group called readerb put user b into it and change the group ownership on the file chgrp to be readerb and then set the group permissions to be read only chmod

55071
bash	zsh
use any of the following the first is extremely portable but slow the second is posix and portable except to the bourne shell and earlier versions of the almquist shell the last three require ksh bash or zsh

55082
udp	tcp
nmap sends a series of tcp and udp packets to the remote host and examines practically every bit in the responses

55084
centos	linux
red hat enterprise linux and derivatives like centos scientific linux etc.

55098
ubuntu	debian
i could have added in the ppp options file replacedefaultroute but problems with iptables in ubuntu made me switch to debian

55102
bash	zsh
echo -e is meant to output -e n so in that regard bash and zsh are not posix conformant

55110
rpm	yum
both yum and rpm use the same databases so using yum localinstall is ultimately the same as just running rpm -ivh packagename.rpm

55140
disk	ram
there are two places where the partition table is stored on disk and in ram

55140
disk	ram
it sounds like you updated the disk without updating the ram then changed the disk back

55140
disk	ram
so if the kernel is still going on what s in ram and the next time you boot it reads the same thing off the disk then yes it should work

55149
daemons	systemd
in that case you d probably want to run a lightweight dns daemons on your systemd and instruct it where to send what query

55153
ubuntu	mint
i use mint 13 maya with mainline kernel 3.6.3 for ubuntu quantal on my asus p53e notebook

55160
clang	llvm	libstdc++	libc++
recently though sylvestre ledru and some other debian developers have mentored students in google s summer of code of 2012 to allow substitution of both gcc by clang and libstdc++ gcc s support library for c++ by libc++ clang llvm s counterpart

55160
clang	llvm
so we may soon see a flavour of debian compiled with clang llvm depending on how much support these successful results can gain

55160
clang	llvm
there is as of this update 2016-08-16 a new version of a traditional linux distribution compiled with clang and llvm openmandriva lx 3.0 now in its final release

55160
clang	llvm
according to its notes it is compiled as much as possible not only with clang and llvm but also with regular high optimization levels and also with link time optimization lto

55160
clang	llvm
while the main subject of the question and of this answer is llvm clang to be fair it should be noted gcc also features lto more background on lto

55160
clang	llvm
in theory lto as seen in newer clang llvm and gcc has the potential of making not only the resulting binaries faster but also having smaller memory requirements for the text-section of the programs and the linux kernel is one potential benefiter of lto

55160
clang	llvm
i have not read how much openmandriva lx 3.0 uses lto across all the programs but i m excited that it uses clang llvm + lto and i would love to see people doing multiple independent benchmarks comparing and contrasting regular gcc-based non-lto-optimized distributions to openmandriva lx 3.0

55161
kate	nano
however when i tested kate and nano for example those just silently deleted the file on every other save

55164
packets	pcap
i would like to feed packets to pcap to programatically handle some packets types

55164
packets	pcap
i have seen articles on zero copy networking pcap bpf but i guess they are all working with packets captures copies

55173
xfce	kde
i had numerous issues with that when changing from mint kde to mint xfce as well as other distros

55182
ubuntu	linux
if i ps -aux on ubuntu or any gnu linux distribution without gui i see 100 processes running

55183
daemons	systemd
but d-bus brings in a lot more features and possibilities many other systemd daemons use it handled by the same dbus-daemon process too

55202
debian	linux
debian gnu linux can be installed on different architectures it s perfect for old computers

55202
ubuntu	opensuse
probably fedora opensuse and ubuntu are the best solutions for new users and for many reasons

55205
disk	ram
trying to run programs that were already cached in ram could work fine while running programs that needed to read from the disk could hang

55207
debian	linux
i am trying to run windows xp in a xen domu virtual machine with a pcie device for which there are no linux drivers being passed through from a debian squeeze dom0

55208
cat	tee
using cat dev pts x | tee dev pts x was the first thing that came to my mind

55212
debian	linux
i d like to do some general disk io monitoring on a debian linux server

55215
munin	cacti
some other options that can show disk usage in trending graphs is munin and cacti

55222
rpm	yum
am i better off trying to use an off the shelf installer izpack etc or is there a way to bundle everything up and still use rpm yum

55222
rpm	yum
is it possible to in my my rpm spec file create a temporary yum repo that includes anything that may be required at install time

55258
daemons	systemd
this requires the ssh daemons to be running on the systemd which most distros install by default but may not have running

55264
chown	chmod
so what is wrong with a simple chown chmod

55288
daemon	cron
putting a script in cron.hourly is merely another way of having it run every hour that is your cron daemon checks both your crontab and cron.hourly

55298
bash	zsh
i m looking for an answer is bash or zsh

55348
versioning	upgrade
it will with high probability work when you upgrade to a newer versioning

55348
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu system is to take the source package and its build

55348
ffmpeg	libav
apt-get source mplayer2 etc it will also compile its own libav ffmpeg

55349
disk	ram
my processor is intel dual-core 2.5 twin 1gb ram 250 gb hard disk default video card and i have windows xp in c drive and ubuntu in d drive

55367
minix	linux
...and the intertwined history of linux minix and unix is interesting to learn as part of your research project as no os lives in a bubble not even plan9

55392
for-loop	loops
the first for-loop without the variable upperlim in loops control works fine but the second for-loop with the variable upperlim in loops control does not

55395
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux

55397
stdout	stderr
jobs submitted to the at daemon will send any output to you from stderr and stdout upon completion

55404
centos	linux
centos is a community-supported distribution that is derived from red hat enterprise linux

55412
ubuntu	openbsd
in addition a default openbsd installation includes very few services whereas a default ubuntu installation runs everything the average user expects to find

55417
debian	linux

filesystems	btrfs
let s say you have a btrfs root filesystems on an online system

55423
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m using linux mint at the moment which is a debian derivate

55464
ubuntu	debian
i m administrating two ubuntu desktops and one debian server

55465
kerberos	ldap
i would however definitely recommend using ldap and kerberos

55489
debian	mint
i would like to put idle machines in our lab running mint debian edition on standby after a timeout

55496
filesystems	ntfs
for a presentation i need to show ext4 filesystems is better than ntfs

55497
filesystems	ntfs
nevertheless you can get a good comparison of filesystems including ntfs and ext4 on wikipedia

55507
daemons	systemd
you don t say which distro or version of the cron daemons you are running but it is likely that your cron maintains systemd crontab files etc crontab and also per-user crontab files

55507
daemon	cron
without further information on your distro version or cron daemon i won t go on but it is possible you have broken the etc crontab as it has a slightly different syntax to the per-user crontab files

55507
daemon	cron
for more details on your cron daemon configuration then remove the erroneous line from etc crontab and either add it one of to the etc cron

55511
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to find a distribution for the latest v3 release of mono which i can use to upgrade the versioning of mono that i have installed

55525
bash	zsh
some shells like ksh bash and zsh allow read to be called without a variable name but the behavior differs between them

55525
bash	zsh
differing on all of bash zsh pdksh and ksh93

55534
sudo	passwd
i put sudo smbpasswd -u adam and filled in some passwd

55548
xfce	gnome
does sound work if you start x with startx not via gdm kdm etc and start a minimal windowmanager like pekwm not gnome or xfce

55555
filesystems	ntfs
a windows system partition containing an ntfs filesystems which must be primary

55561
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
define linux mint as ubuntu 64

55567
filesystems	ntfs
i m transferring files to a ntfs filesystems mounted by linux over samba

55569
google-chrome	firefox
i switched to firefox for a while but few weeks ago i tried google-chrome once again

55570
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
all of the above are available in debian s repository and by transition i think that they are in ubuntu s or linux mint s repositories if that s what you are using

55588
kate	kde
all the kde based editors kate kwrite kile etc. tend to produce recovery

55604
debian	linux
to set up nme for the linux target on my debian box

55604
debian	mint	debian	linux
actually linux mint debian edition but that shouldn t matter

55612
rpm	yum
yum is looking at the rpm package database

55640
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems in question is a ntfs usb hdd to a ext3 filesystems

55676
daemon	cron
question how can i know which version cron daemon installed and running on machine

55696
bash	zsh
with ksh bash or zsh

55718
prepare	execute
a runlevel is essentially just a way of specifying actions you want to take when you enter leave a certain state in that respect once those runlevels are entered they execute programs that prepare the computer to shut down or reboot respectively

55740
folder	directory
so i copied the whole rta-0.8.1 folder to usr local lib rta-0.8.1 and then add a etc ld.conf.d rtadb.conf file containing the path of the library directory usr local lib rta-0.8.1 src in there

55744
debian	linux
while a plain debian gnu linux choose no tasks with the installer and what you get is pretty lean should do the trick why duplicate work

55744
debian-based	linux
have a look at the turnkey linux virtual appliance library it s debian-based

55784
versioning	upgrade
yum upgrade and yum update will perform the same function that update to the latest current versioning of package

55791
udp	tcp
the goal here is to listen through a horribly firewalled connection preferably both tcp and udp traffic

55812
awk	ksh
the solution can be with sed or awk or ksh syntax

55826
openbsd	linux
but is it somehow possible to install openbsd within my running linux system

55841
ubuntu	mint
to get to the installed mint ubuntu system from livecd usb you can follow this guide it seems good up to including step 6

55851
debian	linux
a linux debian 3.2.0-0.bpo.3-amd64 #1 smp thu aug 23 07 41 30 utc 2012 x86_64 gnu linux system has at least 5 scsi hosts

55869
debian	mint	debian	linux
i got annoyed with the system beep of linux mint debian edition when i login or logout

55910
put	get
i want to get all the numbers and put them in a column in a file like

55920
ubuntu	debian
there is no ia32-libs-multiarch on debian however i had a look at the ubuntu repositories and ia32-libs-multiarch is just a metapackage an empty package that depends on others

55943
ubuntu	mint
the question i have is can all ubuntu based packages be installed in mint also without any issues

55943
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
for example most of the packages that i download from respective sites list a version for linux like this debian ubuntu and then give a .deb file which is quite easy to install in ubuntu

55943
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
if a package is made for debian ubuntu will that package be directly installable in linux mint as well

55947
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
if you use linux mint based on an ubuntu version then most packages made for that version and sometime previous or later versions will work on that version of mint

55947
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
the main issue you may run into is if you use a package built for a specific version of debian or ubuntu on linux mint or linux mint debian edition respectively - that depends on a package not available for that version

55953
bash	zsh
in zsh or in bash â 4 after running shopt -s globstar or in ksh after running set -o globstar

55963
bash	zsh
the first two if you d use them again you d put in your shell initialization file .bashrc for bash .zshrc for zsh etc.

55965
versioning	upgrade
this interacts badly with cygwin s emulation of fork when there are different versioning of a dll in the parent and child process when you upgrade a dll between the time the parent started and the time the child started

55979
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
kde gnome xfce x11 dgm kdm gtk x sessions lxdm lightdm compiz kwin window- and desktopmanager.

55979
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
gnome kde xfce are desktops

55985
uptime	reboot
as the other commentators said if uptime reports 7 days of uptime the system hasn t reboot in that while

55991
mouse	keyboard
handles only basic input keyboard mouse ... and output drawing rectangles but does it in a rather abstract fashion so that you can run a program on one machine and control it from another one subscribe to various events etc

55991
gtk	motif
qt gtk motif .

55991
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
kde gnome xfce lxde .

mp4	webm	flac	ogg
i m streaming from an mp4 source and so far i ve managed to save clips as ogg video libtheora audio flac but i d like to save them in the webm format

56005
stdout	stderr
the syntax for redirecting both stderr and stdout works in bash but it likely doesn t work in bin sh which is used to execute cron commands

56017
bash	zsh
it works in ksh where it originated bash and zsh

56025
cinnamon	gnome
i started using linux mint 14 nadia recently and kind of like it better for the gnome experience its gives using cinnamon de

56029
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	unix	aix	solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix	opensolaris	bsd	opensolaris	aix
if your question is about code base lineage and not standards current oses directly descending from the original bell labs at t unix releases are aix hp-ux oracle solaris opensolaris derivatives all coming from system v release 4 and open free net bsd and derivatives from the much earlier unix version 6

56029
unix	bsd
while mac os x has some bsd code its core is not a descendant of the unix kernel code

56031
ubuntu	linux
i have 2 ubuntu linux boxes with similar directory structures lx02 and lx04

56032
ubuntu	debian
right now the htpc is running debian wheezy as the version of alsa in squeeze didn t recognize the integrated sound card although i ve also tried ubuntu and fedora fedora had the exact same issue and with ubuntu the live image installer worked but it refused to give any video output at all dvi or hdmi after installing and rebooting

56032
switching	screens
on those bootups where i get the uefi splash screens i also get grub and debian booting right up to the point where it s about to switching to 1920x1080 then the projector just reports no signal

56045
min	max
but one new thing i recognized is that in the mouse settings i can slide the slider to max or to min

56056
dnf	yum
dnf the yum replacement since fedora 22 also provides a autoremove subcommand which is modeled after apt-get yum autoremove

56056
rpm	yum
although during installation of packages installed dependencies are marked as such seems to be relatively new feature of rpm yum

56064
macbook	bootcamp
currently i own a macbook pro with a bootcamp partition win7 a mac partition os x lion and the recovery partition that comes with the aforementioned lion

56066
stdout	stderr
sort s fd 2 is mapped from its original destination stderr to stdout and then fd 1 which would have gone to stdout anyway is sent to.

56066
stdout	stderr
in versions 2 and 3 echo s fd 2 is mapped from its original destination stderr to stdout and then fd 1 which would have gone to stdout anyway is sent to echo s stdout

56066
stdout	stderr
in version 1 if echo outputs something to fd 2 it will go to stderr but in 2 and 3 it will go to stdout and thus also be piped to sort

56066
stdout	stderr
also in version 1 if sort sends something to fd 2 it will go to stdout whereas in versions 2 and 3 that output will go to stderr

56083
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to write bash shell script in ubuntu 11.10 linux distro that will get executed automatically on logging into the system

56103
freebsd	linux
i am wondering whether my personal assumptions that freebsd is indeed more stable and more tightly controlled less chaotic more organized than linux is actually true

56103
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	freebsd	linux
would using freebsd for all that limit me in the sense that it doesn t enjoy the popularity of linux ubuntu therefore there might be less packages ports

56111
freebsd	linux
personally i think they are equal although in the web hosting world i would venture a guess that linux is used much more than freebsd

56111
freebsd	linux
on that basis alone i would go with linux over freebsd for what you have detailed as wanting to do

56111
freebsd	centos
what good does it do to learn how to deploy a versioning system on freebsd when all of the servers you work on are running rhel centos

56112
freebsd	linux
freebsd is not the kernel alone while linux is only the kernel with many variations distros

56112
freebsd	linux
linux also tends to make changes such as the recent systemd and wayland while freebsd prefers steady as she goes

56112
freebsd	linux
in that case freebsd is less likely to change its core infrastructure while in linux there may be required changes to your code workflow updating whatever on occasion

56112
freebsd	linux
freebsd s roots are from unix and there is a strong desire to maintain the unix way while linux seems to prefer to change things for the sake of progress

56112
freebsd	linux
overall freebsd is less likely to have things move around on you than linux

56112
freebsd	linux
as far as applications go most if not all that you would use are also available on freebsd or if not freebsd can run most linux applications just as well in compatibility mode

56112
freebsd	linux
now we are getting ready to build our own monster-box with freebsd as the os but running linux in multiple vms

56112
freebsd	linux
this way we can code on freebsd and deploy recompile etc to multiple versions of linux and even windows if necessary

56114
folder	directory
the second line will copy the folder into the current directory as folder but the first line will copy all 7 files 6 subfolders into the current directory contaminating the current directory

56119
stdout	stderr
the first argument to write is the file descriptor 0 1 2 stand for stdin stdout stderr respectively

56130
filesystems	ntfs
after remounting this image without specifying ro can the ntfs filesystems safely be modified such as editing files copying new files deleting files etc.

56130
filesystems	ntfs
i know gnu linux can read write ntfs filesystems -- my question is whether the ntfs filesystems in the image can safely be modified after mounting the image as read write

56131
folder	directory
recursively deleted all .svn folder from the staging directory

56131
folder	directory
i need to have a command copy the contents of the staging directory to the clean directory removing everything that is only in the clean directory but leaving the clean folder s .svn folder in tact

56165
vim	emacs
if you want to use vim or emacs it might be worthwhile too to take a look around github to see if other js html css developers have shared their configuration files

56168
x86	64bit
in typical installations of 64bit gcc pass -m32 to compile for the corresponding 32-bit architecture x86 on an amd64 system

56171
daemons	launchd
its typical use is to mount additional filesystems only the root filesystem is mounted at that point and launchd some daemons

56192
gentoo	linux
imho that works on gentoo is not relevant while you can build almost everything from sources on gnu linux and especially on gentoo

56249
kde	gnome
i just had gnome s archiver open a zip file instead of kde s

56257
kde	gnome
technically there is no such thing as â œa gnome programâ or â œa kde programâ

56257
kde	gnome
there are executables linked with gnome libraries and executables linked with kde libraries

56257
kde	gnome
you should be able to get rid of many gnome applications the wrong archiver popping up when you click on a zip file by supplying your own .mailcap referencing kde applications

56303
stdout	stderr
the idea is to redirect your stdin stderr stdout which you can do with gdb but this tiny program makes it much easier to do so

56308
mtu	pppoe	mtu	dhcp	pppoe	dhcp
on the other hand if i allow the modem to do pppoe and nat enable ip and the dhcp client on eth1 and set my ip filtering script to route to eth1 instead of ppp0 clients work fine with their mtu set to 1500

56308
mtu	icmp
i tried temporarily changing these policies to accept in case path mtu discovery was depending on icmp errors from it but the problem remained

56322
bash	zsh
in bash or zsh or

56330
children	parent
probably because its parent process is terminated and the termination signal propagates to its children which don t block it and in case of sigkill they even can t

56361
versioning	upgrade
if it still not working then you can try to upgrade the whole kernel to a bleeding edge versioning and check whether it would work there

56366
disk	ram
hibernate writes the contents of your ram to the disk and shuts the machine down

56366
disk	ram
when you power your machine up again it detects that there is a ram image file stored on disk and loads the contents of the ram image back into ram

56378
freebsd	linux
i m trying to hunt down a cron job or the equivalent which i know is running but i can t find it in the default cron files for my system freebsd linux bsd

56379
jobs	cron
as such you can remove and add your own cron lists or just single cron jobs

56379
jobs	cron
that will list the cron jobs lists tabs that are currently initialized their frequency directory and file location and a few other small details

56379
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	freebsd	linux
also in freebsd you can look in var cron tabs and for ubuntu linux look in var spool cron crontabs for user-specific crontabs

56424
centos	linux
centos is developed by a small but growing team of core developers.â in turn the core developers are supported by an active user community including system administrators network administrators enterprise users managers core linux contributors and linux enthusiasts from around the world

56424
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	mint	centos	mint	centos	linux
you use ubuntu so you may understand this analogy a bit better centos is to redhat as linux mint is to ubuntu

56430
folder	directory
i have a shell script that is saved inside a zip folder and i d like to run the shell script inside the zip file as if the zip file were a directory

56438
udp	tcp
i selected all tcp and udp ports for binds connects

56454
bash	zsh
with bash and zsh but not ash pdksh or at t ksh this trick also works

56455
udp	tcp
lists all udp u tcp t and raw w outgoing connections not using l or a in a numeric form n prevents possible long-running dns queries and includes the program p associated with that

56459
udp	tcp
here it can monitor all a listening numeric n tcp t and udp u process p

56459
udp	tcp
ss linux tcp udp network and socket information

56485
debian	centos
i have an existing centos 6 installation working wonderfully and its owner now wants to add a separate debian installation onto the same machine

56486
gentoo	linux
the linux distributions that make less modifications to the kernel are slackware arch linux gentoo and linux from scratch

56491
solaris	aix
bonus when it works in an ssh session in the gui and on one or more of the following os s too hp-ux solaris and aix

56493
daemons	systemd
d-bus supplies both a systemd daemons for events such as new hardware device added or printer queue changed and a per-user-login-session daemons for general inter-process communication needs among user applications

56500
daemons	systemd
most often the parent process of a daemons is the init process the very first process to be started on a unix systemd the daemons being a child of that process means that it is not under your direct control as an non-privileged user

56501
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux distributions that are considered entry level and which may be of interest to you include ubuntu linux mint and mageia and surely some others too

56524
x86	64bit
if i buy a piece of x86 32-bit or 64bit software but i don t receive the source code and i need to modify the software i ll need to convert the machine code back into a high level language or at least assembly code

56532
spaces	delimiter
fields in awk are per default delimiter by this means doesn t contain a spaces so the correct regex for is

56537
vim	emacs
emacs or vim depending on which you currently use

56551
debian	centos
i would suggest using some form of virtualiazation in your existing centos 6 system like openvz -or maybe even virtualbox since you can access the host via vnc and installing a debian system as a guest

56557
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu doesn t support mips but debian does mips or mipsel depending on endianness

56559
bash	zsh
it depends on your shell if you are using bash dennis is completely right for zsh it may be another issue if you enabled extended_glob in which case the is interpreted by the shell and you have to quote it i.e

56570
stdout	stderr
as nohup will always generate a file with the output to stdout stderr you should combine it with output redirection

56570
stdout	stderr
when you use you only redirect the output of stdout so you still see the stderr output in the terminal

56570
stdout	stderr
to redirect both stdout and stderr and have no file written by nohup you can use

56587
xfce	cinnamon
i m not sure about cinnamon gnome3 but in xfce you can have multiple panels which remember where they are to appear

56587
xfce	cinnamon
if not i would suggest trying xfce or using xfce4-panel in the cinnamon session possibly as a replacement for its native panel

56595
ubuntu	debian
my friends are recommending me to use osx for video-editing but trying to use old good oss such as debian and ubuntu

56599
debian	linux
i have a debian linux server running on my local network

56614
kermit	xmodem
at some point i need to send a local file to the device using either the xmodem or kermit protocol

56615
centos	linux
i have a centos linux server with a ssh connection

56622
filesystems	btrfs
consider using a more modern filesystems like btrfs which with its subvolume feature eliminates the need to do this sort of planning at all

56623
debian	linux
according to the partition table my linux partition should be bootable but i cannot start windows 7 or debian

56627
gentoo	debian
i ended up installing a debian installation disk to a usb flash drive using sudo dd if desktop mini.img of dev rdisk2 bs 1m then from a successful install of debian i could chroot into a gentoo tarball and install that way

56630
gentoo	debian
i ended up installing a debian installation disk to a usb flash drive using sudo dd if desktop mini.img of dev rdisk2 bs 1m then from a successful install of debian i could chroot into a gentoo tarball and install that way

56634
stdout	stderr
is it possible to force glibc to use the same buffer for stdout and stderr

56634
stdout	stderr
i get mixed messages messages are ordered inside stdout and stderr but not with respect to each other

56634
stdout	stderr
is it possible to do have buffering but have it shared between stdout and stderr

56639
stdout	stderr
i m not entirely certain in what context you want to make the buffer the same but in a c program the author can use the setbuf family of library functions to give stderr and stdout the same buffer

56639
stdout	stderr
if a program doesn t get written in a specific way a way that sets the buffer to be the same piece of memory for stdout and stderr then the shell can t make a program do that common buffering

56663
ramdisk	umount
the ramdisk mounts atuomagically at boot and cannot be umount while in multi-user mode

56670
hash	md5
because a floppy device is effectively seen as a file you can also compare hash like sha1 or md5 of the floppy device dev fd0 and of the disk image

56674
bash	zsh
beside ksh all implementations is also supported by bash since version 2.02 and zsh but all three implementations are different and there are differences between each version of a same shell though the changes are generally backward compatible a notable exception being bash s operator that has been known to break a few scripts after a certain version when its behavior changed

56680
versioning	upgrade
it has worked well before on previous versioning of ubuntu but now that i upgrade to ubuntu 12.10 i have had problems connecting

56681
mouse	keyboard
dwm uses only a few hundred kb of memory keyboard driven but you can use mouse as well if you like

56683
stdout	stderr
there is an operator that redirects both stdout and stderr to word

56683
stdout	stderr
as a special case if n is empty and word isn t a number redirects both stdout and stderr to word

56683
stdout	stderr
and there isn t a operator which redirects both stdout and stderr and interprets its right operand as a file descriptor

56688
bash	zsh
it works in both bash and zsh

56689
put	get
if i m not going to put abc out of this script is it possible to get it s pid and terminate that function

56756
udp	tcp
will it be done at the ip layer or does the dropped ethernet frame also result in a dropped network layer packet and a dropped tcp segment or udp datagram

56759
udp	tcp
so in the normal case of tcp ip a dropped ethernet frame leads to a dropped or corrupted ip packet which in turn translates to a dropped or corrupted tcp or udp packet

56760
x86	mips
- x86 powerpc mips sparc arm avr..

56761
centos	linux
can anyone point me in the right direction to bring the mac os x and linux am using centos 6.3 basic os keymappings into alignment

56769
ubuntu	mint
so far i ve tried fedora 17 ubuntu 12.10 and most recently mint mate 14 all of which have died in this exact fashion within a day of the original setup

56777
virtualbox	parallels
nvidia market this sli multi-os configuration which is basically what i ve wanted to set up for ages but i don t want to spend over a grand on the virtualisation software parallels workstation extreme when i have been using virtualbox quite happily for years now

56800
ubuntu	debian
on debian and derivatives including ubuntu there s a rename command which can do what you want

56827
centos	linux
i m running sphinx search server v2.06 the latest stable release on an amazon ec2 with linux centos

56845
vim	emacs
the same goes for other programs whose configuration file is an interpreted language bash emacs vim fvwm sawfish â

56846
put	get
you can also use to get an empty string when foobar is undefined and the value of foobar otherwise or put any other default value after the -

56853
sudo	passwd
also if you disable direct root login do you use sudo instead with same passwd you created for root

56861
ubuntu	linux
but an application named vuescan managed to run it on linux tried on ubuntu 11.10 and 10.04

56862
sudo	passwd
sudo requires the user to enter her own passwd again while su asks for root s passwd

56876
for-loop	loops
i am trying to read user and server details from file tempo.txt and then check the disk space usage of the file system on that unix account using another script server_disk_space.sh .but i am not able to figure out why while loops is only working for first line and for-loop is working fine.please help me understand this

56896
sudo	passwd
it can also effectively create a two level authentication for root access first the private key to log in and then passwd to su or sudo

56911
folder	directory
all of them are in one parent directory but distributed within multiple sub-directories. i want to move these files into a single folder outside the parent directory

56912
google-chrome	firefox
on top of this my scroll wheel doesn t work in most applications it does in terminal and google-chrome but not firefox and other places i thought it d work

56937
mouse	trackpad
for instance i replace buttons on my usb mouse but i don t want my trackpad munged my .xmodmap used to look like this

56950
ubuntu	debian
handlers can be registered by writing to proc sys fs binfmt_misc register or with distribution-provided tools such as update-binfmts and the var lib binfmts directory on debian and derivatives including ubuntu

56981
redhat	fedora
for fedora redhat centos based distributions

56981
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu based distributions

56990
udp	tcp
in case it establishes and keeps open a tcp udp connection you could use netstat to find the remote ip of the connection

56991
sctp	tcp
for tcp though the same approach would work for sctp 1 or any connection-oriented transport protocol same as for looking for listening ones

56992
udp	tcp
this works fine for tcp udp unixsockets

57002
bash	zsh
ksh93 zsh or bash

57028
munin	cacti
you could use something like munin or cacti to monitor the hosts via snmp

57030
rpm	yum
i would either remove the rpms rpm -e rpm and then re-install them or yum update --skip-broken and then try another update

57036
switching	screens
how can i switching between ttys without using screens

57039
filesystems	hfs+
the difference is that osx uses hfs+ as its filesystems debian uses any number of others ext2 ext3 ext4 jffs etc

57058
wan	lan
maybe the lan part not the wan part

57090
bash	tcsh
this system was originally using tcsh shell and i changed it to bash using the command ypchsh to bin sh but it does not load my bash login configuration file and not even .bashrc

57100
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
you can also install ubuntu or linux mint which are very user friendly

57107
ubuntu	linux
select type of linux and version ubuntu

57107
ubuntu	freebsd
i run a variety of systems as vms from ubuntu to freebsd and windows

57110
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
why is there gnome kde xfce lxde e17 etc

57114
ubuntu	debian
personally i would probably run debian with lxde but the ubuntu installer tend to be easier to work with.

57119
bash	zsh
this is largely what gave rise to all the ksh-like clones such as zsh and bash

57120
unix	bsd
bourne was developed as part of the propriety sysv unix while bsd used csh .

57127
wan	lan
okay this one does have stuff jumping further down into lan and wan which makes sense for a home router

57127
icmp	udp
if you scroll up you can see that some udp and icmp stuff is accepted

57127
icmp	tcp
okay that is input from wan not established or related and yes we probably want to reject it and now there are two kinds of rejection here one closing the socket tcp-reset for tcp connection attempts and another one via icmp reply icmp-port-unreachable for icmp messages think ping

57143
debian	linux
for the record on a linux debian wheezy machine here xorg listens on both tmp .x11-unix x0 in the filesystem and tmp .x11-unix x0 on the abstract namespace generally written tmp .x11-unix x0

57181
bash	zsh
bash zsh and ksh93 are the shells that have a disown command

57182
ubuntu	linux
first wubi which you probably mean by installing ubuntu as a windows application doesn t actually install linux as an application

57183
pwd	chdir
it can be changed with the chdir 2 system call and the cd command in a shell and queried using getcwd or pwd in a shell

57186
vmware	virtualbox
you would be better off to install virtualbox or vmware etc. - the performance would be better plus mint is actually relatively lightweight

57198
wan	lan
the rules for access to and from the wan should be different from those for the lan

57199
wan	vlan
if weren t using pppoe the the wan would be accessed over the other vlan likely eth0.1

57222
spaces	delimiter
i have fields delimiter by tabs but within each field there are also spaces

57235
bash	zsh
with ksh93 zsh bash mksh or freebsd sh

57239
folder	directory
how can i copy a subset of files from a directory while preserving the folder structure

57242
tunnel	vpn
you either need to use ssh tunnel or setup a vpn

57243
stdout	stderr
to view the stdout and stderr of a systemd unit use the journalctl command

57243
stdout	stderr
by default stdout and stderr of a systemd unit are sent to syslog

57245
folder	directory
how to set default file permissions for all folder files in a directory

57246
folder	directory
see also how to set default file permissions for all folder files in a directory

57247
umask	mount
you can mount the directory with specific permissions and effective umask using bindfs

57258
wav	ogg
the biggest problem i see is that arecord appears outputs to output a wav by default so you may need to encode it as an ogg

57266
cifs	smb
i ve been using autofs for a number of years and was wondering if there is an alternative to autofs that would handle cifs smb shares in a more interactive way

57269
tunnel	vpn
the tunnel and vpn mentioned is a good work around

57271
put	get
when you get more experience you ll know where on your linux system you seem to put your files but optionally you may also want to consider these

57276
wan	lan
i can access the vms from my lan but when i try to access them from the wan it doesn t work

57277
g++	gcc
i am trying to install a new gcc version g++ version in my home directory on a server i have access too

57277
mpfr	mpc
in summary i downloaded the new tars gcc gmp mpfr mpc extracted them and moved gmp mpfr mpc into the sources directory of gcc ensuring they were then named gmp mpfr mpc

57294
ubuntu	centos
all i m wondering here is why my centos server can t resolve the host name for the drive while my laptop running ubuntu can on the same network

57295
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu sometimes automatically do that but i m not sure if centos does it

57309
wan	lan
it has five ethernet ports one labeled wan and four labeld lan 1 to 4

57311
cinnamon	gnome
i am used to four workspaces in gnome but now that i have cinnamon installed i only have two

57318
ubuntu	mint
as far as i can see since mint is based on ubuntu it will support whatever the standard ubuntu kernel supports

57318
ubuntu	mint
thus mint 14 is based on ubuntu 12.10 s kernel which has pae by default

57324
filesystems	xfs
if extending use the utility for your filesystems to grow it at the end for ext2 3 this would be resize2fs for xfs xfs_growfs etc.

57328
ubuntu	centos
windows and ubuntu connect to it with their guis but i can t get centos 6.3 to do so

57336
ubuntu	linux
currently on ubuntu linux but i noticed this on other os s too

57372
post	get
if i add manually these 2 lines to etc apt sources.list or to a new file in etc apt sources.list.d and then run apt-get update i get an error message -- i m not at work now so i can t provide the exact error but i can edit this post to include the message tomorrow

57375
tunnel	vpn
solution 3 setup a unencrypted tunnel inside the vpn for each site

57383
ethernet	wireless
this is if say i have my laptop connected to my wireless router through both my ethernet card and my wireless card or if i have two ethernet cards both connected to the same router

57383
ethernet	wireless
i can say from experience that in my case my laptop seems to favor the ethernet card eth0 over the wireless eth1--i know that s not a typical name for a wireless interface but that s what i have but i was wondering how does it decide that

57385
folder	directory
i know i can specify a folder to extract to by using -c directory but i am asking about it s default behavior

57430
udp	tcp
related the packet does not match any known flow or socket but the packet is expected because there is an existing socket that predicates it examples of this are data on port 20 when there is an existing ftp session on port 21 or udp data for an existing sip connection on tcp port 5060

57434
debian	mint	debconf	aptitude
because mint is debian derived the easiest way is to update your sources.list to use the new version of the repositories then use apt-get or aptitude to install debconf and apt-get and or aptitude

57436
bsd	aix
by default zsh comes with a lot of completers many of which you may not need - there are bundles for aix bsd cygwin various linux distributions etc and they all get read and installed into the shell

57461
ubuntu	debian
in debian rtl8168f-1.fw is provided by firmware-realtek but in backtrack and ubuntu it s provided by linux-firmware

57462
mpfr	mpc
the server i want to run some code on has older versions of gcc gmp mpc mpfr too installed in the standard locations like the admin is unwilling to update but has allowed me to install a newer version of gcc in my home username directory

57462
mpfr	mpc
i also have gmp mpfr mpc installed in

57467
lan	localhost
since the process listening to localhost 20000 does run on the physical machine with lan ip being 192.168.44.182 i m trying to know how the process ignores the requests to 192.168.44.182

57488
width	height
# v4l2-ctl --set-fmt-video width 800 height 448 pixelformat 1

57490
bash	zsh
why bash doesn t enable it by default is not clear to me given that bash doesn t have any other alternative extended glob syntax of its own like zsh does

57493
bash	zsh
does bash have a way to access arrays similar to zsh something like

57520
bash	zsh
with bash zsh gnu echo or some implementations of ksh on some systems this can be decoded simply by echo -e after replacing all with x

57529
ubuntu	debian
as an example a web application in debian ubuntu may have various suggests dependencies on mysql server packages

57532
google-chrome	firefox
learn to use terminal and linux commands use firebug for firefox and google-chrome s inspector for web front-end debugging use kompozer to fix the mixed html tag indents and almost all visual web stuff and many more

57553
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu this leads to numerous packages - directories can be in multiple packages there

57554
debian	mint
as bahamat said mint is debian derived so you should

57564
stdout	stderr
if you don t have xdpyinfo you can try any of those standard simple x11 utilities that don t display anything on the x server with their stdout and stderr redirected to dev null like above

57571
wan	lan
if your router has an external ip address and your machines on the lan has local addresses 192.168.x.x you need to set up port forwarding from the wan to lan port 22 is for ssh

57573
qt-creator	kdevelop
you might want to try kdevelop s or qt-creator s debugger

57574
logmein	hamachi
if so one option is to use logmein hamachi

57574
logmein	hamachi
logmein hamachi is a virtual networking service that can be set up in

57574
vpn	lan
the client will allow you to create your own private vpn which will exist outside of your lan

57574
logmein	hamachi
logmein hamachi is a paid service however it is free for up to 5 clients

57577
ubuntu	debian
avahi is triggered in host name lookups because of the settings in etc nsswitch.conf for me at least on debian ubuntu like this

57596
stdout	stderr
note if your script might also output to stderr then you should redirect stderr to stdout

57640
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
a salt md5 hash has been generated and written to etc shadow

57640
crypt	hash	crypt	md5	hash	md5
the original value x has been hash in this format stands for md5 see notes on manpage of crypt 3

57677
openbsd	linux
i m similarly trying to install openbsd from a linux box through ssh without vnc and -curses seems to work exactly as vnc would have.

57702
daemons	systemd
however notice that sendmail 8 gets systemd hostname only when it boots so in order for it to notice the changes you ve made you will probably have to restart the sendmail daemons

57708
mouse	keyboard
the primary appeal originally a necessity in the early days of unix computing prior to the widespread adoption of the mouse is completely keyboard driven editing

57751
daemons	systemd
hence disabling it for the regular systemd daemons doesn t make much sense unless you make a ton of other hardening things

57756
spaces	delimiter
the quotes around filenames are not mandatory they just guard any possible spaces in the filenames however they will defintely not help against spaces followed by a comma since that is used as delimiter

57763
ubuntu	debian
apt-get is a package manager utility for debian derived distros such as ubuntu

57783
disk	ram
so to be clear hibernate is like sleep most people use that at least on laptops except the computer does not require any power at all the state is stored on disk not in ram and reloaded by the kernel at boot time

57790
mouse	keyboard
i m using both a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and frankly it s really annoying having to go grab a physical keyboard in order to boot into another kernel version or into windows on another partition

57817
put	get
to get a better idea of what the script is doing put set -x after the #

57845
put	get
a safer alternative is to use mktemp to create a directory safely then put your named pipe inside that directory do an to get rid of it in the end

57849
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
what are the key areas except package management where fedora rhel centos differ from debian ubuntu linux systems

57873
ldd	glibc
first tho for ldd to work you will need the 32-bit loader that comes with the 32-bit glibc without this ldd will call it a non-executable file and tell you nothing

57881
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian
debian ubuntu lts rhel centos sles are geared towards stability longer release cycles and maintenance while ubuntu fedora opensuse give preference to features over stability

57881
ubuntu	opensuse
note that this is in the sense of three-plus nines 99.9x and higher - ubuntu fedora and opensuse are still reasonably stable but the software in the more conservative distributions is more tested due to being older so it s likely to have less bugs

57881
ubuntu	opensuse
ubuntu fedora opensuse use upstart systemd while the other ones stick to sysv-like init at least for now

57894
vmware	virtualbox
i use both virtualbox and vmware

57900
filesystems	btrfs
so there is still the page cache file in between your btrfs filesystems and the actual disk

57918
daemons	systemd
when i now change into a systemd user for example the user for a specific network daemons via sudo or sh i run into the configuration tool because these users have no .zshrc in their home directories

57918
daemons	systemd
it doesn t feel right to place a .zshrc into each and every daemons s home directory which also would be a pain to setup and maintain on a lot of systemd

57920
processors	hyperthreading
i ve got an intel i7 2700k here and i d like to know how i can tell which processors are physical and which are virtual ie hyperthreading

57932
dnf	yum
for example under a redhat centos system you ll install apache via yum or dnf and the configuration files will live beneath etc httpd

57932
ubuntu	debian
under a debian ubuntu system you d install via apt-get and find that the configuration files live beneath etc apache2

57932
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
for example the mail-server installed by default would be sendmail on centos postfix on ubuntu and exim4 on debian

57939
web.py	bottle
web.py bottle etc

57987
hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+
it s possible to mount both apple hfs+ and microsoft ntfs filesystems under linux

58014
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox if you press f12 it brings up developer tools

58025
centos	linux
centos and scientific linux are built upon them

58026
wan	lan
i have ip forwarding enabled but don t know how to route internet requests outside of the lan the vm is hosting to the wan the laptops physical wifi nic is connected to

58042
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
if symbolic links are a problem you can make a copy of a directory tree that doesn t include symbolic links and that uses up negligible space assuming the source tree is on a filesystems that supports hard links so any native unix filesystems or ntfs but not fat

58045
solaris	aix
they tend to be operating in the big server realm not in the embedded realm solaris aix hp-ux sco.

58045
unix	bsd
there are also unix variants licensed under a bsd license

58045
freebsd	netbsd	unix	bsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
there are several unix distributions where the whole core system is provided under a bsd license freebsd openbsd netbsd are the main ones

58074
buildroot	uclibc
i have a filesystem build with buildroot to compile code for a device using a old kernel and uclibc

58079
opera	firefox
firefox opera and rekonq do not

58105
unix	bsd
from there the factor utility was copied to all other variants of unix including commercial unixes and bsd

58121
ubuntu	debian
if you re on ubuntu or any other debian based system you may install rhino from mozilla.org

58121
ubuntu	debian
for interactive work you may prefer nodejs on ubuntu debian sudo apt-get install nodejs

58131
bash	zsh
modern such shells ash bash ksh zsh â conform to the posix shell standard

58131
fish	tcsh
more generally the word â œshellâ can include other command interpreters such as csh tcsh fish â

58206
ubuntu	mint
so if you are referring to appending text to the grub line in ubuntu then the same config should be able to be used for mint and passed to the kernel by yaboot

58223
filesystems	ntfs
target filesystems is case sensitive hfsplus source filesystems are various extfs from linux machines and ntfs

58238
ubuntu	debian

stdout	stderr
if a program runs fork what sets standard streams stdout stdin and stderr

58254
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are inherited from the parent process

58277
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stderr	fflush
it s a logfile simultaneously growing from the same process so i manually fflush stdout and stderr at the end of each item s loop with this segment cutting in mind

58304
put	get
basically put i need to launch a command with a set time limit for it to run before it gets killed and all of the proceeding commands should immediately be run once this command launches the time -limited process in the background and not wait for it get to be killed

58318
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu it s etc network interfaces

58329
hash	md5
its actually a consequence of the design criteria of a cryptographic hash which md5 aimed to be that there not be such a thing

58338
vundle	pathogen
you should install something like pathogen or vundle so you can easily install new syntax files and other scripts

58339
udp	tcp
udp user datagram protocol gives the same information as tcp

58339
udp	tcp
it dumps all hardware addresses network addresses tcp and udp ports

58340

58378
ubuntu	linux
ps this is on ubuntu linux

58431
centos	linux
in centos for example ip_transparent is defined in both linux in.h and bits in.h

58431

xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
most major linux filesystems can be extended while they are mounted btrfs ext2 ext3 ext4 xfs zfs â the main exception is reiserfs

58456
lvm	umount
if you want to extend one of these filesystems on an lvm volume you can extend the volume with lvextend then extend the filesystem to fill the enlarged volume all without deactivating or umount anything

58456
filesystems	btrfs
if you re shrinking the volume there are fewer filesystems that don t require mounting only btrfs and zfs can be shrunk online

58487
ubuntu	debian
there s pavucontrol on debian ubuntu also the package name

58489
filesystems	ntfs
recovering ntfs nothing can fix an ntfs filesystems as well as ms windows native tools

58562
ftp	telnet
i am planning to diy a home use file server with it running a debian base system and some common service programs such as ftp telnet svn samba.

58583
kde	gnome
install an utility like meld there are other utilities for doing this too but i like meld since it doesn t have kde gnome dependencies and use it for visually diffing merging the files

58603
bazaar	git
three common dvcs are bazaar git and mercurial

58635
post	get
i wouldn t post this here normally but i m in a real hurry to get this up and running or i m in a big pickle

58705
hfs	bootcamp
to be able to do this i needed to start over and delete the bootcamp partition again and resized the master hfs volume to its max of 768 as i already did in step 3-4

58705
hfs	bootcamp
i already knew that bootcamp requires a single os x hfs partitioned disk so he can manage the partition

58705
hfs	bootcamp
i was amazed with this error cause i knew that i already removed the last bootcamp partition and resized the main hfs partition to its maximum

58724
daemons	systemd
install a separate ssh daemons - either another copy of openssh or dropbear - into the systemd possibly into opt or run it on a different port

58728
stdout	stderr
well you can spawn several processes in your shell in the background and then if they all use their stdout or stderr you can get lots of information intermingled in the console - and by intermingled i mean it can possibly even mix data from several processes in the middle of a line

58730
google-chrome	firefox
this applies to google-chrome and firefox

58737
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to install another linux distro besides ubuntu

58760
folder	directory
it has it s own database as well in one of your home folder s hidden directory that could be quite big.

58760
folder	directory
to answer your question though the process is indexing every standard dlna folder in your home directory if they exist pictures videos music and possibly others

58799
folder	directory
i ve found a pretty reliable way of doing this is to just create sym-links from the old media directory to your new home folder

58814
freebsd	netbsd
for gnu gzip 1.6 or above freebsd and derivatives or recent versions of netbsd see don_cristi s answer

58847
rpm	yum
you can use yum info packagename or if it installed then use rpm --version packagename

58847
dpkg	aptitude
you can use aptitude show pkgname or dpkg --version pkgname

58872
daemons	systemd
running some linux servers with single or just a few vital systemd service daemons i would like to adjust the oom killer for those daemonized processes in case something odd happens

58875
ubuntu	debian
the first is running debian the second running ubuntu

58875
ubuntu	debian
on the debian machine the program uses at most 8 cores while on the ubuntu machine the program uses all 16 cores

58879
spaces	delimiter
in all cases do not put filenames in a single variable as you cannot use spaces as a delimiter

58885
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
usually i never had problems accessing either home folder on sda2 i ve had elementary ubuntu debian mint antix crunchbang and others so i would just keep my files in chakrahome folder linking them to the other system

58892
ubuntu	debian
it is by design - ubuntu is basically debian unstable

58892
opensuse	debian
if you need the cutting and bleeding edge you may want to try debian experimental or a rolling release distro like slackware opensuse tumbleweed arch linux.

58900
ubuntu	mint	google-chrome	firefox
just to make this concrete let s say - if it s relevant - that i m asking in the context of firefox google-chrome gedit and eclipse on a recent version of either mint what i use at home or ubuntu what i use at work

58902
rsa	dsa
by default it uses .ssh id_rsa for the identityfile for rsa identities and .ssh id_dsa for dsa identities so if you don t want to change your .ssh config you can just rename the file to that name

58903
width	height
etc down to 041 right now will be more in the future - and these scripts them selves use some cursor control to print a progress bar and other status information and get the width and height of the terminal from tput cols and tput lines respectively

58912
debian	linux
so i just rented a dedicated server running debian and i know nothing about linux

58917
filesystems	fat
its description maintains that it is needed for using a fat or joliet cd-rom filesystems

for instance this will not be applicable on a canon camera but will work on any solaris bsd and most linux dists

58935
sudoers	visudo
this can be configured in a etc sudoers file like this edit using visudo

58945

is it possible to have a filesystems fat32 ntfs to exist without having uuids

59003
ubuntu	linux
and my local password is an ordinary linux password of my laptop and the remote machine is an ubuntu box 11.10 joined to an active directory domain via likewise-open

59017
debian	linux
linux debian squeeze 6.0.6 2.6.32-5-amd64 is supplied with quite an old 02.100.03.00 version of the mpt2sas driver

59037
versioning	upgrade
either upgrade the virtualbox to 4.2.6 or maybe you are missing the virtualbox extensions for your installed versioning

59055
spaces	linefeed
note that the 0a is just linefeed newline character and i doubt you want that so i took the liberty of replacing it with a spaces above

59058
jobs	cron
i disabled all my cron jobs by putting a # in front of them

59058
jobs	cron
i don t have any cron jobs

59059

hardware devices are rarely game-specific you can plug in a midi keyboard on a game port use a joystick to control a physical object â

59063
heredoc	herestring
a heredoc is faster than a herestring

59063
bash	zsh
is a ksh93 bash zsh extension which is less well-known than echo â | or

59067
debian	linux
on a linux debian 2.6.32-5-amd64 #1 smp installation where loading a kernel module mpt2sas is desired to be delayed to be loaded after starting sshd and users can remotely login the mpt2sas module was disabled from loading in single user boot by

59068
put	get
if the program recognizes this control key you get back a shell prompt and since the program becomes a background job you can easily kill it with kill which sends a signal to the job that has last been put into the background

59084
bash	zsh
one half of the answer is to use preexec i use zsh but the net is full of bash preexec tricks and use ldd to detect libx11 and what else

59107
mouse	keyboard
however in that case the vnc server is provided by the host which serves the video memory keyboard and mouse of the guest but has no access to the guest s clipboard which is something internal to the desktop environment inside the guest

59130
sudo	passwd
now reboot login to your account and change the root account passwd using sudo passwd root

59137
installation	upgrade
however after my kernel was forcefully upgrade for me today i had to also upgrade my virtualbox installation from virtualbox-4.1-4.1.8_75467_fedora16-1.i686.rpm to virtualbox-4.2-4.2.6_82870_fedora16-1.i686.rpm and after doing so found myself unable to use arrow keys control keys page-up page-down etc in my rdesktop-vrdp vm window

59138
installation	upgrade
as it turns out rdesktop-vrdp is bundled within the virtualbox installation so even though it was working before the upgrade it has stopped working

59139
gentoo	linux
on gentoo what the first character in a linux file permissions drwxrwxrwx means

59155
ubuntu	linux
my institution has a cluster running ubuntu linux

59156
ubuntu	centos
i m not familiar with deploying virtual ubuntu servers but i ve deployed virtual centos servers using a kickstart script from a cobbler web server

59157
stdout	stderr
now suppose i accidentally forgot to append the output redirection part to the command or and my background process is already running for a while can i still change to where stdout and stderr are being written to

59157
stdout	stderr
forgot to redirect stderr to stdout

59162
jobs	cron
debian s cron like many other modern variants read jobs in files under directories called etc cron.d etc cron.hourly etc. in addition to the traditional etc crontab

59176
wan	lan
x in general is good for lan but not wan connections

59183
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
i ll use awesomewm as my main de but without installing any actual de like kde gnome xfce etc i have to setup too many basic stuff like mouse cursor themes gtk qt theme engines and themes clipboard manager sound manager screen manager like lxrandr arandr etc. auto-mounter .

59189
kde	gnome
as for what you want to do but avoiding the large des kde gnome you can go with

59199
mouse	keyboard
each mouse is internally paired with a keyboard by the os to coordinate the relationship of a separate user with their mouse and keyboard

59199
mouse	keyboard
each mouse keyboard cursor is associated with a separate human being that we will call a user does not have to be a system user but it can

59199
mouse	keyboard
when a user has focus for an application the os channels that user s mouse and keyboard as the input controls for that application

59223
mouse	keyboard
multiple mouse keyboard in linux which is a blog post

59233
bash	zsh
bash or zsh are all welcomed

59251
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and debian you should be able to install them via apt install gtk3-engines-xfce gtk2-engines-xfce

59253
bash	zsh
this applies in both bash and zsh in the default configuration i don t guarantee that there aren t exotic combinations of options in zsh that will make it react differently and of course this assumes the default keybindings

59264
freebsd	solaris
does freebsd support network virtualization like solaris crossbow

59266
filesystems	xfs
important thing to note is that on some filesystems this does not necessarily need to reflect the free space it is the available space though since the fs can do preallocations when it thinks it s a good idea for example xfs may do this when you start creating a big file - it will allocate additional space to ensure the file is less scattered and doesn t spend too much time with allocations when it will need to write the actual data to disk

59273
openssl	libcrypto
for openssl at least libcrypto on top of libssl

59276
folder	directory
how does one extract a specific folder from a zipped archive to a given directory

59287
ubuntu	debian
the advantage is that this piece of software is lightweight well-tested and probably available by your package management already debian ubuntu package nagios-plugins-basic

59296
ubuntu	debian
for your other question debian and probably ubuntu have etc x11 xsession.d which for example loads .xresources

59306
vmware	virtualbox
with vmware to do these type of actions in a unix environment like for virtualbox

59318
vmware	esx
connect to vmware s esx esxi virtual center virtual server hosts

59347
kde	gnome
i installed xubuntu i was happy with xfce4 interface but then i decided to try out the other ones so i installed kde and gnome just so i get to know which one is best for me

59347
xfce	kde
i can still choose xfce interface when logging a user but at the login screen i m stuck with kde how do i change that without having to unistall kde

59360
bash	zsh
it seems very cool and slick and the fact that the current working directory and actual command line are on different lines is nice but at the same time i m noticing that zsh can be a bit slower than bash especially when printing text to the screen

59378
stdout	stderr	jobs	cron
stdout and stderr in cron jobs are redirected system mail

59392
sudo	passwd
the end goal of this is to set these two shell scripts to run as keyboard shortcuts so i need to figure out how to set setpci to be able to run without a passwd with sudo

59409
versioning	upgrade
the packaged versioning of libtorrent from the distributive s repository had some funny behaviour complaining on boost dependences so i ve decided to upgrade

59409
ubuntu	debian
the same situation is on both of my debian boxes yet ubuntu box is fine

59420
ubuntu	debian
i personally use dirvish.org it is a disk based file backup that uses rsync over ssh and it is in ubuntu repositories so quite likely in debian s too

59425
put	get
you get the benefit of more diverse experiences but you lose the trust that you may but then again may not put in a single author and information is often spread over more pages and less easy to get at offline

59427
daemons	systemd
public user data data accessed by various services running on the systemd - usually mail queues data served by http daemons

59427
filesystems	xfs
regarding the system-wide back-up apart from options mentioned in the other answers if your installation be it a virtualised guest or the vps host lives on a separate filesystems you can either use the filesystems s native backup snapshot capability xfs has this feature or mount it read-only and dump its containing device which might be dangerous though

59429
min	max	min	median	median	max
see is there a way to get the min max median and average of a list of numbers in a single command

59431
bash	zsh
note that zsh cannot emulate all bash features all you can do is get a bit closer to make split the value and expand wildcards and make arrays 0-based

59438
debian	linux
not all linux systems have sudo installed per default like for example debian

59465
octal	decimal
with ctrl-v the decimal octal or hexadecimal value of a character can be

59485
freebsd	linux
many companies were not comfortable getting involved with freebsd because they were unsure of the outcome and many jumped onto linux

59485
freebsd	linux
at one time torvalds had said that if freebsd had been available when he was first interested he never would have created linux

59498
redhat	fedora
my steps are for a fedora redhat distro

59512
kde	gnome
you can also run kde packages under gnome unity enlightenment and vice-versa

59513
kde	gnome
i have fedora 16 with gnome and kde

59513
kde	gnome
i use kde 99 of the time but need to go to gnome periodically because some apps have bugs running certain scenarios in kde notably eclipse trying to create a new workspace

59513
kde	gnome
for that i need to go to gnome once finished go back to kde

59550
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the next versioning wheezy

59567
bash	tcsh
the default user shell in macos x is no longer tcsh but bash now

59567
bash	zsh
macos x s one used to be zsh and is now bash

59585
fat	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs
none of the ext s work on mac or windows hfs+ doesn t work on windows or well on linux ntfs is read-only on mac and fat sucks on all oses

59602
put	get
i have tried to feed a command to db2 with the -v option which is supposed to play the command back to the screen as well as the results of the command and put that in a variable but then i actually don t get the command outputted to the screen

59602
cat	tee
this will output to the screen for my high level tee but now i have an extra file on the file system i have to worry about cleaning up afterwards though i can egrep and cat it with no issues

59608
bash	zsh
you need to store the string in a variable and store the intermediate result in a variable as well you can t directly chain the expansions you can in zsh but not in bash

59618
udp	tcp
test with iperf both tcp and udp

59627
disk	ram
if you can afford some ram you can set up a ram disk and let your logs go there

59627
disk	ram
this is not exactly what you want but it should fix your problem as ram i o won t slow down your disk

59645
stdout	stderr
an example of a program not properly daemonizing is when it doesn t close stdout and stderr and continues to write data to those locations

59663
ubuntu	linux
i think it is very important to understand that android is only a linux system underneath everything you see on a phone has not much in common with a linux system like ubuntu or fedora you can t just run a command as root with most stock android images installed on real hardware

59669
stdout	stderr
this is also true for just to make sure i do not miss something on stdout or stderr

59670
pbx	ivr	asterisk	pbx	asterisk	ivr
asterisk provides all the functionality expected in a pbx such as voice-mail interactive voice recordings ivr call forwarding and conferencing

59680
unix	bsd
memory in a unix or linux or bsd process is a very long line starting at about 0x400000 and ending at about 0x7fffffffffff on x86_64 cpus

59680
puts	gets
every time a function gets called the stack of function activatio records grows down the process code puts function arguments and a return address on the stack of activatio records and decrements the stack pointer a special cpu register used to keep track of where in the address space of the stack the process current variables values reside

59684
cpu	processors
i m looking for a cpu monitoring tool that could monitor the different processors in my machine and also has a gui similar to the ubuntu monitoring tool

59685
folder	directory
i am using sshfs to mount a folder with some python projects over ssh to my directory

59698
profiling	debugging
and cflags_gcov is for debugging and profiling

59699
disk	ram
when you write to tmp in solaris only - you are writing to ram not to disk

59706
debian	linux
my first and last experience with ext4 on debian linux squeeze older version 6.0.0 x64 was with 2x500gb harddrives without raid

59708
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu install it with

59710
ubuntu	linux
for starting with linux in a vm i recommend ubuntu

59710
ubuntu	debian
for a server forget ubuntu server and use debian instead

59710
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu derives from debian

59710
ubuntu	debian
so if your debian has any problems you can solve them on the ubuntu forums which is a big advantage

59710
ubuntu	debian
when comparing debian and ubuntu server ubuntu server boots slower later

59710
ubuntu	debian
consumption of ram was much bigger on ubuntu server when comparing it to debian

59710
ubuntu	debian
also if you do a clean install of ubuntu server it will install two to three hundred packages while debian only installs 50 to 90

59710
ubuntu	debian
ordinary ubuntu installs about 1300 packages and ordinary desktop debian installs 900 to 1100 packages

59710
ubuntu	debian
i m not saying not to use ubuntu at all but for servers i d favor debian even if you re new

59710
ubuntu	debian
on desktops i had problems with debian while apt installations from the web were working without a problem on ubuntu

59710
ubuntu	debian
if you hate the slow speed of ubuntu but don t want to use debian use lubuntu

59710
vmware	virtualbox
i ran a few tests to check cpu power under virtualbox kvm vmware server 1 and vmware server 2

59710
vmware	virtualbox
the fastest is kvm then virtualbox vmware server 2 vmware server 1 and finally qemu

59710
vmware	virtualbox
there might be a performance difference between vmware server 2 and virtualbox but options for settings are pretty low for me and when choosing between virtualbox or vmware i would take virtualbox

59720
stdout	stderr
0 should trigger the mailing of stdout stderr

59723
debian	linux
we are speaking about software linux raid on debian squeeze

59732
switching	screens
switching to full screens mode in firefox makes its menus and toolbars disappear but the window decorations remain and the window remains the same size

59736
versioning	upgrade
if you are running your own versioning you will have to backport the fix yourself or upgrade to a newer versioning

59738
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu debian as root

59740
redhat	fedora
when i read through the differences between cent opensuse and fedora they frequently say that cent and redhat are binary compatible

59740
ubuntu	debian
my experience has been debian ubuntu that regardless of distro binary files will run and packages are compatible if they use the same package manager

59742
centos	linux
centos 5 and 6 are built from publicly available open source srpms provided by a prominent north american enterprise linux vendor often referred to as upstream or the upstream vendor tuv

59742
centos	linux
centos is designed for people who need an enterprise class os without the cost or support of the prominent north american enterprise linux vendor

59742
centos	linux
neither the centos project we who build centos nor any version of centos is affiliated with produced by or supported by the prominent north american enterprise linux vendor

59743
kde	gnome
in kde i could specify a different one otherwise it would go for the default gnome theme

59746
redhat	fedora
fedora - bleeding edge os built by the fedora project redhat sponsored community proj.

59746
redhat	fedora	opensuse	centos
note rpm isn t a redhat only technology opensuse uses rpms as well and these are not necessarily compatible with rpms built for one of the 3 redhat based distros rhel centos or fedora

59771
debian	linux
today not only debian many other linux distros now also support arm architecture

59793
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
zsh and fish do the same while ksh and tcsh mumble something about job control and then keel over which is a bit better but not much

59821
mouse	keyboard
if you want to use 3d software such as blender you need a proper mouse with wheel and at least 3 buttons -- and keyboard with keypad is a big plus

59829
centos	linux
without more information i can only offer you how i ve done this on centos fedora linux distros

59838
mouse	keyboard
for example as i am not that much of a mouse or gui person i prefer media players that can be started with a file and just show the file with keyboard shortcuts rather than a gui player with lots of buttons and controls to use with the mouse

59841
sudoers	passwd
i know there is an option where i can simply put the user that phing is using inside sudoers and then not prompt for passwd but for security reasons that is not ideal

59843
sudo	passwd
this line adds the user phing to a group on which sudo doesn t lay down path and passwd requirements

59854
mtu	icmp	icmp	udp	udp	mtu
in a case i can use only udp and icmp protocols how can i discover in bytes the path mtu for packet transfer from my computer to a destination ip

59864
filesystems	xfs
the underlying filesystems is xfs

59868
icmp	udp
linux traceroute uses udp as a default if you believe your luck is better with icmp try also -i

59872
rpm	yum
in the case of 1 then install it if you are using a distro based on rpm then you might have yum

59873
jobs	cron
i was actually exploring cron jobs and had set a cron job to echo a hello world message every minute from user1 logged into tty2 directed to tty5 where user2 is logged in but user2 never got the echoed messages

59880
debian	linux
the main reason that debian has not moved on to a new init system such as upstart or systemd is that they both use linux specific features

59883
bash	zsh
i have been slowly migrating from bash to zsh and have got to the point where everything i have moved across is working well with one exception

59899
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
now the sudoers file will parse and i can run the mount command with sudo without being asked for a passwd

59909
ubuntu	debian
ps you may want to consider switching slave box os to debian ubuntu so system knowledge will apply to both machines

59929
ubuntu	linux
is it linux flavor specific but ubuntu has both

59933
tunnel	vpn
to test you can from your remote pc connect to the ubuntu via vpn and then ssh to the ubuntu once connected via the vpn and in that ssh session setup a reverse port forwarding localhost 8181 8181 this will forward everything coming to port 8181 on the ubuntu to go via the tunnel so the ssh needs to be up to the pc on port 8181

59961
daemons	systemd
systemd administration commands and daemons

59968
xfce	gnome
xfce is lighter weight than gnome

59968
ubuntu	linux
puppy linux is lighter weight than ubuntu

59969
stdout	stderr
in most cases the controlling process is the shell that is initially started in the terminal and its controlling terminal is the one that its stdin stdout and stderr are connected to

59969
bash	zsh
some shells ksh bash zsh have a disown builtin to tell the shell not to send a sighup to a particular job

59970
mouse	keyboard
to do the corresponding with the keyboard change the parameter in grep mouse

59979
bash	zsh
zsh arrays are numbered from 1 not from 0 like in bash and ksh so must be written

59979
bash	zsh
alternatively tell zsh to behave in a way that s more compatible with ksh and bash put emulate -l ksh at the beginning of the function

59979
bash	zsh
if you want to keep a file that s readable by both bash and zsh

59983
centos	linux
the xfs driver in newer linux kernels supports the same fs_ioc_setflags ioctl as ext 234 to control flags such as append-only but you may be running an older kernel where it doesn t centos

60000
bionic	libc
i look into android bionic libc syscalls.txt file and msgget is not there

60000
bionic	libc
but when i look into android bionic libc kernel arch-arm asm unistd.h file i can find msgget there

60007
ubuntu	mint
i use mint 14 a clone of ubuntu 12.10 quantal

60020
qmail	exim
alternatives include exim postfix qmail etc

60028
ubuntu	debian
cdctl 0.15-1 x64 build for debian ubuntu

60049
zsh	subshell	bash	zsh	bash	subshell
bash since version 4.4 now supports local - like in the almquist shell to make options local to the function similar to set -o localoptions in zsh so you could avoid the subshell by doing

60050
ubuntu	linux
my linux version is ubuntu

60064
titlebar	window
it works well except chromium window can be dragged using it s titlebar even if it s maximized

60097
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	debian	macports	homebrew
fedora freebsd os x homebrew macports ubuntu debian and others all use different packaging systems for binary and source distribution

60114
folder	directory
this is running on a debian headless server and i did have it working until i moved the folder out of my home directory and into one of their own

60122
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
there are several software packages that i need to synchronize between a linux mint installation and an ubuntu installation

60122
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu already provides a software synchronization service but it would be even better if software packages could be synchronized between multiple linux distributions

60126
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade to a newer versioning of ubuntu and chrome should install smoothly from google s web site

60140
debian	linux
i m trying to run debian linux on a nokia ip710 firewall but i can t get it to boot correctly kernel panic every time

60148
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
all is not lost if you need gui access to the vms as long as you re using a workstation class vm system like parallels workstation desktop vmware workstation fusion or virtualbox

60161
rtsp	rtmp
you can give http rtsp rtmp input to ffmpeg and it would compress it

60163
awk	ksh
solution can be with ksh or perl one liner sed awk etc

60167
sudo	chgrp
sudo chgrp -r assetgroup assets

60171
sorting	filtering
you might also want to add some grep to filtering out lines not containing ip addresses before you start sorting

60176
umask	chmod
this says with what permissions new files are created.again see man umask on linux unix system the idea is that whatever bits you set in umask the same notation as for chmod explained above are excluded from the permissions on a newly created files - for example if you set your umask to 0023 your files will be created with all permissions for you not writeable for your default group and not writeable neither executable by anybody else

60181
redhat	fedora
i was a bit surprised that when i got a new fedora machine at work it used to be redhat enterprise linux rhel the first time it started up it asked me to do an update and i naturally said yes and for anything it asked i just used the default answer usually replying yes by pressing enter

60184
debian	linux
moreover many linux distribution provide 64bits kernels to be used with a 32bit userland if you are referring to pc then check how debian provide amd64 kernel series for i386 32bit architecture as well

60199
disk	ram
i guess you should increase ram disk size in your kernel

60224
fflush	gets
since ram gets fflush out after reboots i have 12gb of ram available on my system and i too have pondered about this question before

60257
bash	zsh
if you have a zsh solution but no bash solution please share as well

60266
ftp	telnet
also for experimenting with ftp it s more comfortable to have the login process handled by the ftp client and use literal commands afterwards compared to using telnet netcat only

60271
rpm	yum
if yum is not configured install it by using rpm command

60271
filesystems	ntfs
fs-type - your filesystems type ex ntfs-3g if u give ntfs may be it is not work

60287
ubuntu	debian
this should be possible with recent versions of debian â wheezy or ubuntu â 11.10 oneiric thanks to multiarch support

60287
ubuntu	debian
read the multiarch howto for how to set up your system it s for debian but it should apply to setting things up manually on ubuntu as well

60292
capitalize	uppercase
even in those cases i think there are strong tendencies to actually write html tags in lowercase and the sql query semantics in uppercase and parameters capitalize

60312
filesystems	fat
by using the fat vfat most likely filesystems you get good performance and compatibility between both operating systems

60312
wan	lan
thus you could use this on the lan or the wan

60335
ubuntu	debian
there is a little part of a script i wrote to create and install live usb key dual boot ubuntu - debian

60350
cifs	smb
whether a locally-housed server or a push of the data into the cloud using a network filesystem probably smb cifs for windows compatibility will ease the migration problems

60386
redhat	fedora
you can check this link for installation steps it includes fedora as well as redhat and centos

60389
bash	zsh
assuming a shell with support for process substitution like ksh zsh or bash

60394
debian	linux
after being a long-time debian linux user i decided to give suse a try

60397
opensuse	linux
i didn t lock the screen on my opensuse linux and let my girlfriend do all evil things when i was sleeping

60399
debian	linux
debian was leaning in that direction too but they didn t go as far because there was a stronger feeling that linux was for enthusiasts when debian started

60421
disk	ram
additionally if the board only have 256m of ram the os may start swapping when creating 100m ram disk file

60428
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
i even tried to install other distros of linux ubuntu 12.10 opensuse 12.2 and both gave me the same problem exactly

60447
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	opensuse	centos
i have installed centos 6.3 opensuse 12.1 and ubuntu 12.04 on vmware workstation 9

60449
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu debian you could try this set of instructions on using an http proxy with apt-get if you know you have an http proxy

60455
debian	linux
i use debian linux squeeze x64 now on gigabyte 970a-ds3

60457
innodb	myisam
i have about 60 mysql databases some of them myisam some of them innodb

60470
bash	zsh
you don t actually need to use find here assuming you re running a reasonably recent shell ksh93 bash â 4.0 or zsh

60480
debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
i can t speak for debian but on my asus eee 901 linux model i was able to install opensuse 11.1 and 11.2 without any problems or needed any extra options for the ssd

60519
cvs	svn
opinions on the choice between these two vary mercurial is a bit more similar to the older cvs and svn than git is and arguably also has a better learning curve whikle git is claimed to be more feature rich

60539
kerberos	ldap
there s a reference on common errors with kerberos gssapi and sasl authentication using ldap that might be helpful once the correct options are picked

60570
debian	linux
i have a binary that runs on my debian squeeze system but then it doesn t do anything on my debian wheezy kernel linux 3.2.0-4-amd64 system

60576
debian	linux
they ran 24 7 for 2.5 years as far as i know of debian linux over pxe without an sdcard or usb storage a usb keyboard without a single issue

60631
sudoers	visudo
to etc sudoers via visudo

60631
sudo	passwd
now every user can either authenticate to sudo via a forwarded or local ssh agent or their passwd

60637
debian	linux
included patches 1-762 on debian gnu linux with locale set to

60645
installation	upgrade
i recently upgrade my system from mint12 to mint14 and as i started my eclipse installation i realized that i need to install svn again

60664
rpm	yum
yum update also update centos-release rpm which contains etc centos-release

60701
hash	md5
is there another way to generate an md5 hash without a trailing newline or space

60722
filesystems	ntfs
i thought ntfs windows filesystems is a filesystems

60722
centos	linux
which one i should use for linux centos if i want to host some stuff

60748
sudo	passwd
instead of disabling sudo passwd altogether i m thinking it would be nice if gnome-keyring or some similar keyring software could be used to rememeber the passwd

60790
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade the process will get rid of old versioning of what is installed automatically

60790
rpm	yum
if space is tight you might want to look at yum installed and get rid of stuff you don t use be careful yum info or rpm -qi tells you what the package is all about

60790
rpm	yum
take a look at the documentation for yum and rpm

60801
uniq	grep
this should at least be better than individual grep as you only process b thrice remove other columns sort and uniq and then i suppose the join will only read each file once as it requires the inputs to be sorted

60805
ubuntu	centos
places on ubuntu 11.04 + seems to have these features but not on centos 6.3

60819
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is probably the only reasonable option see also filesystems compatible with all oses

60819
vmware	virtualbox
there are several virtualisation solutions kvm virtualbox xen vmware

60825
ubuntu	debian
users of debian ubuntu and derivatives change rename to rename.ul or change to rename s r .

60848
folder	directory
the drwx------ on your home directory is preventing other users from traversing it seeing the downloads folder and its contents

60855
hash	md5
it is possible to find a file that has a given md5 hash but it is not possible to produce such a file from the hash itself

60871
filesystems	fat
i have partitioned the cf device into a small fat partition where the kernel image resides as well as syslinux boot configuration and an ext3 filesystems where i have decompressed the root filesystems generated by buildroot to

60872
debian	mint	debian	linux
the weird part is that i ve tried the scanner in two virtual machines w7 and linux mint 14 hosted in the debian testing and works fine in both vm s

60886
hash	md5
a unique md5 hash can be produced by an infinite number of files as there is only 2 128 unique hash but there are infinite files of infinite length theoretically

60886
hash	md5
to create a file from an md5 hash would take a large amount of effort

60886
hash	md5
you would have create a sequence of unique files and generate the md5 hash for each one until you found a match

60886
hash	md5
there are several known flaws with md5 and it is possible to create slightly different files for the same hash

60893
ubuntu	centos
for now i build my own img for ubuntu guest debootstrap my host is a ubuntu 12.04.1lts but i don t know how to make for a centos is possible build centos from ubuntu

60942
postfix	dovecot
i have just outfitted a basic server ubuntu 12.04 lts precise pangolin and have installed postfix and dovecot based on the ubuntu manuals

60944
cinnamon	gnome
as i don t have gnome shell or cinnamon installed i cannot be of direct help as accessing the source could would be much practical since it s rather easy adding such a rudimentary extension with javascript

60997
folder	directory
it s my mounted directory that i want to restore folder ostani

61024
post	put
put another way how many bits of entropy would i need in my passphrase to safely post my .gpg directory on the web

61031
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
the advantage is that vi usually preinstalled in enterprise unix like aix or solaris

61037
put	get
but when i put the mouse at the lower right corner to grab the corner point it is trial and error to get the mouse to become at an angle so i can resize the terminal in an arbitrary direction this way

61038
vim	emacs
the text editing facilities of vim are second to none -- other than emacs i ve never seen or heard of a piece of software that comes close

61050
ubuntu	linux
and now i am going to setup and admin a web server in ubuntu linux distribution

61065
subnet	packets
you may ping 172.16.2.0 24 subnet from to 172.16.1.1 while your firewall don t include ip based rules and you allow all traffic from both eth1 and eth2 to eth0 non ip based including such redirect and back packets

61065
subnet	packets
a good way is to explicitely drop all packets related to local subnet ip

61097
ubuntu	debian
i have checked this both on ubuntu and debian systems

61098
ubuntu	debian
i went for debian crunchbag looked nice but too big step for me from ubuntu

61099
debian	linux
would you recommend me for small debian linux with small apache small mysql and primary datastore with sw raid 5 just 32bit debian or rather 64bit and why

61102
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
you could start using debian which isn t much more complicated than ubuntu or arch linux which is more difficult but will be a good experience

61108
ubuntu	debian
like ubuntu it is based on debian however it uses the openbox window manager and in turn is significantly lighter on resources

61109
x86	64bit
for example on the intel x86 64bit architecture linux cannot use more than 64 tb of physical memory since version 2.6.30 but it was 16 tb just before

61116
ubuntu	linux
on an ubuntu linux i have a directory with the setuid bit set drwsr-xr-x which i want to unset

61125
debian	linux
in general you d either create a qemu image using qemu-img fetch some distribution s installation media and use qemu with the installation medium to prepare the image this page explains the process for debian gnu linux or use an image prepared by someone else

61153
disk	ram
running pivot_root and chroot so after operation the ramdisk will become an unused ram disk mounted at initrd

61197
debian	linux
our files are stored in debian linux accessed by windows using samba so to avoid running some dodgy windows app to find long path names i d prefer to find them using a linux command

61224
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian	opensuse	mint
support for the most popular distributions ubuntu linux mint debian fedora opensuse

61224
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	kde	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
support for the most popuar desktop environments unity mate gnome shell cinnamon kde 4 xfce

61241
switching	screens
the bottom panel that always shows below the screens which shows an icon for each instance of application that is open is a very handy item as it allows one to switching from one app to another very quickly

61254
debian	linux
on my system linux 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.35-2 x86_64 gnu linux it s

61258
ia-32	x86
processors this is termed x86 ia-32 or i386-architecture depending

61264
jobs	cron
i am familiar with cron jobs

61272
jobs	cron
cron jobs will execute any time there is a match condition on the time spec

61279
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
under linux or freebsd netbsd macos x fuse comes to mind it already features some archive file systems that you should have a look at

61290
bash	zsh
i set this up when using bash and got it to work and then switched to zsh

61290
bash	zsh
it still worked but as for word movement with the emacs keybindings it seems zsh and bash are somewhat different the closest i got to emacs behaviour i got with this patch

61295
redhat	fedora
both of these will already be installed on a redhat or fedora system

61318
redhat	fedora
i can choose between ubuntu redhat and fedora or derivatives of these distros

61319
switching	screens
my keyboard switching for ejecting the cdrom does not work though it displays an eject button on the screens

61338
put	get
i can t seem to get any further than this i followed the steps earlier in the thread and put the .fw files in the firmware folders but still get above errors

61349
debian	linux
deb http favorite-cran-mirror bin linux debian squeeze-cran

61349
debian	linux
deb-src http favorite-cran-mirror bin linux debian squeeze-cran

61363
udp	tcp
your port scan happened while a tcp udp session was in progress and ended before the sequential netstat s

61372
sudo	passwd
like the comments in this answer suggest just edit the file etc shadow as root run sudo nano etc shadow in a terminal and replace the hashed passwd in postgres s line with

61373
zsh	subshell
if you don t want to be notified of the completion of a job as scott says you can start it as a job of a subshell or disown it using the disown command or with zsh start it as but note that it means you can t put it back in foreground or kill it using a job number

61415
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i have many linux systems in my company ubuntu 11.04 11.10 12.10 and debian 5 and 6

61417
sysv	systemd
if you are familiar with the concept of runlevels from sysv style init stuff multi-user is the systemd equivalent of runlevel 3 which is a multi-user systemd that boots to a console not a gui

61420
filesystems	fat
for other filesystems types fat the call chain may vary due to lack of inodes permission bits and such

61445
tunnel	vpn
aside from hunting down every single ports opened required by nfs consider setting up a vpn tunnel between your firewall since you are in control of both ends

61445
tunnel	vpn
i think vpn tunnel is really your best choice if not the only choice

61458
ubuntu	debian
if you have a lot of debian ubuntu systems in your company you will probably want to do this anyway

61458
post	get
they are very simple scripts and when i get the time i ll post them to github

61480
cinnamon	gnome
i had the same problem today but more towards the gnome cinnamon side of things

61486
versioning	upgrade
there will be no need to perform a major versioning upgrade to qt5 in the foreseeable future

61491
kde	gnome
another line of development mandrake today mandriva after merging with the mandrake offshot conectiva was derived from red hat mostly diverged by emphasizing kde instead of gnome as a default desktop environment

61491
redhat	fedora
the fedora project was born as a collection of packages for redhat and later took over the fedora distribution when redhat enterprise linux became a separate distribution

61491
centos	linux
then there are distributions like centos that take the sources for rhel and recompile them replacing the red hat logos and other branding and distribute the results without the need for a maintenance contract and scientific linux who do essentially the same as centos but add some packages for use at fermilab cern and others

61491
debian	linux	kde	gnome
on the other hand all distributions are built on the same basic infrastructure of open source software the linux kernel even with debian s bsd-kernel based line and such gcc glibc x.org gnome kde ... so there is an overarching commonality there

61492
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
so i s recommend going with one of the mainstream distributions debian ubuntu fedora opensuse

61492
versioning	upgrade
consider their average lifespan for a versioning short means you get new bling soon but also that you have to upgrade often not as scary as it used to be anymore but still

61497
sudo	chgrp
# sudo chgrp -r nasser home backup

61497
chown	sudo
# sudo chown -r nasser home backup

61503
tunnel	vpn
how does a script look like that sends all traffic to 10.10.3.1 or exchange.server.de through the vpn tunnel and the rest of the traffic uses the default route that existed before the vpn was established

61511
tunnel	vpn
if you do not have access to the vpn concentrator then you will not be able to change what does and what doesnt go through the tunnel

61519
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
i am fairly comfortable with linux and have played around a little with freebsd and solaris in the past

61519
unix	bsd
original uc berkeley bsd unix

61519
unix	bsd
for emotional reasons i may prefer to install some version of the original uc berkeley bsd 1980s bill joy marshall kirk mckusick era but will go with whichever is easier to install the machine is newer production started 1991 than the original bsd unix versions

61519
unix	bsd
i would call it nostalgia except i never did use the original bsd unix

61519
unix	bsd
i hope to use the system to explore bsd unix and possibly at t unix further and do some c programming on it

61520
ubuntu	debian
from my ubuntu i want to create a bootable debian usb

61529
openbsd	netbsd
finally both of these ports have mailing lists netbsd s is pretty active openbsd s not so much

61538
dpkg	apt
is there any way dpkg apt

61540
udp	tcp
to show the tcp udp sockets on which a running program which contains the string sshd is listening to

61554
ubuntu	linux
just don t take the fact that the linux kernel is used to mean it is anything like ubuntu anymore than android which also uses the linux kernel is

61557
ubuntu	linux
while android apps can run on android on both x86 and arm i m having a hard time finding useful apps that run on linux on arm - in fact even ubuntu on arm is still not that well supported

61557
ubuntu	linux
is it hard to make low-cost x86 devices that can run ubuntu linux and relevant x86 applications

61566
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
linux strictly speaking is an operating system kernel used by both android and the unix-like operating system referred to colloquially as linux and sometimes more formally as gnu linux which we know via distributions such as ubuntu and debian

61566
daemons	systemd
the kernel can also stream instructions from other machine code artifacts it loads into ram such as the dalvik virtual machine or the init daemons or the shell or the x server and it is the combined logic of the systemd which interleaves instructions in the processor stream such that the kernel maintains its role and cannot be displaced

61566
ubuntu	debian
the fedora debian ubuntu etc

61567
ubuntu	linux
i have two computers both of which run ubuntu linux 12.04

61577
google-chrome	firefox
i heard that it should be not that hard to install google-chrome and the latest firefox on rhel 5.4

61587
freebsd	linux
which directories and how can i share between freebsd and linux

61605
sudo	gnome-terminal
sudo -b gnome-terminal could work better but i do not have an ubuntu to check if it works out of the box

61606
kde	gnome
the risk is very high you do not use the very same version of these applications under both of the environments say gnome kde gtk firefox thunderbird virtualbox wine and the likes

61606
freebsd	linux
it is certainly doable to have two home directories in their own file systems one for freebsd and one for linux and have the shared sub directories file systems loopback mounted on both home directories

61612
ubuntu	linux
that is not the case on some gnu linux oses such as ubuntu

61614
sudoers	visudo
added to the sudoers file via visudo may work

61615
powerpc	i386
starting with version 0.9.32 released 8 june 2011 uclibc is supporting nptl for the following architectures arm i386 mips powerpc sh sh64 x86_64

61631
mouse	keyboard
if we don t press any button on the keyboard or move the mouse the screen of it turns black

61652
mouseup	mousedown
i get data showing mouse clicks mouseup mousedown and events but all the relative movement data have identical rel_x and rel_y values

61659
debian	linux
if i install an application in linux for example debian gnu linux the files of the applications are copied to many different directories in the file system

61660
unix	bsd
that separation might be a reason why unix linux bsd have more resistance to file system viruses than windows does or the old pre-osx mac had

61677
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i have used several linux distributions arch debian ubuntu over the years and i would consider myself not an expert but certainly an experienced user

61680
wan	lan
it almost sounds like you re bridging layer 2 between the lan and wan interfaces

61680
wan	lan
if that s the case then lots of your user s internal traffic might end up on the wan and all router advertisements on the wan which are meant for the cpe are actually bridges to the lan

61680
wan	lan
use ebtables to filter between lan and wan

61703
bash	zsh
i m using dash sh or bash or zsh

61718
debian	linux
can debian linux find automaticaly drivers for usb ethernet nic

61720
freebsd	linux	freebsd	aix
it seems those types only belong to bsd-like systems aix darwin freebsd hpux sun etc. and won t occur on a linux system

61746
debian	linux
can debian linux find automaticaly drivers for usb ethernet nic

61746
debian	linux
linux debian has drivers for many usb network adapters

61747
centos	linux
if fedora updates too much for your needs consider using centos or scientific linux

61749
cinnamon	gnome
from that day around 2 months ago i still have only fallback mode both gnome and cinnamon

61749
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i installed linux mint maya and ubuntu 12.04 both as windows file and complete installation in an external hard drive

61773
zsh	tcsh
the command works right away on tcsh but on zsh i get

zsh	tcsh
as far as i understand sx 0 is the value of the argument -s but zsh seems to expand it and not pass it to my_command in the same way tcsh would do

61790
folder	directory
the directory testfolder is a shared folder through the whole network

61792
sudo	passwd
sudo mount -t cifs -o username yourwindowslogin passwd yourwindowspassword servername.com testfolder mnt testfolder

61805
kde	gnome
in gnome and kde you can use ctrl + alt + l by default

61824
switching	screens
sometime when i have to do something on a server i find that the screens is locked and i don t know the password of that user to unlock it in order to switching the user

61824
switching	screens
so i need to know how to switching the user even if the screens is locked by a different user

61826
google-chrome	firefox
i usually use it in google-chrome but if there is a way to do it in firefox iceweasel than it is good enough as well

61830
postfix	dovecot
on my current debian setup i have a file var log mail.log which dovecot postfix and spamassassin s spamd all output messages to

61851
redhat	fedora
on my system redhat fedora 14 using gnome desktop i have a choice of network in nautilus

61863
bash	zsh
then a better alternative but you d need a shell with support for process substitution like ksh zsh or bash would be

61869
udp	tcp
configure nfs on the server so that all relevant ports are being bound for nfsv3 then open the relevant ports on the client tcp and udp

61884
gentoo	linux
the server is running gentoo linux with a linux kernel 3.6.11

61884
jobs	cron
i have removed all cron jobs

61898
xfce	kde
the remote session also works with kde desktop but not lxde or xfce

61903
sysv	systemd
centos still uses a sysv style init systemd

61915
ubuntu	debian
i d give either apt or aptitude a try if the distro is debian ubuntu based

61915
redhat	fedora
for redhat based distros such as centos fedora rhel you can use rpm to verify and repair some aspects of the installed packages

61931
stdout	stderr
i need to redirect both stdout and stderr to the debug and log it for all commands in the script

61939
bash	zsh
off topic since you re mentioning bash but for the record with zsh you d do

61945
daemons	launchd
there are many guides to the steps for correctly launchd a daemons process such as stevens chapter in advanced programming in the unix environment

61974
sudo	passwd
i might somehow divert the gdm s typed passwd to something like sudo false but again how to get hold of the provided by the user passwd in the plain text

61979
debian	mint	debian	linux
i want to create a live system on a usb key sdcard with linux mint 14 kde or debian edition that stores data persistently

61979
debian	mint
i ve tried both mint 14 debian edition and kde edition as a live system with persistence file partition but failed both times when updates tried to change the boot system

62002
folder	directory
i have to mount the windows shared folder on redhat directory mnt or anywhere elese

62004
solaris	aix	opensolaris	aix
that is on solaris we know that we can do this cast because of inspection of the opensolaris sources but we should avoid assuming it works on other platforms with psinfo and pr_argv eg aix

62005
daemons	systemd
and furthermore there are several systemd daemons like ssh which check the permissions of directories and files

62014
folder	directory
however if i sync a folder between a hdd and an external hd while the sync is running it is listing each directory where it gets in

62028
jobs	cron
need to run some cleanup jobs regularly to delete leftover files alert of corrupted files ... which is also a job for cron

62053
daemons	systemd
the basic task of a daemons providing logins is to execute one or more commands in the correct context for a user for that systemd

62053
solaris	aix
other notable real-world compatibility issues redhat #126985 redhat #127054 the pam_tty issues on sun eg openssh #687 ruid restrictions on pam_chauthtok aix requires ruid of 0 solaris requires ruid non-zero

62053
freebsd	solaris
platforms native on solaris freebsd

62053
daemons	launchd
create a new contract for processes launchd from a daemons

62091
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu or debian use

62130
debian	mint	debian	linux
running linux mint debian amd64 on a thinkpad x120e

62141
bash	zsh
the form of command substitution is the same as the one found in ksh zsh and bash with the exception that it uses a temporary file instead of a pipe so that it can work with commands that expect a regular file like vim

62184
restrict	shared
it would seem like this is related to the buffer cache being restrict to 32bit dma memory and most likely even at 100 of the setting said memory is taken out of the pool that is shared with other kernel resources so the percentage would always be out of a number quite significantly below 4gb on any system it seems

62200
range	max
for traditional sysvinit you have a bunch of directories etc rcx.d where x range from 0 up to max which depends on the distribution s vagaries

62200
redhat	fedora
the file etc inittab states the default runlevel normally full graphics environment on fedora redhat at least it is was 5

62200
ubuntu	debian
newer systems use upstart ubuntu some others fedora uses systemd debian i believe offers several alternatives and so do some of the minor distributions some might even have their own system

62201
freebsd	linux
i ve read that there is a different behavior between freebsd and linux with the usr local in fbsd ports are installed there in linux not can someone explain more on this

62229
freebsd	centos	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	debian	debian	centos	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	centos	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	debian
sure you will find freebsd openbsd netbsd fedora debian centos and a long list of other non-enterprise operating systems in enterprise use but rarely with official blessing from the phb or his ceo

62246
folder	directory
if the initial system configuration allows these users to visit any of these home directory besides their own is there any way for a user to know who visited his home folder

62262
bash	zsh
otherwise with zsh or recent versions of bash or ksh93 supporting you could do

62264
bash	zsh
and are ksh syntax also supported by bash and zsh but not standard sh

62285
unix	bsd
the bsd stuff either dates from the prehistory or is part of some divergent branch sysv was an effort to end the unix wars by bringing all the disparate lines under one roof

62295
pop-up	dialog
at this point a dialog box pop-up asking me if i want to install the bootloader on a different drive or partition continue without installing a bootloader or cancel the installation

62299
udp	tcp
this will show you connections in established and listen states udp and tcp and it will ignore the unix local sockets

62308
debian	mint	debian	linux
i ve just installed debian after using linux mint for a few months

62316
ubuntu	debian
alas ubuntu and debian no longer seem to support the en_dk locale

62321
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
for java eclipse development consider debian over ubuntu linux mint and possibly even 32bit over 64bit

62321
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
background i have been doing some java eclipse rcp development and have been using ubuntu and later linux mint but have run into all kinds of annoying bugs either related to instabilities in the desktop environment cinnamon on linux mint or a somewhat complicated procedure to install sun java6 jdk which is used by our project .

62321
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
ubuntu linux mint ships only with openjdk in their repos

62321
ubuntu	linuxmint
installing the sun java only requires adding the non-free keyword after the main repository string in etc apt sources.list and then installing via apt-get and the gnome2 desktop shipped with it is also much more stable than the gnome3 unity cinnamon alternatives in ubuntu linuxmint

62345
filesystems	btrfs
however on a cow filesystems such as btrfs this approach is useless

62345
filesystems	btrfs
is there a way to securely delete a file on a btrfs filesystems

62355
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
for instance which version of gimp is provided by mint ubuntu debian sid and fedora 18

62357
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian	rhel	archlinux	rhel	slackware	slackware	archlinux	centos	linux

62359
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
here s mint ubuntu debian and fedora there s a radio button to choose between seeing only the major packages and all packages

62383
ssd	sata
one on a sata drive and one on an ssd

62392
centos	linux
i have a pppoe connection on my linux machine centos kernal 2.6.32 as a client so that when i setup this connection another virtual tunnel interface comes up ppp0

62399
filesystems	xfs
this overhead can be reasonably reduced by creating a large file formatting it with a regular filesystems with smaller blocks xfs can use blocks as small as 512b and loop-mounting it

62408
ubuntu	linux
i am running my donnet framework based application using mono in linux ubuntu

62423
vim	emacs
i m trying to learn c++ in school using a unix environment and our professor urges us to use vim or emacs because a gui is disadvantageous for two reasons

62423
mouse	keyboard
moving your hands off the keyboard and using the mouse to move around reduces coding speed

62423
vim	emacs	vim	kate	emacs	kate
i mean is it a few milliseconds slower or is it really bad to use kate and i should just stick with vim emacs

62427
vim	emacs
so i d go with vim which as said before will be there almost anywhere and if you don t like modal editors go emacs

62438
vim	emacs
i don t know of many people who use emacs or vim on a regular basis

62460
ubuntu	debian
is relatively small in community many fixes found for debian and also ubuntu will work for #

62469
lvm	umount
if you extented your lvm root volume and resized that file system you have to shrink the umount file system then reduce the volume then reduce the group and remove the new hard disk

62482
disk	ram
every byte that you allocate to a ram drive is that much less for applications and disk cache

62538
gentoo	linux
i m installing gentoo linux for years and never explicitly set cxx use flag like now

62558
xfce	gnome
assuming you are using something like gnome xfce or some compliant desktop environment

62558
google-chrome	firefox
instead of google-chrome you can use your favorite browser like firefox or the like

62569
ubuntu	linux
which is almost irrelevant however it will be easiest if it is some full scale linux so ubuntu and fedora are the first that come to mind here is an incredibly large list of alternatives

62585
versioning	upgrade
after years i decided to upgrade from fedora 15 to 18 but as per the guidelines only 2 versioning can be jumped so i decided to settle with fedora 17 and ran preupgrade all was going fine till after sometime it told me that i didnt had any space so i canceled the initial process made some space and tried again

62587
debian	linux
i am running lxde openbox on debian linux

62596
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
not source which is a cshism also supported by tcsh bash ksh and zsh but not standard wouldn t work from .xsessionrc

62623
ubuntu	debian
so i have a debian distro at home considering getting ubuntu and i can t login

62626
versioning	upgrade
this means that a newer versioning of the package than the one in the upgrade is already installed

62626
versioning	upgrade
this should work right if you tell the upgrade to use the updates for the upgrade versioning

62627
ubuntu	linux
some ubuntu sites claim that it ships with configuration for linux even though it doesn t say so on the packaging

62629
folder	directory
how can i make ls show information about the directory specified only not info about its sub-files or folder contents

62636
ubuntu	linuxmint
version 23.0.1271.97 built on ubuntu 12.10 running on linuxmint 14 23.0.1271.97-0ubuntu0.12.10.1

62638
bsd	minix
as such you will find that other unixy systems bsd mac os the propietary unices minix 3 ... use similar conventions

62657
xfce	gnome
several users seem to be facing a similar problem but i have so far not found a sufficient solution since they all seem to be referring to gnome and most of them address something like system settings - sound preferences which doesn t exist in my xfce

62662
unix	bsd
original uc berkeley bsd unix

62662
unix	bsd
original 4.x bsd does not have cpu support code for this model and neither do ultrix and at t unix

62663
mouse	keyboard
i first noticed when my keyboard and mouse weren t responding - however checking dmesg both the logitech unifying receiver and my external mics usb connections were being recognized

62665
bash	zsh
bash copied ksh93 a few years later february 2009 bash 4.0 with the same syntax but an unfortunate difference bash s is like zsh s that is it follows symlinks when recursing into sub-directories which is generally not what you want it do and can have nasty side effects that has later been fixed in bash-4.3

62665
fish	zsh
in fish will match a b c.c but not a.c while will match a.c and ab c d.c and zsh s for instance has to be written

62665
zsh	tcsh
tcsh also added a globstar option in v6.17.01 may 2010 and supports both and ã la zsh

62665
fish	tcsh	fish	bash	bash	tcsh
so in tcsh bash and ksh93 when the corresponding option is enabled globstar or fish expands all the files and directories below the current one and is the same as for fish a symlink traversing for tcsh with globstar and the same as in bash and ksh93 though it s not impossible that future versions of those shells will also traverse symlinks

62665
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
also in every shell but csh tcsh fish and zsh if the globbing pattern doesn t match any file the pattern is passed as an unexpanded argument which causes confusion and possibly bugs

62665
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
if there s no nor file in the current directory then you might end up deleting a file called by mistake csh tcsh and zsh would report a no match error and wouldn t call rm and fish doesn t support the wildcards

62696
passwd	chgrp	chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod	chown	passwd
you have automount support in etc fstab too and you don t have to put sensitive data such as usernames or passwd and if you have your usernames syncrhronized same etc passwd and etc group files you can use the usual posix permissions toolset chown chgrp and chmod

62725
filesystems	fat
once mounted you don t exactly see the difference between one filesystems and the other except when it does not let you do some things because of filesystems limitations for example names in fat

62729
antivirus	rootkit
i need to make the move from windows to linux as i am too pissed off with the many system crashes numerous and random internet disconnecting issues trojans rootkit and malware infections and whatnot and all of these on a fresh new install of windows on which i only installed the bare minimum winamp browser antivirus office vlc etc etc

62729
versioning	upgrade
worst case you can only apply security upgrade and only do a major upgrade when your versioning becomes unsupported or don t upgrade and risk security issues

62733
gentoo	linux
i m running grub 2.00 on a gentoo linux system

62753
ubuntu	centos
check avahi out ubuntu howto should be easily adaptable to centos

62781
solaris	sunos
by the way this os is more commonly referred to as solaris 10 than sunos 5.10

62790
bash	zsh
by mistake i posted the above zsh code - in bash syntax it would look somewhat like this with the reservation that it is much less tested than the zsh code which runs every day on my computer

62793
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am running linux mint but i think this issue will be mutual with ubuntu

62796
vmware	esx
at the moment all i have is a vmware esx 5.x server to use

62797
redhat	fedora
the redhat centos and fedora systems have the kernel-devel package containing the machinery required to build modules against the kernel not the full source mind you

62798
binutils	glibc
so we need to build new system s binutils and gcc first to build target system s glibc let glibc connect with target s binutils and gcc

62798
binutils	glibc
but first pass of binutils and gcc is using host s glibc so we need second pass of compilation of target s binutils and gcc

62802
filesystems	btrfs
when doing a installation to a root btrfs filesystems many linux distributions install to the default subvolume

62820
debian-based	ubuntu
on debian-based distros ubuntu ...

62824
debian-based	linux
knoppix is a debian-based linux live dvd

62827
int	chars
the application was very old and was apparently using the maximum number of fd s and tried to put that number into a variable of type unsigned chars which can only hold up to int 256 resulting in core dump

62848
kde	gnome
consider using python with its gnome or qt kde bindings

62885
ubuntu	debian
i m interested in changing from ubuntu to debian

62885
ubuntu	debian
i would simply wipe the ubuntu partition and install debian and modify the fstab file to mount my home and swap partitions

62887
debian	linux
btw uname -a gives me linux kgbxcrunch 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.35-2 x86_64 gnu linux

62891
mouse	keyboard
iirc ltsp transforms the clients into just x terminals not much more than a display with keyboard and mouse any restriction would have to be enforced at the server in exactly the same way you would limit local users

62903
chown	chgrp
but that s a simple fix just chown chgrp to the new uid gid

62907
filesystems	btrfs
filesystems ext4 btrfs zfs â

62907
ubuntu	debian
going from ubuntu 12.04 to debian wheezy or even squeeze i don t think you ll lose anything so in your case you won t run into any problem

62922
uefi	multiboot
not sure whether there s reason to use gummiboot i prefer refind as a boot manager for a generic case but you well might skip it since you say no need for multiboot elilo as a bootable media starter especially with uefi sb and non-signed kernels and grub 2.00 as a common bootloader that lets one mess with kernel boot parameters and whatnot

62926
bash	zsh
you could put that function definition in your shell configuration file like .bashrc for bash or .zshrc for zsh

62938
ubuntu	linux
maybe it depends on your linux install and your awk nawk gawk versions but on my ubuntu machine only gawk ran terdon s excellent answer

62939
kde	gnome
i m developing a little application for gnome unity and kde desktops

62944
ubuntu	debian
it s in the debian and ubuntu repositories at least

62999
screens	tablet
i following a guide to have my tablet samsung ativ 700t running ubuntu 12.10 gnome3 invert the screens 180 on login

63009
debian	linux
i configured munpack on my debian linux to extract attachments from incoming emails

63010
wav	flac
i m trying to convert arecord wav output to flac and it does work in part

63010
wav	flac
i initially wanted to use sox to record flac without having to recode wav to flac but it s giving me a segmentation fault and i couldn t find a way to overcome this yet

63055
ubuntu	linux
there s some linux distros that i want to try but none of the websites are as user friendly as ubuntu

63059
versioning	upgrade
i was unable to upgrade filesystem to latest versioning lib and lib64 exists

63060
mouse	keyboard
hover mouse over open and hit enter keyboard works

63077
bash	zsh
the answer for the 2nd question in case of bash or zsh declare -f

63082
centos	linux
i need to buy a vps dedicated server that provides a centos linux with 4 x 500 gb harddrives in mirrored raid

63083
debian	centos
it s a debian howto so it differs in the packages you need to install but you should have similar packages for centos

63088
filesystems	btrfs
that s why with most filesystems btrfs being a notable exception the number of links of a directory is an indication of how many subdirectories it has accounting for their

63090
vmware	virtualbox
if not - then it s better to install arch as virtual machine virtualbox vmware etc. before going on your real pc it ll make you more familiar with the installation process

63104
octal	decimal
note that it allows but not 0377.1.1.1 even though 0377 as taken as an octal number is within range because it only considers decimal numbers

63107
libpcap	wireshark
wireshark is build on libpcap which is fairly well documented and easy to use if you are into programming

63107
libpcap	wireshark
libpcap is also the basis of tcpdump which is similiar in purpose to wireshark

63136
rpm	yum
luckily the contents of that directory are part of the yum package at least on fedora a close relative so just reinstalling yum using rpm directly should fix this

63148
mp3	ogg
i have a conv.sh script that loops over mp3 files in the current directory and converts them into ogg

63170
fish	bash
you could do the same with fish or bash -o globstar but beware that those may traverse symlinks when descending the directory tree fixed in bash 4.3

63179
ubuntu	linux
i ve recently been migrating to puppy linux last os was ubuntu and the only version of chromium currently available is about as old as the one in the ubuntu repositories

63179
ubuntu	linux
this wouldn t be much of an issue on a system like ubuntu or even arch linux because the chromium project was nice enough to provide the exact command required to fetch all the build dependencies but with puppy linux you re pretty much dead in the water

63183
gtk	cairo
for example in recent gtk versions this is achieved through another abstraction layer provided by cairo

63183
gtk	cairo
on windows or mac they have the possibility to use the native api so that gtk button can be translated to windows button and for example on a framebuffer device it would be translated directly into the single pixels probably again through a rastering engine like cairo

63198
versioning	upgrade
i think that this breakage has to do with the fact that ubuntu tried to upgrade a kernel with an earlier versioning

63222
debian	linux
edit i am using gnome version 3.4.2 and awesome wm v3.4.14 on debian gnu linux sid

63229
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
the question is why if i do as prescribed #chkconfig smbd on this help my for a few launchd of systemd and eventually samba daemons stops again

63229
daemons	launchd
to avoid mannualy typing each restart samba daemons start commands i made a desktop launchd for lxde fedora enviroment in desktop

63230
children	parent
bsd process accounting at least on linux does report cpu time user + sys though not in a cumulative way like time does children processes cpu time is not accounted for the parent

63234
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade to the latest versioning to see if the wifi is indeed fixed but can t risk bricking the device

63240
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
or even better use lvm or any snapshotting filesystems like btrfs zfs nilfs .

63259
filesystems	ntfs
i have not tried it on ntfs filesystems although apparently it can

63260
gentoo	linux
my system is gentoo linux and window manager wmii

63274
freebsd	linux
i believe ufs implementation use in-memory hashing based on freebsd use and documentation i don t have much direct experience with ufs on linux as the on-disk format does not use hashes

63277
spaces	linefeed
an example is powr1 x0d powr1 followed by three spaces and linefeed

63277
udp	tcp
it says protocol tcp ip nothing about udp or tcp and service nothing do not select telnet or ssh

63287
filesystems	xfs
note that some filesystems such as xfs can only be grown

63296
filesystems	ntfs
the op had several questions regarding ntfs filesystems attributes such as h hidden s system files

63296
filesystems	ntfs
are filesystems attributes that are part of ntfs these aren t part of the file itself

63296
filesystems	ntfs
i believe the ntfs attributes are applied in this case only hidden is supported to the udf joliet filesystems in the iso

63298
bash	zsh
ksh also as the operator also copied by bash and zsh and in recent versions

63306
bash	zsh
it has long been obsolete shells now have arithmetic built in with the construct posix or with let builtin ksh bash zsh or the â construct ksh bash zsh

63310
debian	linux
for a minimal distro i d say dsl damn small linux debian based - but it doesn t really matter as you can configure all but any distro to be lightweight by tweaking and removing features

63334
bash	zsh
if the remote user s shell is ksh93 zsh or bash or sh implemented as any of those you could do

63337
debian	linux
i m using debian linux

63356
switching	tun
ok you could treat it as a separate network segment and use ip routing but then you should switching to tun mode.

63383
rpm	yum
i don t think that yum can do that but rpm can

63408
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux

63433
lvm	btrfs
in response to the first comment btrfs can do thinks like raid and sub-partitions much like lvm

63433
lvm	btrfs
i ve read that btrfs can be seen as a replacement for lvm

63433
lvm	btrfs
lvm has a graphical tool to manage these aspects does btrfs have the same

63447
stdout	fflush
in your test.c file you could fflush the buffered data using void fflush stdout

63449
chown	sudo
so figure out what those files are and just chown them to someone else root or another user you ll probably have to use sudo

63452
cinnamon	gnome	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
not surprisingly gnome unity kde cinnamon the default on mint are out

63462
next	except
and then i don t want to allow pacman to upgrade my wireless drivers so next time i run pacman -syu i want everything to be upgraded except my wireless drivers and if possible my graphic card drivers

63463
width	height
edit i put together a small python tkinter pil gui for imagemagick tkgui_imagemagick.py - and finally i could find the proper command line for something that i wanted to make a montage of four images where the tiles height width are matched to whatever is the largest width of that column or height of row

63463
width	height
and as such we must apriori know the largest width of each column and height of each row

63463
width	height
since img1 is smaller than the implied width height of its neighbors we must explicitly set both width and height in its extents

63466
qnx	minix
the os having microkernel are qnx l4 hurd initially mach not mac os x later it will converted into hybrid kernel even minix is not pure kernel because device driver are compiled as part of the kernel

63470
ubuntu	linux
i m running a dual-boot windows xp and ubuntu plus i frequently boot into puppy linux from a usb drive so it really doesn t matter which os it s for

63489
octal	decimal
esc in ascii is decimal 27 or octal 33 so you can pass that to the shell with 033 and see what i mean

63498
ethernet	wireless
in there are files related to the ethernet and wireless networking devices

63505
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i want to install the latest version of ffmpeg on linux ubuntu debian

arp	dhcp
if i listen for all traffic using tcpdump i can see lots of arp traffic as well as my isp s dhcp server responding to other customers who are requesting ip addresses

63513
freebsd	linux
i know that some linux applications run on freebsd

63513
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
all the more so they should run on debian kfreebsd since it only uses a freebsd kernel while linux userspace

63514
kde	gnome
i will probably run neither gnome nor kde but a lightweight wm

63531
ubuntu	debian
like netbeans and chrome are .sh eclipse is a plain launchable directory java requires this update-alternatives business but i don t think it registers itself into ubuntu debian s programs list just registers as a command etc

63531
put	get
from how to install eclipse i figured to get something to show up in the launcher i need to put a xxx.desktop file in .local share applications

63534
ubuntu	linux	xfce	gnome	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux
these are heterogeneous so there is simply no one answer to the question how do i do this on linux -- it is not even a question of how do i do this on ubuntu or how do i do this on gentoo -- it s a question of how do i do this for the gnome desktop or how do this on the xfce desktop etc

63539
umount	btrfs
now umount the origin fs if mounted and modprobe -r btrfs to make sure it s not going to interfere and make it forget its device scan

63541
sudo	passwd
you only require root privileges if you want to check if the user has a passwd set human user otherwise you can just cat etc passwd instead of sudo grep .

63549
mp4	h.264
since h.264 isn t properly supported in avi containers we ll use mp4 instead which should be your container of choice instead of avi most of the time

63549
ffmpeg	libav
i m using ffmpeg synonymously with libav here since the syntax should be the same

63549
ubuntu	linux	ffmpeg	libav
i would however recommend you to ditch the default libav version that ships with ubuntu and compile ffmpeg from source or use a recent linux static build

63568
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
it underlies your unix linux desktop environment gnome kde xfce etc. and graphical applications all of which talk to x at a very low level in order to display graphics on the screen

63588
g++	gcc
from this answer to install gcc 4.7 on centos 6.x the easiest way to get g++ 4.7 and the required tools and libraries for centos 5.x is via the devtools package

63588
g++	gcc
since you re running g++ manually as opposed to through make you ll need to update your variable so your shell will use the new gcc g++ etc

63596
debian	linux
other distributions like arch linux sabayon linux or debian sid include newest versions a lot faster

63596
g++	gcc
at some point this version or newer of gcc g++ is going to enter the package manager

63598
bash	zsh
note that bash ksh and rc implement process substitution using named pipes rather than temporary files as zsh uses and require the dev fd filesystem to be mounted

63606
filesystems	btrfs
do i have to mount a btrfs filesystems before creating subvolumes on it

63638
ubuntu	mint
i ve been using ubuntu for a while now and wanted to switch to mint

63656
ubuntu	linux
i teach linux i use a mix of ubuntu desktop and ubuntu server to get the students going

63663
bash	zsh
as an alternative to with ksh zsh and bash one can also do

63667
google-chrome	firefox
however there is a preference setting in firefox and an extension available for google-chrome chromium which would let you use middle mouse button for scrolling and activate this feature

63667
google-chrome	firefox
anyways its the tall webpages which creates most of the problem for which both firefox and google-chrome chromium have a solution

63686
int	double
having checked procps libproc it reads proc stat as long-long int and calculates using double precision floats -- i can t see any problems there

63705
ethernet	wireless
ssh took 68 cpu load when copying over ethernet and only 20 when copying over wlan wireless

63709
hard-drive	hdd
a recent processor coupled to an extremely slow hard-drive like a very old or misconfigured ata hdd low-end flash device memory card or flash disk or anything connected over usb running only v1.1 or specially patched version of openssh

63716
kde	gnome
i just installed arch linux latest stable iso from website and i need to know whether or not i can just go straight to gnome kde lxde etc

63719
kde	gnome
gnome kde and lxde are all desktop environments

63719
kde	gnome
they come with a window manager gnome gives you a choice kde and lxde have their own

63728
bash	zsh
this is a bash and zsh feature only

63730
bash	zsh
bash ksh zsh and even ash have a -nt operator for the builtin and in bash ksh zsh the construct that tests whether a file is newer than another

63736
filesystems	btrfs
if you pass and the underlying filesystems supports copy-on-write btrfs or zfs and the copy happens to be on the same device then cp will create a new inode but not copy the content

63748
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
up to february 2013 i have not found any other than fedora to support uefi boot mode out of the box all the other ones ubuntu debian kubuntu linux mint etc

63752
disk	ram
i am not writing a lot of data to the disk so i am not worried about reduced i o speed due to the encryption process just mainly using many cpus and a lot of ram on this machine

63758
ldd	glibc
you could also use ldd to determine what shared libraries the program needs then use ldd on each of the libraries to find out if they require glibc

63761
ubuntu	opensuse
i recently switched from ubuntu to opensuse because of bloatware including unity

63761
ubuntu	opensuse
in ubuntu i set the printer up using this tutorial but in opensuse i end up with this error even though rastertogdi binary is copied correctly

63773
for-loop	loops
however as nodes is evaluated before the first iteration of the for-loop it should be possible to change it during that same loops

63782
zsh	tcsh
zsh is one of the few shells the other ones being tcsh which originated as a csh script for csh users which also had its limitation tcsh made it a builtin as an improvement where which does something sensible since it s a shell builtin but somehow you or your os via some rc file broke it by replacing it with a call to the system which command which can t do anything sensible reliably since it doesn t have access to the interns of the shell so can t know how that shell interprets a command name

63784
mutt	msmtp
statement aside mutt with offlineimap msmtp and 10 accounts is by far the hardest program i ever had to configure

63794
debian	linux
can one disable the ipv6 stack on debian linux especially wheezy

63806
dpkg	apt
on debian-based systems apt-get downloads .deb files under var cache apt archives dpkg does not download anything by itself it only manages the packages locally

63831
debian	mint
do you have some debian mint or ppa sources

63833
installation	upgrade
2 then enter the installation button and then enter the upgrade or update ..

63835
folder	directory
i would like to know how to move all the files not the folder or directory to an existing folder or directory two levels down

63842
ubuntu	debian
if i were in your shoes i would try a live cd boot of ubuntu also based debian based distribution and see if their default audio management settings work

63879
wan	lan
i suggest naming your ethernet interfaces so that you could have -i lan -i wan instead

63885
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh all instances increment shlvl even bash -c â

63888
cpu	processors
the computer server i am using has about 20+ processors intel xeon cpu with 6 core

63913
ubuntu	linux
i tried with other distros ubuntu 12.04 anh bodhi linux and the same problem exists

63931
awk	ksh
i m sure i could write a ksh script to loop through but i know these things can often be written much faster using awk sed both of which i m not very familiar with so it s beyond my megre skills

63951
init.d	pid
the parent of it is init and i guess that it was started with the command service sshd start during bootup but if we have something that cannot be easily guessed for example a convoluted startup command or because of an obfuscated etc init.d somedeamon script - how do we find the somedeamon script knowing only the pid

64016
put	get
to avoid all this rigmarole and just get the exact value of the variable or the output of the command minus final newlines be sure to put the variable substitution or command substitution between double quotes

64017
filesystems	btrfs
a btrfs filesystems can be shrunk live

64025
unix	bsd
i m trying to piece together the names of the people who contributed to bsd unix according to the contents of the sccs logs

64057
debian	linux
having debian 6.0.6 with kernel linux debian 2.6.32-5-amd64 #1 smp we did

64073
lua	scheme
when working with interpreted i m a little reluctant to use this term languages like python scheme or lua each respective major mode the common ones offer ways of running the repl interpreter inside the editor and executing the content of a buffer directly

64077
stdout	stderr
i also do not care about redirecting stdout stderr and i do not want to receive an email if the command fails

64092
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade to isc dhcpd versioning isc-dhcpd-4.1-esv-r6

64094
bash	zsh
it can be recognised by zsh if you turn the kshglob option on setopt kshglob and by bash if you turn the extglob option on shopt -s extglob

64094
bash	zsh
in ksh recent versions of ksh93 only the best you can do is write which would be the equivalent of nullglob in bash or the n globbing qualifier in zsh which would cause the pattern to expand to nothing if there s no matching file and you would then get an error from mv

64133
jobs	cron
in .cronfile you specify the environment for your cron jobs

64142
post	get
according the comment on this post it s possible but i first of all don t quite get what he s saying second of all i m not sure how to accomplish this as there ll be multiple files output from split

64143
centos	linux
i have custom distribution of centos linux 6.3

64159
sctp	mtu
if i use an sctp agent i can set different mtu

64171
rpm	yum
if the dependencies of the two different versions of rpm are same would yum update remove and install dependencies too

64175
ubuntu	linux
what you should do is add a disk label instead for linux ones use tune2fs to set a label i.e to label the partition dev sda1 with ubuntu just an example

64186
switching	screens
because i am the only one connecting to my screens sessions and sometimes i want more than one console connected a la multi display mode to a session at a time i use the -x switching

64191
daemon	cron
or does some function generate an interrupt and notifies the cron daemon

64194
centos	linux
under linux if you look in proc at things like bytes read written or iowait for crond you may see that it has relatively high usage this is because it ends up accounting for all the child processes that it starts on centos 5.x

64206
bash	zsh
-1 are for bash zsh and csh not for ksh

64215
xfce	kde
however you can still use gtk apps in kde and qt apps in eg xfce

now i m still hesitating between debian and ubuntu

64286
filesystems	ntfs
just wonder is it possible to install windows and linux on a ntfs partition and have both oses share a root filesystems as either one is booted

64293
ubuntu	debian
the ubuntu pythoneers have a backport ppa at pythoneers +archive lts - other google hits for debian python2.7 backport look less promising

64297
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	freebsd	linux
the frequency scaling works under freebsd 9 and under ubuntu 12.04 with the linux kernel 3.5

64297
ubuntu	freebsd
however when i put freebsd 9 in a kvm environment on top of ubuntu the frequency scaling does not work

64312
apache	lighttpd
apache need about 300-400 k ram and this is very bad for a vps i removed apache and installed lighttpd

64314

summarizing as you have no idea what your load spikes are and as disk is so much cheaper than ram do configure swap 2 ram.

64318
jobs	cron
show the output of random user s cron jobs on my screen

freebsd	linux
below you can find how to configure and or enable hpet on linux and freebsd

64399
freebsd	linux
this timer can be used efficiently by modern os linux kernel supports it since 2.6 stable support on freebsd since latest 9.x but was introduced in 6.3 to provide consistent timing invariably to cpu power management

64401
post	put
as it s been months the situation has probably been remedied but if someone else has a similar problem and see this post i recommend running setenforce 0 which will put selinux in permissive mode until the next reboot or until setenforce 1 is run

64402
daemons	systemd
i have it pinging the router every five seconds and when the ping fails it reconnects i m not using networkmanager or any systemd daemons which would normally handle that...anyway if it reconnects right away it takes 15 seconds

64405
children	parent
more specifically as it is a per process setting when fork clone vfork etc is called by a process the rlimit_nproc value for that process is compared to the total process count for that process s parent user not to the number of children that process has

64421
redhat	fedora
are you by chance running fedora or redhat

64424
wan	lan
a home or small office router typically has one wan port up to four lan ports and up to two wifi radios

64440
bash	zsh
those globbing extensions are also available in bash after shopt -s extglob and in zsh after setopt kshglob

64443
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
mint is based on ubuntu which in turn is based on debian

64452
switching	screens
i then get a black screens like xorg is trying to switching modes before being sent back to the gdm login screens

64472
bash	zsh
with bash or other posix shells including zsh

64476
sudo	passwd
users must enter their own passwd to run sudo

64479
bash	zsh
in bash and ksh and zsh but not in ash you can use the more readable construct

64480
bash	zsh
more esoterically in bash if you have the extglob option turned on shopt -s extglob this works and includes it also works in ksh and in zsh after setopt ksh_glob

64498
folder	directory
open terminal and move to the bin folder present in the android directory using cd command of terminal

64522
debian	linux
i have a standard linux debian testing laptop with a swap partition

64545
sudo	passwd
- if i provide the sudo command with an incorrect passwd it checks and it return passwd incorrect but if i provide the correct passwd it does return nothing

64545
sudo	passwd
i already changed the passwd and checked if my username belongs to groups like sudo admin adm ....

64571
sysv	systemd
gnu linux have 3 boot process sysv upstart and systemd sysv have inittab and others don t use inittab

64571
ubuntu	debian	sysv	systemd
debian uses sysv fedora uses systemd and ubuntu uses upsatrt

in bash ksh or zsh set snapshot to be an array containing the list of matching file names

64586
bash	zsh
in bash or zsh set the nullglob option to get an empty array instead

64589
put	get
you can get binaries from red hat under a maintenance contract or sources for free and also instructions and tools needed to put a modified distribution together

64589
redhat	fedora
redhat sponsors the mostly independent fedora project a community-driven distribution which strives to get the best and latest of open source into the hands of enthusiasts in form of a easy to use package

64589
redhat	fedora
in turn redhat enterprise linux starts essentially as a branch off fedora selecting packages tweaking configuration and stabilizing hardening and finally maintaining the versions selected by bug fixes and backports

64589
redhat	fedora
many redhat employees are active in fedora as package maintainers or working on external packages

64616
bash	zsh
with ksh bash or zsh but that creates a few more extra processes and pipes for no extra benefit

64620
mktime	strftime
if you want to do date manipulation portably the best you can do is probably to use perl which is installed on virtually every non-embedded unix and its posix module for the strftime and mktime functions

64626
debian	linux
i m running debian on a simulated mips malta board basically linux running on mips if that makes a difference

64630
whiptail	ncurses
also whiptail is based on newt while dialog is based on ncurses

64636
kate	kde
does it happen to other kde app like kate kwrite

64640
versioning	upgrade
you might need to upgrade the versioning to log pid ppid see otherwise i suspect it will under-report on fork without exec

64664
folder	directory
it seems counter-intuitive to me that i can not run a program from its working directory only from the parent folder

64693
prepare	execute
but i m not sure how to execute the commands to prepare dev mapper swapfile

64697
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m used with xfce and lxde and i see that both linux mint 14 nadia and linux mint debian have xfce versions

64704
sudo	passwd
creating directory var lib samba and adding myself to samba passwd databse sudo mkdir -p var lib samba

64705
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
xfce gnome kde etc are just desktop environments they can be installed on any linux distribution

64705
debian	mint	debian	linux	xfce	cinnamon
for example i use linux mint debian lmde and have gnome3 mate cinnamon and xfce installed

64705
kde	kubuntu
for example ubuntu uses unity and kubuntu uses kde

64705
kde	kubuntu
there is no reason you cannot install kde on ubuntu and unity on kubuntu

64709
daemons	systemd
git is a version control systemd not a filesystem sync daemons or something

64724
opensuse	linux
you can also build a custom opensuse or suse linux enterprise for that matter -based distribution with the opensuse studio

64729
splunk	logstash
programs like logstash graylog2 and splunk all offer varying degrees of features to this effect

64739

under this number of options like floppy cd dvd hdd

64758
hdd	floppy
under this number of options like floppy cd dvd hdd

64768
ubuntu	centos
what makes this all the more perplexing is that the code runs fine on ubuntu 12.04 3.2 kernel but fails the subject of this question on centos 6 3.6 kernel

64768
bluetooth	usb
the usb device is a bluegiga bled112 bluetooth smart dongle

64768
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
since the code works on ubuntu 12.04 linux 3.2 i grabbed the 3.2 cdc_acm code and compiled that module on the centos 6 linux 3.6 platform

64796
centos	linux
i have an experimental setup of 4 linux centos machines

64800
implements	extends
another maybe more feasible solution is to either directly implements a ssh client within your application and depend on third party libraries such as jsch or extends either ssh ssh-agent to directly receive and decrypt the key from your database

64804
folder	directory
i renamed my home folder deleted myself created a new user moved my data from my backup home directory except dotfolders and dotfiles like .config .dmrc .pulse .gconf .gnome2 ... and re logged in

64815
ubuntu	linux
if i wanted to output just the size and usage as a percentage of sda2 and sda3 for example how could i tell linux ubuntu to check them sum them and show them to me

64822
versioning	upgrade
i generally don t care about minor versioning upgrade except when there s a security issue or if there s a feature in a new versioning that i know i need

64835
spaces	delimiter
instead use the spaces instead of the as the delimiter in this section

64837
google-chrome	firefox
i m having trouble with firefox and google-chrome for some time now and it s very irritating

64838
kde	gnome
â œcriticalâ messages from gnome applications and to a lesser extent from kde applications mean â œthe programmer has been careless but hey it seems to work so who caresâ

64842
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
how are the distributions xubuntu 12.10 and linux mint 14 xfce different given that the latter is based on ubuntu 12.10

64852
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have dualboot ubuntu 12.10 linux mint 14 both are clean install updated with the latest

64852
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
my wireless works flawlessly on linux mint but it s very unreliable on ubuntu every 15 20 minutes the wireless icon still shows connected status but i can t go to any website

64852
ubuntu	mint
or what s the different in wireless module between linx mint ubuntu

64852
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
anyway i can bring it from linux mint to ubuntu

64863
debian	linux	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
distribution used gentoo gnu linux amd64 or debian gnu linux amd64 because i d like to apply this procedure to multiple installations

64865
bash	zsh
another way in pure bash ksh or zsh

64887
put	get
to elaborate i am looking to get the utility lsb_release which i know would be put into usr bin lsb_release

64901
unix	aix
i am new to unix and have a doubt about file size in unix aix

64920
pulseaudio	mixer
then if it works it should appear in the pulseaudio mixer with the name you gave in the configuration file

64921
zsh	subshell	bash	zsh	bash	subshell	subshell	ash
att ksh both ksh88 and ksh93 and zsh execute the last rightmost command in a pipeline in the parent shell whereas other shells bourne ash bash pdksh mksh execute all the commands including the last one in a subshell

64921
bash	zsh
you could also try zsh which when invoked as ksh behaves in a way that s a bit closer to ksh than bash is

64939
webkit	blink
it used webkit as its web browser engine but google have since forked webkit to create blink which has been used in all chromium-based browsers since version 28

64939
freebsd	linux
many gnu linux distributions include chromium in their official package repositories and it has also been ported to freebsd

64947
google-chrome	firefox
try temporarily moving usr lib libjpeg somewhere else and see if that breaks firefox or google-chrome

64947
binutils	ldd
if you have binutils installed you can use the ldd command to see which .so files are linked

64968
debian	mint	debian	linux
i wanted to try out the linux mint debian

64982
disk	ram
yes swap is when the hard disk is used to hold memory once ram is full

64982
disk	ram
paging excess memory out to disk like that keeps the os from having to kill processes to free up real ram which is why it is generally recommended to have a swap partition for your linux installation

64997
debian	linux
this is an easy to fix bug please see the 7th entry on my blog post about fixing common steam on debian linux problems

65014
stdout	stderr
suppose you want to capture the stderr of a command and stderr only while leaving stdout alone in a variable

65014
stdout	stderr
now both fd 1 stdout and 2 stderr go to the pipe and eventually to the variable which is only half of what we want

65014
stdout	stderr
now we ve got what we wanted stderr goes to the pipe and stdout is left untouched

65030
bash	zsh
first of all if you are in fact using zsh .profile and all the bash rc files are irrelevant

65032
kde	kubuntu
questions about kubuntu an official derivative of the ubuntu operating system using the kde plasma desktop

65033
kde	kubuntu
kubuntu is the official ubuntu derivative using the kde plasma desktop

65059
opml	feed
export feed as opml to stdout

65082
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
how do i set up multiple linux and occasionally more traditional unix such as bsd or solaris distributions with a single home partion or if problematic with a single data partition

65094
daemons	systemd
the tool batch that comes with the atd daemons is pretty useful in principle running commands only when the systemd utilisation falls below a certain level by default 1.5

65094
bash	zsh
i use zsh for my main shell but a bash answer would be equally ok and might have wider applicability

65136
stdout	stderr
one disadvantage to this approach is that the file descriptors for stdout and stderr will still contain references to your ssh session s tty

65136
stdout	stderr
if the process you are abandoning writes to stdout or stderr the process may exit prematurely if the tty buffer overfills

65143
jobs	cron
all my cron jobs and headless installations do still work running under both administrator and root user

65177
centos	linux
i m currently setting up my own linux server running centos 6

65188
solaris	irix
you can switch top between so-called irix mode and solaris mode by pressing shift i

65205
post	get
below are some responses that i get if you need me to post any more output let me know as the dns settings are what i m not super familiar with

65219
dnf	yum
if you are on fedora fedora 18 has dnf as an experimental alternative to yum it is much faster in resolving dependencies and more accurate too

65234
disk	ram
oh and i guess the best thing would be to switch to zfs but i imagine if the system had a 20gb disk in it it s probably 32bit and not a lot of ram so not ideal for zfs...

65235
ubuntu	debian
officially the node.js interpreter is supposed to be called node but debian and ubuntu ship an executable called nodejs instead

65236
bash	zsh
ksh93 where bash got that feature from or zsh don t even set there

65239
cinnamon	gnome
under mate or cinnamon the fonts are smoothed and choosing the session xmonad with gnome fonts are smoothed also

osx	mint
there is nothing wrong with my s2209w as colours are produced appropriately on osx and on mint when connected to a different computer

65273
dnf	yum
btw fedora 18 has the experimental dnf yum replacement much faster and accurate

65283
hex	binary
binary to hex

65298
folder	directory
i have a large directory with hundreds of folder all following the naming scheme a_b_x with x being a random word

65302
filesystems	fat
so are all your processes going to access one file or one filesystems on a slow storage or one ipc resource with a big fat lock etc

65337
subtract	add
from the result then i add all numbers and subtract the total to obtain the number of files under 1k

65340
sudo	passwd
should one always set a root passwd or is sudo -i acceptable

65340
sudo	passwd
sudo -i eliminates the need for a passwd

65341
sudo	passwd
the reason sudo is better than having a root passwd and using su in a multi admin environment is because with su every admin has to know the root passwd so if you ever want to revoke an admin s access you have to change the passwd and tell all of the other admins

65366
min	max
basic control theory functions would be a significant plus max min overshoot state-space model transformations pid tuning controller synthesis

65367
matplotlib	scipy
i would probably use python + scipy + numpy + pyserial + matplotlib + any web framework if you eventually plan to control this over the network

65369
versioning	upgrade
i have been performing an upgrade for a customer using solaris live upgrade to go from solaris 10 update 2 to solaris 10 update 10 and at the same time upgrade emc powerpath from an old versioning to versioning 5.5

65415
switching	screens
when i was at vim age i used to enjoy working with screens which gives me the flexibility to switching between mulitple windows

65415
switching	screens
in emacs i can also open quite a few different screens and switching between them the thing is when my putty window is closed everything there is gone

65419
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	centos	debian	mint	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian	opensuse	mint	centos	mint
i have since tried ubuntu centos debian opensuse mint mageia windows 7 and windows 8

65423
vim	emacs
you can run emacs in screen just like vim

65428
unix	solaris
i am not a solaris unix expert so would appreciate any guidance to identify the correct parameters and also it would be very helpful if you could tell me the possible impact of the changes and how i could have the admin support rollback the changes

65454
daemon	cron
however when i try to use cron the cron daemon gives the message

65454
daemon	cron
the cron daemon reported that there was no such file or directory as full_path my_script.php

65460
ubuntu	linux
so you can see the capacity of your ethernet card by using lshw listing hardware command in linux ubuntu

65476
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
it is used by the transmission control protocol tcp user datagram protocol udp or the stream control transmission protocol sctp as the port assignment for the client end of a clientâ server communication to a well known port on a server

65487
disk	ram
how would the kernel allocate the memory for an initial ram disk

65505
bash	zsh
is it possible to have a similar behavior in zsh as with bash when trying to launch an executable not yet installed

65506
ubuntu	debian
the default zsh configuration for debian and probably ubuntu just doesn t include support for the command-not-found package per default

65530
cinnamon	gnome
i recently switched from gnome to cinnamon in fedora 17 and i feel like i did something wrong because it seems as though cinnamon ignores any gnome settings despite being gnome-based as far as i understand it

65530
cinnamon	gnome
does anyone know why cinnamon seems to run just fine but ignore all gnome settings

65555
opensuse	debian
... the distribution fedora debian opensuse

65576
solaris	sunos
solaris version sunos 5.10 generic_147440-13 sun4u sparc sunw sparc-enterprise

65587
icmp	tcp
however since icmp packets are also used to communicate various problems i strongly recommend you add a rule accepting all icmp packets with a type other than echo-request to make sure you don t get problems with for example tcp connections as an example connection refused is communicated using icmp

65588
filesystems	ntfs
i would like to do this with openelec or any distro and with a further complication i m a .net developer work and primarily use windows which means ntfs and fat32 are my preferred filesystems

65592
ubuntu	linux
is there a way to set up a linux based preferably ubuntu sstp server

65603
debian	linux
in linux distros like debian such tasks are usually accomplished via dpkg-divert and or update-alternatives

65620
bash	zsh
will return the exit code of the job with bash and posix shells but not zsh even if the job had already terminated when wait was started

65661
umask	mkdir	umask	sudo
if you control the -m option to mkdir and the umask of the sudo environment i think it s back to just being a nuisance

65677
debian	linux
i would like to apologize for the slightly off-topic and non-technical question but i recently started to emerge myself into the wonderful world of linux and started studying some distributions in depth the last of which was debian

65688
versioning	upgrade
in many applications what drives your choice of distro is ultimately the software you are going to run there you don t want to run your business-critical applications on a distro with a short life cycle where you will have to upgrade to a new versioning every 1 or 2 years or lose all updates

65688
centos	linux
we ran it on centos boxes but i got it working on arch linux with some work - i didn t mind doing it but in an application where this app was critical it would be unacceptable

65733
width	height
for a width 100 height 200 rgb order raw file

65768
versioning	upgrade
to fix the problem you can upgrade to a newer versioning of git

65777
vim	emacs
however if you are prepared to spend some time learning a new editor and are curious of how an editor can help you even more than most editors i recommend vim or emacs as it is possible to be very productive in them they are very capable and configurable has helpful communities and they can be used with few dependencies they may even be pre-installed on many nix systems

65777
emacs	gedit
i used to do my work in gedit but two years ago i started to learn emacs and i now do most of my work in it and i am very happy with it

65777
vim	emacs
the problem with vim and emacs is that it takes some time to learn them as they are quite unlike many other editors

65777
vim	emacs
initially it may be a good idea to use an editor you know well in parallel to vim or emacs so that you can focus on your work when you need to

65777
geany	gedit
to answer you question instead of saying to stay with gedit or recommending a wholly different editor an alternative to gedit that has fewer dependencies and the features you ask is geany

65777
geany	gedit
geany also has other features in common with gedit

65778
bash	zsh
you can do it with the shell alone works in bash dash ksh zsh

65778
bash	zsh
or if output is not needed result will be kept in a and your shell supports process substitution like bash zsh

65790
debian	linux	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
i am using debian linux and gentoo linux

65800
ubuntu	mint
the ubuntu live cd does fit on a cd so i want to use the ubuntu livecd to install mint

65806
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
debootstrap debian ubuntu mint

65806
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
i would suggest to use a debian or ubuntu network installation cd boot a basic system and then use debootstrap to bootstrap mint from it

65806
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
and since i have successfully bootstrapped debian from debian ubuntu from debian and ubuntu from ubuntu all the same architecture however i have no doubt this will work with mint as well

65819
bash	zsh
david korn realized the mistake and introduced a new form of shell quotes which was later copied by bash and zsh but it was far too late by that time

65819
bash	zsh
on some shells like bash 1 or ksh93 2 or yash variable the behavior even depends on how the shell was compiled or the environment gnu echo s behaviour will also change if is in the environment zsh s with its bsd_echo option some pdksh-based with their posix option or whether they re called as sh or not

65819
subshell	ifs
the subshell which implies spawning an extra process in most shell implementations can be avoided using local ifs with many shells or by writing it like

65852
opensuse	debian
the base for free and top on debian fedora opensuse is is procps-ng

65856
post	put
i ve looked at several articles and post but i m confused about what goes where i just want you to tell me where i should put the right entries this is a sample from this article my system info is below

65872
ubuntu	centos
i m migrating an old ubuntu openvz instance jaunty to a new centos 6.3 host using vzdump vzrestore

65882
ubuntu	linux
there are several ways to disable usually noisy pc speaker in ubuntu linux this is what beeps every time you wish to keep silent

65890
zsh	subshell
note that zsh executes the last command of the subshell in the subshell process instead of forking another one which means that if that command is external you re not even wasting a process it s just that the fork is done earlier so the umask is done in the child process that will later execute your command

65891
mouse	keyboard
i keep replugging my keyboard mouse tablet memorystick and usb-drive but nothing

65933
debian	linux
is it possible to place receive calls in linux debian

65940
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo
if you don t want this to prompt for a passwd add a line in etc sudoers by using visudo like so replace rag with your username

65970
ubuntu	linux
there is probably a lot i do not know about ubuntu linux even though i have been using it for years now so i am happy to be educated

65970
put	get
if there is no known answer on the subject of why the contrast and brightness are wrong and how to fix it then at least something i put into practice to get close to screen colour as possible in the screencast

65972
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m using linux mint debian so i will be running a desktop environment

65976
wan	lan
dovecot also supports specifying which ip addresses to listen on in its config file which popa3d also appears not to support so perhaps you might also want to use that if you want to accept pop3 connections only on the wan and not on the lan

65979
disk	ram
the machine in question is a laptop with 8 gib ram running linux x86_64 3.7.5 with a ssd as target disk

65980
debian	linux
i ve just upgraded my debian linux wheezy to a 64 bit kernel as well as user mode binaries in an attempt to make use of the 4gb of memory in the system without pae

65982
openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	debian
with pax as found on debian suse openbsd netbsd at least

65990
button	checkbox
select eth0 then the edit button takes you to an editing system eth0 dialog which has a connect automatically checkbox

65998
daemons	systemd
systemd allows users to run their own systemd instances to manage private daemons

66028
sudo	passwd
assuming that the user you can ssh to doesn t need a passwd to sudo su into the target user you can try this

66099
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
with gnu or freebsd or netbsd or openbsd and potentially others awk

66104
buildroot	uclibc
my system is a minimal embedded system built with buildroot uclibc and busybox

66118
wan	lan
physically there are 5 ethernet sockets but as it could be seen from the above info there are 2 hardware nics cb b2 32 9c 4d 2e and cb b2 32 9c 4d 2f and this appears logically lan and wan

66177
stdout	stderr
ssh does use two channels for transferring stdout and stderr so the remote commands stderr will end up on ssh s stderr

66177
stdout	stderr
above we merge the whole loop and so ssh stderr into stdout into log

66177
stdout	stderr
that is have stderr merged into stdout at the remote end but for all the commands not just the last one

66181
ubuntu	debian
i tried a couple of different os ubuntu and debian but to my surprise wireshark would only capture normal packets

66181
ubuntu	debian
any ideas what this must be and if it is possible to perform an ip fragmented scan from an ubuntu or a debian os

66184
profiler	perf
try using valgrind s cache grind profiler or perf or perf expert

66189
freebsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
at least linux and freebsd can do it with a sysctl setting and openbsd does it always

66196
ubuntu	linux
os ubuntu based bodhi linux

66217
freebsd	linux
it should be available in all major linux distributions and from what i see in freebsd

66222
filesystems	fat
i m unsure because wikipedia lists umask as an option specific to the fat filesystems

66247
folder	directory
ok i found a workaround mounting the remote windows share folder to a local directory and then doing rm -r thanks to mikhail who gave the hint here â rahimi 2 days ago

66256
bash	zsh
it should work in any posix-compatible shell dash ksh bash zsh etc

66256
bash	zsh
this behavior for this situation is also adjustable in other shells the failglob and nullglob options in bash the special n glob prefix in ksh the nomatch and null_glob options in zsh

66259
ubuntu	linux
i have written a script for installing packages on linux ubuntu

66266
installation	upgrade
if you want to upgrade an older fedora installation you have to upgrade to fedora 17 before continuing

66272
daemon	cron
while tracing the cron daemon you will see it goes to sleep with a timeout as below

66291
centos	linux
note that in red hat enterprise linux and its derivatives like centos scientific linux and oracle linux the software versions often look old

66291
versioning	upgrade
they are the versioning red hat selected way back when they cut rhel x.0 and they will only upgrade to newer versioning during the decade or so rhel x is supported if there is absolutely no other way to fix bugs

66293
sudo	passwd
i m trying to change the passwd that get s asked when doing sudo

66293
sudo	passwd
doing sudo passwd or sudo passwd root does give me the two new passwd questions and it successfully changes passwd

66293
sudo	passwd
but then i can still use my old passwd when doing sudo again for something else

66293
sudo	passwd
so root passwd is changed but not the passwd for sudo

66293
sudo	passwd
how to change sudo passwd

66294
sudo	passwd
sudo wants your user s passwd

66294
sudo	passwd
to change it try plain passwd without arguments or running it through sudo

66295
sudo	passwd
the passwd you use for sudo is the passwd of your own account not the root account

66295
sudo	passwd
to change your own passwd use passwd without sudo

66305
ubuntu	linux
i won t discuss logging with regard to ubuntu specifically much since the topic is standardized for linux in general and i believe most or all of what i have to say is also true in general for any flavor nix but don t take my word for that

66305
ubuntu	linux
the predominant syslog daemon currently in use on linux including ubuntu is rsyslogd

66305
daemon	cron
the normative method of using logrotate is via the cron daemon although it does not have to be done that way if you tend to turn your desktop off everyday you might as well just do it once at boot before syslog starts but obviously after the filesystem is mounted rw

66324
ubuntu	linux
you have not specified what linux os you are using so i will give you the steps i used to resolve the issue on my ubuntu box

66329
disk	ram
i have a machine with 62gb of ram and a trunk that s only 7gb so i thought i would create a ram disk and compile there

66329
disk	ram
i found instructions on the internet to create the ram disk

66329
disk	ram
but i changed the 8192 to 16777216 in an attempt to allocate 16gb of ram disk

66331
disk	ram
the best way to create a ram disk on linux is tmpfs

66365
debian	mint	debian	linux
i have a lenovo sl510 laptop running linux mint debian edition based on debian testing using the cinnamon de and the brightness appears to only have two settings 100 and 0

66396
kde	gnome
mandriva 2009 hosts use the gnome 2.28 environment 2010.2 hosts use gnome 2.32 2011 hosts use kde plasma and the ubuntu 11.04 hosts use unity

66413
buildroot	uclibc
i rebuild my entire target toolchain kernel and uclibc from scratch once again with the buildroot config files this time ensuring that my crosstools were created with ipv6 support

66425
g++	gcc
i m not familiar with current solaris but back when i used it gcc gcc and g++ were an absolute must

66429
opensuse	linux
i am currently working in a company that runs linux opensuse 12.1 on the workstations about 200 computers

66447
unix	bsd
this works on linux bsd and osx but is an extension to posix that other unix variants may lack

66477
gentoo	linux
in gentoo linux you can easily manage what completion you would like to have enabled using eselect bashcomp command

66478
mouse	keyboard
does it quit because it does not run in foreground and cannot get any keyboard mouse input through x server and it can t be anymore useful so it quits

66491
bash	zsh
is only expanded when it is followed by a valid variable name even if the variable is undefined â what matters is that a name follows as in or or single-character variables such as or or in the constructs also in bash and zsh and more constructs in zsh

66491
next	except
â double quotes quote every character except and inside double quotes causes the following character to be interpreted literally and is only stripped if the next character was special

66496
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
bash tcsh and zsh have ways to make the completion programmable they parse the command under the cursor and look up the rules for that particular command in a table

66496
bash	zsh
for example a package that contains a command usr bin foo can contain a file etc bash_completion foo that describes to bash how to complete arguments for the foo command and a similar file usr share zsh functions completion _foo for zsh

66497
powerpc	i386
it is roughly 2gib on i386 powerpc m68k arm 1gib on sparc 512mib on mips 128gib on alpha and 3tib on sparc64

66509
spaces	linefeed
the last command is the fastest when using perl and taking into account that it replaces not only spaces but also tabstops linefeed and so on

66520
put	get
i hope i am correct but how do i get the out put of commands logged locally errlogs and success logs

66521
daemons	systemd
if you want to get started and only want to have two systemd and don t have time to configure all your daemons accordingly you should have a look at drbd raid-1 over the network

66528
stdout	stderr
this will mean that stdout gets redirected to dev null but stderr will still end up in an email

66541
daemons	launchd
i don t have access to the syslog daemons configuration so i think in launchd a differente syslog daemons syslog-ng

66545
stdout	stderr
when a shell does this stdin stdout and stderr are connected to the terminal

66552
disk	ram
you want not to use it ever except for dire circumstances or very unusual workloads because disk is many many times slower than ram

66552
disk	ram
on the other hand disk is cheap and unless you have hard data to the contrary twice ram will do fine

66554
freebsd	linux
on linux glibc and freebsd the path that openlog uses is hard-coded _path_log from usr include syslog.h i know of no way to alter it at run time other than a chroot or .so dll injection

66555
kde	gnome
the menu items for my new project simply refuse to show up in menus on either gnome or kde

66590
vim	emacs
if you re a die-hard vim user you can try this plugin for vim that provides emacs keybindings in edit mode

66609
post	get
when i get it to work perfectly i ll post the result here

66610
put	get
zram is using the available memory i do not know exactly the internal but whatever the mechanism i can clearly imagine a scenario where linux page out put some memory from the ram to zram to get some more free space but then the zram usage in memory is growing so it would further page out which would result in further increase of zram usage and so on until zram is consuming all your physical memory

66610
disk	ram
you should not configure zram to use more than 25 imho of your physical ram which means you would have to rely still in a hard disk swap solution once zram swap is filled up

66613
jobs	cron
sysstat provides the sar command and often creates cron jobs to populate several logs with io memory cpu usage etc

66618
sudo	passwd
you can configure sudo to allow you to run this script without specifying a passwd with the nopasswd tag

66623
umask	chmod
in the case of gcc the output file is first created with permissions 666 masked by the umask then later chmod ed to make it executable

66624
cinnamon	gnome
i am running gnome cinnamon

66629
dpkg	apt
there is no difference between a package that is installed via apt and one that is installed directly by dpkg

66637
udp	tcp
i have read about raw sockets that they are unix domain sockets and don t generally go over the wire unlike tcp or udp

66643
bash	zsh
i don t know how zsh completes them but my homegrown bash completion scripts also look at .ssh config

66657
cinnamon	gnome
i don t know about cinnamon but vanilla gnome desktop used to allow you to add different keyboard layouts thorough system settings input sources

66663
ubuntu	linux
i have a windows xp installation on sda1 an ubuntu installation on sda6 and i ve installed puppy linux on sda7

66663
ubuntu	linux
currently i m running puppy linux off of sdb1 . i m not sure where grub is but i think it s either on sda6 with ubuntu or hiding somewhere in sda s mbr

66681
g++	gcc
they had redhat installed as i recall and they had access to gcc as well as g++ compilers which was awesome

66724
ubuntu	mint
unhappy with gnome 3 in ubuntu i tried mint 14

66724
debian	mint
to make room for a boot as a primary partition i killed my backup assuming that debian would simply take my existing home partition like mint had

66724
debian	mint
when i installed debian and gave it my home partition location to mount on home with instructions not to format i expected debian to behave like mint having the reputation of being more conservative not to say safer

66738
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
i would recommend fluxbox as the wm as for the distribution since you are not well versed in the linux world go with something like ubuntu server or a minimal install of fedora or opensuse

66743
debian	centos
if you don t want to try that just stick with a normal distro debian arch centos and remove as much default cruft as you can

66749
kde	gnome
notification through xorg kde gnome when syncing starts stops

66752
filesystems	fat
this is a typical behaviour of a filesystems that doesn t understand access permissions - very likely a v fat partition

66763
udp	tcp
all applications such as ping that send or receive ip packets that aren t a udp or tcp connection must use raw sockets

66765
gentoo	linux
dam small linux is a possible option if you can get wine working also looking at arch or gentoo may be suitable

66801
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
and finally bacula it is an open source network backup program that runs on a variety of os linux freebsd or solaris to name a few

66806
ubuntu	linux
i use linux 2.6.32 ubuntu 10.04.4 lts

66809
tunnel	lan
now tunnel is established but i can not ping remote lan s machine on 192.168.1.2

66853
cat	tee
i would like to be able to do both things at the same time so that i can use tee to call those commands on the output of something else for instance the echo i ve written and then collect all their results on a single output with cat

66853
cat	tee
there may be better options than cat and tee but those are the ones i know so far

66866
stdout	stderr
expect s model of interaction does not include a separation of stdout and stderr streams

66866
stdout	stderr
for another scripting language with built-in support for spawning a child process and getting its stdout and stderr separately try python and its subprocess module

66875
cat	tee
cmd1 can t tell cat there s no more input because it is waiting itself for more input from tee

66876
aspell	enchant
enchant supports up to 8 back-ends that actually do the spell-check job see home project page hunspell forked from myspell and aspell being the most popular

66895
ssd	sata
samsung ssd pm830 sata 128 gb sda - windows 7 i want to keep this

66918
put	get
i put path of the script in etc profile but because it starts before starting gnome i get errors and can t even login

66924
lan	intranet
i have wired connection to intranet lan of my work with proxy and one wireless without proxy that doesn t have access to the office lan

66933
ubuntu	linux
you don t need to create a new operating system to do this in fact what you want to modify has nothing at all to do with linux and everything to do with your desktop environment the default on ubuntu is unity

66944
disk	ram
before anybody asks the one time i ve seen processes cannot be killed and continue to use cpu and ram unlike a defunct zombie process is when there is outstanding commited i os eg sync returned but not physically on disk yet

66948
ubuntu	debian
this works for me with debian 6 and ubuntu 12.04

66982
ubuntu	linux
i have tried few system ofc ubuntu but also puppy linux but they all didn t run kernel panic while booting or works very slow

66982
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
all i need is os with drivers for hdd windows filesystems fat ntfs and terminal with cp

66988
pypdf	pdftk
i find python with the pypdf library convenient for those jobs that pdftk doesn t do conveniently or at all

67000
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m using linux mint debian edition with cinnamon

67000
switching	screens
i m forced to switching back to another tty and restart mdm mint display manager to get back to the log in screens and thus losing whatever i was working on

67020
chown	chmod
one solution would be to create your own program that calls fchown chown it to root wheel and set the setuid bit chmod +s files run with the setuid bit will be run as the owner the the executable

67029
stdout	stderr
wrapper approach assuming you still want to see the output and keep stdout and stderr separate in the output

67039
ubuntu	linux
i have no background in linux ubuntu bash perl python etc

67056
profiling	benchmarking
depending on your distro you may already have hardinfo installed for example on lubuntu it is called system profiling and benchmarking

67061
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
you can build .deb files for arbitrary versioning of node.js so you can install upgrade uninstall it easily

67107
filesystems	btrfs
change the type if needed with t for partitions holding an extx or btrfs filesystems the default of 83 is fine

67112
xfs	btrfs
i agree with vonbrand btrfs is not yet to the maturity level of ext or xfs or jfs to name a few

67124
bash	zsh
running a command at each shell prompt with zsh s preexec or bash s prompt_command at least doesn t risk breaking stuff

67126
bash	zsh
the pattern is not a basic shell pattern it s a ksh extension that bash and zsh also support if you set the appropriate option

67127
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m following the debian selinux setup guide with my linux mint debian edition system

67131
bash	zsh
bash pdksh and zsh lag behind

67227
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
afaik that header file is more an old-school unix or bsd thing you can find it in solaris and free open net bsd

67251
stdout	stderr
by default cron emails the stdout and stderr of a process to the owner of the crontab using sendmail see man cron

67251
stdout	stderr
it won t wait and if the program now tries to write to stdout or stderr it will get a sigpipe because the pipe is broken the read end was closed

67251
stdout	stderr
meaning the stdout is redirected to a file but the stderr pipe is still broken

67263
processors	hyperthreading
you probably have one processors with two cores and hyperthreading technology

67267
queue	fifo
recently i noticed that the error message iwlwifi 0000 03 00.0 fail to flush all tx fifo queue appears in dmesg then my wlan is very slow to the point that names will fail to resolve 90 of the time

ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
it happens both in ubuntu 12.10 kernel 3.5 opensuse 12.3 kernel 3.7 and arch linux kernel 3.7.10 or 3.8.2-ck

ethernet	wireless
it can actually see the wireless networks i can even connect to my home network but if i unplug the ethernet cable the internet is not working not a single page loads in the browser

67313
packets	multicast
it means you are allowed to receive multicast dns packets dpt destination port 5353 multicast dns udp is the protocol 224.0.0.251 is a destination multicast address 0.0.0.0 0 means from anywhere

67315
packets	multicast
that iptables rule is allowing incoming udp packets on port 5353 that are destined for the multicast address 224.0.0.251

67326
mouse	keyboard
install kvm software like synergy on every computer running the server on the computer with the keyboard and mouse

67329
put	get
if someone else controls the network gear you could talk to him her and see if you can get the restriction put in place on the router

67349
switching	screens
the vt switching should still be okay i generally don t do the screens locking since i use this by myself so ymmv

67393
bash	zsh
for your overlapping problem on linux and with bash or zsh but not with ksh93 you could do it as

67397
versioning	upgrade
what versioning should i choose for long term production use and should i upgrade the system versioning when newer versioning comes out

67410
centos	linux
centos is a repackaging of red hat enterprise linux rhel

67415
mouse	keyboard
when typing startx for the first time my mouse keyboard and everything else worked fine

67415
mouse	keyboard
again when typing startx for the first time my mouse and keyboard worked fine

67423
bash	subshell
p.p.s. you can t export variables from subshell which is always created while using pipe | in bash or

67428
daemons	systemd
so i asked on the #systemd irc channel and it turns out that journald the logging daemons of systemd does not periodically flush the logs to disk at all

67435
sudo	passwd
can someone please point out why the passwd is prompted when running sudo for that command

67441
sudoers	visudo
to verify a valid sudoers file always use the visudo command and never edit the sudoers file directly

67461
gentoo	linux
for start try read the gentoo manual or google about the linux kernel

67473
ubuntu	debian
the debian command-not-found package is based on the ubuntu package

67479
ubuntu	debian
i have a virtual machine with ip 10.0.0.1 ubuntu 12.04 and i start two ssh connections to 10.0.0.2 debian 6 from it 10.0.0.2 is a vm as well

67481
udp	tcp
using tcp instead of udp may also help

67485
ssd	sata
try to plug the ssd in the first sata port and select it as the first boot device in bios

67488
sudo	passwd
i get the same behaviour doing sudo more asks for a passwd same as sudo

67499
libpcap	wireshark
to do what it does knockd uses the libpcap library which is the same one that wireshark uses

67507
bash	zsh
shell process substitution as available in ksh zsh or bash can help us with that and even take care of the backgrounding

67507
stdio	fputs
the commands or rather the stdio api of the libc they call printf fputs fwrite ... detects that the output is not going to a terminal and perform an optimisation by outputting in big chunks several kilo-bytes while they don t do that for standard error

67507
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

67512
bash	zsh
if you re using bash version 4 or higher or zsh you can also use recursive globbing

67513
disk	ram
the messages above show that it mounts the ram disk successfully 1 0 1 is for ram so dev ram0 but not the real root file system dev sda1 8 1 8 is sd 1 is a1

67513
disk	ram
then the kernel would treat the ram disk as the real root file system though you could still pivot_root to another one

67516
folder	directory
you may analyse the files that have changed the files which doesn t exist in the other directory and all the differences between the two multiple sets of folder

67520
folder	directory
i usually create bin folder in my projects that i am working in and i hate doing bin command it would be nice to have command be picked up by bash as long as i am in the directory with a bin folder and that bin folder contains a command executable

67535
pulseaudio	mixer
it s a command line mixer for pulseaudio

67550
post	get
also try to post the exact errors that you re getting so we can get a better understanding as to what s going on

67589
ubuntu	linux
chromium 18 on ubuntu linux 10.04 lucid 2.6ghz 1.23gib ram

67596
daemons	systemd
i m almost certain it s not the systemd caching the response - that part systemd caching is only handled by the nscd daemons

67604
zsh	tcsh
that is save the environment when tcsh starts and restore it when you execute zsh

67617
folder	directory
if the program is really so unfriendly as to expect you to run it only from it s own directory then you may have to leave it in it s own directory including sub folder and create a script which is on your path

67630
unix	aix
i am having aix 64 bit unix machine and i need to connect to microsoft sql server 2008 r2 database

67642
daemons	systemd
if systemd is running as the systemd init daemons then this is already happening

67652
stdout	stderr
using bash how do i copy stderr and stdout to a log file and also leave them displayed on the console

67671
folder	directory
but since these require super user privileges i decided to create a copy of these binaries in my personal script folder and set the suid flag i am the only one who can read and execute that directory

67672
versioning	upgrade
i would like to incrementally upgrade to the latest centos versioning where that application works

67680
daemons	systemd
the positive side would be that utf-8 would become the default charset for any process even systemd daemons

67685
centos	linux
i am working on centos 5.2 and custom kernel patched from linux 2.6.18

67718
switching	screens
glance vi and others switching to the alternate screens when they start and switching back when they exit

67718
switching	screens
from a script you can obtain the control sequence to switching between screens with tput smcup and tput rmcup smcup and rmcup are the terminfo capabilities to switching into and out of full screens mode

67736
bash	zsh
with ksh93 zsh or bash

67754
sudo	passwd
su uses the root passwd while sudo uses the current user passwd

67755
sudo	passwd
sudo requires the passwd of the current user - that is the passwd for user kshitiz

67755
sudo	passwd
by running sudo su you are effectively becoming root then running su to get a root shell - that is your privileges are already elevated to root before the call to su is executed which is why you don t get prompted for the root passwd again

67769
min	max
different rows will need different max min limits

67781
ubuntu	linux

i using an old versioning of rhel that i have recently upgrade from 5.4 to 5.8 with a customised 2.30.9 kernel

67789
zsh	tcsh
in order to inherit the environment from tcsh when i switch to zsh i usually first start an interactive shell in tcsh and later switch to zsh with exec zsh

67789
zsh	tcsh
however sometimes we update our tcsh init files and i need to refresh my environment accordingly from a running zsh shell

67789
zsh	tcsh
i believe the best way to approach this problem is to switch to tcsh to source its init filts and then switch back to zsh

67789
zsh	tcsh
what other ways are there for fully restarting my interactive shell while re-sourcing my non-interactive environment as if i was logging in again in tcsh and then switching to zsh

67797
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
in fact you can specify in the etc sudoers file use visudo which passwd the user who issues sudo has to enter

67797
sudo	passwd
were uncommented you would have to enter the root-password to run passwd with root-permissions via sudo

67817
folder	directory
launched from within a directory it will show you what folder and files use disk space by ordering them biggest to smallest

67850
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
zfs originated in solaris in 2004 and now available in a few unices including freebsd and linux though on linux still in beta and not in the mainline kernel due to licensing issues also allows to add one or more secondary caches called l2arc on any block device for that same kind of purpose

67862
lan	intranet
if you are using internal intranet dns server in your lan

67874
titlebar	window
in many de or wm when you maximize the window and then try drag the window from the titlebar the window would be unmaximized

trying to install prop drivers for my radeon hd6850 card on crunchbang debian-based linux

67911
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i recently upgraded to linux mint from ubuntu

67919
zlib	libpng
there s no reason not to do a normal configure make install of some of these packages to usr local especially glib-2.0 zlib libpng libxml2 -- unless they conflict with something you already have installed

67929
sudoers	visudo
why it is recommended to edit etc sudoers file with the visudo command

67931
sudoers	visudo
the reason for this is that visudo will verify the file does not have syntax errors prior to overwriting the current sudoers

67932
sudoers	visudo
in addition to the syntax checks previously mentioned visudo also locks etc sudoers so that it can t be edited by two users simultaneously

67932
sudoers	visudo
visudo etc sudoers busy try again later

67941
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
surely once a distro becomes more and more mission critical we re into global unix suppliers ibm aix oracle solaris

67947
centos	linux
if that s your definition suse enterprise linux red hat enterprise linux oracle linux scientific linux centos etc

67947
ubuntu	linux
if you mean distributions where you can sign a support contract red hat el and suse enterprise linux qualify and i believe canonical offers ubuntu support contracts as well

67949
postfix	dovecot
we re using lmtp for postfix to communicate with dovecot with local delivery

67972
udp	tcp
on unix machines only root can bind tcp or udp ports below 1024

67984
ubuntu	linux
the server runs ubuntu linux with ext4 on the disks and without lvm

67995
umount	mdadm
tearing it down before reboot shutdown will probably just work but you umount it then mdadm --stop dev md test then losetup -d on both of the loop devices

68001
post	get
i got the idea of how to get the first line from this post on stackoverflow and the idea of how to delete the first line from this post on unix.com

68003
put	get
i have added this script to my startup in fluxbox i don t know where to put it for openbox so each time a session is started my two monitors get configured

68003
switching	screens
i have several workspaces and if i switching between them then i switching workspace for the two screens

68008
sudoers	visudo
to preserve your environment variables as sudoers add to your sudoers file sudo visudo

68035
bash	zsh
is there a way to make this work the same in bash and zsh

68035
bash	zsh
this works in bash but not zsh

68042
bash	zsh
in bash i can use for double substitution in zsh

68058
jobs	cron
cron jobs don t even have a tty let alone an x display

68059
stdout	stderr
so in the run script for the process there is the following lines to redirect stderr to stdout

68062
vim	gedit
if you re regularly finding yourself needing to use both vim and gedit together you should probably switch to gvim the gui version of vim

68068
debian	linux
distro debian gnu linux 6.0.4 squeeze

68081
folder	directory
if your linux distribution and its kernel are recent enough that you could mount the network share as a normal user but under a folder that the user own you will have the proper credentials to write file mount the shared folder somewhere under your home directory like for instance

68085
folder	directory
by complex directory structure i mean that there s a root folder with more than 150 subfolders and for each subfolder there are minimum 3 subfolders

68093
ubuntu	freebsd
i have ubuntu 12.10 as host os and freebsd 9 as guest os in virtualbox 4.1.18

68093
ubuntu	freebsd
i have samba installed in both ubuntu and freebsd and shared a few folders from virtualbox also ticking the automount option

68093
ubuntu	freebsd
how to share folder files between host ubuntu and guest freebsd from virtualbox

68097
ubuntu	freebsd
it is possible to mount either a shared freebsd folder or a shared ubuntu folder with samba

68097
ubuntu	freebsd
then on freebsd mount the ubuntu share by using the correct ip address 10.0.0.2 is probably the one for your nat router created by virtualbox and therefore it probably won t work for example either use the ubuntu ip address on your lan 192.168.1.x or the one that was defined for the host-only interface

68113
ubuntu	mint
yes although i haven t used mint - this answer is based on fedora and ubuntu both of which i ve done it with

68127
cpu	processors
reason long lock hold times also keeps the current processors from scheduling meaning a higher priority process may have to wait to get the cpu

68164
chown	chmod
if i remove the setuid bit or remount my root filesystem nosuid sshd and gnu screen stop working because they call grantpt 3 on their master pesudoterminals and glibc apparently executes this program to chown and chmod the slave pseudoterminal under dev pts and gnu screen cares about when this function fails

68168
disk	ram
the process isn t maxing out my ram before death 12 gb free and disk space is ok

68189
filesystems	fat
what is the best way to defragment a fat filesystems when running linux unix on usb stick for instance

68198
kde	gnome
i only want the basic x window system without gnome or kde

68198
kde	gnome
i ve found numerous guides online that ask me to install gnome or kde but is it possible to use the basic x window system without them

68206
ubuntu	linux
unetbootin allows you to create bootable live usb drives for ubuntu fedora and other linux distributions without burning a cd

68218
folder	directory
i m using encfs to encrypt a few directory in my home folder

68271
bash	zsh
both bash and zsh have a way to perform indirect expansion but they use different syntax

68301
jobs	cron
you could have a cron job that calls the script more than once but you ll have to be careful that the jobs don t start overlapping each other in case the script takes longer than expected

68307
kate	gedit
i took a screenshot with kile skype 2.6 kate and gedit for comparison

68338
ati	nvidia
i can t recommend you a card as it s not allowed but keep in mind that nvidia ati

68343
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r username username home username

68353
bluetooth	usb
it makes much more sense to ask if sound output is available without regard if it is on-board via usb by bluetooth or maybe even over wifi to some media center

68358
comm	grep
or loop and grep each line to a new file then compare files with comm

68363
bash	zsh
as the tags indicate i have cygwin installed but can also boot into ubuntu where i have access to bash and zsh if this makes the problem easier

68370
switching	screens
is obviously the correct answer but if you re switching back and forth frequently something like screens or tmux might be helpful too

68383
bash	zsh
in bash or ksh or zsh you can use typeset to make a local variable declare is synonymous in bash

68384
bash	zsh
bash follows zsh s convention here where the function that generates completions for somecommand is called _somecommand and if that function requires auxiliary functions they are called _somecommand_stuff

68388
filesystems	xfs
rhel 7 uses xfs as its default filesystems and it was an install-time option in rhel 6

68388
rhel	suse
there are many other linux distros and rhel and suse are not the most popular distros across the entire linux space but they are the big iron distros of choice

68420
debian	linux	disk	ram
from the howto provided by you in the last step provide the boot image use the direct link from the debian mirror stable release to download the newest kernel linux and init ram disk initrd.gz

68440
sudo	passwd
you re going to need more levels of quoting to get this right but even with that it still won t work because sudo requires a terminal so it can ask for a passwd and you ve redirected from stdin

68466
ubuntu	centos	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	centos
right now our servers are debian-based ubuntu server lts but i am considering switching to red-hat based centos because of yum s rollback feature

68472
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian
updates on fixed-versions distributions like debian ubuntu rh centos fedora sles opensuse are unlikely to break anything unless you are misusing the packages in question in some weird way

68475
centos	linux
personally i d use either red hat enterprise linux or a clone like centos perhaps supplemented with epel

68475
redhat	fedora
but that s just me redhat user from around 95 lately fedora fan

68488
bash	zsh
it is the ancestor of most bourne-like shells like ksh bash or zsh

68504
ssl	https
ssl and ssh can actually be distinguished but many proxies don t bother however almost all https sites are on the default port 443 so proxies often only bounce connections to port 443

68532
filesystems	hfs+
if the file was not open in append mode with o_append then the file will appear as big as before the next time the application writes to it though with the leading part sparse and looking as if it contained nul bytes but the space will have been reclaimed that does not apply to hfs+ filesystems on apple os x that don t support sparse files though

68547
daemons	launchd
basically there s two options set a default gtk2 .gtkrc-2.0 and gtk3 .config gtk3 settings.ini theme or simply launchd the settings daemons iirc gnome-settings-daemon which would set the theme from your gconf

68548
kde	gnome
is independant of any desktop environments gnome kde ... and

68562
freebsd	solaris
though there seem to be several derivative of open solaris which are mentioned above you might consider choosing a modern version of freebsd

68570
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
for the last few years i been using linux mint and i like it but i am getting tired of it since it is too big to my taste now and i want an easier faster and more lightweight one however i am used to apt-get in ubuntu and debian

68574
stdout	stderr
i d prefer stdout stderr to still go to my terminal

68583
ubuntu	debian
similar to the question uninstalling default vboxguestadditions on debian but a ubuntu install and the solution there isn t working for me

68587
versioning	upgrade
windows will overwrite the boot sector whenever you install it upgrade it to a new versioning or use tools like bootrec fixmbr bootrec fixboot or the older fdisk mbr

68587
unix	bsd
you could also install 100 unix linux or bsd and simply run windows in a virtual machine if the computer is strong enough for that

68603
disk	ram
what i would like to know is why instead of dumping the core of the crashed process to the disk a new process that holds the entire core in the ram is being started

68638
dpkg	apt
you could probably compile dpkg apt on tinycore but then you d have to package stuff on your own

68649
ubuntu	mint
though mint 14 is based on ubuntu 12.10 i get the following error when running the intel driver manager under mint

68694
bash	zsh
therefore based on this experiment it seems that in bash one can omit the double quotes inside but not inside nor in command-line arguments whereas in zsh the double quotes may be omitted in all these cases

68694
bash	zsh
i m primarily interested in zsh bash and bin sh

68706
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade is to replace a piece of hardware or software with a better and usually newer versioning or component

68718
switching	screens
that i can use screens to connect to the switching but when i try the command

68718
debian	mint	debian	linux
this is on debian 7.0 but i have tried it on a linux mint as well

68747
freebsd	linux
the freebsd version is here that is probably nearer the macos one than the linux version

68748
bash	zsh
the zsh designers decided to make it incompatible with traditional shells bourne ksh bash but easier to use

68753
stdout	stderr
i also want to redirect stdout and stderr to a log file

68757

68789
opera	google-chrome
also i noticed that sometimes after viewing a video in opera it starts to work in google-chrome too

68811
switching	screens
but here s something a bit annoying when i switching on terminals from 1 to 6 the visual space is shrunk to get into the upper left corner of my screens leaving the rest unused

68818
filtering	grouping
we then will filtering our chroot restrictions to that grouping or put the users to a local grouping to restrict their sftp access to their own home directories

68846
folder	directory
so basically a command that looks inside the parent directory or the current directory deletes all folder from within it but keeps all other content and files that are not a folder or contained within a folder

68847

daemons	systemd
user authorization events are typically logged by the systemd logging daemons in var log

68879
filesystems	btrfs
would using a filesystems with a fast transparent compression such as btrfs + lzo help

68891
debian	centos
i m currently migrating a centos environment to a debian one

68891
debian	centos
user id conflicts this is easily resolvable by adding 500 to the uids in the centos shadow file since centos started uids at 500 while debian starts them at 1000

68891
debian	centos	hash	md5
it seems centos hash its passwords with md5 while debian uses sha-512

bash	zsh
in the commercial unix side the korn shell the at t variant though more the ksh88 one is the norm and both bash and zsh are in optional packages

69012
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
on the bsds the preferred interactive shell is often tcsh while sh is based on either the almquist shell or pdksh and bash or zsh need to be installed as optional packages as well

69012
bash	zsh
specify the interpreter and its version python 2.6 or above zsh 4 or above bash 4.2 or above... as a dependency for your script either by building a package for every targeted system which specifies the dependency or by stipulating it in a readme file shipped alongside your script or embedded as comments at the top of your script or by adding a few lines in bourne syntax at the beginning of your script that checks for the availability of the requested interpreter and bails out with an explicit error when it s not like this script needs zsh 4.0 or above

if your application runs only on linux you could use a tool like opensuse build service that can be used for development of the opensuse distribution and to offer packages from same source for fedora debian ubuntu suse linux enterprise and other distributions

69037
stdout	stderr
stdout fd 1 will point to filename and afterwards the stderr fd 2 will point to the the target of stdout in this example filename

69037
stdout	stderr
that means that both stdout and stderr get redirected to filename

69037
stdout	stderr
here stderr fd 2 will point to the target of stdout and afterwards stdout fd 1 will redirect to filename

69037
stdout	stderr
this means that stderr will redirect to the original target of stdout and stdout gets redirected to filename

69067
children	parent
unnamed or anonymous pipes provide a means of one-to-one one-way interprocess communication between different processes that are related by either a parent-child relationship or by being children of a common parent that provides the pipe such as a shell process

69068
bash	zsh
think of a standard shell | pipeline which is unidirectional several shells ksh zsh and bash also offer coprocesses which allow bi-directional communication

69078
put	get
so you couldn t put this wrapper script in a directory earlier in your path and let it get found when you run rm and have the unwrapped normal rm available by typing the full path bin rm as you do above

69082
zsh	tcsh
zsh by default asks you for confirmation when you try and run any command called rm with as a whole word on the command line a feature inherited from tcsh though in tcsh it s not enabled by default

69100
debian	linux
some linux distribution ship with a href rel nofollow noreferrer dash the debian almquist shell instead

69106
put	get
i m creating several packages using a single rules file and if i put the configuration files into conffiles i get an error when building the packages since the files are only present in two of the 9 packages

69126
switching	screens
i m completely ok with switching login managers or screens lockers

69127
ati	nvidia
i also agree regarding nvidia vs ati

69127
ati	nvidia
here s one comparing performance between that ati card and an nvidia gtx680

69135
bash	zsh
you re in zsh not bash

69141
bash	tcsh
also for every user whose default shell is bash change their group to bash and for those with shell tcsh change their group to tcshgroup

69142
bash	zsh
for example here s how to change users shell to zsh whenever it was bash before

69159
stdout	stderr
if you need the stdout stderr of the command you can redirect them to a file and cat it later

69167
disk	ram
i need to make three commands and put it in bash script that print used details of cpu usage used average all cores in multi core cou disk usage only partition ram only used mb in as shown below

69172
sudo	passwd
but the question is that how to securely automate running commands with root if we have to sudo su - first on the server and give passwd in it

69174
bash	tcsh
description if this should be done before or after the bash tcsh switch of

69184
postfix	dovecot
i ve just started learning to configure selinux and this morning on my centos 6.4 x64 system with postfix dovecot mysql installed i woke up to the following selinux issue

69191
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux and just for fun i want to create a hardlink to a directory as seen here

69198
subnet	packets
the packets are most likely addressed to 255.255.255.255 or the hightes ip of your subnet probably still ending with 255

69198
udp	tcp
the ip packet should contain a udp segmemt not tcp but it may still be addressed to port 6112

69201
sudo	passwd
then you set up public key authentication so that you can ssh root server -p 666 rm -rf from your desktop machine without the need for sudo and a passwd

69207
ubuntu	linux
tips - if you happen to have another linux distro on the same pc or have ubuntu installed with windows for cases where your only internet access was actually the wireless card you can go to the other operating system download the needed packages will take some time put them in a special folder then go back to ubuntu and access that folder

69208
next	except
since you want both the prompt before the error and after the error that one includes both except for prompts that would otherwise appear both as the prompt after one error and the one before the next error to match your sample output

69211
debian	mint	debian	linux
the nfs server is on linux mint and the client which mount remote partition is debian 6

69237
freebsd	linux
it seems like you re new to freebsd and coming from a linux background

69250
bash	zsh
best would be to use expr instead or the operator of ksh93 zsh or bash

69276
disk	ram
pages of process memory may be displaced from the ram to the disk

69319
bash	zsh
had you used zsh or t csh instead of bash you d have understood your mistake

69319
bash	zsh
note that bash can be configured to work like zsh in this case by doing

69319
bash	zsh
you can get away without doing that in bash or other bourne-like shells except zsh but that makes for dormant bugs ready to kick in the day you run the command in a directory that has a matching file

69321
debian	linux
booting different linux without messing with the partition table is interesting for different purposes an alternative solution to a shared filesystem is to use loop volumes here the few changes needed supposing you have a debian loop file volume into the dev sdb1 filesystem i m using current gnu debian sid unstable for both main and loop os

70348
bash	zsh
in case anyone is using other shells than bash ksh93 and zsh have a floating point variable if you do a typeset -f seconds which can be handy to measure time with accuracy

70362
centos	linux
i would like to install my own copy of emacs 23 on a centos 5 linux where i don t have admin rights

70362
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
i would like to have my own modern copy of emacs on this centos 5 system since i ve got a problem with the fonts when running emacs-21 through an ssh connection to a centos 5 linux while my local system is a more modern ubuntu 12.04.2

70366
sudoers	passwd
then configure sudoers to allow those commands to be run without a passwd by the user or group which is supposed to run the script

70368
folder	directory
when i type mount -f nfs 10.12.13.2 username remote username the folder username gets mounted in the directory remote username

70373
filtering	grouping
the way you can figure out what grouping you need to filtering by is by using this will give you a list of all the grouping that user is a part of

70380
ubuntu	debian
if you re a debian or ubuntu user this is fairly easy using kernel-package make-kpkg

70392
filesystems	ntfs
i would mount ecryptfs on the ntfs filesystems and still use rsync - as long as you don t need to read the files from windows

70403
ubuntu	debian
i have both debian squeeze and ubuntu 10.04 machines

70403
ubuntu	debian
can i simply install a few packages from ubuntu on my debian box and have it work

70403
freetype	cairo
if so which are the relevant packages cairo freetype xft are the libraries which seem to keep getting mentioned

70403
ubuntu	debian
alternately are there patches i can pull from the ubuntu deb sources that i can apply to to the corresponding debian versions and rebuild

70411
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
there is no smbmount on linux mint nor on ubuntu anymore

70417
ubuntu	debian
if that doesn t solve your problem outright ubuntu tends to be a bit ahead of debian stable because it s much less rigorous about what they consider acceptable for a stable release i d still recommend you look at debian backports before you start trying to graft ubuntu packages onto a debian system especially where libraries are concerned

70459
bash	zsh
how do echo and printf treat backslashes in zsh bash and other shells

70459
bash	zsh
in zsh and bash

70471
bash	zsh
zsh echo behaves the standard way like bash in unix mode

70476
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
avoid names that are already taken by standard commands or shell builtins or keywords at least of the most common shells like bash zsh tcsh or ksh

70495
manjaro	archlinux
is it safe to use archlinux s repository within manjaro linux installation

70498
ssd	sata
or does the cpu and sata port slow down the ssd too much

70511
ubuntu	debian
on debian and derivatives including ubuntu this is easy with a simple call to rename

70514
stdout	stderr
piping to stdout and stderr

70522
ubuntu	linux
how does linux ubuntu apt manage libraries and executables with name clashes

70529
debian	linux
on my debian linux system during the install i decided to use disk encryption the one offered during a regulard debian install

70536
stdout	stderr
your shell has three open file descriptors 0 stdin 1 stdout and 2 stderr

70540
filesystems	btrfs
use a filesystems with support for copy-on-write files like btrfs

70543
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
the block device may then be formatted in any normal filesystems one could desire ext2 3 4 xfs jfs btrfs kernel 3.2 or later

70543
filesystems	btrfs
zfs does a lot more with the underlying discs than most btrfs excluded other filesystems

70550
ubuntu	debian
your error message shows that you have the rename command from the util-linux package and not the perl script found on debian and derivatives including ubuntu

70563
filesystems	btrfs
alternatively you may store your files on a filesystems that performs copy-on-write or deduplication or have a snapshot feature and not worry about hard links btrfs or zfs

70572
width	height
you can run a program inside an emacs window and emacs displays it in a dumb terminal of infinite width and height

70577
stdout	stderr
the java -version command prints to standard error stderr so in order to parse we need to redirect stderr to stdout

70592
daemons	systemd
as you are still using the old init systemd you have to add iptables to the daemons array in your rc.conf

70594
xfce	kde
in modern des like kde or xfce you can mount a luks device after entering the password

70646
redhat	fedora
oh yeah and the theory is that this will stop boot sector viruses or at least make the creators create steal someones id and pay 99 to verisign the redhat fedora route

70648
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade to the latest versioning of cinnamon

70665
sudo	passwd
i m not sure if sudo supports so i want to execute a command only if this command is configured as nopasswd that is if the command can be run without passwd run it

70666
sudo	passwd
the -n non-interactive option prevents sudo from prompting the user for a passwd

70666
sudo	passwd
if a passwd is required for the command to run sudo will display an error message and exit

70666
sudo	passwd
problem with this is that you can t tell directly from the exit code if sudo failed because it required a passwd or if the command you ran failed

70679
put	get
you can put your end-of-file summary in an block - it will get executed as the script exits

70692
ubuntu	centos
how can i have the same emacs fonts and antialiasing configuration that i have in my local ubuntu 12.04 also working when i open an emacs session via ssh to a centos 5 system

70693
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
on redhat based linux systems like centos or fedora it is in

70693
ubuntu	debian
and for debian based systems like ubuntu it is in

70701
daemons	systemd
a service does not have to be a daemons or program it just has to be a service that the systemd provides such as being able to get your movies there

70754
hash	md5
you can cat the three md5 sum s to a file and after that make another md5 on that file any changes to one of those hash results in mismatch at the final text file hash

70783
centos	linux
i am in the process of migrating a legacy 4gl application from sco openserver 5.0.7 to centos red hat linux 5.9

70810
spaces	delimiter
sort -k1 sort by first column delimiter by sequences of spaces and tabs

70817
filesystems	fat
and others are encoded with characters that are allowed on fat filesystems

70825
redhat	fedora
many gnome developers are employed by redhat which also sponsors fedora and fedora development

70825
redhat	fedora
disclaimer i m a fedora developer and work for redhat

70826
put	get
it seems all i need to put in my .zshrc to get this to work is the following

70830
hash	md5
you add an md5 hash to check if file was downloaded correctly and add some operations at the beginning of the file to deploy your archive

70844
execl	fork
after fork execl and setuid setgid the child process is started as another os user say user1

70895
stdout	stderr
stderr to stdout

70901
stdout	stderr
this can happen if the application is writing directly to the tty instead of stdout or stderr

70904
rmdir	mkdir
mkdir rmdir mknod and rename

70915
factors	mean
doesn t look like the pam module assuming you mean the google authenticator module they introduce for two factors authentication has any options to support this natively so you ll probably have to futz around with the pam stack control flags

70935
daemons	launchd
i m trying to follow the archwiki guide for writing a custom service file to launchd davmail as a system-wide daemons

70939
disk	ram
it is very useful when you know that your commands depend on a lot of ram a lot of disk use give a lot of output or for whatever reason it s better not to run them all at the same time while you want to keep your resources busy for maximum benfit

70939
ubuntu	debian
task-spooler is available in debian ubuntu and other distros

70941
ubuntu	linux
linux gnu linux kernel 3.5.0-25-generic ubuntu 12.10

70965
stdout	stderr
this is for redirecting the stderr stdout

70965
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr and stdout to stdin of piped command cmd1 | cmd2

70965
stdout	stderr
redirect both stderr stdout to dev null nothing shows up on console

70965
stdout	stderr
redirect stdout to dev null only stderr shows on console

70971
stdout	stderr
it redirects file descriptor 2 stderr and descriptor 1 stdout to dev null

70980
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
when i extract some file mp3 with japanese or korean characters within its filename on windows they appear normally but when i extract it on linux ubuntu mint they appear as something like this

71009
igmp	udp
i am using a centos 6.3 server to subscribe to udp multicast data and i noticed that my server doesn t answer the igmp queries sent by the switch it is connected to

71045
freebsd	linux
on linux there is as yet no message count field -- unlike freebsd which provides a curmsg value

71045
perl	tcl
there are also ruby perl and tcl modules for this the ruby one comes with a posix-mq-rb cli tool

71054
daemons	systemd
note sleep 2 in the above script is needed on my systemd so that lo starts after gpasted clipboard manager daemons otherwise for some unknown reason gpasted goes crazy

71055
ubuntu	opensuse
i recently started trying opensuse 12.3 after having used ubuntu for a few years

71055
ubuntu	opensuse
can this use of sudo from ubuntu in which sudo seems to use the same preferences gpg keys as the regular user be replicated in opensuse

71060
put	get
warning just because you put something in ram doesn t mean no one else can get to it

71065
jobs	cron
on ubuntu 12.04 how can i configure cron to log to a particular file when it runs jobs as a particular user

71077
folder	directory
the test .php files i uploaded to the var www html directory worked fine but after extracting a tarball with a folder inside of it to that directory i receive a 403 forbidden error when attempting to access it

71079
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
this will call checkrestart every time that dpkg was called by apt and of course any other tool that relies on apt such as aptitude and finished successfully

71100
bash	zsh
in bash ksh or zsh you can use ksh s additional glob patterns to remove any number of leading 0 s

71107
folder	directory
i have a large collection of files packed into a two-level directory structure with many many many folder

71111
put	get
if i can get this to work i can simply put my computer to sleep and wake it back up and have the keyboard working again

71126
chown	chmod
chmod chown commands will let you access directories

71137
bash	zsh
maybe not what you re asking for but this should work to some extent to identify the interpreter currently interpreting it for a few like thompson osh bourne bourne-again bash korn ksh88 ksh93 pdksh mksh zsh policy-compliant ordinary posh yet another yash rc akanga es shells wish tclsh expect perl python ruby php javascript nodejs spidermonkey shell and jspl at least ms wine cmd.exe command.com msdos freedos...

71149
ubuntu	debian
preferably a debian ubuntu package

71161
sudo	passwd
so in the first step the passwd is passed to sudo using the -e flag to echo so that n is really a newline and in the second run the authenticaion works without prompting for any passwd

71161
sudo	passwd
that s probably because i m within the time limit in which the sudo passwd has to be entered only once

71178
ubuntu	debian
in debian or ubuntu you can install it with apt-get install fdupes

71178
redhat	fedora
in fedora redhat centos you can install it with yum install fdupes

71178
gentoo	linux
on arch linux you can use pacman -s fdupes and on gentoo emerge fdupes

71193
rpm	yum	dpkg	apt
things like yum are not tied to rpm in the same way that apt is tied to dpkg

71193
zypper	yum
the yum rhel and zypper sles commands are the most common

71202
rpm	dnf	rpm	yum	dnf	yum
but that has nothing whatsoever to to with rpm or yum or dnf today that is packaging repository management policy for the distribution mostly

71209
ubuntu	debian
i m not entirely sure what s broken part i confess because i m much more familiar with how it works on debian than ubuntu though its similar but i have a couple of suggestions

71219
installation	upgrade
the system in question is a ubuntu server 12.04.2 installation otherwise upgrade to latest packages

71249
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox browsers do work fine

71254
stdout	stderr
just wrap it in the following caveat we re assuming that the create bit is successful and that the output of createhomedir is on stdout rather than stderr

71260
ubuntu	linux
you could also try puppy linux or try creating your own custom ubuntu disc using ubuntu mini remix and uck remastersys ubuntu builder etc

71263
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is modern and popular ubuntu compatible so it would not be hard to get information because there are a lot of ubuntu forums

71264
freebsd	linux
the commands are for linux system and i have a freebsd system

71268
free	malloc
a segmentation violation with si_code segv_maperr 0x1 is likely a null pointer dereference an access of non-existent memory such as 0xfffffc0000004000 or malloc and free problems

71268
free	malloc
heap corruption or process exceeding its runtime limits man getrlimit in the case of malloc and double free or free of non-allocated address in the case of free

71278
mouse	keyboard
for the record i ve tried the same setup on manjaro - many mouse and keyboard issues under wine

71284
next	except
except that the make command will crash again once it reaches the next file

71284
umask	sudo
side notes i m on centos5 umask -s returns u rwx g rx o rx sudo doesn t help at all

71288
installation	upgrade
if #1 is allowed will yum upgrade my installation of mypkg if i run yum install mypkg again

71301
trojan	virus
i know that linux is virus proof but just to be sure...suppose someone writes a script trojan etc.

71368
kde	gnome
i m running debian testing xmonad window manager and many gnome and kde applications

71368
kde	gnome
i suspect that it could be a gnome or kde feature

71372
centos	linux
the issue seems to be that i can t get tmux started under the user of choice via the rc.local file linux centos 6.3 but instead it seems the tmux session belongs to root instead

71411
stdout	stderr
is necessary to redirect strace s stderr file descriptor to stdout for grep

71415
daemons	launchd
in such a case mpd should be launchd as a daemons and the user to whom the process will belong is configured in etc mpd.conf

71434
chown	passwd
chown dave . passwd

71450
dpkg	apt
a package manager is working means that something is holding a lock on var lib dpkg lock and or var cache apt archives lock

71455
ubuntu	mint
on ubuntu mint all i need to do for passwordless ssh login is

71455
manjaro	archlinux
i do the same on archlinux or manjaro it s not working on the third step it still prompts for password

71457
udp	tcp
it gathers a variety of figures such as tcp connection packet and byte counts interface statistics and activity indicators tcp udp traffic breakdowns and lan station packet and byte counts

71457
icmp	tcp
includes tcp flag information packet and byte counts icmp details ospf packet types

71457

71457
udp	tcp
tcp udp and other protocol display filters allowing you to view only traffic you re interested in

71498
stdout	stderr
as long as you don t care whether what you are looking at is from stdout or stderr you can still use tee

71508
kde	gnome
this is also used by the file-browsers under gnome and kde to select icons and the list of programs to open edit the file

71511
bash	zsh
or with process substitution ksh93 zsh or bash

71513
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
newer shells such as zsh and bash have since then acquired and surpassed tcsh s interactive features such as advanced command line edition and programmable completion while the csh family has seen little evolution since the late 1990s

71514
bash	zsh
csh had more advanced interactive feature but has been surpassed by modern bourne-style shells such as zsh and bash

71597
folder	directory
currently all regular users belong to a users group and i have set the directory owners to be their respective users ie a is the owner of the a directory inside the dropboxes directory i tried setting the permissions to 533 and 522 for all these user folder but i keep on getting the wrong result

71611
pull	push
just push your work to the stick move it to the other box and pull all the changes

71613
packets	multicast
my router sends out multicast packets in regular intervals that are blocked by ufw s standard policies

71616
ubuntu	linux
at least on my ubuntu gnu linux 12.04 no checks for ever match even though it is reported properly by udevadm info and udevadm monitor

71622
777	tmp	chown	sudo
unfortunately i have launched sudo chown 777 -r tmp instead of sudo chown 777 -r tmp

71622
ubuntu	debian
should i change it back to more secure settings or like common default settings for a debian ubuntu distro - i don t know which they were

71625
777	tmp
the problem with a tmp with mode 777 is that another user could remove a file that you ve created and substitute the content of their choice

71661
ubuntu	centos
i ve found this answer showing how to make a ubuntu system reload the iptables rules after a reboot but this directory is not present on centos

71676
postgresql	mysql
it works as with mysql mariadb so with postgresql sqlite and valentina db

71686
ubuntu	linux
i am installing oracle 11g 32bit on ubuntu linux and the setup shows the following error message on prerequisite checks screen

71701

71703
freebsd	netbsd
on mac os x 10.6.8 you have to use stat -f format because it is actually netbsd freebsd stat

71704
awk	ksh
solution can be done with sort or ksh awk sed perl one liner ...etc

71730
udp	tcp
is it possible to get net-snmp running over tcp instead of udp

71732
stdout	stderr
every process on a posix-compatible operating system has 3 i o streams stdin stdout and stderr

71732
stdout	stderr
in the first case we put stderr on a copy dup of stdout then put the old stdout in the trash

71732
stdout	stderr
in the second we first put stdout in the trash then copy it still pointed to dev null and put stderr there too

71738
udp	tcp
udp their ports tcp flags packet size and the like

71752
mp3	flv
obviously i am not dealing with mp3 files so i need the avconv equivalent of the above one-liner for dealing with mp4 and flv files

71755
sudo	passwd
on some os sudo requires the users passwd on others it s root s passwd

71757
sudo	passwd
rootpw this causes sudo to require entering root s passwd

71757
sudo	passwd
runaspw this causes sudo to require entering the target user s passwd

71760
bash	zsh
how can i do this in bash and zsh

71763
vim	emacs
i just switched to emacs from vim today so i have no idea what i am doing

71784
bash	zsh
if you want to store the command and more than it s 0th argument you can use arrays in shells that support them bash and zsh do

71817
debian	centos
i installed centos 5.3 by using a 4gb usb disk on an old pc that i used run a debian on it

for several years i ve managed a server or two on centos distro with cpanel or not and i was wondering if i should actually use a desktop linux distro based on centos rhel instead of going for something debian ubuntu like mint

71849
gentoo	linux
at my work we have an epson wp-4545 printer and the printer part works fine from linux but for scanning we can chose between to usb-memory or to computer wsd the 2nd option works fine with windows borrowed a windows computer to try but we kubuntu and gentoo

71851
ubuntu	linux
i encountered the error when attempting to transfer source files from a remote linux web server to a local hp dt1000i desktop hard driveâ connected to anâ ubuntu 12.10â box via usb

71851
chown	sudo
i tried to address this by executing sudo chown -r mike mike media hpdesktopdrive but the files are still set to root root

71855
centos	linux
as it is somewhat of the upstream of red hat enterprise linux and thus all derived distributions like centos scientific linux or oracle linux it is managed much the same

71868
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
xen and kvm work out of the box in most major desktop distros debian x l ubuntu opensuse fedora... and provided you have enough memory you can build yourself an heterogeneous virtual network of servers linux or other to practice on which you can clone modify migrate ditch at will while you keep your favourite desktop environment tuned to your taste

71873
redhat	fedora
if it is a centos system you want to learn stick with redhat based as suggested maybe fedora for a change in scenery

ubuntu	debian
under debian and derivatives including ubuntu and most non-linux systems that ship with perl the rename command is a different one which takes a perl expression as an argument instead of a string to replace and a replacement string

71903
disk	ram
for example i have the following crontab entry in root s crontab intended to populate the ram cache with the entire file system structure to speed up disk accesses

71909
mtu	pppoe
you could also be experiencing fragmentation iperf tries to send 1500 bytes packets while pppoe should have a 1492 mtu

71920
daemons	systemd
daemons are usually systemd services in arch linux hence you could run

fedora debian and a lot of debian-based distros like ubuntu linux mint opensuse have got gnome as the default desktop manager

71983
sudo	passwd
su won t ask for a passwd if the root user invoked it so if you first have used sudo or su to become root you won t need a passwd to become any other user

71995
gif	png
most common image formats are already compressed like jpg png gif so you don t get much savings

72003
versioning	upgrade
your best course of action is likely to upgrade to the latest versioning of fedora first then you will have a more recent versioning of gcc available 4.7.2

72025
stdout	stderr
when the loop finishes file descriptors 0 to 2 stdin stdout and stderr are guaranteed to be open

72114
mouse	keyboard
since upgrading to 12.04 i ve randomly experienced this strange phenomenon where my mouse mostly doesn t work and keyboard mostly does

72114
mouse	keyboard
the mouse won t be able to interact with any open windows but if i do alt+tab i can t keyboard nav through those i can only click to change windows that way

72114
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard remains focused in whatever window was just active but i can click things with my mouse to open new programs

72117
freebsd	linux
edit thanks to james i realized i glossed over the freebsd and suggested the solution i always used and took for granted on linux

72127
folder	directory
mountpoint is the directory where you want the folder to show up

72192
kerberos	ldap
this is why a lot of ldap kerberos identity services allow this type of auditing but local unix users have a hard time with it

72192
unix	solaris
to clarify the default passwd utility on some versions of traditional unix like solaris 9 i m seeing will syslog the passwd -l but i assumed we were on linux given the gnu version of passwd and that that s still insufficiently complete to be trustworthy

72203
daemons	systemd
should i simply execute to kill the systemd daemons

72235
imagemagick	mogrify
my script is called gpfl for get picture file length. i use it after doing a mogrify on a file in imagemagick before opening or re-loading a picture in a gui jpeg viewer

72259
debian	centos
i m trying to move my emails maildir from an old centos server to a new debian server

72263
bash	zsh
basically if expr and are portable all shells can handle them and handle them pretty much identically and and if expr are implementation-specific they are keywords whose evaluation depend highly on the shell you re using them in and if you re not using something like bash zsh or ksh they might not even exist

72270
versioning	upgrade
the addition of a new kernel to the list of kernels versioning to select from after an kernel upgrade of linux would change the position of the windows entry

72273
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout stderr

72273
stdout	stderr
by default stdin is the keyboard and where command usually take its input stdout is the where a command sends its output and stderr is the place where errors are printed

72273
stdout	stderr
both stdout and stderr can be redirected to the same file

72281

72328
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql databases

72352
chown	chmod
everything is working fine except for the chmod and chown lines

72352

since the script is running as root why wouldn t the chmod and chown commands be working

72369
debian	linux
by the way i run arch linux and debian

72377
ubuntu	opensuse
i also used ubuntu before opensuse

72387
int	double
if they do you could double backslashes that aren t followed by int

72395
versioning	upgrade
we hope to use 4 serial ports together on centos 5.3 could not upgrade to newer versioning due to application limitation

72430
debian	mint	debian	linux
i was quite lucky with linux mint debian edition until i found crunchbang which is the closest to debian that is currently possible for me here

72434
kde	gnome
please take this more as a general question about installing gnome apps on kde and not so much about shutter and the libs it needs

72458
centos	linux
when i started the installation it is not giving any screen to start the installation in command line mode like it did with centos 5.5 like type linux text command

72458
centos	linux
i am also wondering if the minimal install feature on centos 6.4 64bit is same as centos 5.5 32bit where if we start installation with linux text command and unselect every package including kde genome server and etc

72476
jobs	cron
i have a couple of cron jobs set up to maintain a local copy of a remote database

72477
centos	linux
i have a memory problem with a linux server centos

ethernet	wireless
how do i set up a linux box i have that has 2 network adapters one ethernet one wireless to act as invisible proxy to the network for another box connected to it via the ethernet port

72528
tar	gunzip
however gunzip followed by tar -xf works just fine

72529
ubuntu	mint
this will return false on a machine running mint even though mint is based on ubuntu

72534
tar	gunzip
so that s why it works without the -z option after you d already run gunzip once tar automatically added it

72552
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication rsa dsa ecdsa

72557
put	get
it s typically put in either a system or user s rc files such as or for bash shells so that the environment variables ssh-agent set get incorporated into your environment completely

72557
children	parent
by incorporating it into here the following environment variables are getting set as part of a parent shell therefore all forked children should also have them for example

72570
bash	zsh
is it time to start writing zsh scripts instead of bash ones

72570
bash	zsh
is it really worth to switch from bash to zsh

72572
bash	zsh
i don t think zsh will ever replace bash

72572
bash	zsh
bash is more geared towards standards and compatibility while zsh is geared more towards power

72573
hash	md5
if two files are different they have different md5 hash so storing the md5 of a file allows checking its integrity later

72573
hash	md5
the md5 cryptographic primitive has been partially broken it is possible to craft two files with the same md5 hash

72576
minimum	max
plugging in gives me max brightness and running on battery sets it at the minimum

72615
vim	emacs
it works with complex ncurses apps akin to emacs such as vim

72625
ubuntu	debian
i tried installing arch debian stable debian sid and ubuntu 12.10 from a usb thumb drive but while the bios saw the usb drive and started to boot from it as soon as the os attempted to enumerate the usb devices i lost all usb functionality including the boot device

72658
ubuntu	linux
since she is not opposed to the idea of using ubuntu instead of os x i am currently trying to transfer all of her files to my linux machine using an ethernet crossover cable

72658
filesystems	hfs+
nfs doesn t seem to like apple s hfs+ filesystems

72666
icmp	udp
a likely reason for the difference is that by default window s tracert uses icmp whereas linux traceroute defaults to udp

72673
filesystems	hfs	filesystems	hfs+
then under 13.04 you mount the hfs+ filesystems under mnt hfs

72681
x86	64bit
exactly how this works depends on the architecture the kernel is built for but for example in x86 32 and 64bit cr3 is the register that points to the current page-table

that way program s stdout is piped to tee to be written to stderr which is printed on the console

72831
debian	linux
i know that one can install debian from afaik any linux computer using debootstrap

72833
freebsd	linux
debootstrap s second stage relies on being able to chroot to the target directory as it has to run some apps in it and the linux kernel can t execute freebsd binaries afaik

folder	dir
in a folder owned by my user sites website there is a dir named

72835
folder	directory
when i cd to this directory i am redirected to my home folder

72853

unless you are on very old low spec hardware running gnome gtk apps in kde or kde qt apps in gnome should not have any noticeable impact on performance

72853
kde	gnome
when you re on kde qt kde libs are already loaded in memory gtk gnome libs are not

72869
kde	kubuntu
same problem already occurred with the stock kde 4.8.5 from kubuntu 12.04

72873
cpu	processors
as i said i want to measure the clock pulse of my pc processors s manually and my idea is just to compute the quotient between the number of assembler lines a program have and the time my computer spends to execute it so then i have the number of assembly instructions per time processed by the cpu this is what i understood a clock cycle is

72885
daemon	cron
i have a daemon implemented in bash and running by means of cron and the reboot option that shows the desktop in inactivity

72885
kde	gnome
but it a user begins for example a terminal session and not a graphical session like kde or gnome the script also continue

72894
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
new open source projects are seldom setup in cvs as more modern and capable distributed version control systems like mercurial hg git and bazaar bazaar are widely available

72901
rsa	dsa
when the same rsync command is executed from a cron job it fails because it is looking for a dsa key as shown in the logs instead of the rsa key

freebsd	linux
i m not a linux unix freebsd expert

72948
switching	screens
trying to brighten the screens using the fn keys doesn t work and the only option is to switching the machine off and on

72959
sudo	passwd
if you don t have to give sudo a passwd - perhaps because you ve already just given it - you may add an to put the whole thing in the background.

72977
ubuntu	opensuse	rhel	suse
these are controversial and not accepted by linus into mainline kernel but some distros fedora rhel ubuntu opensuse suse ship with their own secure boot patches anyway

debian	mint
if your mint distro is based on the debian testing you can open the multi-arch support by just

72982
rpm	yum
installed software yum rpm over and above default relevant to this setup

73008
bash	zsh
the accepted answer for a similar question for bash does not seem to work for zsh

73017
filesystems	xfs
they both implement a union mount where multiple filesystems like xfs ext3 4 etc

73049
filesystems	fat
and it may be true for the special filesystems like proc and for windows fat filesystems but most contemporary unix and unix-like systems seem to use inode number 1 for tracking bad blocks pushing the root up to inode number 2

73121
disk	ram
essentially you can change the size of your tmpfs it is set by default to use half your total ram but looking at your overall disk usage you have a more pressing space issue than resizing your temporary filesystem

73147
filesystems	ntfs
mounting of non-native filesystems vfat ntfs works by different way you can give options to mount to set owner of files on mounted volume permissions to that files

debian	linux
os debian linux 7.0

73191
freebsd	netbsd
basically the os x userspace is essentially freebsd with small elements of netbsd but the kernel itself is a fork of the mach kernel that makes it more monolithic in nature like the network stack and process model are in line with freebsd

73210
freebsd	linux	unix	bsd
i m after using many different unix flavors over the last 20+ years starting with bsd 2.9 on pdp11 via bsd 4.2 vax xenix sco unix consensys linux and freebsd now using os x nearly ten years

73216
folder	directory
i usually don t have root access to the system where i work so i install my packages on local folder under my home directory

73224
bash	zsh
requires bash 4.0 or higher and shopt -s globstar or zsh

73226
stdout	stderr
which will run haconf -makerw and store its stdout and stderr to haconf_out

73238
bash	zsh
if the shell is zsh or bash though not in sh mode make exit a function

73238
bash	zsh
functions have precedence over shell builtins even special ones like exit in zsh or bash though not in posix shells

73251
for-loop	loops
also note you shouldn t use a for-loop to loops over filenames

73259
gedit	nano
you can use the text editors gedit gui or nano command line to edit this file and add these lines to it

73262
disk	ram
researching about ram disk i stumbled upon a question with an answer stating that it is okay to create a directory in dev shm and use that like a temp directory

73299
ubuntu	debian
essentially i have an ubuntu laptop and a board running debian

73299

disk	ram
i thought i run the tests in a ram disk

73309
disk	ram
i also tried in a fuse based ram disk written in perl

openbsd	freebsd
the ttm memory manager is being ported to freebsd which in turn makes it easier to port to openbsd

73492
put	get
to get this extra backslash you need to put two backslashes in the original since there has already been one stage of shell expansion inside double quotes

73495
bash	zsh
add set -x at the top of .bash_profile or .profile or .bash_login if your login shell is bash or .zprofile and .zlogin and .zshrc if it s zsh

postgresql	mysql
i have mysql and postgresql as well as apache with php running on my computer so i can use solution based on these

73622
mp4	h.264
i think h.264 mp4 should work

73638
tunnel	packets
and this closes the circle because for ipv6 reverse lookup the dns ipv6 root servers would be accessed the packets would go though the 6in4 tunnel without my isp messing with them getting a response

73639
ssl	https
standard usual https enables you to establish the identity of the server from a common trusted root ca importing a client s ssl certificate in the browser that is marked as enabled for authentication is how you use ssl certs to perform client authentication

73653
rpm	yum
if from rpm would you use yum or rpm

73670
mouse	keyboard
it seems like the only practical way is to get the shellcode into my mouse s paste buffer so i can inject it while retaining the keyboard as the input device

73697
bash	zsh
many applications like vi zsh or readline based ones like gdb or bash though beware bash uses a modified version of readline allow you to add bindings for any sequence of characters

whenever i ve installed ubuntu linux mint this always happened but then i just clicked on language center and it automaticilly asked me if i want to install the remaining language packages

73732
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this is a an ubuntu screen but it was almost the same thing on linux mint

73732
debian	mint	debian	linux
however on the new linux mint debian edition with mate i cannot find that language support window

73750
ubuntu	debian
btw in other shells like dash bin sh is symlinked to dash in debian ubuntu it fails when using the function keyword

73755

73779
bash	subshell
the bash code inside the will be in the same script but running in a subshell

daemons	systemd
so in the case of port 22 that s the ssh daemons running on my systemd that s listening for connections

73782
icmp	tcp
observed in a packet sniffer on the client machine scenario #1 icmp reject message and #3 tcp rst ack message are clearly distinct

73791
ubuntu	mint
while mint is ubuntu derived i would guess that because they are not actually part of canonical ubuntu s parent organization they can t use the secure boot key canonical has which is recognized by the oems along with microsoft s

73818
ubuntu	centos
in centos and ubuntu how do i find out how much free disk space i have left and other disk stats like disk usage

73834
kde	gnome
itâ s actually a kde application a plugin to konqueror but runs just fine under gnome

73841
chown	chmod
you would need to either change the owner of the file chown or add the other user to the group root and chmod it so the group can execute on the directory or allow everyone else to execute the file

73852
stdout	stderr
or proc pid exe which simply is a link to the executable which holds file descriptors for stdin stdout stderr and other files

73854
bash	zsh
bash and zsh introduced the function keyword for compatibility with ksh

73854
bash	zsh
however in these shells and are strictly identical as is the bash and zsh extension

73875
pkcs#12	pfx
this error was telling the op that the .crt file they had wasn t a pkcs#12 pfx file

73875
pkcs#12	pfx
after reading one of the comments the op was in fact attempting to load a .crt file into a dialog within firefox that was expecting a pkcs#12 pfx formatted certificate

73875
pkcs#12	pfx
see below for how to convert a .crt to a pkcs#12 pfx cert

73875
pkcs#12	pfx
since it sounds like you have a .crt file you may be able to convert it to a pkcs#12 pfx file using openssl

73875
pkcs#12	pfx
that command is mixing together your .crt file and the ca s .crt file into a pkcs#12 pfx file

73920
folder	directory

there is nothing in var log messages or .xsession-error or on stdout stderr of firefox or google-chrome

73954
ubuntu	mint
the ubuntu version depends on the version of mint you are using

73970
mouse	keyboard
i ve pluged the type 5c in via the mini din plug under the keyboard that is for the mouse because you can t detach the 5c cable from the keyboard

73991

this works fine except for flash in firefox and google-chrome

74011
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i would like to install linux mint and remove ubuntu while still keeping my windows dual boot

74018
disk	ram
it represents how much ram is dedicated to cache disk block

74019
unix	bsd
free bsd 9 is one of the best unix systems i have seen for ppc hardware if you do not mind the subtle differences from linux

74027
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
yes assuming you ve already taken care and backed up any files of consequence on your ubuntu installation you can just select install alongside windows during the linux mint installation process

74027
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
the pre-existing ubuntu partition can safely be ignored just make sure you select the same partition that it was installed to for linux mint

74045
bash	zsh
that syntax is not posix but is supported by bash yash and zsh for compatibility with the korn shell though those shells and the pdksh -based variants of the korn shell don t treat it any different from the standard syntax

74045
bash	zsh
it only happens to be supported by accident by bash yash zsh and the pdksh based variants of the korn shell

74045
bash	zsh
it is supported by bash yash and zsh but not ksh even the pdksh -based variants

74066
ubuntu	debian
after searching quite a bit for the answer tried stuff from udevadm monitor --environment during plug and unplug with replicating all actions via udevadm trigger to looking into what the blkrrpart ioctl does without any success - i finally stumbled upon how to remount a usb stick without removing and reinserting - ubuntu debian which has the answer

74067
ubuntu	debian
i presume you re using ubuntu debian or some derivatives

74069
debian	linux
i have a problem booting my debian linux server

74070
ubuntu	mint
i m replacing ubuntu with mint but trying to keep my personal data

74083
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
as a last resort configure sudo to not require a passwd for the user by adding the nopasswd option to their sudoers entry

74088
sysv	systemd
i think the problem here is that fedora does not use sysv systemd runlevels anymore i had similar problem with archlinux so above examples doesn t work anymore

74100
pull	push
it s just the mechanism used to push updates out to clients and for those clients to pull new packages updates down from

74102
rpm	yum
does rpm yum still work

74105
stdout	stderr
you can also use this technique if you want to ignore stdout and stderr redirection to nohup.out

74127
rpm	yum
it s called gnome-disk-utility in centos6 i just confirmed that that rpm is in the default yum repos

74192
jobs	cron
or automatically have jobs run by root via cron then just setup cron jobs on the server the server doesn t depend on the client machine to login and kick off the job

74209
bash	zsh
one thing to bear in mind is that bash implemented arrays like ksh that is as associative arrays where keys are limited to positive integers contrary to other languages like perl or zsh for instance

74209
bash	zsh
in bash you ve got an associative array with 3 elements while in perl you d have an array with 790 elements 789 with zsh

74210
rpm	yum
i prefer this to rpm -ivh because if you end up with a repo in the future yum will already be aware of your package vsftp in this case and be able to update it if necessary withouy complaining that the yum database was modified outside of yum

74251
pwd	chdir
the chdir and getcwd system calls modify and retrieve information in pwd

74262
kde	gnome
this greater accuracy is particularly important for assessing desktop environments such as kde and gnome which make very heavy use of libraries shared between applications

74289
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
in general rsnapshot is just making use of rsync so it should work fine with backing up a variety of files from filesystems such as ext3 ext4 fat and ntfs

74289
filesystems	fat
in order to make these links you need to have a filesystems that supports feature which the fat fat32 filesystems common on a lot of external usb drives doesn t

74303
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu i would do

74333
daemons	launchd
a daemons is a long running process that doesn t have any reference to the console that launchd it originally

74340
stdout	stdio
that would tell the application assuming it s a dynamically linked application and the buffering is due to stdio to do line buffering on stdout as if it was a terminal

74340
stdout	stdio	stdout	fflush	stdio	fflush
however what it would still not do is fflush stdout upon stdio reads from stdin as it would normally do if stdin stdout were terminals

74359
redhat	fedora
if you run a rpm based os redhat fedora and the likes you should be able to run

74363
debian	linux
i run the tests on debian php-5.4.14 bash-4.1.5 and arch linux php-5.4.12 bash-4.2.42

74372
arp	dhcp
while a bad routing table would normally make the connection not work at all there is an edge case where the symptoms are the ones you describe if you obtain an address with dhcp and the dhcp server is also the server you re contacting â the address of the dhcp server will be routed to the desired interface until your arp cache expires.

74375
sudoers	visudo
add a sudoers rule run visudo and add a line

74385
irix	linux	solaris	irix
sample text linux solaris irix hp-ux

74385
irix	linux	solaris	irix
suppose i want to copy the word linux then paste over solaris and irix

74385
irix	linux	solaris	irix
text is now linux linux irix hp-ux but now solaris is on my vim clipboard

74386
irix	linux	solaris	irix
you could also just delete solaris and irix and paste linux twice in their place

74399
punctuation	words
hint replace the w by w in qbdiw apq to select words with punctuation like hp-ux

74423
cifs	smb
smb cifs server windows server 2003 3790 service pack 2

74433
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
given you re a novice i d be inclined to steer you towards either ubuntu or linux mint

74437
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux 3.7.10

74447
packets	multicast
all you have to do is create a ufw deny rule to match those multicast packets

74453
filesystems	btrfs
other filesystems like btrfs can create inodes dynamically

74454
ubuntu	linux
i ve observed this on arch linux and ubuntu but not on the solaris server i have an ssh account on

74486
ubuntu	linux
linux you mentioned only under ubuntu but the only os you mentioned it working under was darwin does not support passing multiple arguments to a shebang interpreter

74490
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux 3.7.10

74491
chown	sudo
sudo chown opendkim opendkim var spool postfix var run opendkim

74498
unix	solaris
another unix se post talks about using the command as i d expect it to work granted in solaris but i don t understand why those mails refuse to delete

74505
versioning	upgrade
chapter 4 of the release notes include detailed instructions for the upgrade and will be quite familiar if you ve upgrade between debian versioning before

74533
ubuntu	opensuse
now i want to install opensuse 12.2 alongside ubuntu 12.04

74536
installation	upgrade
an additional thing i can recommend is keeping some kind of log for what you installed for each installation i use emacs in changelog mode with a file for each machine-distro-revision combination so you can redo the installation if you upgrade and you don t have to remember what extra stuff you installed

74546
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i was using ubuntu linux but now i have a new computer using linux mint

74546
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
what i d like to do is take all the apache sites and settings that i have on the old ubuntu machine and reproduce them on the new linux mint machine

74546
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
is it not possible to in some way copy the entirety of the apache 2 settings and sites on my ubuntu machine and put them on my linux mint machine in one go

74552
dpkg	aptitude
i m not able to install update or do anything else with apt-get aptitude dpkg and so on

74562
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
is it not possible to in some way copy the entirety of the apache 2 settings and sites on my ubuntu machine and put them on my linux mint machine in one go

74583
kde	gnome
anything desktop environment related be it kde or gnome or whatever is probably right out of the question

74586
filesystems	fat
foreign filesystems might have their own restrictions for example ms-dos fat can have only filenames in the 8+3 format with exactly one . probably and are forbidden too

74603
debian	linux
i tested it on debian php-5.4.14 bash-4.1.5 and arch linux php-5.4.12 bash-4.2.42

74604
debian	linux
i tested it on debian 6 php-5.4.14 bash-4.1.5 and arch linux php-5.4.12 bash-4.2.42

74622
stdout	stderr
i like detach over nohup as closes stdin stdout and stderr by default so its invocation is cleaner

74624
ubuntu	debian
i think it s slightly different for the debian ubuntu distros

74630
ubuntu	mint
both ubuntu and mint use etc apache2

74639
ubuntu	linux
i found these threads on the ubuntu forums which discus the support lack of support for the killer e2200 ethernet network driver under linux

74652
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
given i primarily use redhat based distros i m most familiar with their take on fhs for fedora centos and rhel linux distros

74659
binutils	bfd
they re part of the binutils package you can read what the flags mean if you look in the bfd header file usr include bfd.h for their meaning or here

74663
ubuntu	debian
my host is ubuntu 12.04 and guest is a debian squeeze lamp server

74666
freebsd	linux
s3ql effectively provides a hard disk of dynamic infinite capacity that can be accessed from any computer with internet access running linux freebsd or os-x

74670
hide	show
e.g to set docky to show on left auto hide and no panel mode

74683
ubuntu	debian
for my current debian ubuntu distro i happen to have full 15gbytes with all my installed tools so i must allocate a bit more than that

74691
atexit	main
as you can see at address 400e54 _start in turn invokes __libc_start_main which initializes the necessary stuff pthreads atexit ... and finally calls main with the appropriate arguments argc argv and env

74714
zsh	tcsh
i switch to tcsh with bin tcsh and i switch back to zsh with bin zsh

74732
gnupg	gpgme
gnupg and its library gpgme are the base of many foss crypto applications like mail user agents

74776
sudo	passwd
they only place you could get some of this type of information would be from the sudo command logs assuming you re using sudo and that your sudo setup gives out permissions such that you re logging on individual commands such as passwd

74804
kde	kubuntu
i m running a kubuntu 12.04 lts with kde

74822
post	put
if you really want to split user and system accounts reading some of the comments on other post it looks like you are curious about this you could leave all system users in the files etc passwd database and put people users in a second database kinda like if you were doing ldap

74826
debian	linux
i want to use debian linux for my laptop again

74829
folder	directory
the .ko file is in the build directory in my user folder and i know it works because running insmod . vizzini.ko from the appropriate place works fine

74840
cifs	smb
cifs vfs unexpected smb signature

74842
cpu	affinity
to control where the cpu affinity check hwloc taskset or control for runtime control sched_setaffinity

74862
kde	cinnamon
today for testing purpose i installed kde alongside cinnamon in linux mint 14

74865
folder	directory
ideally i d like to avoid creating new virtual hosts in var www and instead opt for creating these under a public_html folder in my user s home directory

74870
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to debian wheezy 7 and had to upgrade vmware player along with that since the versioning i had didn t like the 3.2 kernel

74877
versioning	upgrade
worst case you can use the versionlock plugin to exclude all the versioning of the package apart from the one you want and then just do a simple yum upgrade

74889
kde	gnome
and i don t care much i made the experience that kde and gnome are a bit heavy for a netbook

74889
debian	mint
i really liked using mint debian edition with xfce running from where i switched to the even ndash

74890
vim	emacs
another solution would be install emacs in the remote machine and copy your configuration i chose this solution aggregated in a git repo for my vim stuff

74911
folder	directory
my use case is that i want to move ebooks called .epub from many directory into a single folder that an epub reader can find.

74916
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
in the ubuntu debian mint .

74916
jobs	cron
setting up needed or optional cron jobs

74916
jobs	cron
in the rpm world -- admittedly this was the situation several years back and it may have improved since then -- i found myself having to run additional steps chkconfig enabling cron jobs to actually make packages really work

74916
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
since the ubuntu debian mint .

74916
installation	upgrade
this in most cases rather than solve the problem broke my installation by failing to restrict what dependencies can or cannot be upgrade correctly

74916
ubuntu	debian
in contrast in ubuntu debian i found that i almost never need to build from source

74916
ubuntu	debian
also a few times i installed debian non canonical packages on ubuntu and they worked just fine despite this compatibility not being officially guaranteed

74938
hide	show
with mate you can create new panels and drag them to the second monitor to enable drag uncheck expand in the properties also uncheck autohide and show hide buttons

74942
ubuntu	linux
i am running linux kernel 3.2.0-23-generic ubuntu 12.04 distro on lenovo thinkpad machine

74949
stdout	stdio
echo dir1 | write dir1 n on stdout of the first command which is not echoed but buffered through stdio and available to subprocess via stdin

74960
bash	zsh
i don t know if it s relevant but i ve tried both in bash and zsh with the same result and i also tried

75013
daemons	systemd
i am curious how systemd daemons on a local linux host send email

75015
udp	tcp
it s part of the tcp or udp etc. header in the packet

75017
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
you can use mta s such as postfix and sendmail on most of the larger distros such as debian ubuntu fedora centos etc

75017
daemons	systemd
most of the linux distros do come with an mta and it s typically so that systemd generated emails can be delivered from various crons and daemons that are running on the systemd

75017
mutt	thunderbird
they range from terminal based apps such as mail and mutt up to evolution and thunderbird

75018
mutt	thunderbird
examples mutt thunderbird evolution kmail .

75018
qmail	exim
examples include exim postfix qmail sendmail etc

75028
opensuse	debian
first there s etc crypttab - typically you specify a key file or password in the third slot but some distros allow you to specify an option in the fourth field called keyscript debian and opensuse support this

75028
stdout	stderr
i m not sure if it s possible to make the keyscript prompt for input possibly on stderr since any output on stdout is taken as the luks password

75031
disk	ram
if the program is started in a ram chroot then it does not have a chance to wake the disk directly

75043
debian	linux
that s not available in my current linux distro debian squeeze so i haven t tried it out

75047
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
practically all shells you re likely to run across bash sh ksh zsh csh tcsh ... implement wildcards

75077
centos	linux
whenever i run a terminal in linux centos my console line starts with

75101
folder	directory
so in a nutshell they have their own directory and they have a shared group folder

75130
centos	linux
i am new to linux and centos so i may not be sure of the exact question to ask

75179
stdout	stderr
it happens that the command you re running under nohup never writes to stdout or stderr and that you aren t sending any input to it

75179
stdout	stderr
to avoid this redirect nohup s stdin stdout and stderr to dev null

75179
bash	zsh
this is a bash extension also present in zsh

75180
sudo	passwd
you should use sudo time command because sudo s processing time is small but not always negligible and its wall clock time may be a lot larger if the user needs to enter a passwd

75182
sudo	passwd
besides i don t need to input passwd for sudo on remote host

75188
kde	gnome
gadmin-proftpd is a gtk+ front end for gnome and kde as a part of the gadmintools collection

75244
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs
currently anyfs-tools supports filesystems conversion to ext2fs ext3fs or xfs ... ntfs and ext are way too incompatible to even hope to convert

75266
bash	zsh
with shells that support the non-standard sh ksh type of quotes like ksh93 zsh or bash you can write it

75267
cifs	smb
actually i thought that smbclient and mount.cifs used the same low-level instruments to connect to the smb cifs servers but it isn t so

75271
stdout	stderr
if you want both stderr and stdout to go to the log file you can run it like this

75276
bash	zsh
in many shells including ksh zsh and bash time is a keyword and is used to time pipelines

75280
ubuntu	debian
also take note that some packages go by different names in debian ubuntu vs

75280
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
these sites include nice tables that show particular package management tasks and how to perform them using the corresponding commands on centos rhel fedora and debian ubuntu

75286
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
those distros might not have a community as big as debian ubuntu or they might not have long support cycles desirable for servers like rhel centos debian stable

75290
debian	centos
i haven t checked out the ones you mentioned and for a first-time install i d stick with a major one like debian centos fedora or similar

75296
google-chrome	firefox
something like firefox or google-chrome

75318
gentoo	linux
if gentoo is not complicated enough you can build your own linux from scratch

75355
rss	feed	rss	icalendar
you can track them via rss feed or icalendar

75361
linefeed	delimiter
the default delimiter is just linefeed

75377
inherited	properties
bash has associative arrays that can be used to implement a simple object system with inherited methods and properties

75403
filesystems	ntfs
maybe you want to store most of your data on the ntfs partition for a while and thus need only little space on the linux filesystems

75420
django	web2py
django probably has its own additional folder structure i know that web2py does so you might have more luck using a web page with that code and analysing the output from that

75426
debian	mint	debian	linux
i have downloaded multiarch .deb file for latest skype and unable to install it on latest version of lmde linux mint debian edition xfce x86_64

75427
put	get
so if i get address in sequence from this pci bus locations and put them in ifconfig-eth0 to ifconfig-eth7 in order of pci bus location my eth naming will be stable

75443
dpkg	apt
in a sense the sudo dpkg -i skype-debian_4.1.0.20-1_i386.deb is installing a package in a broken state into your system and the sudo apt-get install -f is an attempt to try and get apt to resolve your now broken setup by installing any missing dependency libraries

75454
cpu	processors
if you re interested i typically look up a cpu on cpubenchmark.net to get a sense of where a processors stacks up

75491
mutt	msmtp
here is mutt setup i use offlineimap to fetch the mail and use msmtp to send the mail

75491
mutt	msmtp
i searched a lot but the closest i could find was a ssh tunnel but i guess that was for the case if i was using mutt s inbuilt smtp support and not a mta such as msmtp

75493
folder	directory
you ll notice we re not talking of folder but of directory here

75493
filesystems	btrfs
some filesystems like btrfs depart from that traditional directory structure

75493
filesystems	btrfs
you ll notice that link counts on directories in btrfs filesystems are always one even though those directories do contain a . entry with the same inode number as themselves in them

75493
filesystems	btrfs
of course this kind of optimisation doesn t work on btrfs though in modern versions of linux the type of files is also stored in the directory entry for some filesystems including btrfs and returned by the getdents 2 system call used to retrieve the list of entries in a directory so lstat is still not necessary

75510
children	parent
the pipes need to be set up by the parent process before the child or children are forked

75565
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
debian ubuntu linux install kernel headers package

75570
vim	emacs
good editors such as vim or emacs let you choose the default strategy

75573
portrait	landscape
most of them are landscape oriented but some are portrait oriented

75573
portrait	landscape
but if i do pdfjoin on all images at a time then the result is always landscape oriented which means that if you watch the pdf file you have to turn your head by 90 degrees to watch the images that were portrait oriented originally

75580
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh the equivalent command is hash -r zsh also understands rehash

75586
ubuntu	linux
see this unix linux q a titled ubuntu make fails with no such file or directory lib modules 3.4.0 build for details on how to accomplish this task

75588
centos	linux
i am trying to create a virtual interface for the purpose of namebased virtual hosting on my centos linux box

75610
debian	linux
debian gnu linux jessie sid n l

75653
filesystems	fat
when you save a file to a fat filesystems the file is saved as close to the start of the disk as possible

75655
truecrypt	umount
and then the usual is umount the truecrypt s volume close truecrypt exit root session

75669
bash	zsh
some shells like zsh or bash set the variable but don t export it

75690
redhat	fedora
this works on a fedora and or centos and or redhat el systems

75696
ssl	https
red hat enterprise linux - how do i install copy paste easy way ssl https

75707
filesystems	fat
ext2 and fat filesystems are both methods to record which blocks on disk belong to which file

75715
redhat	fedora
none of the redhat distros prior to fedora 17 included the ability to do dist-upgrades as you ve asked

75715
ubuntu	debian
be on par with the dist-upgrade available in the debian ubuntu

75715
ubuntu	debian
new in fedora 17 18 is a tool called fedup fedora upgrader which purports to do dist-upgrades similar to debian ubuntu distros

75715
ubuntu	debian
most distros such as debian ubuntu provide this facility now

75715
versioning	upgrade
upgrade between versioning

75715
ubuntu	debian
so from a purists standpoint debian ubuntu fedora are not rolling releases

75720
truecrypt	umount
the truecrypt process has no way to know whether other processes are using the filesystem so it keeps running until the filesystem is explicitly umount

75720
truecrypt	umount
once you ve umount all the truecrypt filesystems you can kill the truecrypt process

75723
bash	zsh
you do need to be running ksh93 or bash â 4 or zsh and in ksh93 you need to run set -o globstar first and in bash you need to run shopt -s globstar first

75734
folder	directory
what does work is that i store all my html css and javascript in a folder in my dropbox directory

75741
filesystems	fat
wipe the usb stick that you want to install ubuntu onto and create a fat filesystems for ubuntu

75776
debian	linux
this is the default route my linux server debian give me at startup

75783
daemons	systemd
to monitor process creation i d like to periodically write the last pid assigned by the kernel to any process on the systemd not just processes created by the pid-monitoring program with a time stamp to a file using a daemons to avoid creating any extra processes

75795
zsh	tcsh
interestingly that works better than its posix counterpart because in tcsh and in zsh in csh emulation cshnullglob option contrary to posix shells those pattern that don t match any file get expanded to nothing instead of themselves

75834
bash	tcsh
for tcsh or bash

75836
chown	chmod
short of doing a chmod u+s bin chown or giving the target users cap_chown via pam_cap.so both of which would give them root-level chowning rights for all files on the system that s as dangerous as it sounds the owning user and root are the only people who can touch it

75848
traceroute	packets
to diagnose a firewall you can use traceroute -p tcp -p 25 to see how far packets to port 25 get

75849
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	solaris	netbsd
here is a oneliner that should work on all systems implementing dtrace solaris freebsd netbsd mac os x oracle linux with latest uek and others like illumos based oses linux with dtrace4linux

75853
kde	kubuntu
if it matters i m on kubuntu 12.04 with kde 4.10

75855
kde	kubuntu
i m using kubuntu 12.04 with kde 4.10 and i recently installed the kde-config-grub2 that places a nice grub configuration panel into kde system settings

75857
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
dpkg originates from the debian debian linux distribution and is used by others such as ubuntu and linux-mint

75858
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
the base software for debian ubuntu mint package management

75861
centos	linux
when i installed centos installation went smoothly and then after restarting windows booted normally like there s no linux installed

75886
ubuntu	debian
something similar is slated to appear in gnu screen 4.1 soon and is already available in cvs per this mailing list thread and has been included in the debian and ubuntu screen packages starting with 4.0.3-10

75899
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
so i wanted to test opera and firefox but both does not support kiosk at all like google-chrome does

75899
opera	firefox
i installed opera and firefox where i am using openbox desktop

75899
opera	firefox
how do i remove the window borders for firefox opera to make it full kiosk mode

75920
manjaro	archlinux
i basically started with archlinux and manjaro and i kinda like it

75936
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

75936
redhat	fedora
fedora redhat

75940
xfce	gnome
asking for very latest gcc but being ok with not-so-late desktop environment doesn t make much sense but perhaps one of the simpler lighter ones lxde xfce is a better match than gnome for you

75956
ubuntu	debian
on most systems i use all versions of ubuntu for many years now and some installs of debian

75969
rpm	yum
if the software was installed from rpm use yum to upgrade them

75984
pulseaudio	dbus
i have systemd set up so that using systemctl start user me will start my user services as i expect but my dbus one just won t go which i need for pulseaudio

75990
folder	directory
inside each of those directory is a dropbox folder

76018
solaris	sunos
you need to run opt solarisstudio12.3 bin cc and never usr ucb cc - the ucb script is an old compatibility wrapper for building sunos 4 software that doesn t work with current studio releases and was deleted from solaris 11 and later

76112
put	get
of course you will get many suggestions for different places to put things as there is not much standardization for this kind of thing

76182
debian	linux
i wanted to upgrade the linux kernel on my debian wheezy stable on thinkpad t60

76185
centos	linux
and then allowing a couple only two mobile users to login remotely on a linux centos machine

76190
rss	feed
i have a custom status script that wget s an rss feed and shows the latest headline in it

76193
vim	emacs
vim and emacs use this convention and probably many other programs too

76206
umask	chmod
easiest way is to use the touch command to create the file with the default umask and use chmod to make it executable

76314
bash	zsh
you need a shell with support for process substitution ksh zsh or bash

76323
debian	linux
shameless plug i have implemented uefi support in alt linux and if our regular builds work for you then i can probably translate explain the relevant bits of mkimage-profiles documentation so you can prepare the derivative needed or use it to prepare a bootable root so that you can work on your debian installation with comfort

76324
wan	lan
i proceded to bridge the lan and wan interfaces

76324
wan	vlan	wan	lan
i did this because the wiki page says bridge the lan vlan together with the wan interface and remove the existing wan interface - if any. i had to telnet into failsafe mode to recover from it so that obviously was a bad move

ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	redhat	fedora
on any of the redhat distros such as fedora centos or rhel the command mkpasswd doesn t include the same set of switches as the version typically included with debian ubuntu

kde	gnome
is there any reason one of either gnome or kde might be more compatible than the other with a vmware + backtrack

76431
vmware	virtualbox
typically with the virtualization products like vmware and virtualbox there are extensions that you have to either install via the virtualization products guis or manually mount some cd iso inside the guests to get these sorts of drivers modules installed

this syntax should be portable to any bourne shell style interpreter tested with bash ksh88 ksh93 zsh mksh dash and busybox sh

76588
opensuse	centos
in other documentation redhat centos or opensuse all examples refer to adding partitions to the vg instead of raw disks

76620
lvm	btrfs
the only other way is to go back to dealing with partitions which is part of the reason people like well-designed volume management schemes like with btrfs lvm zfs etc

76630
put	get
it has an edit command which handles the get edit put sequence for me as in gui ftp clients

76633
opensuse	linux
i created a custom linux using opensuse studio that s just text based and very simple to squeeze all the performance i can out of the machine

76633
opensuse	debian
i was expecting something like rasbian where it boots and you log in and can use sudo and startx to get into the desktop however on debian and on the opensuse it boots to bash

76638
ubuntu	linux
i am experimenting with desktop linux on my home computer using ubuntu

76646

for example in this process tree gnome-session has three children and four descendants including the right-most nm-applet plus one parent as per the definition and three ancestors lightdm twice and then init

76695
ubuntu	linux
i do tasks some of which require windows while some require ubuntu and thus i sometime need to access linux from windows though the reverse is easily possible

76704
sudo	passwd
basically if you use the option -a instead of reading the passwd from stdin sudo reads the passwd from an external program that you can specify with the sudo_askpass environment variable

76704
sudo	passwd
save your sudo passwd in the gnome-keyring

76704
sudo	passwd
you should be able to retrieve the passwd from the keyring with something like gnome-keyring-query get sudo

76704
sudo	passwd
that being said be aware that if you save your passwd in the keyring and leave this keyring open anyone can read your sudo passwd very easily either using this gnome-keyring-query tool or just simply by launching seahorse

76705
kde	gnome
i want to see display manager name gnome kde etc. via python or bash script

76727
folder	directory
then i used diff -r a b to check for changes between the folder and diff indeed observed differences in the target directory

76732
kde	gnome
when you click shutdown in kde or gnome your de sends a signal to your dm to power off or restart after the session has terminated

76732
terminate	timeout
then your de tells every program to end and once all other process has terminate or expired a timeout the last process of your de -- the session process -- terminate

76732
kde	gnome
this process is called kdeinit in kde and gnome-session in gnome

76746

i have a vcf file that contains numerous vcard

76929

when importing the vcf file to outlook it seems to only import the first vcard

76938
post	get
if you re determined to get grub working as your primary boot manager you can see how to address that in this post

76964
ubuntu	mint
possibly the problem has to do with the transition from the gtk-based control panel to the qt-based the ubuntuone-control-panel-gtk package that existed in previous of ubuntu mint no longer exists

76967
google-chrome	firefox
a google-chrome or firefox extension existing or one that you write

folder	directory
but i got the following error i checked 2 folder and notice for 1 folder there are such files and another there is no such files but why all of them shows mv cannot stat no such files or directory

77008
bash	zsh
i would like it instead to run some_command in another shell such as bash or zsh

77008
bash	zsh
one way of running commands on zsh or bash from sh is to call

77008
bash	zsh
another example would be when i need to pass something with quotes to a binary that i want to invoke from bash or zsh

77022
filesystems	fat
for non unix filesystems such as fat you specify what id to use for all files when you mount it

77056
cinnamon	gnome

debian	linux
take a look at this page titled linux downloads debian - postgresql

77091
ubuntu	mint
this is a debian-ism and therefore appears in ubuntu mint etc.

77091
vim	emacs	vim	gedit	emacs	gedit
additionally you can set the environment variable to point to anything you want vim gedit emacs etc

77091
vim	emacs	vim	gedit	emacs	gedit
or you could just tell users that the systems provide gedit gvim vim emacs etc

77093
bash	tcsh
to make these changes permanent you will need to place the appropriate commands described above in your .login or .cshrc files for csh or tcsh users or your .profile file if you use bash or ksh

77098
debian	mint	debian	linux
i was having kernel panics in linux mint debian edition lmde when i decided that i wanted to use packages from debian wheezy to get a newer kernel that could fix them

77105
bash	zsh
there isn t a simple one-liner in bash but there is one in zsh

77105
bash	zsh
on linux with bash or zsh you can use rename instead

77105
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
if your linux distribution is debian ubuntu or a derivative the rename command is a different one

77107
bash	zsh
ksh has an operator to compare the dates of two files it s also available in ash bash and zsh but it isn t in posix

77108
jobs	cron
you don t want to be waken up everyday at 6am because the daily cron jobs are running

77115

what is the proper way to remove all hidden and non-hidden files and folder recursively in a target directory without receiving the warning error about

77154
bash	zsh
i am looking for bash or zsh solutions

77159
bash	zsh
i have the following code in a file that is sourced by both zsh and bash

77159
bash	zsh
shellname is zsh if the shell is zsh and bash if the shell is bash

77159
bash	zsh
each of the above functions contains code that works with zsh but not bash

77162
bash	zsh
note that zsh contrary to bash does support the bourne function syntax

77166
google-chrome	firefox
the following deals with firefox but the relevant code should be usable in google-chrome when placed in .config google-chrome default user stylesheets custom.css

77167
zsh	tcsh
with tcsh or zsh for alt-s s for same

77167
zsh	tcsh
in zsh and tcsh at least the numerical argument that is when you prefix it with alt- number will be applied to the space character which is not very useful alt-3 alt-s would insert 3 spaces the last word once and accept the line

77176
bash	zsh
here with ksh93 also bash and zsh syntax

77187
filesystems	ntfs
however this automounting does not work with ntfs filesystems

77187
filesystems	ntfs
how can i achieve this automounting with ntfs filesystems

77187
filesystems	ntfs
also i just noticed a strange behavior when there is already a sdbx mounted filesystems i plug my ntfs usb device as sdc ... and everything works as expected automount works

77190
daemons	systemd
your ubuntu systemd has the avahi daemons running while this is not the case for your raspberry pi

77209
ubuntu	linuxmint
linuxmint is also very simple and is forked from ubuntu

77209
gentoo	linux
finally there is linuxfromscratch where you build your own linxu-system without partial automation like for gentoo following a book - this will really teach you how different parts of linux fits into each other

77209
freebsd	linux
as this cost much money most linux and other free oses like freebsd are not certified although most linux-distros probably could ve been

77210
freebsd	centos
a centos covers red hat freebsd covers the bsds

77210
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
centos bsd debian and suse for that matter are going to arguably be a better fit if you re going out to find a job rather than fedora ubuntu

77220

fedora is the community edition essentially of redhat enterprise linux which is the most popular distribution used in the enterprise government

77259
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
lfhex is an application for viewing and editing files in hex octal binary or ascii text

77276
ubuntu	linux
one thing that will make it easier to understand why some thing on gnu linux are designed the way they are is to just remind yourself that windows isn t the reference point for most linux distributions design except maybe ubuntu

77276
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
for example red hat is a billion dollar corporation but they got there by marketing themselves to enterprise users as being an affordable easier-to-use alternative to traditional proprietary unix vendors and competing against os s like hp-ux solaris aix etc

77276
hash	hmac
to windows admins checking changing the hmac for ad s kerberos server is considered being l33t at least i hope the average ad admin is just unaware of ad s use of md4 hash whereas on unix hmac password hasing etc is just part of setting up the server just being some of those the things you re supposed to think about when designing your company s solution

77292
debian	linux
i m very new to linux and i m setting up a debian server

77319
ubuntu	linux
i m about to get a linux laptop with ubuntu preinstalled

77329
chown	sudo
for additional protection give yourself the permission to access the device sudo chown sj755 dev disk by-id ata-yoyodine-50rdf15h then do the rest under your own user instead of root

77338
sudo	passwd
alternatively set up sudo rules to allow the developers to run cryptsetup and losetup without a passwd

77344
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu variant

77344

on debian ubuntu the location of things is different and the runlevels are different too

77344

under debian ubuntu the sysv services mechanism is slowly being phased out by a new mechanism called upstart

77356
sudo	passwd
if i run a command which requires root privileges with sudo i will be asked to enter the current user s passwd

77356

disk	ram
when they do hibernate they save entire content in ram to swap disk

77370

the vmpeak is not a solution either since it reports the allocated memory and also does not calculates from the real ram but also from the hard disk

77375
sudo	passwd
i have checked and by doing the following i can see that sudo doesn t prompt for a passwd but su does

77414
versioning	upgrade
i have an ancient versioning of fedora which i d like to upgrade

77439
openssl	gnutls
i can t confirm it but i think fedora compiles ngircd with gnutls and i think my keys were created with openssl

77441
daemons	systemd
on unixy systemd root is all-powerful and can certainly read and even write into your daemons memory without it even being able to find out

77443
sudo	passwd
if you get prompted for your sudo passwd you can also do

77443
sudo	passwd
to the end of the file where username is your username which will allow you to use sudo without prompting for a passwd every time and thus allow you to disable your wireless connection right before the shutdown sequence begins without a passwd prompt

77448
disk	ram
setup is big nodes with 1tb ram and i don t want to have local filesystem for os and the alternative is to have nfs server the root filesystem but i don t want the nfs traffic so ram disk seems like good option

77460

eventually that system was reverse engineered and a free replacement called groff was created but that was several years after the gnu project started

77538
sudoers	passwd
the process is a little drawn out but it s doable by making an exception in etc sudoers so that the user can run the script as yourself temporarily without being prompted for a passwd

i started using vim two weeks ago switching from sublimetext and i am a ruby developer

77708
ubuntu	debian
the only really good aac encoder for avconv ffmpeg is libfdk_aac - but the license for that is incompatible with the gpl so in order to get access to it you ll have to compile your own that s an ffmpeg compilation guide since i don t know of one for avconv - the ubuntu guide should be fine for debian since i don t think there s anything ubuntu-specific in there

77708
ffprobe	avprobe
to transfer that over use avprobe ffprobe with -show_format to extract and neroaactag to insert

77708
ffprobe	avprobe
you may want to change ffprobe and ffmpeg to avprobe and avconv

77714
versioning	upgrade
mint doesn t take a lot of care to make upgrade smooth and skipping a versioning increases the risk of problems

77716
zsh	tcsh
you are highly likely to disrupt the user s configuration and it may or may not work what if the user has zsh or tcsh as his login shell

77739
chown	chgrp
the problem with this is that operations like chown and chgrp fail and we need to replicate something close to our production environment www-data owning the files used by apache

the process is a little drawn out but it s doable by making an exception in etc sudoers so that the user can run the script as yourself temporarily without being prompted for a passwd

77813
pull	push
then i don t have to supply arguments to git push and git pull

77814
cpu	affinity
well for the cpu affinity bit that s usually intended to solve a different set of problems that pertain to the physical cpu s that are executing the program

77814
cpu	affinity
that s why you have to specify which particular cpu s you re talking about with cpu affinity

it was available in the ubuntu debian repositories

77912
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
that said i do notice that you don t allow in icmp or dns over udp or tcp

77912
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
a well-behaved host on the internet needs to accept icmp packets and if you are running a dns server you will need to open up communication over tcp and udp to port 53 for it to work

77912
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
these will allow in any responses to anything outbound the server has initiated over tcp or udp as well as icmp messages

sudo	passwd
but if i do sudo -i and then exit the system does not remembers the passwd and asks for it all over again every time i use sudo -i

i am very new to debian linux i forgot my root password...actually i think i know what it is because it is the same password i have for pretty much everything but in the terminal in tell me sorry try again. is there a way to reset the password

78128
ethernet	wireless
if b would know at this point that his ethernet is bridged to wireless could it associate to the ap itself

78183
daemons	systemd
shutdown sends a request to the init 8 daemons to bring the systemd down into the appropriate runlevel.

78198
rmdir	mkdir
what you can do is use a fuse filesystem like bindfs in combination with a ld_preload hijacker that disables the mkdir and rmdir system calls

78208
google-chrome	firefox
once you do that you can run firefox or google-chrome on the remote machine

78209
ubuntu	linux
i initially installed vnc4server to run guacamole render vm through browser on an aws ec2 linux ubuntu 12.04 instance

78212
stateless	stateful	udp	tcp
ssh is a stateful protocol which uses tcp however dns requests use the udp protocol stateless which can t be sent over the ssh tunnel

78216
ubuntu	linux
on my desktop i have installed ubuntu linux 10.04 with package postfix 2.8.5-2 build0.10.04

78219
jobs	cron
view feedback from cron jobs

78221
ubuntu	linux
i have these credentials that i am using for logging in with my linux distribution ubuntu 13.04 when starting the computer

78221
sudo	passwd
then also when i am installing something from ubuntu center i need to type this passwd or when performing something using sudo etc

78226
ubuntu	linux
then i install within virtualbox windows 7 because i need to run a custom program from my comapny that is exclusively for win and maybe another ubuntu or some other linux distro for my daily stuff browsing the web testing some untrusted linux apps downloading stuff via torrents etc.

78226
ubuntu	linux
the question is am i safe when i run apps browser within my virtualbox or do some viruses malware spyware exist that can access my main ubuntu system from windows 7 or the other linux distro that runs inside virtualbox

78227
ubuntu	debian
the 2nd command will run the debian ubuntu installer program and install a program called gimp as root

78229
puts	gets
as celada pointed out both logname and getlogin depend on var run utmp which puts them at mid-level trustworthiness it s a regular file instead of something that necessarily gets regenerated with reboots unlike kernel structures so there s a slight possibility of contamination if they can boot from cd or something then again what couldn t they compromise if they did that

78230
sudo	passwd
if you are afraid that your user passwd is likely to be seen by others because you enter it often then preventing your user from sudo access and use root with a different passwd may be advantageous

78235
sysv	systemd
i know that historically on some sysv systemd i used to manage utmp was prone to get corrupted occasionally

78237
openvpn	iptables
currently i have iptables setup as described in the ethernet bridging setup page of openvpn

78238
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu and likely in the rhel world a package is roughly synonymous with a component

78249
sudo	passwd
when you type your passwd to install a program your passwd is read by sudo under the hood

78249
sudo	passwd
sudo asks for your passwd to confirm that it s you at the keyboard

78251
bazaar	git
a more modern and more powerful but more complex system such as bazaar or git or mercurial might take a whole hour

78254
bash	zsh
to pass the file names to the perl script in ksh93 or bash â 4 or zsh you can use the pattern to traverse subdirectories recursively

78293
freebsd	linux
first of all freebsd is not linux

78295
ubuntu	centos
i have ubuntu 12.10 on which i installed virtual box on which i setup centos 6.4 i386

78309
solaris	bsd
if you re on bsd or solaris they have the same concept they re just called privileges instead of capabilities since capabilities was already the name of a security-related mechanism on those platforms roughly analogous to lxc and or selinux fwiw

78312
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
depending on the distro it s called etherwake on ubuntu debian ether-wake on rhel centos fedora

78326
unix	solaris
by sh i think you re refering to the bourne shell which was the shell of most unix systems before the mid 90s and was bin sh on solaris prior to solaris 11

78331
portrait	landscape
that is a tag which uses awful.layout.suit.tile in landscape mode would use awful.layout.suit.tile.bottom in portrait mode

78354
cinnamon	gnome
gnome s or cinnamon s

78386
ubuntu	debian
i know i can grab the source code from the website - but is there a better way on ubuntu debian

78390
ubuntu	openbsd
it s geared to ubuntu but could be adapted for openbsd

78454
opera	firefox
as a result my apps does not work with chromium but works with firefox opera

78474
daemons	systemd
linux has an audit systemd that is usually used together with auditd a daemons that as far as i know is designed for logging all events to the disk

78486
debian	centos
i see this both in debian 7 and centos 6

78491
sudo	passwd
i have no idea how you managed to get through d-i without setting up either a root passwd or a user account with sudo

78503
stdout	stderr
after stdout of the commands has been redirected to the file stderr is redirected to stdout so that messages there get to the file too

78511
ubuntu	linux
i m running an linux image kernel 3.2.8 for beagleboard-xm on qemu s 1.4.0 emulator ubuntu distribution for 13.04

78519
filesystems	ntfs
every common filesystems i have tried ntfs ext3 ext4 has a limitation on filename size at 255 or 256 bytes

78521
bash	zsh
set your terminal s title to show the current directory and running command from bash or preexec zsh

78534
chown	sudo
did sudo chown me files.db

78534
chown	chmod
this morning i did the following chown me folder and then chmod 777 folder

78535
filesystems	btrfs
after upgrading from ubuntu 12.04 to ubuntu 12.10 i get a message scanning for btrfs filesystems at starting-up

78535
filesystems	btrfs
i don t have any btrfs filesystems

78536
vmware	virtualbox
boot up a virtual machine nowadays virtualbox but i used to use vmware for that and install x from the image

78537
filesystems	btrfs
it is the btrfs kernel module that does the scanning for filesystems scanning multiple devices

78539
umask	mount
when i mount a usb drive with umask 022 new files and directories both have permissions 755

78546
filesystems	ntfs
currently it finds a ntfs filesystems where it expects a root filesystems which probably doesn t hold what s needed as indicated by the kernel complaining about no init found

78556
wan	lan
seems like you re just trying to do a straight port forward of wan ip 1610 to lan ip 161

78562
ubuntu	debian
someone told me that i could install debian from within ubuntu 11.10 but that would be risky

78562
ubuntu	debian
could someone please help me with detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install debian alongside ubuntu when the only boot option is from the hard-drive and not from usb or cd media

78564
ubuntu	debian
if your system is capable enough you could run debian as a virtual machine within ubuntu

78564
ubuntu	debian
in this way you circumvent the bios restriction and you have the advantage that you can run ubuntu and debian simultaneously

78567
hide	show
you can select an additional entry for your desktop panel which is called show desktop and it will show or hide all windows when clicked on

78580
disk	ram
that e-mail almost certainly will be temporarily written to the system s mail queue which means that the password does end up on disk unless you have the mail queue directory on a ram disk which besides the fact that the mail queue is supposed to be on persistent storage presents its own set of problems operationally

78580
starttls	smtps
the only way to have reasonable confidentiality assurances with e-mail over smtps even if you are using smtps over ssl or starttls throughout the entire chain of mail servers is end-to-end encryption like s mime or openpgp

78582
centos	linux
oracle unbreakable linux is a derivative product from rhel red hat enterprise linux so you should be able to install package built for centos another deriviative product from rhel

78608
gtk	ncurses
that ensures that the daemon is spawned with enough privileges and then you need to access it with the client part wicd-client which is actually just a wrapper for wicd s various front-ends command-line ncurses gtk and possibly also qt

78624
spaces	delimiter
in bash i am trying to take this output and get these values into a multidimensional array or just an array with a spaces delimiter

78630
freebsd	linux
after years of linux i would like to give bsd a try but i m uncertain if i should use freebsd or pc-bsd

78637
spaces	delimiter
for storage in bash arrays using a delimiter other than spaces is often simpler

78642
bsd	minix
the gnu version is in coreutils there s a version in the main source tree of any bsd there s a version in busybox in minix etc

78645
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
on debian and derivatives ubuntu mint etc. this command is called rename.ul

78647
bash	zsh
since bash 4.2 you can tell bash to behave like ksh and zsh by setting the lastpipe option

78647
bash	zsh
you still need pd ksh bash or zsh for arrays. run everything that requires the data from the pipeline inside the pipeline

78650
fish	bash
i m trying out the fish shell 2.0 to replace bash

78650
fish	bash
i m trying to convert the following bash function to a fish function but its giving me hell

78669
ubuntu	debian
it shows you how to set up your existing grub on an installed ubuntu system so that you can boot the debian installer from it

78691
unix	bsd
i know that the origin of linux unix and bsd are the same but they are different branches

78705
ubuntu	debian
it is based on ubuntu which is based on debian

78705
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
if you really really want to stick to a pure debian go for linux mint debian which is based directly on debian not ubuntu and is a debian in all ways

78730
kde	gnome
i have had weird mouse and cursor issues with kde but not in unity or gnome on the same system

78739
apache	nginx
the above gives the apache user substitute with whatever user your apache nginx whatever is running as read-only access to the target of the symlink and gives groupofprogrammers read access to the directory the symlink is in so that groupofprogrammers can get a complete directory listing there but turns all permission bits off for the same target of the symlink

78747
ubuntu	linux
i m new at linux ubuntu

78755
ubuntu	linux
i have a funtoo linux machine which i am trying to add ubuntu to thats a whole other issue

78766
puts	gets
the block device layer gets requests from upper layers and performs an i o elevator operation and puts the requests into the i o request queue

78766
daemons	systemd
when systemd memory becomes scarce or the kernel swap timer expires the kswapd daemons will attempt to free up pages

78789
debian	linux
now want debian linux

78789
debian	linux
note i know i can get ubunto installer as suggested and upvoted on windows 7 to linux install without cd dvd or usb drive but i would like to get debian and dual boot to windows or seperately to debian

78789
put	get
i also tried to put grub interdependently using wingrub but need better instructions for that for windows 7 as it did not work edited windows using bcdedit but when i try to boot using that get an error results of that too are on first question

78804
debian	linux
i have a horrible situation where i have to restore data from damaged raid system in a rescue debian linux

78820
dnf	yum
downloaded packages via yum or dnf are cached until a yum clean packages or dnf clean packages operation removes them

78820
dnf	yum
were you in the middle of a yum or dnf transaction

78857
debian	linux
i heard about lvm but can i use it after i installed debian or is it better to copy everything and reinstall my linux

78864
bash	zsh
if you don t have zsh but you have bash â 4 or ksh93 you can use the to traverse subdirectories recursively and then loop over the matches

78864
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu and derivatives

78866
ubuntu	linux
i am using red hat enterprise linux 6 it has gnome gui but it is very simple and not like ubuntu s gui

78876
udp	tcp
you need to modify your iptables rule it should be for udp not for tcp

78892
ssd	sata
with ssds the situation gets better but even an ssd - which has throughput measured in hundreds of mb s on sata as compared to tens of mb s of a spin-plate hdd and really negligible seek times compared to miliseconds for a spin-plate - can become a bottleneck

78894
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs	disk	ram
there s an exe installer for puppy linux which boots from an .iso on fat32 ntfs or linux filesystems ext2 ext3 ext4 xfs etc. using syslinux and runs in ram using unionfs aufs with full access to persistent storage disk sd flashdrive etc.

78899
post	get
but i get the mount point media cdrom does not exist issue also mentioned in the same post

78947
put	get
i did all what i can do to get a better air flow in the laptop and put a better thermal paste but there is still a problem

78951
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
and if not how many version of the init script would there have to be to cover ubuntu debian and rhel centos 5.x and 6.x

78974
overwrite	preserve
this preserve the hierarchy structure and cpio does not overwrite existing files that are not older

78989
jobs	cron
for rotation i use a set of cron jobs

78989
jobs	cron
following requirements are satisfied by the cron jobs

78996
daemons	systemd
the presence of systemd account such as root sys nobody bin daemons etc

78996
g++	gcc
for a production system the installation should most definitely not include any development tools such as gcc g++ and only the basic services should be running

78997
redhat	fedora
for example i m using fedora a redhat based distro

79028
versioning	upgrade
i remembered i bricked raspbmc once doing apt-get upgrade so i want to make sure the packages are not upgrade to newer versioning when reinstalling which seems to be the case with apt-get install --reinstall by default

79043
clang	llvm
here s how i downloaded clang llvm download page - download llvm 3.2 - clang binaries for ubuntu-12.04 x86_64 .

79045
stdout	stderr
a program is started with three files open stdin #0 stdout #1 and stderr #2

79045
stdout	stderr
if you just run a program from your shell prompt these will be connected to your terminal device so the program reads what you type stdin and prints output stdout and errors stderr to your terminal

79045
stdout	stderr
the shell implemented those redirections by passing the three devices as stdin stdout and stderr instead of the terminal

79045
stdout	stderr
they just use stdin stdout stderr as normal

79050
versioning	upgrade
that is for example reinstall the old versioning of the packages that were upgrade during the process

79053
icmp	tcp
the default firewall of centos permits ssh input tcp 22 and icmp ping

79059
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
either filesystems snapshots through lvm zfs btrfs or instance snapshots if you re using a vm of some kind

79067
versioning	upgrade
agent install is currently packaged with the rpm so when the server is upgrade older versioning of the agent is removed from the system

79067
versioning	upgrade
apparently 4 is not desirable so what we want is to keep all agent versioning that have every been installed even as the server component is being upgrade

79087
debian	linux
i have usb cellular modem attached to an alix 3d2 board running voyage linux which is based on debian squeeze

79091
restrict	shared
this has a double benefit for me it restrict access to both the nis maps and an nfs shared

79110
width	height
arguments mh and mw is max height and max width respectively

79129
ethernet	wireless
let s say my machine is connected to a network via two interfaces one wireless and the other ethernet

79145
folder	directory
now make sure to set default machine folder to this new directory

79151
folder	directory
i would say it makes more sense to put the virtual machines in your home folder since the virtual machine is data that is associated with your user and configure your backup program to exclude that directory

79167
post	get
post reboot without back grounding the commands i get one terminal and when i exit from that one i get the next one and so one

79179
daemons	systemd
have the daemons run automatically whenever the systemd boots

79204
folder	directory
give your description â œopened the folder in the terminal and run the commandâ it s likely that you ran the command sage expecting to execute the program with this name in the current directory

79209
ubuntu	mint
i don t think mint implements this but you can look it up for ubuntu online on the package search page offline with apt-file

79211
freebsd	linux
if have seen this freebsd and linux shared partitions but the answer states it is unconfirmed

79216
bash	zsh
i get the same results in both bash 4.2.45 and zsh 5.0.0

79218
vmware	virtualbox
it would appear to be possible in the first 2 virtualbox and vmware

79218
disk	ram
so it would do so but the physical memory wouldn t become freed would be my guess thus wasting now disk within the vm s swap and still continuing to use the physical ram

79219
vmware	virtualbox
i have both virtualbox and vmware installed so i m guessing that s why i have two vmnet entries

79221
bash	zsh
use a shell with tab completion zsh or bash

79233
put	get
the drive might get to hot therefore wrap it in plastic and put it in the fridge for 10 minutes this gives some readability time before the drive heats up again

79272
packets	multicast
on computer c1 using iperf i am sending udp multicast packets to 239.0.0.1

79272
packets	multicast
on computer c3 using iperf i am seeking udp multicast packets to 239.0.0.1

79272
versioning	upgrade
this is a versioning of iperf upgrade for multicast

79288
ubuntu	linux
canonical provides enterprise editions of ubuntu but their support infrastructure as a company isn t as well developed as suse or red hat s and it s still a niche skillset in enterprise linux

79296
centos	linux
again check out this other unix linux quesiton centos no network interface after installation in virtualbox

79298
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
for some reason when i try to update to a modern version of linux from debian 6.0.7 or ubuntu 10.0.4 i lose most of the resolutions that were available including the native resolution of the panel i m trying to run 1366x768

79298
ubuntu	debian
basically everything works fine in either debian 6.0.7 or ubuntu 10.04

79298
ubuntu	debian
this isn t just a debian issue either since the exact same thing happens going from ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04

79304
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
shopt -s nullglob is bash specific but shells like ksh93 zsh yash tcsh have equivalent statements

79315
stdout	stderr
i know that well-behaved utilities like grep output normal messages to stdout and error messages to stderr

79317
stdout	stderr
my personal preference is to send error messages and exceptions to stderr and informational messages to stdout

79321
stdout	stderr
the easiest way to separate stderr from stdout just imagine all your scripts output will be redirected to another command via pipe

79321
stdout	stderr
in that case you should keep all notifications in stderr as such unexpected information in stdout may break the pipe sequence

79327
bash	zsh
with zsh or bash you can also do

79327
fish	tcsh	fish	bash	bash	tcsh
the part of that was copied by ksh93 in 2003 fish in 2005 bash in 2009 and tcsh in 2010 though tcsh also copied the part

79327
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
unfortunately note that both bash and fish do follow symlinks to directories like -l -follow in find or in zsh or tcsh

79327
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
in those shells you can find pdf files in any level of subdirectories without having to rely on find but note that caveat above about fish and bash and only zsh has the globbing qualifiers

79330
mouse	keyboard
if the page is refreshed then it works but i want to be able to bring up a url without having a mouse or keyboard

79333
stdout	stderr
i generally write everything that relates to the application operation to stderr stdout is reserved for data

79333
stdout	stderr
everything that might be interesting to another application or a postprocessor to my application is going to stdout everything that only relates to the interna of my application is going to stderr

79338
sudoers	visudo
i want to svn export it to etc sudoers but can t do it because sudo detects that it was not edited by visudo and throws syntax errors

79341
sudoers	visudo
it s perfectly fine to edit etc sudoers without using visudo

79341
sudoers	visudo
visudo calls your preferred editor with etc sudoers.tmp checks the syntax on the new content of the file once the editor has returned and commits to etc sudoers when happy

79341
temp	tmp
storing that sudoers temp file in a a world writeable directory like tmp sounds dangerous to me

79350
ati	nvidia
if you want to turn off one monitor only you can to it through xrandr unless you re using a proprietary display driver in which case you ll have the tools provided by nvidia ati

79351
mouse	keyboard
later there also were some graphical terminals so-called xterminals not to be confused with the xterm -program with screen graphical screen-card keyboard mouse and a simple processor

79351
stdout	stderr
as the command inherits the settings for stdin stdout and stderr from the shell the command will write to the terminal s screen and receive input from the terminal s keyboard

79357
unix	bsd
historically my understanding is that bsd userland descends more directly from v6 and v7 bell labs unix via the 32v port to vax hardware

79367
ubuntu	linux
i want to install oracle 11gr2 for linux on ubuntu server 13.04

79370
bsd	aix
mac os x aix bsd

79382
debian	linux
on my raspi board debian linux the usb microphone occasionally gets locked up such that nothing can use it

79387
tunnel	lan
a ssh tunnel can protect you from some kind of sniffing and man-in-the-middle attack inside your network or other lan focused attack

79406
centos	linux
note there seems to be bugs in both bic and cubic for a number of versions of the 2.6.18 kernel used by redhat enterprise linux 5.3 - 5.5 and its variants centos scientific linux etc. we recommend using htcp with a 2.6.18.x kernel to be safe

79453
installation	upgrade
the arch linux installation is quite new so i did not expect any serious upgrade issues for some time.

79455
rss	feed
to avoid this situation in future you should subscribe to the ml or the rss feed from the news page so you get advance warning of any significant changes that require user intervention

79458
post	get
that being said rpms also contain pre and post scripts and some poorly built packages might drop files that wouldn t get tracked in the rpm database

79460
zsh	tcsh
i m a long-time tcsh user that finally decided to try out zsh

79476
ubuntu	opensuse
is this possible to remove from a base installation of opensuse or ubuntu

79479
sudo	passwd
as for elevating this auto logged in user s credentials again this can be done by adding them to sudo so that they aren t challenged for their passwd

79479
sudo	passwd
see this askubunu question - execute sudo without passwd

79485
children	parent
kill the parent bash and its children too will be terminated

79493
ubuntu	linux
howto install oracle 11g on ubuntu linux 12.04 precise pangolin 64bits

79505
cpu	affinity
if you see them as using only one core that s probably because either of cpu affinity settings perhaps there is some tool to spawn a process with different affinity or because one process isn t enough to hold a whole core and the system prefers not to spread out computing

79513
titlebar	window
right-click on the emacs window titlebar then

79520
cpu	processors
each processors is an intel xeon cpu e5430 2.66ghz

79526
cpu	affinity
taskset - retrieve or set a process s cpu affinity

79605
irc	xmpp
specifically it would need to support xmpp and irc

79621
posix	getcwd
getcwd computes the current directory each time it s called by walking down the directory tree so its information is always accurate but for the logical directory implemented by posix shells the information in might become stale

79621
bash	zsh
some like bash or zsh do check that is still a path to the current directory upon cd but not upon pwd

79633
bash	subshell
the problem with using --norc is that it doesn t pull in your .bashrc file so your interactive subshell won t have things you re used to using in bash like your history commands etc

79649
vmware	virtualbox
when i was not able to find anything supporting the protocol i ran the windows application inside a virtual machine vmware at that time but it should work on mint in virtualbox as well just make sure you are allowed to use the usb devices

79649
skype	hangout
however since then i have moved to using skype and google hangout and have not had the need for using yahoo

79662
bash	subshell
export equivalent to declare -x in bash simply makes the variable available to subshell

79664
disk	ram
i have a very comparable system at home 16gb ram 2 x 3tb sata disk in zfs mirror that s been rock solid since upgrading to freebsd 9.1

79690
arp	dhcp
if it uses dhcp you can ping all your network and look in your arp cache for the mac address of your camera

79704

so i m searching a way to find what driver cups use for my printer on ubuntu and maybe use this information to make work it on my debian

79725
postgresql	mysql
consider also tags for other things involved such as postgresql mysql or tape

79727
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu 13.04 linux 64bit

79740
folder	directory
so i want to symlink copy all the files and folder in one directory to another directory

79740
folder	directory
how do i non-recursively symlink all files and folder in one directory to another directory

79741
postfix	dovecot
i m trying to setup postfix dovecot and procmail to work together with virtual users

79783
bash	zsh
ksh has .kshrc bash has .bashrc zsh has .zshrc

79845
hide	show
some files may have windows line endings but still show up as unix - if i run dos2unix on those files it is then fixed and vim correctly labels it and hide m the next time i open that file

79854
bash	subshell
you can start a subshell as login shell bash -l

79863
flac	ogg
you could also losslessly encode to flac and put the streams in an ogg

79869
put	get
if possible for your script you might be able to get the new files put into a separate directory first as a holding area

79872
disk	ram
but even then it may help to read all the inodes before the first gets written assuming you have enough free ram for the disk cache

79886
redhat	fedora
there are a number of files there that pertain to the configuration of a redhat based distro such as fedora centos or rhel

ubuntu	linux
tested on ubuntu 10.04 - 13.04 and arch linux

79939
daemons	systemd
i m trying to use xen with virt-manager on gentoo systemd and i have some troubles with libvirt daemons

79947
put	get
now we get last installed kernel version release and put it on a var

79955
filesystems	ntfs
as new versions of windows came out microsoft has added to the inventory of available attributes on the ntfs filesystems

79963
udp	tcp
i have been testing my application which has tcp udp ports for peer to peer with the help of server signalling commands for making communication that works when i have public ip or lan ip and not firewall port blocks are involved

79963
wan	lan
a pc1 - running in european commission having lan ip and unknown wan ip

79963
wan	lan
b pc2 - running in european commission having lan ip and unknown wan ip

79963
udp	tcp
so i was thinking is there any third party tools which i can use in my pc1 pc2 to make list of ports available remotely to access via tcp udp without caring what firewall or network they are located

79968
umask	mount
if the filesystem does not even support the most basic access rights then the filesystem code has to fake them with the mount option umask for vfat

79971
xfce	kubuntu	xfce	kde	kde	kubuntu
for instance if i install kubuntu comes with kde and then install xfce this should in principle be identical to installing xubuntu comes with xfce then installing kde correct

79974
xfce	kde
as per your second question there might be minor interferences between the two des but all in all kde and then xfce should equal xfce then kde

79984
filesystems	ntfs
as general rule files permission and files attributes are stored into filesistem the exact way depends on the filesystems in question ext3 4 riser ntfs etc .

79993
debian	linux
i would like to skip the username and password prompt at boot-up from debian linux

79995
kde	gnome
i m going to assume you mean the console as opposed to gnome or kde or some such in which case

80004
stdout	stderr
if both stdout and stderr were redirected to a file not the same file

80004
stdout	stderr
both stdout and stderr could be directed to dev null

80013
versioning	upgrade
i need to upgrade to a higher versioning of php

80013
versioning	upgrade
so i am trying to upgrade php to versioning 5.3.26

80016
ubuntu	debian
debian based systems ubuntu etc use a structure of include files which are included into httpd.conf rather than editing it directly

80053
bash	zsh
ksh bash and zsh support brace expansion but note that this not a file glob so it will always expand

80053
bash	zsh
zsh s extended globbing and bash s globstar bash v4 or higher support for recursive globbing

80062
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
you suppose to enter the passwd of user that you are trying to sudo from and make sure user has proper sudo access in visudo etc sudoers

ubuntu	mint
ubuntu mint for desktops laptops

80149
debian	centos	redhat	fedora
some brew of either debian or a redhat based one on supercomputing grids centos fedora rhel

80153
bash	zsh
you can also do this in some shells tested in bash and zsh

80155
stdout	stderr
try making both stdout and stderr unbuffered

80156
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
most modern unix systems solaris linux bsd support access control lists which allow assigning read write excecute permissions for more than one user and more than one group for each file

80156
filesystems	btrfs
ext2 reiserfs btrfs zfs and most other modern unix filesystems formats define a place to store such acls

80156
filesystems	hfs+
the hfs+ filesystems format supports them

80156
filesystems	fat
conversely if you access a fat filesystems on linux all files will have the same permissions

80156
filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs filesystems was extended to store those extra permissions

80160
filesystems	xfs
filesystems such as tmpfs xfs and zfs always support acls

80167
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
as far as linux is concerned start by picking one from the debian camp i recommend debian sid and one from the redhat camp i recommend centos

80171
ubuntu	debian
on debian and derived distributions including ubuntu there is a command called print which has a man page

80171
debian	linux
on most linux distributions xdg-open plays a similar role to debian s edit but there is no analog for print

80195
mouse	keyboard
almost anything you can do with a mouse i can do faster with a keyboard

80200
ubuntu	linux
in the command-line you can change the resoultion i have done so in ubuntu which is essentially linux under the hood

80203
vim	emacs
examples might be emacs and vim

80203
ubuntu	linux
and ubuntu isn t essentially linux under the hood

80203
debian	linux	rhel	slackware	rhel	suse	slackware	suse
it is a linux distribution like debian slackware rhel suse or any number of others

80203
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
it is closely related to debian though which can be used without linux that s debian kfreebsd which is pretty much the same old debian but running on top of the freebsd kernel

80206
mp3	flac
i m looking for something that can take advantage of my gpu or at the very least multiple cores of my cpu to convert a few terabytes of flac to mp3 vbr v0 very quickly while preserving all of the tags

80229
g++	gcc
i m looking for a suitable linux distribution with good multimedia support codecs for audio video content and also good programming support which includes gcc g++ vim editor supporting syntax highlight and auto-indent

80251
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	aix	solaris	aix

ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
mint assuming you are using mint and not mint debian can use ubuntu repositories

80266
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade it to a new versioning

80268
versioning	upgrade
i suggest you upgrade to a current versioning of fedora which will naturally upgrade valgrind

80279
daemons	systemd
it makes sense to show normal users in a login dialog so that you can click them instead of having to type the user name but it wouldn t to show systemd accounts the uids under which daemons and other automatic processes run there

80279
min	max
# min max values for automatic uid selection in useradd

80279
min	max
# min max values for automatic gid selection in groupadd

80286
sudo	passwd
for some reason i suddenly do not need to enter the passwd when issuing sudo some_cmd

80289
sudo	passwd
if it starts asking again all that was happening is that you had sudo configured to remember your passwd for some time

80289
sudo	passwd
if you authenticate with sudo then create a new tab with ctrl-shift-t you ll find that you don t need to give a passwd to sudo again in that tab despite the fact that it also creates a new tty

80289
sudo	passwd
you can even close the terminal app entirely and as long as you restart it within the normal passwd timeout sudo will run without requiring you to re-enter your passwd

80289
centos	linux
red hat enterprise linux and derivatives like centos insist on getting the password on each new tty

80295
debian	linux
since i had some trouble with 3g modems previously i d like to know whether it ll work well with linux preferably debian without doing any magic

80310
kde	kubuntu
i m running kubuntu so a kde solution would be even better than zenity but i already installed zenity so i can keep using it.

80320
dpkg	apt
trying to roll back apt automatically is not recommended but if you use the logs then it should be possible to do it manually unless the failed action has broken something that interferes with apt s actions an inconsistent dpkg database

80338
dpkg	apt
how can i get ubuntu apt dpkg to tell me that bar is installed because foo is installed

80344
sudo	passwd
is it not a gaping security hole in linux why couldn t i compile a heavily-patched sudo that just did whatever regular sudo did but didn t ask for the unprivileged user s passwd

80364
ubuntu	centos
just to be certain double check you main.cf etc postfix main.cf on my ubuntu distros not 100 sure for centos and make sure that you have

80371
kde	gnome
kde or gnome running or not yad gtkdialog xdialog installed or not

80371
pop-up	dialog
yad yet another dialog is a fork of zenity with many improvements such as custom buttons additional dialog pop-up menu in notification icon and more

80372
bash	subshell
however in bash introducing a pipe means the individual commands are run in subshell

80374
filesystems	ntfs
if there are problems with the scsi drive or you just want to be sure to be able to start over from scratch make a copy of your file and try to repair the ntfs filesystems on the second copy

80406
pkcs#12	pfx
how to convert a complete pkcs#12 pfx certificate to receive it in web service and redirects it to pjp page which i download it in there to browser

80411
rss	feed
using claws-mail website and a plug-in rssyl to read rss feed i collected a lot of text files

80443
sudoers	visudo
to obtain this you have to edit etc sudoers using visudo and add this directive

80450
mouse	keyboard
so i just installed debian on my other computer and i ve run into an interesting problem once i log in the keyboard and mouse buttons don t work

80450
mouse	keyboard
i can move the mouse but clicking does nothing as do keyboard shortcuts

80450
mouse	keyboard
i know the mouse and keyboard work as i ve used them in windows

80466
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu i found a couple of ppas which sort of keep certain packages updated but haven t found a good guide to do so for debian

80468
ubuntu	mint
this is a common defect in newer mint ubuntu versions

80468
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
i find debian versions easily install on machines that mint ubuntu hang freeze fail on

80478
google-chrome	firefox
it s correct to forward firefox banshee and other applications however when i want to use google-chrome it shows a message

80486
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome have the limitation useless explained in his answer you cannot have multiple processes running with the same browser profile

80488
mouse	keyboard
is there a way to detect if a keyboard and a mouse is plugged in and working in linux

80489
filesystems	ntfs
i want to mount my windows ntfs share c to linux ext4 filesystems so i can see the filesystems tree as part of my linux filesystems and transfer my files

80491
mouse	keyboard
connected to the dock is a bluetooth mouse a bluetooth keyboard and a dvi-display

80492
centos	linux
centos linux by default allows all users to have permission to halt reboot the system by using the commands halt and reboot

80499
voip	sip
i am not at all sure about voip support do you need proper sip support or simply computer-to-computer voice messaging

80534
ubuntu	linux
this is my first time using linux ubuntu 12.04 and i m trying to get a development environment going to learn to use the shell python and other things as i learn more

80544
debian	linux
i am wanting to download every version of the linux kernel as source code debian files and rpm files

80569
wpa	dhcp
i can connect without issue to wpa networks but if i am somewhere like a hotel and try to connect to an unsecured wifi things hang at the dhcp part and i don t get an ip assigned

80579
versioning	upgrade
the openvpn versioning should also be able to be compiled with and work on linux kernel 2.4.21 due to business reasons i am not allowed to upgrade

80579
centos	linux
will older openvpn versions that work on linux kernel 2.4.21 centos 3 be compatible with the ios client

80589
centos	linux
given centos 3 is a hard requirement i would first find out what is the latest version of openvpn that will run on that version of linux

80591
filesystems	fat
the filesystems usually used on sd cards is fat which has actually a rather simple structure so you probably want to look around for utilities that would try to reconstruct that these utilities have been around since dos times one example can be the norton utilities

80593
ubuntu	mint
video showing mint 15 ubuntu raring update-grub error bug

80621
debian	linux
i muffed up my graphics card driver and or xconfig files and decided to just reinstall debian linux squeeze 6.0.6 last night

80629
stdout	stderr
i have tried all sorts of ways to redirect both stdout and stderr to dev null without any success

80632
stdout	stderr
you have to redirect stdout first before duplicating it into stderr

80632
stdout	stderr
if you duplicate it first stderr will just point to what stdout originally pointed at

80642
stdout	stderr
if the output on error is printed to stderr and all of the output in case of normal exit to stdout you can redirect the output when you start the command with at

80642
stdout	stderr
by default at emails both stdout and stderr from the man page

80642
stdout	stderr
i have for these kind of things a small python program that wraps another command and caches the output both stdout and stderr this cached data is only sent if the exit value of the command is non-zero or if some special error strings was present in the output which was handy for some windows linker i used that always exited with 0 although there were errors.

80651
ubuntu	centos
i would say centos is probably not as hardware compatible as ubuntu when it comes to recognizing a large array of hardware

80651
ubuntu	centos
so i would expect better hardware support overall from ubuntu for a larger swath of hardware than form centos

80652
rpm	yum
fedora might be a good alternative using many of the same or similar packages and using the same package manager yum rpm

80657
ubuntu	mint
to echo and amplify slm if you are looking for highest likelihood of just working ubuntu has probably hit more varied desktop configurations than any other considering that distrowatch s top 2 are ubuntu and mint an ubuntu derivative

80664
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
nearly all common distro s ubuntu debian centos etc have support for iptables built-in

80681
folder	directory
for example i have partition for multimedia storage i can mount it in folder mnt multimedia and bind music and video folder to home directory with this fstab

80692
bash	zsh
i use pushd to work with multiple directories in bash and zsh

80692
bash	zsh
is there a way either in bash or zsh that i can refer to one of the directories listed on the command line using an alias for its position on the stack

80704
bash	zsh
bash s dirs +2 is zsh s print -r 2 or

80740
sudo	passwd
can i use scp to copy a file from a remote server which my login user can t read but where i have permission to sudo to root without passwd even

80747
switching	screens
the --primary switching sets the vga screens as the primary monitor and causes the panel to be displayed on it

80762
sudo	passwd
if your sudo requires typing in a passwd you will want to add -t just after the ssh in order to type in the sudo passwd

80768
daemons	launchd
is this in debian the correct way to specify the dependency of the second daemons upon the first being launchd before

80786
ubuntu	debian
but there is no any word if it is possible to run debian from usb the same way as ubuntu on machine with windows xp installed

80809
spaces	delimiter
should they appear within double quotes would expand and be delimiter by the first character of ifs which by default is spaces

80847
freebsd	linux
i have attached a freebsd disk to my linux machine

80857
buildroot	uclibc
i have a custom application running on an embedded x86 setup built using buildroot and uclibc

80913
kate	gedit
when i opened the .vba file in kate or gedit i saw that neither of them have highlighting syntax knowledge of visual basic code

80917
vim	emacs
apart from vim with visual basic highlighting as evan indicated there is also a visual basic mode for emacs

80917
emacs	gedit
emacs is not a lightweight editor like gedit is it is well worth learning to use something as powerful as emacs

80920
sudo	passwd
members of the sudo group in my debian install can execute anything without entering a passwd

80924
sudo	passwd
the two main ways are either explicitly logging in as root with a dedicated root passwd or using a privileged user which is allowed to use sudo to do so

80924
sudo	passwd
without nopasswd sudo will ask for your own passwd

80938
put	get
so if you put comma then you will not get missing error

80945
folder	directory
your home directory might then not be files in folder but instead merely lists of tags folder where a file may be found in more than one

80950
folder	directory
it s also true that the hierarchy part is just a fiction folder better referred to as directory and their membership get their arrangement from the kernel making it so by reading file names and matching inode numbers from a directory s data

80952
debian	linux
i am downloading isos for the wheezy distribution of debian linux for an old amd box without any internet

80953
solaris	sunos
how do i set the shell in solaris sunos for my user only without access to etc passwd or any other su stuff

80973
ubuntu	debian
if you are on debian ubuntu you should use adduser and usermod

80981
sudo	passwd
optionally a secure way for the user to enter their sudo passwd

80981
sudo	passwd
kdesudo may be a solution but it reprompts for the passwd many times ignoring the usual default sudo timeout of x minutes

80991
bash	tcsh
i ve used csh and tcsh for decades myself though i ve recently switched mostly to bash and i routinely run into cases like this where i have to experiment to determine how something is going to work

80991
bash	tcsh
csh and tcsh do have somewhat more convenient array syntax than bash has

80991
bash	tcsh
also bash arrays are 0-based while csh tcsh arrays are 1-based

80995
stdout	stderr
use additinal fd 3 and 4 for stdout and stderr and simply redirect 1 and 2 to them at the end of your script

81021
vmware	virtualbox
from what i understand the virtual machine software qemu vmware virtualbox will have to create a window to show the guest operating system and will therefore need a desktop environment

81044
button	checkbox
but there isn t button checkbox for that in virt-manager nor a quick google search turn up anything

81047
daemons	systemd
i m looking for something like a cross between libnotify in that it uses dbus programmes hook into it and there s a notification daemons and google s re-imagined unified notification systemd

81053
vim	notepad++
for convenience vim is able to highlight changes within a line but it does not detect moves of blocks of lines unlike notepad++

81055
switching	screens
i d like to be able to switching which screens is active using a simple mouse-click or keyboard combination

81064
bash	zsh
also beware of in bash ksh zsh at least

81084
bash	zsh
set -u is in effect or causes an error if a is unset in bash and ksh93 but not in dash pdksh or zsh

81088
crypt	hash
â œsalt typeâ refers to the algorithm used to hash the password by the crypt function

81088
hash	salt
the salt type is visible in the password hash the second field of master.passwd which starts with the salt type between dollars so in your case

81095
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
you can use debootstrap to install a debian or ubuntu release in a directory of any linux system

81095
ubuntu	mint
while mint isn t explicitly supported you can install the ubuntu release that the mint release you want is based on

81095
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
the debian ubuntu and mint installers do a bit more than that so you won t get exactly the same experience from a system installed with debootstrap and from a system installed with the installer

81121
mtu	icmp
but you don t even allow outgoing icmp so that path mtu discovery would t even work

81130
move	drag
right click on the swap partition and click resize move now drag and move the coloured box with the two arrows all the way to the right.then click the resize move button.now we can resize the linux mint partition right click it and click resize move then drag the right arrow to the right as far as you can then click the resize move button

81139
kde	gnome
if you re using a graphical login manager one supplied with gnome or kde instead of login the mail environmental variable may not be set

81165
bash	tcsh
to clarify i want xterm to use tcsh pterm to use pysh gnome-terminal to use bash etc

81181
sudo	passwd
normally if sudo requires a passwd it will read it from the user s terminal

81194
ubuntu	debian
i regularly use debian ubuntu redhat and solaris 11

81195
octal	decimal
note1 when in ascii dump mode showkey -a showkey prints to the standard output the decimal octal and hexadecimal value s of the key pressed according to he present keymap

81197
ethernet	wireless
i mean download them all plugin for firefox report my internet speed over ethernet card when download a movie is 1.5mb s and other internet speed over wireless card is 1.0mb s

81199
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have tried ubuntu 13.04 and linux mint 15 and both do not have optinos for setting mouse scroll wheel sensitivity

81199
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
is this only a problem of gnome distros or kde and xfce has the same problems too

81201
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
ubuntu 13.04 linux mint 15

81201
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
is this only a problem of gnome distros or kde or xfce based would work better for me

81205
rpm	yum
to install an application by package management he needs only to run rpm or yum or apt-get as root not any program

81209
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
is this only a problem of gnome distros or kde or xfce based would work better for me

81214
ethernet	wireless
this method isn t as flexible and i d avoid it if one of the ethernet devices is wireless

81219
installation	upgrade
so i booted the stick again without doing linux rescue and chose upgrade an existing installation and to reinstall grub

81247
ubuntu	debian
installing debian from this usb in hope that it will preserve the persistent files like ubuntu does - installs a clean system

81250
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are the best for security updates

81250
debian	linux	google-chrome	firefox
if you use debian linux they recommend their versions of firefox or google-chrome

81262
dpkg	aptitude
i want to use apt-get or dpkg as the uninstaller since some people will not have aptitude installed and i do not want users of the gem to have to install anything

81262
dpkg	aptitude
maybe i could programmatically manage aptitude s marked unmarked packages list if i could find where it is although i d prefer a cleaner solution. i assume it s not var lib dpkg status or else there would be no disparity

81292
rsa	dsa
4 of them are for dsa and rsa public private keys

81298
sorting	filtering
procmail is a powerful mail delivery agent mda capable of sorting and filtering mail based on rulesets called recipes

81299
comm	grep
# ps axo stat ppid pid comm | grep -w defunct

81300
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
upgrade of the kernel in debian or ubuntu linux

81303
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
if you use sshv2 you chose between multiple signing algorithms like dsa rsa and ecdsa and then the ssh_host_ecdsa_key and etc are used

81306
cat	tee
cat dev urandom | padsp tee | aplay

81314
debian	linux
or suse linux or debian linux because if you actually make your

81327
debian	linux
they create a lot of software and allow anybody to distribute it but you could hardly call the project a software distribution unlike the debian project which is focused on distributing a full os with linux or optionally a different kernel such as hurd or kfreebsd

81327
debian	linux
note also that debian calls their linux distribution debian gnu linux to emphasize that crucial parts of the distribution builds on gnu software

81327
debian	linux
it s not entirely accurate because there are parts in debian which are neither gnu nor linux. at the time gnu founder richard m stallman was arguing that linux distributions built on a gnu toolchain and userspace should be called gnu linux or something like that but very few actually followed suit

81330
centos	linux
i m trying to set up centos 6.4 linux 2.6.32-358.11.1.el6.x86_64 with a specific version of php 5.2.17 as it is required by an app i m trying to install

81330
centos	linux
i m new with linux but might it be that php is el5 but centos is el6

81335
ubuntu	linux
i am pretty new to linux this is my first real time using xubuntu used ubuntu before and raspbian on my rpi and i have a mouse that is way too sensitive

81354
post	put
what should i put in the post section so the appropriate key gets imported

81359
bash	zsh
if you have a modern shell bash 4+ zsh ksh you can get recursive globbing with globstar

81376
debian	linux
on a linux machine debian based i get this when opening the man page for du

81384
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu linux

81392
folder	dir	folder	directory
i have a directory dir that contains a bunch of random folder like dir av 801 and dir lm 320

81392
folder	directory
i want to copy the contents of every inner folder ie av 801 into a different directory

81398
openbsd	linux
openbsd netcat is available by default on linux and also on os x

81405
filesystems	btrfs
under linux the btrfs filesystems supports snapshot

81405
solaris	bsd
another filesystem that supports snapshots is zfs which is native to solaris and also available on linux and bsd

81412
folder	directory
now the reason why i googled about soft and hard links is simply because i was organizing my folder and files and in one point i wanted one file to be referenced to from another directory

81421
fish	bash
what is the fish shell equivalent to the following bash

81440
dns	spf
spf records are just dns txt records that contains rules saying which hosts are allowed to send email for a given domain

81525
single-quotes	double-quotes
use double-quotes instead of single-quotes

81541
ubuntu	debian
perl-rename used by debian and its derivatives such as ubuntu and many others

81565
ubuntu	linux
lrzsz package has installed in my linux server ubuntu 13.04

81584
clang	llvm
i am trying to have llvm and clang on a centos 5 without root permissions

81584
clang	llvm
i tried to do it downloading llvm and clang src packages and trying the ususal configure make and make install steps as such

81614
folder	dir
note which takes backup of mention dir but it puts every users dir into one folder

81639
lsof	pstree
top -c does not help pgrep bash just gives me different lists of pids lsof bin bash just lists running bash instances and pstree shows them as independent processes

81639
debian	mint	debian	linux
in case it is relevant i am running linux mint debian kernel 3.2.0-4-amd64 gnu bash version 4.2.36 1 -release

81640
ubuntu	linux
i know that there are many different distributions of linux including ubuntu

81640
ubuntu	linux
here is my problem i ve found very useful videos on youtube teaching how to use linux commands in linux with ubuntu distribution

81649
macports	homebrew
you can use homebrew as a package manager for installation macports packages onto your mac as well

81649
macports	homebrew
going the macports homebrew route will probably get you 90 + of the way to what having an ubuntu box would give you in terms of getting experience with the gnu unix tools

debian	linux
the following is the trace of vim saving a file in debian 7.1 linux 3.2

81675
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m using linux precisely mint 13 maya which is based on ubuntu precise

81689
bash	zsh
in shells other than bash and zsh use instead of

81718
daemons	systemd
dunst is a notification daemons dropbox notifications notify-send and other on screen displays are handled by dunst on my systemd

81743
bash	zsh
the equivalent command in sh bash and zsh hangs the shell and by hang i mean that i cannot kill the command or suspend it using c-z c-c

81761
put	get
i put the right ip and port 2345 in the connection window but upon attempting to connect i get a black screen with a solid green cursor which after a few seconds gives a gui popup saying network error connection timed out

81777
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
you may have a vg volume group linux with the lvs logical volumes debian ubuntu opensuse .

81808
centos	linux
i m using a windows computer to connect to centos 6 linux with putty

81861
stdout	stderr
i know how to redirect stderr to a file or to the stdout when i issue a command or or even

81882
stdout	stderr
just to break this down a little bit more so it s crystal clear what s going on the will run any output returned both stderr stdout is merged together

81903
put	get
if you get a response there then the problem is with your hostname resolution in which case you need to put your nameservers in the etc resolv.conf file

81927
pop-up	dialog
in both cases it pop-up a little password dialog and opens the viewer but it s still dependent on the console being open

81947
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
the backend is configurable so you can choose what ever version control system you want to use git svn bazaar etc.

81947
pecl	pear
this tool will collect the customized configurations along with packages you ve installed using any of hte package management tools such as packages managed by apt yum rubygems pythonâ s easy_install and pip phpâ s pear and pecl and node.jsâ npm

81961
put	get
put noauto in etc fstab so the nfs volume does not get mounted at boot time

82003
daemons	launchd
thereafter launchd sshd daemons with restrictions

82007
unix	bsd
this is also how it was handled in the 1983 release of 4.3 bsd which was the first general release of the modern unix ip stack

82010
children	parent
this signal tells the parent process to execute the wait system call and clean up its zombie children

82010
children	parent
if a parent process continues to create zombies it should be fixed so that it properly calls wait to reap its zombie children

82019
ubuntu	linux
i m curious about one aspect of heap management in linux and particularly in ubuntu s build of glibc 2.17

82021
debian-based	linux
in debian-based linux distributions which use the apt-get utility to manage packages there is also a nice command named apt-file

82054
apache	cherokee	apache	nginx	nginx	cherokee
if those directories are owned by the same user as the one running your webserver application apache nginx cherokee then you should be able to get away with 664

82097
bash	subshell
subshell are syntactical sugar for bash -c echo a

82126
folder	directory
now i can log in via ftp see all the directory listings not limited jailed to any directory but i cannot create a new folder inside var www html

82130
mouse	keyboard
the problem is that xfce4 starts shows default the ui but the usb keyboard and mouse are not working

82130
mouse	keyboard
i also tried to run kde4 the same way and the keyboard and mouse weren t working so it seems the chrooted x server is causing trouble

82166
spaces	linefeed
i ve had issues copying public keys to authorized_keys and winding up with an extra linefeed or spaces or something

82198
xfce	gnome
that is will it all be configured just as if i had xfce gnome installed

82201
folder	directory
block - this is not the block folder in the driver directory

82223
centos	linux
i do a lot of remote programming on my centos linux server by opening an x11 xterminal window on my mac os and ssh into the server

82229
ubuntu	mint
would i be able to run then all 3 systems ubuntu mint windows from the menu when starting a computer or not

82242
google-chrome	firefox
any ideas how to enable webgl in either google-chrome or firefox

82246
cpu	processors
while the processors temperature can vary depending on the cpu activity from 40 to 85 deg

82252
ubuntu	centos
after doing change just run or if you are using ubuntu then reboot the system because below command work and tested in centos

82253
google-chrome	firefox
well according to the webgl public wiki both firefox and google-chrome support webgl with nvidia gpus in x11 linux

82254
next	except
gateway appears to be correct it s identical to a machine with fc 16 sitting right next to it except for the brand-new device names

82296
sudoers	visudo
second edit your sudoers file using visudo and add a line as the following

82302
redhat	fedora
nautilus â œopen in terminalâ on fedora centos redhat rhel

82308
next	except
except that if the next key i want to press is also an arrow key i want to go to the bash prompt above and search history for previous command then this keystroke is also interpreted by tmux

82325
kde	gnome
there are many tools like the klipper and glipper for kde and gnome but many others for other wm and most of then are wm independent

82341
debian	linux
i m using linux with grub 2 specifically 1.99-27+deb7u1 on debian wheezy on a single-boot system no second os installed to take into consideration

82378
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
i m often exposed to various gnu linux systems including centos sles and debian

82382
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu at least maybe others you can use update-rc.d to selectively enable disable scripts found in etc init.d or to set them up to default or recommended settings for each script

82386
opensuse	linux
all machines are running linux mostly kubuntu 12.04 or opensuse 12.3

82388
ubuntu	linux
the hard disk in question is the one i use for ubuntu linux

82388
ubuntu	linux
ever since this happened i can t boot into ubuntu linux

82401
post	get
i m setting up something where i ll need to be able to setup a service that accepts input on a tcp port and then parses the xml provided and extracts the necessary data then post that to google s universal analytics via http get

82419
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
obviously the chmod 777 leaves a directory completely open to anyone but does my practice of using sudo chown .

82421
sudo	passwd
you don t actually need to create a group but it makes management easier. create a sudo rule that allows users in the group juniors to obtain the permissions of the group seniors but only to execute one specific program â â the script that reads the passwd file

82421
sudoers	visudo
run visudo to add this line to the sudoers file

82421
sudo	passwd
nonetheless the user who called sudo will not be able to access the passwd file unless the script is buggy and can be tricked to leak it

82421
sudo	passwd
note again that sudo is only useful if you need some people to be able to access the resource without knowing the passwd

82422
x86	64bit
if blender is a binary then the loader is the dynamic loader lib ld-linux.so.2 blender-2.66rc blender for a 32-bit x86 binary or lib ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 blender-2.66rc blender for a 64bit x86 binary

82430
ubuntu	linux
recent versions of ubuntu including 12.04 provide a cross-compilation toolchain targeting arm linux â binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi â g++-arm-linux-gnueabi etc

82445
ubuntu	opensuse
for the media player i can use play on opensuse or mplayer on ubuntu

82449
authorization	access-control
terminal access controller access-control system tacacs is a remote authorization protocol that is used to communicate with an authorization server commonly used in unix networks

82464
cifs	smb
samba smb cifs file print

82465
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
this will configure your modem to be used with ubuntu linux mint debian crunchbangnor other debian based os

82468
kde	gnome
i switched to kde from gnome after seven years using the latter

82509
bash	zsh
the behaviour you are observing in zsh and bash when executing is caused by mc

82509
bash	zsh
also you think that bash and zsh are hanging but i would say that they are not hanging but waiting for the echo command to return

82515
stdout	stderr
as mentioned in the correct answer below the permission denied messages are appearing in stderr and not stdout

82516
stdout	stderr
the simple solution is redirecting stderr to stdout

82518
kde	gnome
x windows gnome ubuntu unity kde mir wayland who does what in terms of display server window manager and graphics driver

82519
kde	gnome
gnome ubuntu unity and kde are all desktop environments not window managers

82520
debian	linux
i have a linux system running debian wheezy stable on it and am using it as a file repository not a true file server because i am using bittorrent sync to move files as i move around the world

82527
postgresql	mysql
currently mysql postgresql oracle and

82529
irc	whois
some of the irc servers provide web frontends to the whois command so if you know someone frequents a particular irc server you can search for them using those

82530
kde	gnome
gnome and kde are desktop environments

82530
kde	gnome
the core of them are their respective application toolkits which are gtk for gnome and qt for kde

82557
jobs	cron
i want to ask about cron jobs

82557
daemon	cron
ok we place the scripts in the crontab and the cron daemon executes them

82569
put	get
so if i put all three interfaces into a single 802.3ad bond do i get two aggregators

82573
jobs	cron
i found this q a over on stackoverflow titled how does cron internally schedule jobs

82573
jobs	cron
for example your question as to how does cron deal with jobs that are scheduled for the same time

82573
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
one of the answers in that thread states that as the cron daemon processes each task it forks each scheduled job so that no single job will act as a blocker for jobs that have overlapping times

82591
ubuntu	linux
the installed os on the bb is an ubuntu linux

82620
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 6.0.7

82639
sudo	passwd
in the comments it was mentioned that a normal user could have the right to use sudo and if this user s passwd would be guessed the system is totally lost too

82642
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
the good thing about debian is that since it s definitively the most widely used linux including it s derivatives such as ubuntu the support community and number of pre-compiled packages available is extremely extensive

82658
sudo	passwd
i would appreciate a working example of how to implement sudo x11vnc -storepasswd .vnc passwd in a script

82661
pull	push
every time i try to push pull shell ls the adb disconnects from device

82683
tunnel	packets	udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
that is it is a network layer emulation device that can tunnel data packets of varied nature be it raw tcp udp sctp or encapsulated packets such as ppp pptp ah ipsec whatever

82699
stdout	stderr
since these are error messages they are sent to stderr not stdout

82701
sudo	passwd
sudo has an option -s that allows it to read the passwd from stdin

82701
sudo	passwd
this would allow you to use sudo commands in your script without having to hardcode a passwd

82701
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
alternatively you could add your user or a subset of users the capability to run x11vnc with sudo without a passwd but adding a line like this to etc sudoers

82720
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu linux 10.04

82731
jobs	cron
i want to have a separate folders for cron jobs like

82731
folder	directory	jobs	cron
similarly i want to have more files in that directory for each separate cron job so that i can centralize and separate the cron jobs from one folder

82734
sudo	passwd
and as soon as the attacker has access to the account the sysadmin uses for ssh logins and then uses su or sudo to do his tasks he can infect that user s session with a program which will send the attacker root passwd when the sysadmin types that the next time

82742
ubuntu	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux
i know this to be the behavior on puppy linux 5.2.8 lupu which is based on ubuntu 10.04 and research indicates it is common at least for many debian-based distros like ubuntu

82743
freebsd	linux
i don t see why it would not be feasible although i can t say if it exists on any nix os it might on the more specialized ones such as qnx but i have my doubts about more general-purpose systems like os x freebsd or linux

82766
bash	zsh
if the echo builtin of your shell supports it bash and zsh do but not dash you just need to use the right backslash escapes

82776
ubuntu	linux
i am a ubuntu user by the way and i am not really experienced with linux i would be grateful for any answer

82781
bash	zsh
following the link about per-directory history in zsh and then the link in the comment there two per-directory history in bash links are provided one is broken but corrected here

82785
stdout	stderr
the file descriptors for stdin stdout and stderr are 0 1 and 2 respectively so to read from stdin you d want to have

82794
voip	sip
i was very happily using voip sip with ubuntu 10.04

82798
debian	linux
i am using debian gnu linux jessie sid updated to latest

82800
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu you can determine what package to install when you encounter a missing command line tool

82808
children	parent
on ubuntu 12.04 i have several apache2 processes running the 1130 parent and the children it spawned and as you can see they have around 300-400 mb of virtual memory and 10 mb of resident memory

82821
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i don t know is that only my problem or not but i have a little eyestrain when using fedora 19 with gnome 3 .8 compared to ubuntu linux mint or windows

82863
gentoo	linux
i have compiled mplayer with vdpau in gentoo linux amd64 but i get this error

82868
switching	screens
the -s switching starting line number will also be useful if you want to capture lines outside the current screens

82869
filesystems	btrfs
i d like to assign different raid levels to different subvolumes in my btrfs filesystems eg have a subvolume home that uses raid 1 and a subvolume var that uses raid 0

82880
dnf	yum
but to be honest i really want a better method to select the same packages on the new fedora 19 system b i just want to install the packages from system a that were explicitly mentioned on a dnf install or yum install command line - and not those that were installed as dependencies

82897
postgresql	mysql
currently mysql postgresql oracle and

82906
ubuntu	linux
it looks like many standard windows external hard drives are formatted in either ntfs or fat32 whereas our ubuntu linux file server uses nfs

82910
ubuntu	linux
my institution has a ubuntu linux cluster

82911
ubuntu	linux
it looks like many standard windows external hard drives are formatted in either ntfs or fat32 whereas our ubuntu linux file server uses nfs

82911
filesystems	ntfs
it may come pre-formatted with ntfs which is a sensible choice for most people who buy them but nothing stop you from changing the filesystems and reformatting

82913
bash	zsh
the shell does not matter happens on zsh bash and ash

82921
ubuntu	opensuse
on ubuntu my scripts are located in etc network if-up.d and in other distros opensuse they are in etc sysconfig network if-up.d

82923
ubuntu	debian
i cross posted this question to askubuntu because my problem seems most acute on debian ubuntu but it was suggested that i ask here

82923
ubuntu	opensuse
whatever method is suggested for solving this problem should work on most distros opensuse ubuntu

82934
daemons	systemd	backgrounding	multitasking
a number of backgrounding processes can be running on a multitasking operating systemd such as linux while the user is interacting with the foreground process some backgrounding processes such as daemons for example never require user input

82950
jobs	cron
they probably contain reports from cron jobs

82954
kde	gnome
when you click the x to close the terminal window that is sending a signal from your desktop gnome kde etc. to the terminal application telling it to shut itself down

82954
children	parent
so part of the responsibilities of being a parent process is that you in turn send this same close signal to your children

82965
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
using the socket api you can exchange data between two endpoints over tcp ip connections sctp associations udp datagrams or between two processes datagram or connection using unix domain sockets.

82971
debian	linux
debian 7 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.46-1 x86_64 gnu linux

83006
rpm	yum
have you tested yum or rpm as explained here

83006
rpm	yum
should work if you installed it with yum or rpm

83009
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
anyway i suggest you to try ubuntu or linux mint as your first linux experience

83011
sudo	passwd
i have no passwd for bob but i was told i can use his powers by typing sudo su - bob and then doing stuff

83011
sudo	passwd
i tried many combinations of su sudo etc. but the result is always the same - passwd prompt and after that rejection

83016
daemon	cron
well if there is some cron daemon you can have a cron job for bob which regularly executes some bash script

83035
openbsd	freebsd
for freebsd there exists a testsuite called paxtest is there a paxtest available for openbsd

83047
ubuntu	debian
when you install debian or ubuntu you are not offered this option

83056
umask	sudo
in my user account i set the umask to be 022 with my .bashrc but i want root to use a umask of 077 no matter how i become root logging in directly as root on a tty or using sudo or su

83060
ubuntu	debian
i m using debian wheezy and i wonder are ubuntu ppas hosted at launchpad safe to be added used on debian

83073
ubuntu	debian
i don t know about ubuntu 11.xx and earlier but ubuntu 12.04 has libc6-2.15 while debian wheezy uses libc6-2.13

83079
osx	mint
i was able sucessfully get my printer working on linux mint 13 cups 1.5.3 by editing the mac osx ppd file and removing superficial mac osx specific entries and substituting a linux cupsfilter in place of the macosx one as mentioned by gilles see step 3 below - i hope it works for you too

83080
bash	zsh
ksh bash zsh syntax above

83102
put	get
to get both types of shells to read the umask you need to include it in one of the files mentioned above that both types of shell invocations will read so i d put it in root .bash_profile

83110
cpu	processors
check the cpu usage with top or htop to see if something is running the processors up

83118
debian	linux
antix is a fast lightweight and easy-to-install linux live cd distribution based on debian s testing branch for x86 compatible systems

83123
daemons	systemd
in an unusual scenario i have to get rid of a specific systemd user account called lp line printing daemons on an opensuse systemd

83124
ubuntu	debian
i don t know suse use ubuntu and debian myself but i don t think you ll run into problems

83156
freebsd	linux
recently i ve stumbled upon an interesting question about the difference between linux and freebsd why would someone choose freebsd over linux

83156
freebsd	linux
i ve read that the main difference is that linux is just a kernel and freebsd is a complete os with many integrated packages in it that work seamlessly

83158
kde	kubuntu
i want to see the results in kompare i m on kde - kubuntu 12.04

83190
freebsd	netbsd
it contains elements from freebsd netbsd and if you install the optional developer tools gnu user-land tools

83192
execvp	execl
they ve got c library functions to help them doing that the environment is made available as a environ variable and you can retrieve and modify that list the copy of the list of environment variables it received with getenv setenv putenv and functions like execvp execl system popen .

83221
centos	linux
so i m on a vps - centos linux installation

83221
folder	directory
what i m struggling to do is to create the user to only have access to var www mydomain.com - i observed that the user correctly logs into the right folder however the user can then browse back to other directory

83279
filesystems	xfs
i m currently trying to install xfs filesystems support because my usb hard disk is formatted with it but unfortunately dd-wrt firmware doesn t seem to support it

83307
stdout	stderr
those messages are printed as errors stderr rather than regular output stdout

83307
stdout	stderr
only stdout gets piped not stderr

83307
stdout	stderr
so by having after grep you are only merging the stdout and stderr output of grep itself it will not merge the stderr of conntrack

83307
stdout	stderr
stderr is file descriptor 2 and stdout is file descriptor 1

83307
stdout	stderr
merges stderr into stdout

83312
sudo	passwd
if the script isn t running as root then give the user running the script the permission to run sudo reboot without supplying a passwd

83312
sudoers	passwd
note that if there s an entry for the same user in the sudoers file that requires a passwd the nopasswd entry must come after

83316
freebsd	linux
from a system administrator s point of view freebsd is closer to a specific linux distribution than to linux in general

83331
cpu	processors
what is difference between cores cpu threads and processors on linux system

83335
cpu	processors
a core is a cpu is a processors

83335
cpu	processors
a processors is another name for a cpu

83349
cpu	processors
early processors were mostly composed of a cpu

83349
cpu	processors
a two core cpu is roughly equivalent to two single core processors although shared components might reduce the gain if a component is a bottleneck or on the opposite and more commonly improve the performance because of a faster internal communication between cores

83360
xfce	kubuntu	xfce	kde	kde	kubuntu
over kubuntu because xfce and lxde are generally more lightweight than kde

83360
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
you could also try the currently very popular and also on ubuntu basing linux mint with the cinnamon or mate desktop

83389
sudo	passwd
i can run the sudo command locally without passwd

83405
sudo	passwd
sudo when executed w o terminal requires a helper program to handle passwd query

83405
sudo	passwd
normally when you connect via ssh and sudo will need a passwd but terminal is not allocated it will blow an error - on aix this can behave different

83414
versioning	upgrade
there s not a lot of information here for instance you haven t mentioned how you re going to be upgrading does your distro provide a dedicated upgrade tool or are you just going to run the installer of the new versioning

83414
folder	directory
so for example if the same .kde directory exists in your home folder then your kde should look and behave exactly as it did before the upgrade

83415
spaces	delimiter
characters delimiter by white spaces

83422
bash	zsh
you could skip the first line with ksh93 zsh bash syntax

83442
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu debian you also have a couple of other alternatives

83446
apache	nginx
this issue you re encountering is typically why most server daemons such as apache nginx or jetty log all the current date into a file named error.log and then this file is rotated to another name such as error_20130517.log afterwards

83454
redhat	fedora
do you trust microsoft to do a good job or do you trust canonical ubuntu or redhat fedora and if you can only trust yourself then you have to build it all by yourself

83457
filesystems	xfs
an xfs filesystems although not impossible is likely not the root of the problem here

83457
filesystems	xfs
partitions that are part of an raid array are according to gilles comment not an xfs filesystems

83470
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 12.04.1 lts

83489
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd root

83511
daemon	cron
it also has the cron daemon running in the background

83521
pyenv	virtualenv
python pyenv virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper

83523
sudo	passwd
moving this file to a path in my home directory instead of usr bin i was finally able to call it with sudo without entering a passwd

83525
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux with maildir mailbox format

83525
postfix	dovecot
i m running ubuntu 13.04 raring ringtail and i use mutt for my email client and i m using postfix and dovecot for smtp and mda imap

83531
folder	directory
okay so i have about 100 directory in my home folder each owned by the home user itself

83538
rhel	suse
i m going to write an answer with rhel in mind but just know that if you re on a suse or debian-based distro there are going to be analogs for what i describe

83538
rpm	yum
if they used yum highly likely there will be a var log yum.log entry for that rpm being updated

83538
children	parent
all children inherit the parent s loginuid so even though sudo spawns a program with the euid of zero or whichever user you re still going to have the same loginuid

83545
debian	linux
the debian linux kernel

83559
versioning	upgrade
apt-get update will sync-up the local copy of these lists and apt-get upgrade will upgrade all installed packages to the latest authorized versioning

83564
folder	directory
this command will extract the tar you ve downloaded and move into a hidden directory in your home folder aliased to which is synonymous to home username

83575
unix	aix
currently i ll be installing one aix server behind a firewall i just asked to open port 443 to use the ssh protocol to access this unix server

83620
mouse	keyboard
now disabling mouses works forever but after plugging new mouse or keyboard you have to enable it manually with xinput

83634
gentoo	linux
i found someone having the same problems and i tried what he did but it didn t work for me root file system is mounted read-only on boot on gentoo linux

83640
bash	zsh
to add the key in .ssh id_rsa on servera ksh93 bash zsh syntax above

83646
sudo	passwd
having several users sharing knowing a single passwd i ve heard is a bad idea - that is after all the rational behind sudo

83656
centos	linux
using red hat linux centos

83659
debian	centos
the second link is from the debian wiki but the configuration is identical for centos

83676
ubuntu	linux
we have a server application which runs fine on ubuntu and the old mandrake linux but it consistently fails on redhat enterprise linux to be precise rhel 4 update 8 kernel 2.6.9-89

83708
ubuntu	mint
although mint is based off of ubuntu ubuntu and mint use different software repositories

83708
ubuntu	mint
on any mint or ubuntu desktop system you can set the repositories to anything you want

83708
ubuntu	mint
so you could take a system that was installed as mint and change all the repositories to ubuntu repositories

83708
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
however ubuntu and mint each do their own little tweaks to the code which is in turn based off of debian

83708
ubuntu	mint
so if the mint packages are expecting one set of tweaks but the ubuntu packages provide a completely different set of tweaks then you could end up with a very broken system

83715
ubuntu	debian
it should be fairly straightforward to adapt it to ubuntu or debian as well

83717
gentoo	linux
i found this solution over on superuser titled root file system is mounted read-only on boot on gentoo linux which sounds exactly like your issue

83720
hdd	floppy
prepping the stick with other things like freedos and attempting to boot from floppy using a freedos dvd also gives me the isolinux disk error 01 ax 0201 drive 80 error which should be coming from the stick as the hdd only has windows of which i renamed bootmgr to keep it from booting and i believe freedos doesn t use isolinux

83721
pyenv	virtualenv
python pyenv virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper

83728
ubuntu	linux
how to use uuid to mount partitions volumes under ubuntu linux

83740
sysv	systemd
nowadays you should use something like service instead of directly executing init scripts as you don t always have a sysv environment upstart or systemd

83754
versioning	upgrade
if the older versioning of the package is still in your yum repositories then you can just run yum install packagename-version-release.arch and it ll install the older versioning without trying to upgrade to the latest release

83763
filesystems	ntfs
when using an ntfs filesystems cygwin will by default apply

83765
ubuntu	centos
your commands worked for me on fedora 14 and centos 5 6 but not on ubuntu 12.10

83780
rss	feed
i want to experience reading rss feed from emacs

83814
debian	linux
debconf is a software utility for performing system-wide configuration tasks on debian -like linux systems

83814
installation	upgrade
debconf supports preconfiguring packages before they are installed which allows large installs and upgrade to ask for all the necessary information before the actual installation

83823
versioning	upgrade
you will need to upgrade to a newer versioning of ubuntu or manually install one

83824
versioning	upgrade
read maverick meerkat no longer supported please upgrade or manually install a newer versioning of ubuntu

83846
folder	directory
i am trying to count how many files and folder i have recursively under a directory with 500k files with find note recursively and under

83848
debian	linux
i have kali8 installed - it is a debian gnu linux wheezy based distro - and when i use the bash built-in command set to check my vars from x like in lxterminal everything works fine but when i do it from either the console vt or ssh putty log-in i get some vars and then a bunch of lines of code - thousands of lines that look like from some kind of completion script

83857
vim	kate
without knowing anything about kate in particular i found 1 for vim

83873
chown	chmod
now you have a bin chmod that s executable but it s actually chown some other binary

83899
ubuntu	linux
i tried out red hat ubuntu kali linux

83903
ubuntu	centos
on the centos and ubuntu systems i have to hand there are even examples of this

83907
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
debian ubuntu and linux mint are good examples of this

83907
ubuntu	debian
so the ubuntu distro takes debian at its core and expands upon it changing the desktop among other things

83907
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
the linux mint project takes ubuntu as its core and further expands upon ubuntu again changing the desktop file explorer and such

83908
debian	linux
kali linux adds a number of packages on top of debian

83908
ubuntu	debian
for example ubuntu is based on debian

83908
ubuntu	debian
now ubuntu is massively different than debian

83918
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
can we make a live dvd with a dual boot option between ubuntu and linux mint

83930
debian	linux
can somebody please explain to me the exact differences between useradd -b and useradd -d in debian linux

83934
debian	centos
the host is centos 6.3 and guest is debian wheezy which seems to be using the kvm clock as a time source

83950
postfix	dovecot
i have setup postfix and dovecot on my centos server

83958
vim	emacs
adding the g control + g can be done in vi vim by first pressing control + v in insert mode or in emacs by pressing control + q

83979
unix	bsd
the install program isn t part of the unix specification but it is found in bsd and in gnu coreutils

83991
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

83991
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

83994
vim	gedit
if you want this to go faster do a open that file list in vim gedit or whatever remove the lines of files you do not need save and then extract them with tar xzf file.tar.gz -t filelist -c extracted

83994
rar	zip
to get random access to a compressed file you should use perhaps zip with posix extensions rar or as dru8274 suggested squashfs or even zfs with compression turned on or btrfs if btrfs has gotten compression to work at the time of reading

84031
centos	linux
i have centos and red hat enterprise linux running where i have now working google apps engine and related other python web applications

84041
centos	linux
linux how to rollback yum updates on rhel centos

84042
bash	zsh
you can turn it off with set -p in bash or with setopt chase_links in zsh

84043
unix	bsd
tru64 is the one major commercial unix that is neither based on system v nor on bsd

84094
jar	war
first you have to extract the war file jar xvf sample.war

84095
octal	binary
i suggest that one important reason is that the octal representation matches closely what you see with ls -l or rather it does when you mentally convert between octal and binary

84124
ubuntu	linux
is there any framework to automatically try to compile a c++ project on github.com on every commit made similar to what or do for different compilers on an ubuntu vm but for different linux distros and versions

84129
daemons	systemd
the init daemons was also replaced with systemd in f15 so you ll see many of the old init.d bash scripts are not there anymore

84162
folder	directory
i have a tar.gz file in the directory above the one which contains the code and debian folder containing the code and the makefile

84163
ubuntu	opensuse
opensuse build service supports automatic build for many distributions opensuse ubuntu ...

84167
ubuntu	debian
currently ubuntu and debian are

84167
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu and probably other distros eventually chroot

84195
execl	posix
or posix conformant c library functions like execl execp system popen .

84195
execl	posix
what that means is that if an application typically not one specified by posix doesn t rely on posix execl system .

84215
centos	linux
i have made a backup of my linux os in a bacukp.tgz the os is centos 6.4

84240
salt	md5
i know that on a linux system passwords are stored in etc shadow and are salt and encrypted using a one way hashing algorithm like md5 sha-256 or sha-512

84244
daemons	systemd
so you can open 590432 provided you re alone on an idle systemd single-user mode no daemons running

84247
mouse	keyboard
select with mouse and copy it with the keyboard shortcut

84251
mouse	keyboard
however there is a degree of consensus that clipboard should be used for windows-style clipboard operations while primary should exist as a quick option where text can be selected using the mouse or keyboard then pasted using the middle mouse button or some emulation of it

84267
redhat	fedora
upstart init used by older ubuntu and some rhel redhat and older fedora versions

84267
ubuntu	debian	rhel	suse
systemd init used by modern fedora ubuntu debian rhel suse versions

84272
disk	ram
most distros now include a ram disk for this exact purpose

84279
stdout	stderr
if stderr was sent to stdout before stdout was directed to a file then wouldn t the file contain stdout and stderr

84281
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
it s standard on most distros fedora centos rhel debian ubuntu etc

84291
stdout	stderr
usual names for fd 1 is stdout standard output and usual name for fd 2 is stderr standard error as it s commonly used to display errors without interfering with stdout

84293
stdout	stderr
when we then redirect stderr to a duplicate of stdout s file descriptor stderr goes to a duplicate of home bon dirlist

84293
stdout	stderr
if we would first redirect stderr to a duplicate of stdout s file descriptor

84293
stdout	stderr
using you see where stdout with fd 1 and stderr with fd 2 are going for the current process

84293
stdout	stderr
you can see that the file descriptors 1 for stdout and 2 for stderr vary

84312
sudoers	passwd
however if you think you have security locked down enough add apache to the sudoers file with no passwd see

84330
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
feature of desktop environments like gnome kde xfce etc

84332
dpkg	apt
i believe it may have been a package i installed on the same day and have pasted a link to my apt and dpkg logs

84332
debian	linux
system info linux kali 3.7-trunk-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.7.2-0+kali5 x86_64 gnu linux

84355
ubuntu	debian
assuming that you have the perl rename provided by debian and derived distributions such as debian and ubuntu you re almost there

84357
debian	centos
i m more used to debian so yum and centos is a little new to me

84406
debian-based	linux
in debian-based linux distributions it is provided by the libpam-script package

84412
vpn	lan
for faster debug you can disable shorewall btw you should check your firewall rules you have to enable forward from the vpn tun interface to lan and vice versa

84423
bash	zsh
if that s your shell bash zsh whatever it probably doesn t accept the key combination and ends up trying to parse the encoded key which contains

84428
xfce	cinnamon
should i just ditch cinnamon for xfce or some other wm with built in kiosk mode

84438
xfce	gnome
another solution would be to install a desktop environment like gnome or xfce and change your window manager to i3

84465
short	base
long story short what identifying attributes does the base of a company s organization have in edirectory and how do i locate it if i set my search base to root dse

84470
uninstall	upgrade
probably i could just uninstall virtualbox then upgrade the kernel + nvidia drivers oh god why... and i d get my laptop back to normal however this will mean no virtualbox for me

84472
bash	zsh
if your script is a bash or ksh or zsh script you can use the operator instead

84482
put	get
when i put the -v option or -vv option i get the ip s src and dest

84506
debian-based	ubuntu
in debian-based distributions including ubuntu use dpkg -s uxlib.h to find out from which package a file named uxlib.h comes from if that package is installed it will find it

84511
switching	screens	kde	gnome
since i installed kde and removed gnome when i switching to any tty1-6 i got a black screens

84528
versioning	upgrade
the newer versioning of the packages you re trying to go to will sometimes link against specific versioning of the software they depend on or be designed with a particular software versioning in mind so updating for dependencies means that in order to have the software you requested be installed updated it needs to upgrade these other packages otherwise the software you did request may behave erratically if at all

84531
redhat	fedora
i used redhat s small brother fedora and it drove me crazy in setting up lamp

84536
versioning	upgrade
so yum upgrade package b to versioning 2 automatically and tells you it s upgrading package b for dependencies

84566
centos	linux
we used it at my last company on centos linux 6.3 and it was able to pick up some information about vulnerabilities in our dns configuration among other things with minimal setup required

84633
ubuntu	debian
i have several sources saying that var log messages has system log message but i don t have that file ubuntu 11 debian

84650
filesystems	btrfs
i have a laptop with a samsung 840 500 gb ssd and i ve installed opensuse 12.3 with btrfs as the filesystems

84650
filesystems	btrfs
before the crash the filesystems was roughly 70 full as reported by both df btrfs filesystems show and btrfs filesystems df

84650
filesystems	btrfs
i was under the impression that when df and btrfs filesystems df agree that the filesystems has plenty of space left then everything should be fine

84650
filesystems	btrfs
the output of btrfs filesystems show after deleting the snapshots was

84657
versioning	upgrade
i need to upgrade some packages to newer versioning unfortunately they re not available

84701
kde	kubuntu
if you meant kubuntu instead of kde they re similar but slightly different and kubuntu includes kde sudo apt-get install -d kubuntu-desktop sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop to install

84747
debian	linux
i have a broadcom wireless chip which i ve managed to wrestle into working with debian gnu linux i m on sid if it matters

84768
ubuntu	linux
i also have failed to boot arch linux 2013.07.01 ubuntu 13.04 and parted magic 2013.06.15

84789
cpu	irq
eventually the cpu will return to userspace either from an irq handler __irq_usr â ret_to_user_from_irq or from a syscall vector_swi â ret_fast_syscall

84790
folder	directory
i just want to set it up so that when new folder or files are created in this directory they will have the permissions set to 777

84796
ubuntu	linux
i want to share a file that is sized at 1 gb and my os is linux ubuntu 12.10 via a wireless router by the name of tp-link with a speed of around 400mbps

84833
udp	rtp
in vlc click file open network stream and then choose udp rtp multicast

84835
vmware	esx
is the openvpn server a vmware virtual machine on a esx esxi vsphere server

84835
vmware	esx
the problem is that vmware esx virtual switch will not learn new mac address by default it just accept the vm mac address and nothing more

84837
chown	chmod
the use of chmod is for changing permissions the command chown is for changing ownership of files directories

84844
fish	zsh
is there anyway to make zsh behave more like fish in this regard

84855
stdout	stderr
i think the confusing part here is the misapprehension that redirecting stderr to stdout actually connects the two streams

84855
stdout	stderr
a perfectly reasonable idea but what happens when you write is stderr takes a peekaboo at what stdout is writing to and writes to the same place itself

84855
stdout	stderr
therefore if you subsequently tell stdout to go write somewhere else it has no effect on the destination of stderr which has already been moved

84876
centos	linux
i am using centos release 6.4 final with kernel linux 2.6.32-358.11.1.el6.x86_64 and gnome 2.82.2

84916
ubuntu	linux
just on a side note i m very new to linux using ubuntu so i may not understand some high-level concepts

84929
ubuntu	linux
i am accessing a remote ubuntu linux cluster using ssh from my pc

84929
ubuntu	linux
i am not using a ubuntu linux gui

84944
debian	linux
tldr how is useradd --no-log-init actually used in gnu linux debian

84990
width	height
if text wrapping is used which in zenity it is used by default it seems to set the window height based on the minimum window width with the text wrapping making that size taller

84991
disk	ram
once it s booted you can check if your ram is ok check if your disk is ok explore your partitions etc

85014
ubuntu	debian
alternatively you can use some other tool to extract the pdf dimensions such as pdfinfo from the poppler utilities poppler-utils package on debian ubuntu

85053
bash	zsh
so use a shell with support for process substitution ksh93 zsh bash and

85059
redhat	fedora
redhat enterprise linux is fedora server

85059
redhat	fedora
fedora is where redhat innovates and so it s bleeding edge by definition and not meant for servers

85059
redhat	fedora
redhat enterprise is based on fedora

85059
redhat	fedora
fedora provides a platform to develop and test new updates before they get pushed to redhat enterprise

85059
redhat	fedora
fedora is such an asset to redhat because by the time something makes it into redhat enterprise the code has been hardened after being battle tested in the wild by millions of users

85059
redhat	fedora
redhat has been in the game for a long time pushing linux development and the fedora model has proven effective

85059
redhat	fedora
redhat s first release was in 1995 fedora was released in 2003 and in 2012 redhat became the first billion dollar open-source company

85059
redhat	fedora
in essence fedora is redhat linux before the addition of redhat enterprise linux

85059
redhat	fedora
the name was changed to reduce confusion but the project s importance was made clear when they renamed it after redhat s iconic symbol -- its red fedora

85059
redhat	fedora
see the redhat fedora project announcement

85059
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
running fedora on your desktop keeps you at the forefront of linux development world it s what linus uses and it makes your life easier if you re running redhat or centos servers because the environments are the same

85089
daemons	launchd
i reloaded the crontab daemons but i am still getting hourly reports that the file failed to launchd and the email address does not exist

85106
bash	zsh
in that regard its behaviour is closer to emacs than with bash readline ksh zsh emacs mode but departs from the terminal driver embedded line editor in canonical mode where ctrl-w deletes the previous word werase also in vi

85112
google-chrome	firefox
i only need bash and firefox google-chrome java and flash

85114
mouse	keyboard
it supports classic and tiling window management with extended keyboard mouse and filesystem based remote control

85114
mouse	keyboard
it supports tiling window management with extended keyboard mouse and it is scriptable in lua

85118
buffering	sigpipe
the command will receive a sigpipe signal when head exits so it might go on looking for a few more matches due to buffering but it will stop before the end of the file if there are a lot of matches

85129
google-chrome	firefox
i only need bash and firefox google-chrome java and flash

85140
vim	emacs
no complicated modes to think about like vim and emacs

85142
ubuntu	debian
i only need it for kinux 64-bit ubuntu debian and osx

85151
opensuse	centos
the script seems to be identical for opensuse and centos rhel here it is

85161
chown	chmod
if for some reason you don t have permission unless you opened the crypt container itself in read-only mode it s a question of chown chmod

85196
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
but consider debian gnu kfreebsd which runs a gnu userland on top of the freebsd kernel not using linux at all

85205
kde	gnome
so this lead me to ask is there a way in gnome kde lxde put your window desktop manager environment here to simulate the click in close button event

85213
spaces	delimiter
by default it splits at spaces if you have a different delimiter tab for example specify it with -f

85250
solaris	aix
you can find an unmodified copy of that script from 3bsd there and it s a hardly different script you can find as which on many commercial unices nowadays like solaris hp ux aix or tru64

85250
bash	zsh
all of the almquist shell ash to be replacement of the bourne shell in bsds the public domain implementation of ksh pdksh bash sponsored by the fsf zsh came out in-between 1989 and 1991

85250
freebsd	netbsd
ash though meant to be a replacement for the bourne shell didn t have a type builtin until much later in netbsd 1.3 and freebsd 2.3 though it had hash -v

85250
bash	tcsh
tcsh made which builtin and added a where command acting like bash s type -a

85250
openbsd	freebsd
in openbsd and freebsd which was also changed to one written in c that looks up commands in only

85250
zsh	tcsh
on linux beside the builtin ones in tcsh and zsh we find several implementations

85250
zsh	tcsh
in the shells other than tcsh and zsh which may tell you the path of the given executable as long as there s no alias or function by that same name in any of our .cshrc .bashrc or any shell startup file and you don t define in your .cshrc

85250
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
you d use where in tcsh or zsh type -a in bash or zsh whence -a in ksh93 and in other shells you can use type in combination with which -a which may work

85250
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
a case where it might make sense to use which is if you want to know the path of a command ignoring potential shell builtins or functions in bash csh not tcsh dash or bourne shell scripts that is shells that don t have whence -p like ksh or zsh command -ev like yash whatis -p rc akanga or a builtin which like tcsh or zsh on systems where which is available and is not the csh script

85278
folder	directory
in the first installation i was able to start openbox instead of x when running startx by copying xinitrc to my home user directory and then simply adding exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch openbox-session to the end on both the xinitrc in my user folder as well as the one in etc x11 xinit

85290
stdout	stderr
such a way allows to redirect only stderr to file.txt without stdout - namely what you wanted

85301
stdout	stderr
redirect the ps header row to stderr then grep on stdout but first remove the grep command itself to avoid the noise row stemming from grep itself

85304
centos	linux
i just installed java 7 on centos release 5.3 final that is apparently has security enhanced linux

85305
solaris	sunos
furthermore is smccoreu package on solaris which provides tac on sunos installed by default

85321
folder	directory
you need to make sure that read + execute bits are set for either a group that apache is a member of or the others read + execute bits are set on the user s directory as well so that apache can access the public_html folder down below

85365
hex	binary
if you convert it from hex to binary each 1-bit represents a caught signal counting from right to left starting with 1

85370
hash	md5
first thing to do is to verify md5 hash of the fedora iso file you downloaded

85390
bash	zsh
bash readline ksh zsh emacs mode but departs from the terminal

85395
bash	zsh
you can turn on emacs mode via set -o emacs in bash ksh zsh etc.

85395
bash	zsh
for example zsh ksh does not use readline as far as i know but also support vi emacs modes that are very much like the bash readline one

85396
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
ksh was most probably the first in the early 80s reusing code that had been written separately to add a vi mode and an emacs mode to the bourne shell as seen above followed by tcsh tcsh initially only had emacs key binding vi mode was added later and later bash and zsh in the early 90s

85396
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
you switch between the two modes in bash zsh or ksh with set -o vi or set -o emacs and with bindkey -e or bindkey -v in tcsh or zsh

85396
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
the default mode for bash the public domain variants of ksh pdksh mksh oksh tcsh and zsh is the emacs mode though with zsh it s vi if your is vi while in the at t ksh it s the dumb mode unless or mentions vi or emacs

85418
ubuntu	debian
on debian and its derivatives like ubuntu the info pages are not installed unless you install the corresponding package-doc package for a given package

85418
ubuntu	debian
a notable exception though that may only apply to debian and not ubuntu is bash-doc

85452
versioning	upgrade
depending on which versioning of open-vm-tools you re using your issue might be fixed by an upgrade

85471
urdu	arabic
on one rhel server i installed arabic language support but if browse some arabic or urdu language sites it is showing gibberish characters

85488
switching	screens
the feature seems to be called alternate screens or switching between normal and alternate screens

85488
switching	screens
now you can switching to the alternate screens via ctrl +mouse2 middle click - show alternate screens

85488
switching	screens
disable alternate screens switching

85488
switching	screens
enable alternate screens switching

85488
switching	screens
some terminals support the alternate screens switching feature screens but disable it on default

85488
switching	screens
some terminals support disabling the control sequence for alternate screens switching

85501
stdout	stderr
gdb is used to replace the stdout stderr file descriptors to point to the interceptor instead of the usr terminal

85503
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

85528
multiplying	multiplication
as well as multiplication using the operator x you can suffix any number with b to mean multiplying by 512 0x200 and with k to mean multiplying by 1024 0x400

85532
folder	directory
preinst prerm postinst and postrm scripts can technically contain things that alter the behavior during install remove - but then again is the behavior of dpkg in usr local an exception or the rule the removal of empty top directory not limited to one level - and is the design affected by package and folder ownership or just by the package being in usr local

85615
opensuse	debian
i m trying to connect a debian 7.0 client to a opensuse 12.1 server

85616
udp	tcp
i have testet the link using iperf both tcp and udp successfully transferring about 5gbytes of data

85621
mouse	keyboard
since i sometimes use only the keyboard for long periods of time this means that eventually the screensaver activates because of a lack of mouse input

85643
x86	64bit
for example on x86 amd64 64bit binaries run only on 64bit cpus while 32-bit binaries run on both 32-bit and 64bit cpus

85658
ubuntu	linux
i have no script preference as long as it is a language that usually comes installed by default in ubuntu linux

85663
sudo	passwd
i just don t want to sudo and enter my passwd every time i reboot or power off

85665
sudoers	passwd
i changed etc sudoers so that every user that is in the admin group can execute the following commands without being ask for a passwd

85684
dpkg	apt
the snapshot.debian.org main page has information on how to make an apt sources.list line from that in case just downloading the .deb and running dpkg -i doesnâ t work isnâ t enough or youâ re paranoid enough though itâ s not paranoid if theyâ re really out to get you that you want secureapt checks

85686
ubuntu	linux
i am thinking of installing pendrive linux ubuntu 12.0 and after that i need to install oracle in ubuntu

85690
ubuntu	linux
i built a custom linux recovery-cd image that consists of a compressed initrd and boots via bcdedit like ubuntu wubi instead of a physical cd

85697
debian	mint	debian	linux
on my system linux mint debian edition it seems to come from libpam-modules

85711
chown	chgrp
change the group ownership of var www a to this new group with either chown or chgrp

85714
debian	linux
i have linux debian jessie installed on a hard drive

85714
folder	directory
or another variant of question is it possible to have linux installed not into root directory of partition but in folder

85715
put	get
there was something in pacman that you could use to get the update urls and put all links in a file. then aria2 could use this file as an input list for download

85725
udp	tcp
actually i don t want to allow any traffic tcp udp going out from my server that i don t allow to

85740
jobs	cron
trying to launch them separately in two cron jobs cascades and crushes the server maybe because the grep command doesn t manage to catch the search words because they are parameters i don t understand

85763
filesystems	fat
if you re mounting a filesystems that doesn t implement file ownership fat the user calling mount will end up owning the files unless overridden by a mount option

85770
ubuntu	debian
i found this which is for booting xubuntu while having ubuntu installed but i don t know how i d apply that to arch and debian

85771
ubuntu	linux
if you have any linux live-cd like ubuntu around you could simply boot to that and once you end up on the distro s desktop simply use the available file manager gui to see if you can access that windows partition and ultimately copy important files to a usb drive if you can t restore your access to the partition

85780
zsh	tcsh
now for searching in tcsh if you want to emulate emacs zsh ctrl-r or ctrl-s in emacs mode you ll have to bind the i-search-back and i-search-fwd widgets

85792
debian	linux	debian-based	linux
i have a debian-based system voyage linux 0.9.1 actually which is based on debian wheezy and when i do etc init.d ntp status it returns for example

85796
stdout	stderr
-q --quiet if getopt encounters an unrecognized option or a missing required argument in the parameters to be parsed it will print a message of the form or to stderr generate the normal output to stdout and exit with a non-zero status

85801
folder	directory
extract it all to a folder called d but without directory structure note this will extract files in subdirectories of d into the top-level output d folder

85835
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
how to record rip streaming net radio in ubuntu debian linux easy steps

85838
ubuntu	debian
the logs on var log debian ubuntu are stored as

85854
bash	zsh
bash dash gnu or zsh echo in their default configurations can do it with

85854
bash	zsh
bash but not zsh

85857
children	parent
you can not export the parent s environment into any of it s children once the child has been forked

85857
children	parent
the children are forked shells which when spun up get a copy of the parent s environment at that moment

85857
children	parent
in some rare cases you may have a stray set or unset which would obliterate the parent s environment variable from being passed cleanly to any children

85880
filesystems	btrfs
much easier to use something that sticks with filesystems addresses that way it s consistent maybe except for non-traditional filesystems like zfs btrfs

85906
sudo	passwd
for example if you use sudo and type your passwd to execute commands as root and some malware manages to grab your passwd then that malware can run sudo without your detecting it

85908
chown	chgrp
the owner and group can of course be changed later with chown or chgrp

85935
x86	64bit
when installing on an x86 system with secure boot uefi a 64bit version of linux is needed

85937
ubuntu	debian
like xsel it is usually not installed by default so you might need to install it sudo apt-get install xclip on debian ubuntu

85942
freebsd	linux
the easiest way and most popular is to put user into chroot linux lxc-container linux jail freebsd and many more.

85960
ubuntu	debian
i know for a fact that debian and ubuntu automatically take care of this

85974
kde	gnome
well...i don t use gnome or unity but this is kind of similar than krunner in kde which i prefer

85999
folder	directory
is it possible to copy all the files and folder with their directory over to the new drive

86018
daemons	systemd
essential on most systemd is a daemons usually atd

86019
stdout	stderr
redirerection of stderr of ls to stdout

86029
bash	zsh
another obvious case is builtins or keywords as which being an external command has no way to know which builtins your shell have and some shells like zsh bash or ksh can load builtins dynamically

86029
solaris	aix
solaris 10 aix 7.1 hp ux 11i tru64 5.1 and many others

86029
solaris	aix
the solaris and aix versions have fixed that issue by saving before reading the .cshrc and restoring it before looking up the command s

86029
bash	zsh
an unset path is not to disable path lookup but means using the system s default path which unfortunately on debian nobody agrees on dash and bash have usr local sbin usr local bin usr sbin usr bin sbin bin zsh has bin usr bin usr ucb usr local bin ksh93 has bin usr bin mksh has usr bin bin execvp like in env has bin usr bin yes looks in the current directory first

86029
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	ash	tcsh
some shells like bash ksh or yash when invoking foo will indeed try to run b foo and report an error while others like zsh ash csh bourne tcsh will run a foo upon the failure of the execve system call on b foo

86075
ubuntu	centos
additionally either var log syslog ubuntu or var log secure centos

86075
uptime	reboot
to find out when your server was last reboot just type uptime to see how long it has been up

86144
udp	tcp
use ping -f or a tcp or udp flood tool tcpflood

86172
mouse	trackpad
look for a module relating to mouse and trackpad such as synaptics xf86 or touchegg and then remove them using

86175
daemons	launchd	jobs	cron
however please note that many processes will not go through pam usually if they are not launchd by a logged in user like daemons and maybe cron jobs

86178
sudo	passwd
however as root you have the rights to su substitute user without being prompted for a passwd and not require configuration of sudo to achieve this sudo is specifically aimed at non-root users

86184
disk	ram
of course real limits exist due to kernel design restrictions available ram available space on disk etc

86193
arp	icmp
arping works similarly to ping except instead of sending icmp packets it sends arp packets

86194
post	get
i am completely unfamiliar with how nix handles partitions but i needed to get a file off of my usb drive so i followed an online post that said you could mount a usb stick with

86222
rss	feed
is there an application for linux which is able to put rss feed directly on desktop

86224
sudoers	visudo
one final note - you should always use the visudo command to edit etc sudoers because it will do a syntax check on the file before actually saving your changes

86225
jobs	cron
i use when running micro-focus cobol programs in background cron jobs instead of because then we don t get an warning about the input file not supporting ioctl

86226
rss	feed
you can use conky to display rss feed directly on your desktop

86226
rss	feed
which results in the above rss feed displaying on my desktop like this

86236
sudo	passwd
for most users su is not allowed without using sudo which is meant to make the user think twice about what they re doing and usually to prompt again for passwd

86237
bash	zsh
in that regard bash behaviour is different from that of t csh which bash borrowed that feature from or zsh which remove that backslash that has been used to escape

86239
switching	screens
screens where you can switching to what system do you want to boo if yes did you switching to fedora

86243
rss	feed
both only show one rss feed at a time but you can have more than one instance running

86245
put	get
you actually have to tell the registrar where your nameservers are before they can put glue records in place to get your step of the delegation to work

86250
folder	directory
each of these have documents downloads and videos folder that are again symbolic links to independent directory not in run media ..... fedora or bt-linux or suse so i can access those directory right from the home directory

86251
dpkg	apt
dpkg gives the same error message but not apt

86251
dpkg	apt
the experience above shows that apt and dpkg behaved somewhat differently insofar as error messages change with my setup xubuntu 13.04 dpkg 1.16.10 amd64 and apt 0.9.7.7ubuntu4 amd64

86251
dpkg	apt
ultimately apt calls dpkg so dpkg should be the bottleneck

86252
bash	zsh
i want to know the bash equivalent of zsh expressions such as which directly address a range of a shell function s or script s command-line arguments array

86252
bash	zsh
for the sake of concreteness what would be the bash -equivalent of the following zsh test function

86265
bash	zsh
note that zsh eventually included the syntax only when it doesn t conflict with csh style modifiers so the above bash actually ksh code will also work in newer versions of zsh

86265
bash	zsh
as to the reason for the discrepancy between versus you have to bear in mind that in bash contrary to zsh or csh or rc but like ksh where bash copied its arrays from arrays are sparse and indices start at 0

86288
debian	linux
this includes stuff you install via apt-get which is compiled by debian and oracle javas which are compiled by oracle for either 32 or 64 bit linux the aha moment for me was that i do not need to run them as a parameter to another command but they are self running scripts like on mac - you can untar or jar extract them

86319
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
linux mint and ubuntu for now... are debian derivatives technically the non-lmde edition of mint is based on ubuntu

86330
folder	directory
to get files and folder sorted by modification date but this does not separate directory from files

86338
ubuntu	linux
instead using backtrack linux that is based on ubuntu 11.04 dates back to the 2011 you could be using kali linux that includes all the latest updates of all the tools fixes several updates problems and is in general a more usable distribution than backtrack

86342
udp	tcp
i want to run gdb so that i want to learn how it decodes tcp and udp packet as i am writing an application where i need to dissect these two types of packets

86344
ubuntu	mint
i have one idea about what is your problem nvidia optimus - driver that supports it is pretty recent 319.17+ and did not made into mint ubuntu yet so you might need install manually from nvidia.com newer version

86372
bash	zsh
zsh has had the feature from the start early 90s while it has just only been added to bash in 4.0 2009

86372
bash	zsh
the bash syntax is a lot newer and builds on top of a new feature recently added to ksh93 bash and zsh

86372
cat	tee
thatâ s why we don t have to close the unused file descriptors like with zsh â but itâ s also why we have to do and use eval for that new value of to be passed to tee and cat â

86417
sudo	passwd
assuming that nagios has sudo rights to run your volts command vcgencmd measure_volts you ll also want to make sure that the sudo rights are similar to the ones above where nagios can run the command as root and that no passwd is requied nopasswd

86418
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
additionally look through your var log cron log file on fedora centos rhel or var log syslog on debian ubuntu

86425
folder	dir
and make it have the same permissions as the other rules in that dir folder

86426
manjaro	archlinux
i m using manjaro archlinux using vesa driver since fglrx beta crashes a lot and radeon and fglrx stable does not support my graphic card

86442
bash	zsh
if it s relevant i m using zsh on ubuntu 12.04 although a more generic unix-y answer for bash sh for example would be fine

86446
ubuntu	linux
on systems and file systems supporting the seek_hole lseek flag like your ubuntu 12.04 on ext4 would and assuming the value for seek_hole is 4 as it is on linux

86447
pulseaudio	mixer
use a pulseaudio mixer not the userland alsa one

86475
folder	directory
i added directoryindex script.cgi and added a directory stanza noting the path var www folder enabling the script to run

86495
stdout	stderr
so the above sets the buffering for stdin stdout stderr is set to zero

86506
disk	ram
note that sometimes what looks like disk errors are instead caused by a damaged or badly inserted cable or by faulty ram

86509
fat	btrfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	btrfs
most common filesystems types are ok but not fat or btrfs

86516
udp	tcp
sudo netstat -tunpe | grep 53 returns nothing and i have iptables open on 445 udp and tcp

86527
put	get
for which i get an out put

86538
bash	zsh
you can use a simple for-loop with bash zsh or ksh93

86538
bash	zsh
the following works only since bash version 4 2009 zsh 4.3.10 2010 and ksh93r 2006 though the syntax originated in zsh in 2.6-beta4 in 1995

86549
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
now for each element in one arrays i need to loops over the other arrays with a for-loop

86551
bash	zsh
in zsh for people not constrained to use bash

86564
min	max
q how can i limit the min and max length of a piped string

86564
min	max
min x 3 chars max x 32 chars

86640
tftp	telnet
tftp uses similar mechanisms as telnet for transmitting ascii

86640
tftp	telnet
tftp rfc rfc1350 and the telnet nvt specification

86644
debian	mint	debian	linux
i am using lmde linux mint debian edition

86674
folder	directory
in my media center directory all modified times of my folder are somehow not the desired date

86684
mouse	keyboard
although i can use the usb keyboard and mouse in the bios the keyboard doesn t seem to work at all once i boot off the boot dvd

86686
folder	directory
say my current directory is and i want to zip a folder named folder1 whose file path is folder2 folder1

86691
bash	zsh
now to address the log rotation issue if on linux where contrary to most other systems dev fd n are symlinks to the actual files with ksh bash zsh dash yash most posix shells except the most pedantically posix ones like posh as -ef is not posix

86691
bash	zsh
it s not needed with zsh or bash when not in sh mode

86691
bash	zsh
if it s important for your-filter to be run every minute on average with ksh bash or zsh you could change it to

86698
stdout	stderr
if you start an application from a terminal you can see the output to stdout and stderr but if an application is started from the window manager where does the output to these files typically go

86720
rhel	suse
they only worked on rhel and suse anyway

86722
folder	directory
i have a folder with some directory and some files some are hidden beginning with dot

86734
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
alternatively with tcsh bash or zsh

86739
filesystems	ntfs
using debian 7 i can access and mount indeed to a ntfs partition of my hard drive.i do this by clicking on the 446 gb filesystems shorcut in the files applicacion which comes with debian

86748
sudo	passwd
apt-get install sendmail won t ask for passwd no sudo privileges

86748
sudo	passwd
passwd no sudo privileges needed

86748
sudo	passwd
passwd no sudo privileges needed

86752
filesystems	ntfs
once you ve mounted the disk on your desktop use the mount command to get hold the partition and disk the ntfs filesystems is

86752
chown	mount
if you do want access for that user you will need to set filw ownership on the mount point chown username ntfsdisk where username is the username of the user you want to give access to

86764
debian	linux
note i work on gnu linux debian 7 crunchbang if this matters hellip

86785
stdout	stderr
most of the state stdin stdout and stderr will be preserved but not the other file descriptors because sudo typically closes them unless explicitely configured not to

86785
sudo	passwd
using su instead of sudo or a sudo configuration where sudo authenticates the target user instead of the caller might make a little more sense but that would still mean you d need to know the passwd of all those guys

86811
installation	upgrade
it might involve changing the installation scripts of packages that you may install or upgrade int he future too

86812
sudoers	visudo
run visudo to edit the sudoers file never edit it directly

86814
filesystems	btrfs
a driver for a disk-backed filesystems ext4 btrfs vfat â translates the command into block storage operations read and write sectors from a partition or other block device

gentoo	linux
distro gentoo linux kernel linux-3.7.1-gentoo

86864
bash	zsh
with ksh93 zsh or bash

86867
g++	gcc
i already tried i686 but apparently it doesn t work at all gcc compiles and runs it s the gcc g++ compiler that doesn t find the headers on the machine using the i686 prefix

86872
stdout	stderr
evenmore in the snippet above you might even prefer to silence patch completely redirecting its stdout and stderr to dev null

86899
zsh	tcsh
in zsh setopt chase_links and in tcsh cause cd to make sure is symlink-free

86949
post	get
here a sample implementation called stopper i checked it with the attach option only and it required some few changes to get it working eventually if needed i ll post the code somewhere

86973
children	parent
which should kill all children of parent process with id ppid

86992
switching	screens
another altnerative would be to learn how to use screens or tmux so that you can switching back and forth between windows

86996
daemons	systemd
i m looking for a flexible per-user initialisation tool to kick off user daemons when the systemd re- boots

86996
daemons	systemd
of course this could be hacked by creating a crontab job and checking whether or not the daemons is already running and starting it otherwise but it strikes me as not particularly clean although it would have the advantage of automatically restarting the daemons if it crashes irrespective of systemd starts

87005
ubuntu	linux
how can i download files from a remote linux ubuntu server

87006
putty	winscp
if you have windows you can use winscp or pscp which comes with putty

87030
debian	linux
a linux distribution for the raspberry pi derived from debian

87032
cinnamon	gnome
it is no longer developed having been superseded by gnome 3 but survives in cinnamon

rsa	dsa
puttygen makes dsa and rsa keys

87049
google-chrome	firefox
a family of browser addons for firefox google-chrome and other browsers that blocks ads and popups

87051
bash	tcsh
through a weird flash of inspiration i connected this problem with the fact that my default shell is tcsh and as i m not allowed to change it i simply set my .tcshrc to contain exec bash

87051
bash	tcsh
when i changed this to bash or just used tcsh the problem disappeared

87052
bash	tcsh
if you want to use exec with bash and get your program to run you probably need to figure out where tcsh s equivalent of bash s argv is storing the program call to whatever you wanted to run and pass that to bash

87055
bash	tcsh
reason being exec bash not being login shell will not change the shell environment variable which is later on used by gdb and vim and points to your login shell tcsh

87058
bash	tcsh
therefore bash is used directly to spawn your command instead of tcsh which is configured to only start bash

87058
bash	tcsh
this way you can start directly in bash but do not break any tcsh scripts

87067
versioning	upgrade
recently i upgrade php to versioning 5.5

87067
debian	linux
linux host 3.10-2-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.10.5-1 2013-08-07 x86_64 gnu linux

87071
bash	zsh
ps. i need a solution that works both on bash and zsh if possible

87075
centos	linux
covers kickstart installations of centos also applies to scientific fedora and redhat. there s also which allows you to make a customized installation disk of suse linux meaning you can get the packages you want installed right off the bat

87075
put	get
you really do learn how things get put together and what the requirements are to make linux .

87130
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
how do you quickly create a local repository for random packages using a debian based linux distribution - like xubuntu 13.04 ubuntu

ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	centos	debian	mint	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian	opensuse	mint	centos	mint
off the cuff list slackware mint very popular lately ubuntu debian my favorite centos enterprise quality they say opensuse

87170
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian

87180
bash	zsh
bash doesn t have provision for changing users but zsh does

87184
debian	linux
because that is a complex task various pre-compiled gnu linux distributions exist of which debian is one

87184
debian	linux
point being debian doesn t actually write most of the software in the distribution -- the gnu and linux crew did

87231
chown	chmod
in 99 of the cases access problems are just a matter of getting the ownership and permission bits set correctly using the chown and chmod commands respectively

87256
bash	subshell
as you can also see there are a few problems with my function anyway - it uses one of the subshell as a workaround so it can run on an archaic bash version i m stuck with it on a legacy system but still wanted a unified configuration

87268
ubuntu	linux
i m using cron 3.0pl1-120ubuntu4 on ubuntu linux

87276
ubuntu	debian
it s in the default ubuntu and debian repos

87277
ubuntu	debian
you can find qpdfview in the default ubuntu and debian repos

87285
daemon	cron
the cron daemon runs with a defined timezone

87285
daemon	cron
if however you re aiming to run all your crons in a different timezone you could take the more dramatic tactic of changing the tz for the cron daemon itself

87288
pop-up	dialog
this dialog tends to pop-up when i unlock the computer after having been away for a while

87290
ubuntu	linux
this is a new addition to the linux kernel and a welcomed one so it s only in newer distros such as ubuntu 12.10

87297
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
you can customize debian or ubuntu to create your linux distro

87297
ubuntu	debian
the key of customize debian or ubuntu is preseed file

87313
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
i recommend you install ubuntu server or centos into flash.they are both good linux servers

87317
disk	ram
you can install your sql server into tmpfs filesystem.for example you can move your table files of mysql into tmpfs and then start mysql server.your mysql will be faster because the data is stored into ram rather than disk

87318
put	get
hi i made bash script to put down my interface change mac address and get it up again

87318
put	get
when i try put down eth0 with sudo ifconfig eth0 down after few seconds my os ubuntu 12.10 reconects me automaticly with my old mac address and i get new ip

87319
rtp	rtsp	udp	rtp
vlc support other stream methods.for example http udp rtp rtsp and so on

87338
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade it to versioning 3.6

87370
overwrite	preserve
also i want to preserve 1 tb of data using only these disks while still being able to overwrite each disk with random data

87396
ubuntu	linux
zorin os is an ubuntu based linux distro built especially for newcomers to linux

87411
centos	linux
if you are using centos fedora core rhel linux boot from first cd and at boot prompt type

87427
sudo	passwd
you can use sudo to allow running certain commands without entering a passwd

87427
sudoers	visudo
edit etc sudoers file with the command visudo and add something like the following line

87427
sudo	passwd
this example will allow users in the wheel group to execute sudo su without entering a passwd

87449
ubuntu	linux
my current level of linux staff is newbie so i would appreciate it if you answer in a newbie language so already i have installed x ubuntu on my pc and that s all

87463
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu debian the package is called libssl-dev

87465
ethernet	wireless
because i don t have working wireless or an ethernet port i effectively can not use yum to install these from the internet

87474
rpm	yum
any other idea that fits into rpm specs or other yum repository magic even at the yum .repo file.

87497
debian	linux
i see it s something that commonly afflicts debian linux distros so i tried that fix of adding a -f flag to the rm definition for the m4 processor

87499
put	get
however when i put the scale as 0 to get an integer i get numbers which are grossly incorrect

87546
freebsd	linux
edit this is freebsd not linux

87580
disk	ram
i m installing debian wheezy on a 50 gb partition of a 500 gb seagate sata hard disk with 2 gb ram

87584
filesystems	xfs
one filesystems prominently featuring the behavior you re interested in so called delayed allocation is xfs

87584
filesystems	xfs
because of this behavior it is not uncommon to find completely zeroed out but otherwise legit looking files size and other metadata intact on an xfs filesystems after a sudden power interruption

87589
put	get
i don t want to get rid of them just put them in their proper place

87597
vmware	virtualbox
you can use any hypervisor software.for example qemu-kvm virtualbox xen vmware and so on

87602
stdout	stderr
what i really need -- make such sticky redirection for stdout and stderr at the same time execute some commands stop redirection and read log file

87603
stdout	stderr
i.e. make file descriptors 3 and 4 copies of the current 1 stdout and 2 stderr redirect 1 to log.txt and 2 to the same as 1

87603
stdout	stderr
then restore stdout and stderr from the saved values in file descriptors 3 and 4

87630
cat	tee
the error persists even if i replace the | head -1 at the end of the command with | head -10 | cat | tee dev null | etc

87630
bash	zsh
fwiw the output produced by the ls -l proc self fd subcommand looks the same whether i run this under zsh or under bash

87633
vmware	virtualbox
is there a way to tell whether a host is a physical one or a vm and which virtual container it is running out of virtualbox or vmware

87638
ubuntu	mint
isn t mint based on ubuntu

87674
min	max
until now i have used a script which sends 3600 pings per hour and saves min max avg. but i am not sure how representative icmp packets are

87688
redhat	fedora
i suppose debian or fedora themselves could engage in the certification process so redhat enterprise could become a certified unix but this begs the question that such is actually desirable

87705
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs filesystems df reports there is some free space actually

87733
ubuntu	debian
when you install .deb files on ubuntu debian they get stored in the following directory var cache apt archives

87736
unix	solaris
for example until recently solaris a unix wasn t considered open source

87738
debian	linux
those maintainers don t necessarily make all that extra software they assemble it and modify it sometimes and put it all together to provide what the linux experience is about for most people today - they add the flavor so to speak and there s often lineage to very established distributions like debian and redhat etc

87742
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
that s what gnu linux distributions like debian or ubuntu and the like do

87763
sorting	grouping
sort -u doesn t report unique lines but one of each grouping of lines that have equal sorting order

87767
freebsd	linux
is there a way in linux or freebsd to receive notification from system at a specified time

87777
vim	notepad++
i would suggest you some editor like vim or notepad++ which highlight syntax error in colors if they wrong

87802
ubuntu	mint
i know in my experience mint ubuntu based works out of the box as does manjaro arch based

87842
bash	subshell
from the bash man page if a command is terminated by the control operator the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell

87864
openbsd	linux
it still works i ve tested this on linux but i d like to use it in my openbsd machine that handles all my routing firewalling access-pointing is that even a word

87887
sudo	passwd
the problem is that after the sleep the script prompts me for the sudo passwd

87887
sudo	passwd
how should i re-write the script so that it doesn t prompt me for the sudo passwd after the sleep

87887
sudo	passwd
i ve tried to call sudo sleepin 30 but it still prompts me for the passwd

87913
debian	linux
cubian is a linux operating system designed for cubieboard based on debian wheezy

87932
solaris	aix
solaris supports extended file attributes but there are no user level commands for setting or changing them and the chatr command in hp-ux and chattr in aix have unrelated functions

87939
centos	linux
i want to install bind9 with its source code on linux centos 6.3 we know by using we don t get the source code we get only the binary files

87958
temp	tmp
note that is expanded by the shell into the two words tmp and temp

87962
sysv	systemd
common init systemd are the classic sysv init and newer systemd like systemd and upstart

87970
acpi	vga
i would just like to add the fact that linux offers a much wider and better support on the driver-side netbsd as all the major bsd os is a great os but most of the time i still use it as a toy because i just don t get the necessary drivers with it and you can feel this gap across the board from the vga to the acpi functionality there are a lot of peripherals that simply work better and are more stable under linux

87985
post	get
the keyboard status leds flash during the post so the keyboard is detected i also get a report detected .

87986
temp	tmp
the last bit does a search and replace on the contents of variable and replaces tmp with temp

87992
debian	linux
i switched to arch linux from debian crunchbang and noticed much higher temperature

87995
solaris	aix
this is the lowest common denominator when you get into supporting across a variety of unixes such as solaris aix and linux

88004
debian	linux
i would like to get a random mac address everytime i turn on my linux machine debian

88014
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 6.0 n l

88027
csv	tsv
question stand for csv coma separated value and present tsv tab sep vals so my script will work for any kind of tab coma or space separated values just look for last field

88047
udp	tcp
i ve also assumed your vpn server uses udp and not tcp if it does use tcp you will need to update the 2nd rule to reflect that

88051
next	except
the second solution works essentially the same way except when it encounters th e pattern it prints that line and then stores the 4th record ahead of it in the array nr then goes to the next record

88054
mouse	keyboard
having plugged the mouse into the adapter and the adapter into the ps 2 mouse keyboard port on the motherboard things seem to be working

88056
mouse	keyboard
also when changing the vlc volume by mouse or keyboard in steps it will temporarily change the volume for like 1s and the revert back to 87

88075
ubuntu	linux
keep in mind that most linux distros including ubuntu have a relatively small footprint when first installed

88076
kde	gnome
what you installed was a rather large amount of dependencies it s know to happen when you use kde qt applications in gnome gtk environments and vice-versa which most of them can be uninstalled rather easy if you don t want them using the following command

88083
daemons	systemd
i am writing a daemons process for a debian systemd in c that uses a unix domain socket

88083
daemons	systemd
if the daemons process s working directory is the root directory is there an idiomatic directory to place the socket on the file systemd

88105
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i ve tried ubuntu linux mint and debian even though all have worked great for me i m keeping with ubuntu i tested 12.04 12.10 and even 13.04

88141
ubuntu	debian
my base system is ubuntu 13.04 server but i have tried debian and older ubuntu servers as well

88149
ubuntu	mint
on ubuntu and mint bin sh is dash not bash

88149
bash	zsh
it is common to use dash for scripts that don t need the extra features and bash for interactive use though zsh has a lot of nicer features

88183
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu i am going through with a lot of problems

88194
folder	directory
your syntax would not work unless you have a rule for folder path clean in the directory that you execute the make folder path clean in

88205
sudo	passwd
if you do not set root passwd please use sudo passwd to set new passwd for root user

88211
debian	linux
my operating system is linux drake 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.41-2+deb7u2 x86_64 gnu linux

88221
int	chars
the brace expansion only works for literal int or single chars

88226
debian	linux
how do i increase the priority for a task in debian linux system

88234
ubuntu	debian
it appears on ubuntu debian and fedora as packages so it is easily installed and looks like it is ported to a number of distros

88235
bash	tcsh
same with pdksh ksh93 bash csh tcsh

88237
zero	decimal-point
explicitly zero no decimal-point character appears

88251
subnet	vlan
all of the instances are on a dedicated vlan and subnet 10.2.x.x

88253
ubuntu	linux
i am using stock ubuntu linux

88259
bash	zsh
you can work around that in zsh by changing to or in bash by running shopt -s nullglob

88260
put	get
it s most likely dev sdb but it might get dev sdc to be put after a previously-mapped optical drive for example

88265
kde	gnome
this is what i used to think but it turns out that in kde and gnome environments according to what i read

88266
zsh	subshell
use with caution since this is read by every single instance of zsh even when it is a subshell where you ve set other variables

88269
gentoo	linux	gentoo	mint
the only issue on linux is that a single key is misbehaving gentoo 3.6.11 arch linux and linux mint 2.6.38 are all affected

88277
put	get
...but if i put the same lines in my .zshenv on darwin i get error messages to the effect that setting locale failed. i vaguely remember bashing my skull for several hours over the problem of finding the right locale settings for darwin lion

88283
post	get
i was googling about how i could find the number of cpus in a machine and i found some post but i am confused as some mentioned that you get the logical cores vs physical cores etc

88304
ubuntu	debian
this solution is for ubuntu debian systems that come stock with dash which is posix compliant

88331
sikuli	squish
i went through ldtp dogtail squish and sikuli but all dependent on specific qt versions

88369
debian	mint	debian	linux
what is the main difference between debian 7.1 and linux mint 15 debian besides look and desktop environment

88374
gentoo	linux	gentoo	mint
is there a huge performance difference between for example linux mint as host and gentoo as a host

88378
vmware	virtualbox
if you need many different vm solutions for instance some running on vmware some with kvm some xen or virtualbox i d choose what s best even if that means having different vm solutions running side by side on several machines

88385
debian	mint
by default lmde is based on debian testing and is essentially debian testing + cool mint tools

88386
xfce	gnome
it depends on the desktop environment you re using personally i m using xfce but i was a gnome user for many years

88406
post	get
regarding the second part of your post where you say that you would like some way to get the list of files that a defined application or process is reading from

88409
ubuntu	debian
.deb for ubuntu debian based distros

88409
ubuntu	debian
there is something similar on ubuntu debian as well

88419
daemons	systemd
as for your ssh problem - ssh servers should close connection once the systemd shuts down although i have seen some linux distributions which somehow mess up the proper behaviour by not shutting down the ssh daemons and running sessions properly - if that is the case see the escape characters section and other places referring to it in ssh 1 - escape character followed by

88426
folder	directory
in order to be able to access a file you have to link it to a directory think of directory as phone directory not folder that is add one or more entries to one of more directory to associate a name with that file

88432
ubuntu	debian
just in case you have simply not noticed this is what i see when running an ubuntu guest on my debian host

88449
hid	keyboard
at any keypress the hid system loops 4 times through all keyboard keys

88454
debian	linux
does anyone know how do i list existing alias for a certain unix linux user on debian

88464
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	centos	debian	mint	centos	mint
the normal way to deploy a program is a package tailored for each distribution rpm format for red hat and centos and suse and others deb format for debian and ubuntu and mint and others etc

88521
ubuntu	debian
if your switch is a managed switch then you can use lldpctl from the lldpd package on debian ubuntu to know its mac address

88523
icmp	udp
when you ping you actually use a different protocol called icmp internet control message protocol on most systems some use udp which will not be passed over your ssh tunnel

88523
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
this will then allow you to send any ip related protocols including udp tcp and icmp so you can ping browse and so forth

88524
icmp	tcp
ping is implemented in the icmp protocol the ports that you forward are tcp ports

88533
debian	linux
here comparing busybox 1.20.0 s grep and awk gnu grep 2.14 mawk 1.3.3 gnu awk 4.0.1 on debian linux 7.0 amd64 with glibc 2.17 in a utf-8 locale on a 240mb file of 2.5m lines of ascii-only characters

88538
jobs	cron
that s a little nicer as cron might be scheduling other jobs as well

88539
folder	directory
then run commands similar to these to make the directory s group web-data and to force the group to be sticky so that any new files folder created will be made with this group as their default

88574
chown	chmod
as i understand it many mac os x command-line tools like ls cp chmod chown etc. are imported from freebsd

88586
disk	ram
the answer was that the demo version is mounted to a ram disk

88620
ubuntu	linux
i recently installed arch linux on a chromebook through a bizarre hack in which i used an install script to install ubuntu and then overwrote the ubuntu rootfs with an arch rootfs

88620
ubuntu	linux
is the part of linux that runs before chrooting into rootfs common to all linux distros and that s why the initial boot worked for both arch and ubuntu

88623
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	centos	gentoo	debian
debian quickly comes to mind but i can t see why you wouldn t use ubuntu or centos or even gentoo or arch

88625
debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian	gentoo	opensuse	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
most linux distributions also use some kind of software management system to ease software installation and configuration for example be it by binary package management like debian or source package management like gentoo and occasionaly some distro specific software like for instance administration tools i can think of debconf for debian or yast for opensuse for instance

88629
mtu	pppoe
if you are running over a vpn or pppoe the mtu is reduced to compensate for the overhead of the vpn or pppoe layer

88685
fish	bash
you don t need to quote as unlike bash fish doesn t separate variables by spaces

88691
sudo	passwd
provided you have a non-root account with remote access to the host and permissions in sudo to run all commands as root i would also recommend changing your root passwd sudo passwd and changing etc ssh sshd_config to have the setting permitrootlogin no so remote hosts cannot connect as the root user

88697
disk	ram
furthermore the linux kernel uses memory for disk cache otherwise the ram wouldn t be used and this is not efficient and intended

88698
put	get
you get this error because the tcp protocol forces the server to put the socket that you just closed into the status time_wait for the time defined in net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout

88707
geany	gedit
i m currently getting this problem with both gedit and geany on latest mint-lmde and

88707
vim	kate
kate kwrite gvim vim qtcreator libre writer are not affected

88707
geany	gedit
geany and gedit both give

88745
redhat	fedora
redhat family distributions including centos and fedora use var log messages and var log secure where debian-family distributions use var log syslog and var log auth.log

88765
udp	tcp
however http proxy doesn t support udp probably you can do this only with tcp vpn

88767
unix	solaris
to support an application we just installed i ve been asked to add this command to the etc profile file on our solaris 10 unix server

88768
bash	zsh
as for where to implement the change the better way is by editing the etc default init file which will set every process default locale and not only sh ksh bash and zsh

88793
kde	kubuntu
if you use a kde based distribution kubuntu

88821
kde	gnome
gnome kde installation

88844
ubuntu	linux
my installer should work in all linux platforms rhel ubuntu

88859
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i just successfully installed skype on my 64bit linux mint debian which is a debian in all ways not based on ubuntu by going to to download the multiarch debian package saved as skype-debian_4.2.0.11-1_i386.deb and installing it

88866
stdout	stderr
three of these links are pointing to dev ptmx these are stdin stdout and stderr

88890
cpu	processors
processors intel r core tm i5-2410m cpu 2.30ghz 2.30 ghz

88897
filesystems	btrfs
some filesystems prevent this lag such as zfs and i believe btrfs this is known as copy-on-write

88901
sudo	passwd
get a user to download or save an email attachment a desktop entry that does calls the user s graphical sudo with a destructive system command such as rm -rf - this can t possibly fool even the simplest of users as it shows a big scary dialog that requires the user to type in their passwd and usually shows very clearly what will happen if they do this

88928
sudo	passwd
sure i can have the program execute something like sudo adduser jim and supply the sudo passwd but this would require me to include an administrative passwd within the jar file

88930
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if your only problem with sudo is having to use a passwd you can add the nopasswd tag in your sudoers file

88932
filesystems	btrfs
using a loop-mounted user created btrfs filesystems with the permissions set correcly a user is able to freely create btrfs subvolumes

88935
debian	mint	debian	linux
linux mint debian therefore assuming debian testing as well

88936
ubuntu	debian
one method i found on debian ubuntu systems is to run this command

88946
bash	zsh
unix shell such as bash or zsh

88958
centos	linux
on centos linux desktop let s create a folder named a

88958
centos	linux
i m simply using centos linux desktop which uses gnome by default

88968
g++	gcc
and there i changed every gcc to icc and every g++ to icpc and every -o2 to -o3

88968
g++	gcc
but eventually i m getting weird errors that seem to be caused by using gcc g++ rather than icc icpc

88968
g++	gcc
and should changing every gcc and g++ in the makefile be sufficient to use a different compiler

88971
google-chrome	firefox
i can see from the system monitor that the cpu is working hard specially when i run google-chrome or firefox

88985
mouse	keyboard
the x server only handles display and keyboard mouse input

89016
daemons	systemd
i m using archlinux with systemd and d-bus i suspect it s a problem with polkit or some kind daemons not runing on window manager start but have no idea what could i try or how could i get more meaningfull error messages

89016
daemons	launchd
after clean reboot sudo notify-send something works even without manually launchd any daemons however what i and my launchd programs should do to be able send notifications without root privilegies as it is possible in gnome or any other full desktop environments

89026
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
zfs problematic fuse support on linux at best and btrfs still in heavy development or any filesystems you choose if you stack it on top of lvm

89037
rss	feed
rss.py merely scans an rss feed and gets blog post titles dates from it

89039
rss	feed
as the conky documentation notes there is a rss variable that defaults to a 15 minute interval for checking feed

89039
rss	feed
download and parse rss feed

89077
sudo	passwd
depending on your previous usage of the sudo command you may get a short be careful doing what you re doing message but either way you ll need to enter your passwd

89077
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
if you re interested launchd and launchctl use the csh tcsh syntax so you can t use the bash zsh format

89095
scheme	racket
if you want your script to be portable across scheme implementation this is possible provided that the implementation follows srfi 22 which racket doesn t

89098
kde	kubuntu
i m running kubuntu 12.04 lts kde and system settings - multimedia - phonon does not show the 6i6 at all

89119
folder	directory
the directory + files analogy used is to mimic how people think with respect to the physical world for storing items files inside of something folder

89120
folder	directory
subsequently i found that if i rename the directory above the openwrt folder with a minor change in a file say wifi.lua the next make in openwrt folder takes 21 minutes to compile successfully

89120
folder	directory
however if i don t rename the directory above the openwrt folder with a similar minor change in the same file the next make v 99 takes only 3 minutes to compile successfully

89120
folder	directory
to get the makefile to compile faster i also have the openwrt dl as a symbolic link to a folder in my home directory so that the user-space package tarballs don t need to be downloaded again.

89124
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu users can type smart quotes with .

89155
debian-based	ubuntu
for debian-based distributions such as ubuntu you can use the command apt-offline

89164
debian	mint
say my host is mint and i m running a windows guest and debian guest

89169
dvd	asf
it supports many file types including avi dvd compatible mpeg files mp4 and asf using a variety of codecs

89169
freebsd	linux
kdenlive is a free and open-source video editor for gnu linux freebsd and macosx

89169
mp4	webm	flac	ogg	flac	vp8	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg	vp8	ogg
hybrid is a multi platform linux mac os x windows qt based frontend for a bunch of other tools which can convert nearly every input to x264 xvid vp8 + ac3 ogg mp3 aac flac inside an mp4 m2ts mkv webm mov avi etc

89175
ubuntu	centos
we run a mix of guests mainly centos ubuntu and windows server 2008r2

89197
ubuntu	linux
here are two guides on how to compile a linux kernel for ubuntu and for arch linux

89202
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
if dpkg was invoked by a tool in the apt suite apt-get aptitude synaptic â the actions of apt are logged in var log apt history.log and var log apt term.log

89202
dpkg	apt
the file apt term.log contains a transcript of the dpkg run pre- and post-install and -remove scripts dpkg run triggers

89202
versioning	upgrade
the current versioning may have been an upgrade from another versioning this method won t tell you anything about prior versioning

89211
redhat	fedora
i recently learned that at least on fedora and redhat enterprise linux executable programs that are compiled as position independent executables pie receive stronger address space randomization aslr protection

89246
for-loop	loops
then select one over n frames with a small for-loop in which you loops over all the frames you check if it is divisible by 2 and if so you copy it in a new temporary file

89260
ethernet	wireless
it has eth0 interface for ethernet ath0 for wireless and br-wan as a bridge between the two

89275
png	ico
i can use imagemagic to convert png to ico but i think not sure it will create one image ico file for the size i specify

89309
xfce	kde
i don t know what to include as it seems to me that skype is working on kde but there is some issue with xfce but i ve no idea where to start resolving this

89315
centos	linux
to download all the necessary packages to a folder and then install the gui from a folder without an internet connection the next time around when i re-installed centos minimal linux

89320
filesystems	ntfs
with most filesystems including ntfs and ext 234 data is stored in distinct locations on the drive

89320
filesystems	ntfs
i expect the same applies to ntfs under windows but the ntfs linux filesystems developers can t afford to be as cavalier opting for consistency over performance

89344
centos	linux
in order to install xdotool on centos linux

89344
centos	linux
i was wondering if there is a known rpm version so that installing it would be simple on centos linux

89354
centos	mint	centos	linux
mint to the blank pc and from linux mint i had to create a centos

89359
daemons	systemd
monit is particular useful for monitoring daemons processes such as those started at systemd boot time from etc init.d

89369
rpm	yum
you can create your own yum repository from the folder which contains all the rpm you downloaded

89373
centos	linux
i want to use sarg tool in linux centos to report users using website

89378
centos	linux
i discovered that if i copy the auto-generated kickstart file in centos linux

89378
centos	linux
i could re-install centos linux without having to fill stuff and so on

89403
debian	mint
for mint debian but the idea is the same

89408
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu the openvswitch-brcompat package will install open vswitch bridge compatibility support

89422
rpm	yum
hi i have created the yum repository i downloaded the snort rpm package from their website

89437
ubuntu	debian	daemons	systemd
this may not happen automatically as most watchdog drivers are blacklisted in case there is no watchdog daemons in etc modprobe.d blacklist-watchdog.conf on an ubuntu debian systemd

89442
centos	linux
recently i installed centos linux minimal and then

89476
centos	linux
i have no idea how to download all these to a folder and then use the folder to install them all after a fresh install of centos linux minimal

89476
centos	linux
how can i download all these to a folder and next time i re-install centos linux minimal i can just run something like

89479
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i m going to say this right away if you have a macbook air and or no ethernet cord you are largely screwed if you use a distro that uses a network-based installation such as arch linux or the recommended debian image or one of the ubuntu alternate cds

89479
filesystems	hfs+
if you intend to keep os x you should use os x s built-in disk utility to resize as gnu linux doesn t currently have write support for the default mac filesystems configuration hfs+ with journaling for those curious

89479
filesystems	fat
therefore i d recommend creating a fat filesystems on the new partition

89479
ethernet	wireless
the biggest thing besides the wireless which needs firmware but is easy to bootstrap as long as you have an ethernet cable was that if i closed the lid the screen failed to wake up

89495
filesystems	btrfs
assume that i m using an ext4 filesystems if it matters but i d also be interested in answers for other unix inode-based filesystems especially btrfs

89499
mouse	keyboard
so i took a look at the configuration options of the running kernel from proc config.gz and found config_usb to be enabled i guess i would not be able to use my usb keyboard and mouse if it was disabled

89517
folder	directory
at this point you just need to mkdir under the folder c directory so we ll use xargs to do this repetitive task

89540
debian	linux
everytime i want to print to file say a website in iceape seamonkey in linux debian i have to set all the options for printing anew to overwrite the default settings

89546
disk	ram
when you access reserved memory for the first time this memory has to be backed by pages located either on ram or on disk

89569
for-loop	loops
again using grep -f as above but this time we ll have to loops through the files using a for-loop

89594
stdout	stderr
the output form perf both stderr and stdout goes to the file stat.log

89594
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian

89598
ftp	telnet
fping fping6 telnet rsh rlogin ftp dig mtr ssh-installkeys showmount

89608
folder	directory
in zsh assuming that folder a folder b and folder c are subdirectories of the same directory

89608
folder	directory
make sure to include a at the end of the source directory so that their content is copied directly under path to folder c without creating path to folder c path to folder a and so on

89613
bash	zsh
in bash after running shopt -s globstar in ksh after running set -o globstar or in zsh out of the box you can also use to match files in subdirectories recursively

89613
bash	zsh
bash traverses symbolic links to directories while ksh and zsh do traverse if they re symbolic links to directories but omit symbolic links when recursing

89613
bash	zsh
ksh93 and zsh but not bash dash or pdksh have floating point arithmetic so you don t even need to invoke another tool such as perl to do the sum

89616
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
unlike debian and ubuntu centos doesn t ship etckeeper out of the box but it can be installed

89630
ubuntu	linux
it should also works on linux since my teacher is able to connect to it he s running ubuntu

89684
octal	hex
1b is hex for octal 33 oft seen in things like color prompts because the shell likes octal but to get unprintable control characters through sed use hex

89684
octal	decimal
octal 33 decimal 27 the ascii esc character hence escape sequence

89714
xen	openvz	vmware	virtualbox
i want to determine what kind of virtualization technology it runs on if any vmware virtualbox kvm openvz xen

89718
vmware	virtualbox
i have tested on vmware workstation virtualbox qemu with kvm standalone qemu with ubuntu as the guest os

89724
put	get
i put d on apache log format and i get the time is between 10-90 seconds

89725
ubuntu	debian
if you re on ubuntu debian there s the package open-vm-tools can be installed

89728
ubuntu	linux
after setting up network sharing the easy way on the ubuntu machine and getting an ip address via dhcp on the arch linux machine downstream the arch machine is able to ssh to the ubuntu machine and resolve dns but not communicate with the internet ping pacman time out

89729
centos	linux
i m using centos linux 6.4 desktop

89734
switching	screens
i ve tried opening one instance in one screens and then press alt+ctrl+f2 to switching to the screens two and open the other instance of omxplayer but the video of the first screens is in overlay also in the screens called with f2 and also all other screens i have

89743
centos	linux
now i re-install centos linux minimal and then i want to install all of the groups without running

89748
integer	fractions
but that would remove the fractions part instead of giving you the nearest integer and that wouldn t work for values of like 1.2e9 or .12 for instance

89748
bash	zsh
also as noted by binaryzebra in several printf implementations bash ksh93 yash not gnu zsh dash it is affected by the locale the decimal separator which can be

89748
int	double
however note that while double s can represent very large numbers int are much more limited

89749
folder	directory
i have a directory full of hidden folder and files

89779
disk	ram
i know that in virt-manager you can add ram and processors to the virtual machine but is there a way to increase the available disk space larger through the gui

89785
ubuntu	linux
a few days ago i decided it was be time to abandon the classic ubuntu windows 7 dual-boot and switched to arch linux which i ve used for quite a long time on other machines

89817
octal	hex	octal	decimal
the 27th decimal or 033 octal sequence or 0x1b hex sequence is the escape sequence

89817
octal	hex
to get around this to make it easier to use certain utilities represent the raw sequence either with 033 by octal reference hex reference x1b or by special character reference e

89817
octal	hex	octal	decimal
he is saying decimal ascii 27 octal 33 hex 1b ctrl - and e are

89850
disk	ram
i ve only talked about ram and disk usage above but there are other resources to consider

89905
folder	directory	ready	each	next	except
except that each file is not moved to the destination directory unless a separate process has fetched the sole file in that destination directory and moved it elsewhere thus the target folder is empty and ready for the next file to be moved there

89923
disk	ram
the linux kernel provides an option of having a small file system loaded to a ram disk and running programs there before the actual root file system is mounted

89927
minix	linux
development of gnu began in 1984 and the original version of minix which was used during early linux development for bootstrapping purposes was released in 1987

89928
disk	ram
load of stage1.5 from disk to ram makes use of bios disk access routines

89928
disk	ram
stage1.5 contains the filesystem utilities so that it can read the stage2 from filesystem well it still uses bios 13h to read from disk to ram but now it can decipher filesystem info about inodes etc

89928
disk	ram
stage2 loads kernel into ram again using bios disk utilities

89928
put	get	disk	ram
the problem is that kernel and ramdisk weigh more than 1 mib thus to load them into ram you have to load kernel to first 1 mib then jump to protected mode 32 bit move the loaded kernel to high memory free the first 1 mib for real mode then return to real 16 bit mode again get ramdisk from disk to first 1 mib if it s a separate initrd and older kernel possibly switch to protected 32 bit mode again put it to where it belongs possibly get back to real mode or not and execute the kernel code

89928
disk	ram
now when you finally run the kernel you already have it and ramdisk loaded into ram by bootloader so kernel can use disk utilities from ramdisk to mount you real root file system and pivot root to it

89946
freebsd	linux
it doesn t and while some os s freebsd i think have done the opposite on linux sysctl calls are depreciated

89956
debian	linux
i ve got a debian 7 linux machine and a tp-link mr3020 router attached to it via ethernet cable at eth0 interface working in wisp mode meant to make it a client rather than an access point

89978
switching	screens
then switching back to your main screens with ctrl-alt-f7 and continue working

89981
children	parent
if you source the code below and use mypushd mypopd mydirs instead of the originals children processes will remember their parent stack

89991
kde	gnome
otherwise consider installing a desktop environment such as gnome or kde

89992
debian	linux
i m trying to install the various i386 libraries required for skype on linux debian 7.0 wheezy 64-bit but i ve run into a problem where apparently the two versions of libsqlite-3-0 are each blocking the other

89992
versioning	upgrade
libsqlite3-0 amd64 the normal one is installed but instead of the wheezy default of 3.7.13-1 i have a different versioning from squeeze-backports from before i upgrade to wheezy 3.7.16.2-1

89995
bash	zsh
by the way iâ m realling using zsh instead of bash but neither will work

90010
versioning	upgrade
the fix is to upgrade your squeeze backports to wheezy versioning

90060
debconf	apt
specifically it must send progress information to the file descriptor selected by the apt status-fd configuration option and must keep the file descriptors nominated by the apt keep-fds configuration option open when invoking debconf directly or indirectly as those file descriptors will be used for the debconf passthrough protocol

90069
debian	linux
i wish to mount my sony xperia st21i android 4.0.4 under linux debian via usb

90075
fish	zsh
that was fixed in the forsyth shell the basis for the original minix shell and pdksh in the late 80s zsh 1990 and fish 2005 but not other shells and in particular not the posix sh language that requires the expansion of to include

90076
filesystems	ntfs
unable to mount windows ntfs filesystems due to hibernation

90079
ssl	https
additionally google tries to do most requests via ssl so a deny via url_regex plays no part in these requests there is no url in https

90081
titlebar	window
in case you haven t read the titlebar of your webbrowser s window

90099
umask	chmod
the umask may prevent it but if you chmod 777 .config pulse the service should be able to write to it

90114
spaces	delimiter
using sed this will replace all spaces delimiter digit-only words

90116
solaris	sunos
we re working on a sunfire v240 server with sunos 5.9 solaris 9 yeah really old one i m not expert on server architecture and i d like your advices about installing debian sparc on those systems

90119
debian	linux
i m trying to install things in linux crunchbang linux - a derivation of debian and i m getting errors which point towards mongodb-20gen

90150
filesystems	fat
on cheap flash media that doesn t reallocate sectors meaning pretty much any older usb stick i don t know if it s still true of recent ones the repeated writes to the file allocation table on v fat or to the journal on a typical modern filesystems can kill the stick pretty fast

90150
filesystems	fat
on fat filesystems you can use the flush mount option

90163
kde	gnome
x resources are configuration values used by old-fashioned x applications applications that came before modern environments such as gnome and kde which have their own less powerful configuration system

90164
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu and other derivatives uconv is in the libicu-dev package

90164
redhat	fedora
on fedora redhat and other derivatives and in bsd ports it s in the icu package

90181
g++	gcc
this is an executable that you ll have to build using gcc g++

90203
stdout	stderr
afaik the only difference is that i have told bash to redirect stderr to stdout and it should not make any difference to what happens with stdout

90205
stdout	stderr
the wget command writes it s output to stderr not stdout

90207
mouse	keyboard
it processes their requests to draw onto the display and instead of responses sends events - notifications of user activity mouse buttons clicked keyboard keys presses etc.

90213
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m on lmde linux mint debian edition with cinnamon

90213
cinnamon	gnome
i don t know which exact package is responsible for the open file dialog - cinnamon gnome nemo or something else

90223
sudo	chgrp	chgrp	chmod
assuming your username and group are ricab have you tried sudo chgrp ricab var log screenlock.log and sudo chmod g+rw var log screenlock.log

90242
hex	binary
output as binary then convert to hex

90254
icmp	tcp
i m setting up a network bridge on centos 6.4 and i m not able to pass icmp or tcp traffic via eth1

90268
vmware	virtualbox
most support some level of 3d now - vmware workstation and virtualbox both do to some extent

90274
unix	bsd
apollo domainos could be used with sysv and bsd unix environments

90285
debian-based	linux
i ve created a debian-based chroot environment using debootstrap under arch linux and fill it with life like this

90302
bash	zsh
short and sweet is there a way to accomplish what --noprofile and --norc bash switches do using zsh

90371
spaces	delimiter
the problem is that cut uses a single spaces character as a delimiter but as the column name and the 4 digit pids are right aligned there are multiple leading spaces which cause cut to output an empty line

90390
ubuntu	linux
i d like to try and put linux on it in a dual boot probably ubuntu with its uefi support but before that i d like to make a system image with clonezilla in case i mess up or in the more likely case that uefi causes something else to mess up

90390
put	get
te problem is that when i put the clonezilla cd in the drive and reboot i get its grub menu but after selecting an option the screen just goes black and stays that way

90395
debian	linux
note i m new to linux server administration dusting off 10-year-old weekend classes in debian cli so for answers and questions please be explicit in what i need to enter into the terminal

90403
bash	zsh
zsh is very similar to bash you could probably call it a superset of bash - feature- usage-wise

90425
hash	md5
i am trying to find the memory usage of a md5 hashing program that is written in c and takes 7 seconds to hash hello world

90428
redhat	fedora
is there anything like debian watch in the fedora redhat world

90445
ant	maven
the build system itself is based on jenkins nexus maven ant and shell scripting

90468
filesystems	fat
that is the filesystems distributes the meta-data of free lists inode tables and data blocks into block groups across the drive so that the head doesn t have to jump from edge to edge as much as it might if there were only one block group as with fat filesystems

90494
bash	zsh
you need a shell with support for process substitution like ksh93 zsh or bash

90504
rpm	yum
this looks like yum rpm is complaining because a requirement has not been met

90514
versioning	upgrade
centos has been upgrade to versioning 6.4 and has all updates

90520
ubuntu	linux
the user mode linux uml i run on ubuntu crashes occasionally but does not generate any core file

90546
opensuse	linux
i just switched my development environment to opensuse so i can get more experience with linux systems

90549
redhat	fedora
disclaimer i work for redhat on the fedora project

90567
postfix	dovecot
is it possible that you don t want to redirect the incoming mail to an mta like postfix but instead to an mda like cyrus or dovecot that stores the mail in a user mailbox for later retrieval

90571
sudo	passwd
adapting the tab completion of your normal user to work with sudo may be possible but it seems rather problematic if you haven t used sudo in the last 15 minutes it would either prompt you for your passwd while you are trying to use the tab completion or it just wouldn t work and you would have to run sudo manually to refresh the credential cache before it could work again

90579
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
this is not guaranteed here because the chown chgrp and chmod calls may proceed at different rates so directory entries may be evicted from the cache but i d give it a go

90579
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
chgrp chmod and chown do nothing if the file already has the right metadata so you could call them unconditionally

90579
chown	chgrp
you can save a call by combining chgrp into chown

90590
folder	directory
i need to set read and write permissions for root user to directory subfoldern and all its parent folder till root

90605
folder	directory
add some commands that only a root or sudo user can execute like creating a folder at the root directory level

90607
openssl	gnutls
also openssl and gnutls the most widely used certificate processing libraries used to handle signed certificates behave differently in their treatment of certs which also complicates the issue

90621
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
with csh tcsh ksh zsh bash or fish

90649
disk	ram
it will be loaded into ram when it is invoked unless it is already in the disk cache

90650
bash	zsh
built-in commands like alias cd echo etc are part of your shell bash zsh ksh or whatever

90670
filesystems	fat
on cheap flash media that doesn t reallocate sectors meaning pretty much any older usb stick i don t know if it s still true of recent ones the repeated writes to the file allocation table on v fat or to the journal on a typical modern filesystems can kill the stick pretty fast

90670
filesystems	fat
on fat filesystems you can use the flush mount option

90677
sudo	passwd
i d like to setup sudo in such a way that it doesn t prompt me for a passwd when i authenticate to sshd with a key

90690
dpkg	aptitude
i believe your problem is a result of on inconsistency between the dpkg database var lib dpkg status and the aptitude database var lib aptitude pkgstates

90742
ubuntu	linux
i saw that on other computers that have a newer version of some linux distro these requests go fine so i m guessing it has to do something with me using ubuntu 10.10 where this problem isn t solved

90750
opera	internet-explorer
other browsers like opera internet-explorer support such open-url-with-external-program feature

90760
disk	ram
i ve done some reading and understood that the apparent ram utilization is not actual and that the extra ram is used for caching buffering disk i o operation to improve the performance of the server

90760
disk	ram
so how can i reduce the disk i o caching buffering ram as not to

90763
rpm	yum
also i would use yum to do it too it is able to help you out more than just regular rpm with trickier things like this

90766
kde	gnome
in that case you need to edit your .vnc xsession file to have it start the appropriate x clients such as an x window manager such as openbox or even a desktop manager such as gnome or kde

90774
disk	ram
use ram to speed up disk operations by using available memory for

90811
bash	zsh
i would like a solution that is not shell-dependent bash zsh etc.

90831
disk	ram
you re filling up the disk with your log files and you re running firefox x and rdesktop - all of which tend to use large amounts of ram

90842
websphere	ibm
on cisco and ibm s websphere application server for instance

90851
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade to the latest versioning of bluez versioning 5.8

90864
debian	linux
so how am i supposed to perform this installation under linux debian here without unpacking the extension by hand

90869
rsa	dsa	jobs	cron
this can also be useful for allowing passwordless rsa dsa authentication in cron jobs without passwordless ssh-keys

90869
jobs	cron
by doing this passphrases must be re-entered on login as above but cron jobs will still have access to the unencrypted keys after the user logs out

90878
gedit	sublimetext
firefox and sublimetext text2 shows +c ã as ä gedit shows nothing

90878
gedit	sublimetext
in firefox and sublimetext text2 the only problem is ã gedit is quite different it seems like a brazilian abnt2 keyboard

90929
sudo	passwd
but programs like su and sudo can check passwd without running as root

90953
cpu	processors
firmware is software that runs on a processors in the device itself not on the main cpu

90955
vpn	lan	wan	lan
the protocol is tolerable on a lan network but as soon as you try and span it over a wan connection or introduce encryption in the form of a vpn or by using an ssh connection as a link between the client and the server the protocol really starts to show it s lack of scalability

90955
wan	lan
it is going over a 100mb network in the lan test and a 20mb connection for the wan test but the point is still the same

90965
subtract	add
on top of this date can deal with dates like tomorrow or and can add and subtract them and return a human readable date instead of a string of digits

90966
daemon	cron
create a few more of these scripts and perhaps add functionality to issue warnings for slow responses that are different from criticals when the service goes offline completely then provide a web front end to browse and manage the status of the various hosts and create a dedicated daemon that runs these instead of cron and you ve got nagios

90982
freebsd	linux
this is not applicable to every kernel though meaning that you can probably replace a freebsd kernel with a newer freebsd kernel and as stated above you can upgrade a linux kernel pretty easily but you cannot easily replace a linux kernel with a freebsd kernel

90999
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
i ve used both mint and ubuntu in the past and definitely prefer distros based on debian that use apt-get as opposed to the others like suse

91002
chmod	mkdir	chown	mkdir	chown	chmod
add a dummy group add the user to that group chown root somegroup bin mkdir chmod g-x bin mkdir

91005
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i understand that a much better option as i m using linux mint 15 olivia which is ubuntu debian based is to download and install dpkg dev package and gnu make but i m afraid that the dependency error might pop up again

91007
debian	linux
install that package using your linux distribution package management tool you haven t mentioned what linux distribution you are using - like debian redhat etc.

91020
daemon	cron
this forces date to run with the time zone setting of the invoker which means the cron daemon

91020
daemons	systemd
also note that any changes to the systemd global timezone settings including etc localtime almost certainly require at least a restart of the cron daemons and possibly though unlikely a systemd reboot to take full effect

91020
daemon	cron
editing the tz assignment in the crontab should not require a reload of the cron daemon as it should detect that the file has been changed and reload it automatically

91021
debian	mint
i m not a mac person myself but my friend has been running debian on his macbook for years without issue it is the most stable distro you ll find and it should support your wifi drivers however if you want something simple and easy to use go with mint

91029
keydown	keyrelease	keydown	keyup
investigating further it turns out that fn is a special key on some notebooks like ibm lenovo thinkpads in that the keypress and keyrelease events or keydown and keyup in microsoft terms are generated simultaneously and only when the key is released

91029
keydown	keyup
however if fn keydown and keyup don t generate separate events of their own i believe they don t on thinkpads this doesn t really get you any further

91032
debian	linux
target debian gnu linux 7 amd64 256mb xeon

91043
sudo	nohup
run your command nohup sudo yum update this will also log all output to nohup.out file in your current directory

91066
sudo	nohup	sudo	passwd
dirty workaround do a dummy sudo before like sudo ls then launch your nohup command and it won t ask for your passwd again and will run anyway

91078
mouse	keyboard
there are pretty good directions on doing it here titled disable enable keyboard and mouse in linux

91102
stdout	stderr
if you want to redirect the stdout and stderr to dev null for xset -q you should do

91102
bash	zsh
the redirection of using only works within bash or zsh

91115
bash	subshell
starts a new bash subshell under ssh-agent

91140
ubuntu	linux
disclaimer i m fairly new to linux 2 years at home and mostly have only used ubuntu

91167
ubuntu	centos
along the lines of this msdn article how would you setup a pair of ubuntu or centos or rhel servers in a cluster so they appear to hosted applications as a single server but will continue to work even if a node in the cluster becomes inoperable or needs maintenance etc

91169
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
linux distributions have been slow to come to the mix fedora 18 adopted it debian and ubuntu still haven t budged so it usually requires the system administrator to set it up manually

91171
bash	zsh
this requires a shell that supports associative arrays ksh93 bash or zsh

91174
filesystems	fat
there are a few utilities that access a file directly without mounting such as debugfs for ext2 ext3 ext4 filesystems and mtools for fat filesystems

91175
disk	ram
ram isn t just for process memory it s also for the disk cache and buffers

91182
sudo	passwd
sudo cannot prompt you for a passwd and read it because it is executing in the foreground

91200
filesystems	btrfs
that said modern linux filesystems such as ext4 btrfs and jfs do store the file creation time aka birth time but use different names for the field in question crtime in ext4 otime in btrfs and jfs

91205
freebsd	linux
difference between freebsd and gnu linux on stat command

91205
freebsd	linux
if you call stat command in gnu linux it invokes the -x option but in freebsd you yourself should invoke the -x option

91219
macports	homebrew
use ddrescue via homebrew or macports instead of dd which will try and recover from read errors and also log them

91231
ubuntu	debian
i run debian rather than ubuntu so i haven t tested this myself but the page claims that this will work for ubuntu 12.04 12.10 and 13.10 and the instructions seem correct

91287
unix	bsd
for better for for worse most unix linux bsd shells use identical syntax in accessing environment variables and shell variables

91287
unix	bsd
and this latter stronger definition is what an environment is for unix linux bsd shells an association between names variables and their values

91287
bash	zsh
ksh zsh and bash all have typed variables these days

91293
ati	nvidia
if it s an older gpu intel nvidia ati it likely doesn t have support so disable hw accel

91296
xmodem	zmodem	kermit	xmodem	kermit	zmodem
transfer files between network devices with sftp xmodem ymodem zmodem or kermit

91298
ubuntu	debian
since ubiquity the ubuntu installer was giving me hard time installing grub i selected to continue without a bootloader and since i installed mounted boot in my previous boot i just had to do update-grub from debian 32-bits and problem solved.

91298
ubuntu	debian
but when i select ubuntu 13.04 it boots into debian

91298
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu s and debian fstab are the very same except for the entry

91305
ubuntu	debian
this is probably the reason why your ubuntu entry is booting debian - you may be using ubuntu s kernel and initramfs but your grub.cfg instructs it to mount your debian partition and then to continue booting from this partition

91305
ubuntu	debian
then set up debian s grub to chainload ubuntu s grub

91305
ubuntu	debian
yes move from debian s grub to ubuntu s grub

91305
ubuntu	debian
if you have debsums installed on ubuntu you can now check for missing files in case you forgot something in debian s boot but this may take a while

91305
ubuntu	debian
you still have to figure out how to tell debian s grub that it should chainload the grub2 mbr that is now living on the ubuntu hard disk

91307
sudo	passwd
ideally that command would ask my private ssh key passwd then connect then ask the sudo passwd for rsyncuser and then run rsync on the server

91307
sudoers	visudo
so i had to add this to etc sudoers using sudo visudo which basically gives passwordless full read-write access to the system to the user rsyncuser which is not to my taste

91307
sudo	passwd
how can i instead tell sudo to read its passwd from say another tty

91307
sudo	passwd
that way i could run rsync in one terminal window on my local machine and use another terminal window to open a possibly separate ssh connexion to the server and supply the sudo passwd there

91307
sudo	passwd
the only way i think of doing something like that would be to use an expect script around sudo which reads the passwd from a named pipe and i would write to that pipe from the other terminal

91327
torque	slurm
if your matlab jobs are non-interactive running a batched script then you may want to look into batch scheduling software like torque or slurm - this kind of resource management is exactly what they are designed to do

91327
torque	slurm
slurm has a set of compatibility wrappers so that people used to pbs or torque can start using it immediately with familiar commands

91354
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m on linux mint 15 mate edition based on ubuntu 13.04 and i m using a logitech g700 mouse

91359
jobs	cron
you could use 2 cron jobs one to start the application at 10am and another to stop it at 5pm

91367
debian	linux
note i have tested this on a debian linux system using the latest versions of id from gnu coreutils and find from gnu findutils

91373
sudoers	visudo
this kind of config is done in etc sudoers you must edit it with visudo

91377
mouse	keyboard
system settings - keyboard mouse or input devices - keyboard - num lock on kde startup - turn on

91384
sudo	passwd
from what i get from the answers and man sudo the shell ran with sudo -s is the one given in etc passwd right

91384
ubuntu	debian
however on both ubuntu and debian the shell given in etc passwd for root is bin bash

91405
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am running linux mint based on ubuntu 12.04 and had a similar problem

91459
subnet	packets
a packets from 10.0.1.50 to another host in this subnet will not pass through the router so you can t filter it

91461
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am a beginner to linux so i installed several operating systems on my computer in a multiboot configuration ubuntu linux mint windows ...

91461
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am using ubuntu and linux mint

91468
sudoers	visudo
the command visudo is the prescribed way for editing the etc sudoers file

91482
disk	ram
the kernel will automatically fetch the required data from the hard disk store it in the ram and return this data to the application

91485
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
webmin should work with most of the major distros such as centos debian and ubuntu

91496
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
this is the rename command provided by the perl package on debian and derivatives ubuntu mint â but not on other distributions which may have a different utility called rename

91503
unix	solaris
if you really want that you ll need something more flexible than classical unix file permissions or solaris linux acls i think you can do it with osx acls

91515
jobs	cron
since all files were created at about the same time look for daily cron jobs that run about that time

91520
udp	tcp
tcp and udp sockets are accessible to any user because these protocols have a notion of ports and a process can take control of a port which is called binding it so the kernel knows where to send the packets

91526
versioning	upgrade
your choices at the moment are to stay with 2.13-38 and recompile your program against that versioning of libc6 or upgrade to 2.17-92+b1 from sid or testing

91540
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
note that the killall command on systems descendant from unix system v notably sun s solaris ibm s aix and hp s hp-ux kills all processes killable by a particular user effectively shutting down the system if run by root

91543
h.264	webm
your .mpg extension suggests you are using mpeg-2 now for example so you might try switching to h.264 or vp8 webm

91549
ubuntu	debian
to get rid of the different behavior of sudo -s on ubuntu and debian respectively you could use a sudo wrapper answer to q4

91572
ubuntu	debian
one of the differences between the configuration in debian wheezy and in ubuntu 12.04 is that the home environment variable is preserved in ubuntu but not in debian

91572
ubuntu	debian
thus sudo -s preserves home on ubuntu while on debian home is erased and sudo then sets it to the home directory of the target user

91572
sudoers	visudo
run visudo to edit the sudoers file

91584
dpkg	apt
if apt dpkg may be informed of how to unpackage those files it should do the trick

91594
freebsd	centos
specifically i am trying to determine why on a freebsd vm i have 3 times better performance on an nfs mount than on a centos vm

91616
mouse	keyboard
also mentioned in the user guide there are only three settings in the keyboard mouse section in bios uefi configuration aka

91638
stdout	stderr
now without killing the shell how do i get back the output redirected to the stdout and error redirected to stderr respectively

91639
stdout	stderr
what you re doing in your question is replicating in stdout and stderr the original stdout and stderr which have already been redirected to the file

91639
stdout	stderr
so the above statement makes use of tty to redirect stdout and stderr back to the terminal device as they were before

91650
ubuntu	centos
i just bought a hp prolliant dl320e g8 v2 and i am trying to install centos or ubuntu server on it from a usb

91650
vmware	esx
the problem is that i do not have any option for this in intelligent provisioning the only options are windows red hat linux open suse enterprise vmware esxi vsphere custom image and vmware esx custom image

91685
getter	setter
if ksh93 is an option there is definitely a way to implement what you want with getter and setter discipline functions that would retrieve store the variable value from to a shared storage

91710
xfs	btrfs
xfs ext4 btrfs preallocate entire extents

91716
stdout	stderr
when you ran stdout and stderr were formerly connected to the terminal and became connected to filename

91716
stdout	stderr
so if you want to get back that shell s original stdout and stderr you can do it because the file they were connected to is still around

91720
ubuntu	linux
if not what about installing another gnu linux flavor alongside my ubuntu installation

91721
vmware	esx
vmware at least esx has its own timekeeping software

91736
folder	directory
i mounted a folder on a remote machine using sshfs but didn t specify -o allow_other flag thus can t access the mounted directory

91754
chown	chmod
it is advisable to chown it root root and chmod it rwxr-xr-x 755 to avoid unprivileged users modifying it

91773
puts	gets
some kernel code in the kernel text section might be trying to call a function marked with the __init data macro which the linker puts in the kernel init section that gets de-allocated after boot or module loading

91775
sudo	passwd
what i would like to do is be able to login and sudo commands immediately without entering a passwd again

91775
sudoers	visudo
and be sure to use sudo visudo to edit sudoers

91779
stdout	stderr
i need to log stdout and stderr to logfiles but only show the error messages on screen

91802
icmp	tcp
the first is that ping uses a icmp packets which are quite distinct from tcp ip and are frequently given less priority than ip traffic and are more likely to be discarded by intermediate routers

91816
lvm	mdadm	put	get
let s say i have a raid5 configured with mdadm and put the resulting devices md0 and md1 into lvm to get one big failsafe drive

91827
xfce	cinnamon
i installed mint-meta-xfce package on an existing cinnamon installation but it doesn t look anything like a standalone installation of linux mint 15 xfce

91841
lvm	btrfs	lvm	mdadm	mdadm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
if you are still in the design stage you re not already committed to mdadm and or lvm then i recommened that you seriously consider using a modern filesystems like btrfs or zfs

91841
lvm	btrfs
one other big advantage that zfs and btrfs have over lvm is that lvm logical volumes are of fixed size kind of like a virtual disk partition and you have to take special steps if you need to grow or shrink the size of an lv if you make a mistake and allocate far too much space to usr and not enough to var you ll have a lot of work ahead of you to fix that

91841
filesystems	btrfs
with zfs btrfs a sub-volume is more like a soft-quota allocation with optional reservation from the total space and changing the allocation is a trivial process that does not require any filesystems juggling backup restore moving files around

91841
filesystems	btrfs
it is conceptually quite different to zfs and there are some things it does better than zfs rebalancing data across drives when you add or change the drives in the btrfs filesystems but overall it has less features than zfs

91859
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
tcp udp icmp for protocols on top of ip

91872
stdout	stderr
is it possible to redirect the output from a command to replace the text sent to stdout with the text from stderr

91872
stdout	stderr
i know i could just use but i want to know if there s a way to do this with the text from stderr redirected to stdout

91910
ubuntu	linux
i have 3 linux distributions on my machine ubuntu arch and fedora

91912
mouse	keyboard
the mouse is movable but nothing respond to mouse or keyboard

91912
google-chrome	firefox
if i don t use google-chrome say using firefox instead then the system runs ok

91920
xfce	kde
example you have installed from the kde live image and now want to switch to xfce

91933
folder	directory
i have a lot of mp3 files located at various levels of subdirectories inside a single folder and i want to move them all to a single directory what command could i use to do this

91942
torque	slurm
i personally wouldn t want to set up what you want but if i had to i wouldn t consider using pbs or torque i d use slurm

91947
debian	linux
both of these are probably already packaged for your linux distribution - in debian they are libexpect-perl and python-pexpect

91992
bash	zsh
the only workaround will probably be to run another shell like bash or zsh instead of ash

92001
opensuse	linux
in case you d like to check whether it works out for you try opensuse 12.2 12.3 or alt linux 7.0 i ve tested the former and added uefi support to the latter

92009
udp	tcp
install iptraf-ng to see which tcp udp connection eats your bandwidth

92024
gtk	ncurses
if you decided to switch from ifupdown for some reason you might be interested in wicd which consists of a daemon controlled by various uis ncurses gtk qt

92032
sysv	systemd
for bsd sysv init style this means adding a script somewhere to be run in the desired runlevel for systemd this involves creating a unit file and requiring it by the desired target

92032
daemons	systemd
first solution is better for things local to one or two machines since they are more of a configuration thing second one is suited for service daemons like things that are likely to be run on more systemd and should actually be packaged to make maintenance easier

92036
bluetooth	usb
i would like to make a usb bluetooth dongle discoverable upon start-up or whenever it s plugged in on debian squeeze or wheezy

92036
ubuntu	debian
a number of documents for example on the debian wiki or this ubuntu issue point to settings in etc bluetooth hcid.conf

92046
ethernet	wireless
those i suppose to be my pc s wireless adaptor ethernet adaptor and localhost

92070
debian	linux
my computer runs cruncbang linux debian based

92071
chown	chmod
at the man pages for chmod and chown and searched around different help

92074
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
chgrp chmod and chown seems quite limited in this case

92083
centos	linux
the linux ami distros that amazonws uses are custom versions of centos

92083
ubuntu	centos
it probably makes more sense to either install a fullblown version of centos or ubuntu and install the packages using that distro s normal packages vs

92090
chown	sudo
what rootuser can do is to run sudo chown â â the chown command must be run by root the rootuser itself has no particular privileges

92093
chown	chmod
in the simplest mode use chown and chmod to set the ownership and permissions on a repository for each user

92103
ubuntu	debian
the above was sleuthed on a fedora system other distros such as debian ubuntu may store the .seq file in an entirely different directory

92116
rpm	yum
i am upgrading python on an offline 64bit rhel 6.4 box and am having to do it via rpm s rather than yum

92118
pyenv	virtualenv
python pyenv virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper

92125
sudo	passwd
this won t work if sudo prompts you for a passwd

92125
sudo	passwd
to avoid that run ssh -t user 192.168.1.2 sudo first and enter the passwd

92130
bonjour	avahi
in addition to the useful recommendations in the other answers the avahi suite aka zeroconf aka apple bonjour is useful in passing around and resolving local mdns information

92140
ubuntu	debian
regarding the debian openssl bug - i don t think any other distribution apart from debian based ones including ubuntu has been hit by it

92141
versioning	upgrade
i read this article ubuntu12.04 how to disable a daemon process at startup it says this feature can be done by upstart 1.3 but we are limited to use rhel 6.3 which upstart package versioning is 0.6.7 and the most important thing is no upgrade for upstart and cannot switch to other platform

92142
stdout	stderr
i d like to run it as normal but have stdout and stderr logged to a file at the same time they re output to the console

92143
stdout	stderr
to pipe both stdout and stderr

92156
rpm	yum
is there a way to install without the yum command like the question above is there an rpm file buried in there somewhere i can run

92162
ubuntu	linux
well the simplest thing to do is probably to use a live distribution of your favorite gnu linux a usb stick with a live ubuntu would do it for example and to resize your partition with a tool as gparted easy to use with a great gui

92178
ubuntu	linux
i wrote a small c program and compiled it on i386 linux ubuntu 12.04 using gcc

92195
folder	directory
given you re trying to make use of mhddfs to create a virtual directory of other directory it seems like you should be able to just provide the paths to dropbox folder as arguments to it

92204
daemons	systemd
the system.sysdescr.0 object in the snmpv2-mib can help you find out which os you are contacting provided there s an snmp daemons running in the target systemd

92206
disk	ram
on a mid-class centos 6.4 64 server with 32 gb ram 3 tb free disk space operating as kvm hypervisor i start copying a 200 gb file to a destination in the same local filesystem

92218
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i would tend to go with lsb_release -a for any linux distributions that i would frequent redhat debian ubuntu etc.

92236
chown	mount
the solution was simply to chown the home directory after the mount took place

92238
kde	gnome
can this work also under kde gnome unity ..

92241
ubuntu	debian
there is this tutorial which discusses how to do this using debian ubuntu but much of the steps should be translatable to other distros as well

92256
bluetooth	usb
turn bluetooth on android off and disconnect your usb bluetooth adapter from your linux machine or if you have an in built one reset it using hcitool devname reset

92264
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp	gif	png	gif	bmp
you can try mirage which supports png jpg svg xpm gif bmp tiff and others

92278
debian	mint	debian	linux
i just upgraded linux mint debian edition with the up7 package

92278
dpkg	apt
the update manager failed initially can t remember where... so i ran sudo apt update sudo apt dist-upgrade sudo apt upgrade and sudo dpkg --configure -a

92306
cpu	processors
processors core cpu core logical processors refers to a single processing unit capable of performing computations

92313
ubuntu	debian
doing some tests on an ubuntu 12.04 virtualbox vm hopefully not too different to debian 7

92316
mouse	keyboard
x #support keyboard mouse and some of driver

92328
stdout	stderr
it redirects both stdout and stderr into file fname

92358
sudoers	passwd
for instance if it desired to allow users in the wheel group to a run useradd without entering a passwd it can be achieved by adding the following stanza to etc sudoers with the sudoedit command

92377
udp	tcp
applications that do not require the reliability of a tcp connection may instead use the connectionless user datagram protocol udp which emphasizes low-overhead operation and reduced latency rather than error checking and delivery validation

92393
ubuntu	linux
i ve tried to install for several times various linux distros on the usb hd ubuntu backtrack suse 11 scientific linux but i have problems booting it

92397
ubuntu	linux
for example when you re interactively working on a graphical linux desktop let s say ubuntu then having to use sudo is fine in those rare cases where you sometimes need root access

92416
ubuntu	debian
installing two glibc alongside in debian ubuntu

92416
ubuntu	debian
how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

92431
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
if i m not mistaken any filesystems supported by windows fat vfat fat32 ntfs should meet some standard naming conventions for valid file and directory names

92431
filesystems	fat
i would say that linux implementation of fat vfat filesystems tries to be compliant with this kind of windows standard

92468
bash	zsh
with bash ksh or zsh builtins

92470
octal	hex	octal	decimal
you ll get tables in octal hex and decimal

92517
ubuntu	linux	daemons	systemd
using example.local only works on systemd and for destinations that have a mdns daemons running macosx current linux distributions like ubuntu fedora

92519
bash	zsh
is a ksh feature also found nowadays in zsh and bash called process substitution

92519
bash	zsh
there s however a operator in zsh inspired from the same operator in the unix port of rc also found in recent versions of ksh93 and bash

92519
heredoc	herestring
it s a variation on the heredoc operator called herestring

92519
bash	zsh
now you can combine the operator with command substitution to somehow emulate zsh s operator in bash and ksh93

92522
centos	linux
now i ve seen centos scientific linux that when rsyslog is already running you delete the log file the one dedicated to log traces from your application you then run your application rsyslog will not create a log file and no trace will be recorded

92523
division	modulo
doing modulo division 4 times adding 1 to rtest prior to allows us to increment the numbers to generate the range

92523
division	modulo
performing modulo division is a great way to box a number so that you get results in a specific range

92525
disk	ram
i thought all modern os provide infinite ram by just using disk swap for whatever goes over the physical ram

92528
disk	ram
that in turn will slow everything down because reading from disk is much slower than reading from the ram

92528
disk	ram
once the process has taken all the ram it will also fill up the disk because it is writing to swap and i am left with no more ram and no more space to swap into people tend to limit swap to a dedicated partition rather than a swapfile for exactly that reason

92550
debian	linux
i have an apache web server running on debian linux and i secure a certain directory with htaccess

92550
crypt	md5
apache documentations says that crypt encryption was used to encrypt passwords until version 2.2.17 and md5 encryption is used since 2.2.18

92552
daemons	systemd
this might happen even while the systemd is not actively swapping for example if the swap area is filled with sleeping daemons memory pages

92564
int	chars
tell the terminal device that the chars that causes a sigint to be sent to the foreground job is something else like with stty int k in a shell

92574
wan	lan
x works fine locally over a lan and over a wan

92581
macports	homebrew
highlights how to using either macports or homebrew

92608
ubuntu	linux
is that the problem with port only or is there anything wrong in my code or any settings is required in linux ubuntu

92620
stdout	fflush
i made sure to use fflush stdout in both the programs immediately after using printf

92622
sudo	passwd
i suppose the last output should also be bash because etc passwd shows that root uses bash am i missing any points about sudo

92624
ethernet	wireless
these 2 lines show that we re listening on port 22 sshd and are willing to accept connections from any interface we have any network card ethernet or wireless

92676
versioning	upgrade
bear in mind that if it requires a newer versioning of libc it is probably easier to upgrade your entire system to the testing or experimental repositories

92676
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade libc because package foo depends on a newer versioning how should the package manager deal with the fact that 16056 packages depend on the installed versioning

92679
ubuntu	linux
i have had this problem in multiple linux distros including ubuntu and currently fedora 19

92684
macports	homebrew
i ve helped more people that i care to admit that were using an osx system where they wanted to install opensource project x and they were going through all the same types of hoops on osx with the wrong version of xcode or they were using the official version of subversion and needed to install a version from macports or homebrew

92694
filesystems	ntfs
at a technical level what you re asking a filesystems to do is counter to the design of most filesystems where the index of the disk is a very key and central structure without encryption even in a filesystems like ntfs your inability to browse a directory is something programatically enforced by that operating system an open source filesystems driver can choose to pay no attention to such access hints and ultimately you re just not going to achive anything anywhere near secure without a a filesystems explicitly designed for this unlikely in a decades old fs or b encryption software to render the data visible but unreadable

92697
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
further running the same software stack on ubuntu or debian or centos or arch or whatever will result in the same memory usage

92697
ubuntu	linux
a full fledged linux system without x will fit in 20-25 mb of ram whether it s ubuntu or fedora or arch or whatever

92699
daemon	cron
cron and anacron are normally daemon services

92729
ubuntu	debian
with ubuntu and debian it shows up as usr share doc util-linux examples getopt-parse.bash

92767
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
i created several btrfs filesystems upon different devices sdx loop lvm etc

92767
filesystems	btrfs	umount	btrfs
during these tests i removed abruptly some or all devices which were part of a btrfs filesystems fs were umount first

92767
filesystems	btrfs
but now command btrfs show still shows filesystems uuid and list of devices

92767
filesystems	btrfs
but where does btrfs stores its list of handled filesystems

92772
sudo	passwd
now to solve my work i need a way so that it would automatically take my passwd when the above sudo command executes

92772
sudo	passwd
from this output it means this path file has to run and provide my passwd as output to sudo

92773
sudoers	passwd
to do what you want you probably want to edit your etc sudoers file to allow the shut user to be able to run shutdown without specifying a passwd

92773
sudo	passwd
a more insecure option would be to use the -s option of sudo to read the passwd from stdin and echo the passwd to it like so

92773
sudo	passwd
echo passwd | sudo -s shutdown -h now

92783
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade my versioning of gitlab from 6-0 to 6-1 part of the upgrade consists of replacing the init script

92790
ubuntu	debian
i ended up installed the kx studio distro based on debian ubuntu and i removed pulseaudio for simplicity

92791
ubuntu	debian
i ended up installing the kx studio distro based on debian ubuntu and i removed pulseaudio for simplicity

92792
freebsd	solaris
the freebsd and solaris manuals are clear if at.allow exists at.deny is ignored

92792
solaris	bsd
despite the convergence of bsd and solaris this is not universal

92810
ubuntu	debian
i use debian solaris and osx so i m not 100 sure if they are the same on ubuntu

92813
comm	grep
the grep and comm with sort methods take a long time on large files

92829
bash	zsh
while brace expansion like originates in csh in the late 70s and found its way to bourne-like shells in bash zsh pdksh in the late 80s early 90s the variant came later first in zsh in 1995 2.6-beta4

92859
rpm	yum	dpkg	apt
it s typically a single executable file that when executed will dump the .deb or .rpm files out to disk and then install them using the package management tools dpkg apt yum or rpm

92894
jobs	cron
but beware of cron jobs and world writable directories

92895
freebsd	linux
it works with gnu sed on linux but freebsd sed expects the first argument after -i flag to be extension for backup copy

92898
freebsd	linux
if you have gnu find non-embedded linux or cygwin or freebsd find freebsd or osx you can use -newermt to match files that were last modified after a certain date

92902
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
this applies to debian derivatives as well including ubuntu and mint

92905
dpkg	apt
.deb files are packages for dpkg the low-level debian package manager which is invoked under the hood by apt and its relatives

92905
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
a .deb file is a package for debian or for a derivative such as ubuntu or mint

92905
installation	upgrade
debian packages contain the files that belong to the package as well as a â œcontrol fileâ which describes the package s dependencies and other meta-information and installation scripts that are executed when the package is installed upgrade or uninstalled

92905
redhat	fedora
redhat and relatives such as centos and fedora suse and others use rpm a different format with similar characteristics

92916
bash	zsh
this is the case even if i start m-x ansi-term with bash and then i try to switch to zsh

92942
nerdtree	tagbar
any chance to get g vim displaying nerdtree and tagbar above each other left to edited file

92952
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
in gnome kde unity and xfce the default keyboard shortcut for the run prompt is alt + f2

92952
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
inside a desktop environment xdg-open simply passes the arguments to a desktop environment specific equivalent gvfs-open in gnome and unity kde-open in kde or exo-open in xfce

92953
cifs	smb
instead of smb unc you probably need to use urls like cifs server path or smb server path

92962
folder	directory
if not is it possible to create a folder css in another folder where i want to create symlinks and that folder have symlinks for all the similar file names in another directory where files can come dynamically

92966
cifs	smb
about the magic linux uses samba package which is an open source partial implementation of smb cifs protocol used by windows machines to exchange data in windows domains or workgroups

92966
cifs	smb
smb cifs is a piece of ooze kind of technology making use of like 10 other protocols and i failed to find a good source of info on it which would explain its functioning by example like first this message goes from a to b then that goes from b to a

92975
sudo	passwd
instead of su use sudo which has the -s switch to accept a passwd from standard input

92975
sudo	passwd
instead of using set-uid gid you can use configure sudo to allow a specific user to run het helperapp as user1 without a passwd prompt this requires admin root priviliges

92985
bash	zsh
that s a ksh feature also found in bash and recent versions of zsh

92985
bash	zsh
when in scalar context like here in an assignment to a scalar variable the list of elements is joined with space characters with bash and ksh93 and with the first character of or nothing if is empty or space if it is unset with zsh

92985
bash	zsh
contrary to ksh and bash zsh arrays are a different variable type from scalar variables are not sparse zsh has associative arrays as another variable type and start at index 1 instead of 0

92985
bash	zsh
as a special case and again for portability with ksh93 and bash zsh also accepts a 0 first element for and treats that as

93028
folder	directory
when the user types cdop they go to the company opengl proj folder if they cdap they go to the freelance android project directory

93043
bash	zsh
similar features of bash and zsh

93058
bash	subshell
in the 2nd example the echo command is within the grouping braces because bash runs the pipeline in a subshell so changes to the sum variable will not exist when the subshell exits

93073
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
also this user explains how to do this on a ubuntu linux can i still follow that guide point by point even on debian linux

93083
disk	ram
the most obvious potential benefit is that accessing ram is much faster than accessing a disk

93101
debian	linux
location of numpy depends on your linux distributive for instance in debian 7 i have numpy installed in usr lib pyshared python2.6 numpy .

93102
for-loop	loops
we could use this modified version of our script which would use a while loops instead of a for-loop

93125
sudo	passwd
with the advent of sudo additional permissions could be handed out on an as needed basis to groups further undermining any use cases that group passwd may have provided

93156
sudo	passwd
use the user account which has sudo privilege with the passwd live

93169
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
or you can use other bootloaders such as lilo or loadlin they should be better suited for running kernel from ntfs or fat filesystems used by windows machines

93176
bash	zsh
in fact if bash or zsh can find the terminal dimensions it will automatically set these variables itself to make it easy for not-so-clever programs to see the terminal size

93176
tcsh	dash
however most other shells including dash and tcsh do not set these variables

93206
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
there are several different graphical user environments available for linux such as the gnome kde or xfce desktop environments

93206
kde	gnome
such desktop environments include a panel application such as gnome panel or kde kicker

93206
kde	gnome
both the gnome and kde projects have announced that they will implement support for wayland but currently it is not a viable alternative on the desktop although it is used by some linux-based in-vehicle infotainment ivi systems

93210
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
if you aren t adverse to burning some cd s i d cut a few live cd s that use different de s -- gnome kde xfce etc

93210
titlebar	window
2 the widget set is what determines the appearance of generic stuff inside the window frame buttons scrollbars etc. which is why there are two distinct independent forms of theme in play with the gui appearance the theme of the widget set inside the frame and the theme of the wm the frame the titlebar

93212
daemons	systemd	sysv	systemd
i m not sure where the etc init.d skeleton file disappeared but i would expect that this change is related to replacement of traditional sysv init daemons with systemd since opensuse 12

93235
ubuntu	freebsd
you can read a man page with the man command or in various online databases ubuntu freebsd etc.

93264
zsh	tcsh
if the login shell of the remote user is csh or tcsh look at the .cshrc and .tcshrc and for zsh at .zshenv which are interpreted by every shell including non-interactive ones regardless of whether they re called over ssh or not but as such they will typically not do things with the tty unconditionally

93273
centos	mint	centos	linux
both my computer and the server are on the same lan i m running linux mint and the server is running centos release 5.9 final

93279
stdout	stderr
there are three standard files open for each program stdin standard input stdout standard output and stderr standard error

93279
stdout	stderr
writes to both stdout and stderr is output in the terminal by default

93279
stdout	stderr
it is a common convention to write errors and log messages to stderr instead of stdout in order to not mix log or error messages with actual program output

93284
bash	zsh
this is a quick port of a zsh function i have to bash

93285
hide	show
is there a terminal command to hide the file extension from being show when i open this folder in finder the next time

93294
ubuntu	linux
this is about ubuntu linux 12.04 server

93302
debian	linux
so it s probably possible to get this driver as a file download and then copy it to the debian linux computer and install it manually especially if you have no internet connection on that computer

93302
debian	linux
i was prompted to insert a cd dvd because i installed debian linux from a dvd disc and i have it listed in the sources.list file

93302
debian	linux
i did get help from the linux wireless community and the debian community

93307
bash	zsh
yes process substitution is a non-standard feature originated in ksh and only available in ksh bash and zsh

93331
bash	zsh
some shells like bash zsh and some implementations of ksh do that implicitly for the last command in a script

93350
debian	linux
do we have something similar in a linux debian world for make utility

93353
rijndael	twofish
openssl dgst -sha512 -binary produces binary form of the sha-512 hash from its standard input openssl enc -bf encrypts it using blowfish - feel free to choose hash and cipher to your liking twofish or rijndael are both rather well-tried but other ciphers available in the kernel should be fine too

93365
debian	mint	debian	linux
i recently updated my linux mint debian edition to update pack 7

93365
cinnamon	gnome
i have checked cinnamon s sound preferences and gnome s just in case since there is some overlap and also the pulse audio settings

93376
ubuntu	debian
i have tested this with both ubuntu 12.04 and debian 7

93391
ubuntu	centos
but there is available a gpt-aware fdisk tool called sgdisk which is part of the gdisk package on rhel centos ubuntu distros

93429
debian	linux
once debian and the fsf parted ways stallman requested that debian refer to itself as gnu linux

93429
libc	binutils
reason a tends to be mentioned rather more often though it was not exactly true then and is even less true now though clearly important parts of a linux based operating system depend on gnu tools bash gcc binutils gdb libc etc. in some cases these can be replaced by other tools

93429
debian	linux
as far as i know only debian and some of its derivatives following the lead of its parent refer to themselves as gnu linux

93429
gentoo	linux
however the other so-called linux distributions such as fedora gentoo etc

93431
trojan	virus
the trojan virus is sent in a application zip attachment

93431
trojan	virus
addendum running clamscan on the saved attachment zip file its-self results in no virus trojan malware being detected probably because the internal executable file is in an unreadable state

93431
filesystems	xfs
if the zip file is unpacked on an xfs filesystems by the user then it is readable because xfs does not support the attribute setting mechanism

93432
freebsd	debian
and as an universal operating system you can run debian with a freebsd kernel and a gnu userland

93434
libc	ldd
you can t run ldd on it but file says it is dynamically linked i presume to libc this may sound circular but it isn t and linux-vdso

93449
centos	linux
would a fedora repository platform linux brand chfk work for centos

93458
sudo	gnome-terminal	sudo	passwd
can sudo sessions be shared across tabs of gnome-terminal so that once i use sudo in one tab i won t have to re-enter my passwd every time i open another tab and use sudo

93459
sudoers	visudo	sudo	gnome-terminal
to share sudo authentications across all shell sessions not only the tabs of a specific gnome-terminal instance you will need to add this line to your etc sudoers file use visudo to do so

93477
bash	zsh
at least on arch the script checks if you are running either bash or zsh and exits if you are not

93483
google-chrome	firefox
now restart google-chrome and firefox

93484
ethernet	wireless
2 it turned out that if i just booted with the other kernel that was already installed 3.5.0-41-generic instead of 3.5.0-030500-generic - i don t actually know what the difference is both the ethernet and the wireless worked fine

93494
ubuntu	centos
this is not ubuntu it appears to be centos

93501
disk	ram
when the available ram is exhausted the kernel starts swapping out bits of processing to disk

93501
disk	ram
on a typical healthy system only about half the ram is used by processes and the other half is used for disk cache and buffers

93535
kde	gnome
now try strace on your gui terminal -- you ll have to figure out the name if you don t know it on kde it s konsole and gnome has the gnome-terminal i believe

93540
fish	bash
this especially easy when using the fish shell instead of bash

93541
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	redhat	fedora
you can t simply dd iso to hard disk but for debian and rh-based there are debootstrap and febootstrap scripts that can help you install debian ubuntu or redhat fedora into you hard drive after boot from any linux os

93556
ubuntu	debian
now ubuntu is a debian derivative so many things apply here as well

93556
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately ubuntu does not pay as close attention to safe upgrades as debian

93557
bash	zsh
at t ksh yash and zsh also bash but only for single-byte characters support alnums in the current locale not only ascii ones

93557
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
that one seems to work with zsh yash csh and tcsh on linux amd64 but not with any of the other shells i tried mksh ksh93 bash dash

93606
redhat	fedora
i tried the above code and it worked fine on redhat fedora 14

93638
versioning	upgrade
the warning message would go away if you removed the texlive-local package or if you upgrade to a versioning with a maintainer field

93640
mouse	keyboard
gui applications such as xterm gnome-terminal konsole â transform keyboard and mouse events into text input and display output graphically in some font

93641
disk	ram
chances are that either your disk or ram are failing

93645
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu uses grub as its default bootloader and grub contains a filesystem driver that it uses to load the linux kernel but grub needs to find its filesystem driver

93679
ubuntu	mint
i added a user to my mint ubuntu desktop so that he could ftp files that i can share ndash

93680
folder	directory
that creates a folder underneath the standard location for the ftp daemon s pub directory that any member of group users can write to

93681
put	get
i get the following out put

93684
afp	smb
i would like all shares afp and smb to be accessible from a server icon in the finder navigation bar

93684
bonjour	avahi
samba does not have built-in bonjour support but with the help of avahi it s possible to advertise your smb shares through bonjour as well and they show up in the finder s navigation bar as well awesome

93684
afp	smb
when i click on the server icon in the navigation bar i only see the afp shares no smb to be seen

93712
starttls	smtps
smtps port 587 with starttls is the standard-compliant way to connect

93727
ubuntu	linux
i currently have nothing linux related installed but the ubuntu still shows in the boot loader

93727
ubuntu	linux
edit i am now getting the grub error an any linux version i try i just tried ubuntu

93767
gentoo	linux
this is x86_64 gentoo linux with kernel 3.10.7

93774
bash	subshell
this can be done by the sed or cut or tr command but because this is such a simple task why spawn a new subshell when bash can do it

93782
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i ve had the same problem in both ubuntu 12.10 and linux mint 15

93786
put	get
i know that xdotool can get the coordinates of the pointer mouse but what i want is to get the coordinates of the text input caret so then i can use xdotool to put that same coordinates for the mouse pointer

93789
for-loop	arrays
i would create the for-loop and reverse the keys with the values in the new arrays

93796
xen	openvz
i m heavy user of kvm xen and also lxc and i can say this one thing that when it comes to security i never go with linux containers no matter if lxc openvz vserver

93796
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
libvirt ensures strict confinement of containers when using selinux thanks to lxc_driver - not sure though if it s only rhel centos fedora case i don t use ubuntu debian that much - so going with selinux is a good idea in my opinion it s must have in such circumstances

93799
ubuntu	linux
when i boot from the installation cd for arch linux 2013.10.01 i can see the menu that lets me choose to install arch boot the installed system ubuntu 10.04 i think power off

93811
google-chrome	firefox
may i add that there are periods where it seems to post what i would say is acceptable in speed response if i do a refresh page whether in google-chrome or firefox it will take a perceived 200-300ms then maybe some time later a mind boggling 1.5 mins

93832
stdout	stderr
you can run your command in background as a job and redirect its stdout and stderr optionally to a logfile where designates job if stderr too say instead of

93833
bash	zsh
note that this only works if your shell actually supports the preincrement operator like bash or ksh93 or zsh

93847
sudo	passwd
it is the same thing as sudo a program that allows you to run things with root privileges by entering your passwd

93855
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
adding rootpw as a parameter to a user group or a default definition in etc sudoers will require the root passwd entered for that user group or by default in all of the above sudo s unless otherwise overridden

93855
opensuse	linux
while this is not the default for most linux distributions i can t speak for unix much i seem to remember that it was at least for a time the default in opensuse

93859
sudo	passwd
if you can do that disable passwd for the devs and set the sudo rules to not require a passwd

93904
freebsd	debian
fwiw i had a quick look at the freebsd bash ports and debian bash patches no sign of a suitable fix.

93931
put	get
also dont forget to remove any hosts file bodgery you have put in place once you get it all working i dont know if thats relevant to dnsmasq never used it i have a similar but more complicated configuration in place using isc-bind name server which you can configure forwarding to other servers like you are using or simply use it as a non-forwarding dns server that does the full name resolution its self - which is what i have set up

93934
ecdsa	rsa
not every install of ssh out there supports ecdsa so you need rsa

93934
ecdsa	rsa
and since openssh prefers it over rsa i m guessing the developers think ecdsa is better

93943
bash	zsh
if you re using lftp you can use the tab key to do path completion similar to the same method used when in a shell such as bash or zsh

93944
vim	emacs
i m using vim but the same should apply to emacs

93962
put	get
sorry for my bad english what i mean is that i put this script starting on boot with the tool given with elementary os and if i turn on my pc 1 times per day and bing s image change one time per day the other times i just get everything black as wallpaper

93980
sudo	passwd
sudo is an interactive program requiring you to provide a passwd in order to run a command as root or another user if you have not recently put in your credentials

93984
postgresql	mysql
gammu-smsd is a program that periodically scans modem for received messages stores them in defined storage postgresql mysql database and also sends messages enqueued stored in a queue in this storage

94071
folder	directory
i have downloaded this script named pyaes.py and put it in a folder name codes inside a desktop directory of my linux

94089
chown	sudoers
run chown root root etc sudoers to fix

94096
centos	linux
they re running centos 6.2 6.3 alt linux 4.1

94107
chown	sudoers
alternatively you could boot the system into rescue mode should be an option at the grub prompt that will hopefully give you a root shellâ at which point you can just do chown root root etc sudoers

94114
chown	sudoers
if root has somehow gotten uid 1000 then it makes sense why chown root root etc sudoers set the ownership to 1000

94120
post	get
regarding the existance of this option this is not the traditional behaviour of a socket normally the socket handler s thread is woken up when the connection is accepted which is still after the three way handshake completes and for some protocols activity starts here an smtp server sends a 220 greeting line but for http the first message in the conversation is the web browser sending its get post etc line and until this happens the http server has no interest in the connection other than timing it out thus waking up the http process when the socket accept completes is a wasteful activity as the process will immediately fall asleep again waiting for the necessary data

94140
versioning	upgrade
you may need to upgrade to the versioning of parted in testing unstable

94147
smarthost	exim
since i have a local mailserver exim running anyways i wonder whether i can set it up in way so it delivers mail directly rather than sending it to a smarthost as it does now

94176
folder	directory
copy the folder into an install directory of your choice

94177
gmail	hotmail
but even then there are pitfalls to managing an email server send too many emails to hotmail yahoo gmail too quickly and you ll get blacklisted - meaning yo need to ensure that you ve got throttling in place

94183
gobject	dbus
i suspect that it may have something to do with the gobject or dbus subsystem

94187
icmp	udp
it looks like the opendns server at 208.67.220.220 sent my computer some kind of message by udp from port 53 and my computer tries to respond with an icmp code type 3 which my firewall blocks because i ve configured it to block icmp out with a few exceptions.

94191
width	height
www and hhh are the window width and height

94195
width	height
if the -g option is specified then four integer columns will follow x-offset y-offset width and height

94197
rpm	yum	dpkg	apt
generally speaking under linux usr is for programs provided by the distribution and managed by its package manager dpkg apt rpm yum emerge etc. and usr local is for programs installed and managed manually by the system administrator

94251
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux

94259
debian	linux
i have installed debian 6.0 os linux kernel 2.6.32 to test my usb application as well as driver

94265
ubuntu	centos
i looked on a centos 6.x system along with a ubuntu 12.04 system and neither had that parameter too

94275
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
also you can give -t keytype were keytype is dsa rsa or ecdsa if you have a preference as to which type of key to grab instead of the default

94329
mouse	keyboard
devices most likely get a file in dev input named eventn where n is the various devices like mouse keyboard jack power-buttons etc

94329
keydown	keyup
typically keydown keyup key-repeat key-code etc

94332
bash	zsh
alt + backspace works for me in bash and zsh

94343
installation	upgrade
if i have a fresh install of 5.9 i m able to upgrade to 6.4 without many issues using linux upgradeany on a installation cd

94344
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
apt is the package manager on debian ubuntu mint and other linux distributions

94375
put	get
if you put that line in etc rc.local it will get executed on startup you might want to give a full path for the binary

94378
bash	zsh
possible duplicate of bash auto-completion feature for sshing into different hosts - with answers for bash and zsh shells or another answer for bash shell here

94397
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
works as with windows in linux mint ubuntu etc

94407
debian	linux
therefore some distributions like debian redhat suse arch etc. went to package a linux kernel the gnu tools and all kind of applications together for easy installation and maintenance

94407
freebsd	debian
for example you can have a debian system with freebsd or gnu-hurd as a kernel.

94447
tunnel	vpn
where i work we have a site-to-site vpn tunnel set up between our main data center and a third party data center that does some oracle paas for us

94454
folder	dir
the group which now has access to mark home dir is thus the same group as gid of michael hence the michael is now allowed to create delete files folder in mark s home dir

94455
chown	chgrp
when you use chown in a manner that changes only the group then it acts the same as chgrp

94455
chown	chgrp
it works like that because both the chown and chgrp commands use the same underlying chown syscall which allows changing both owner and group

94455
chown	chgrp
the only difference between the chown and chgrp commands is the syntax you use to specify the change you want to make

94485
ubuntu	linux
i have a run.sh in a directory in ubuntu linux 12.04 lts

94496
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
these files are setup to be sourced by shells such as bash csh zsh or tcsh

94496
bash	zsh
files with the extension .sh are sourced by shells such as bash and zsh

94496
jobs	cron
yes but what about cron jobs

94502
stdout	stderr
if you want to take the output from stdout and re-direct it to stderr

94504
unix	bsd	stdout	stderr
every unix linux bsd process has 3 standard inputs and outputs 0 is stdin 1 is stdout 2 is stderr

94532
ubuntu	debian
it is packaged as similarity-tester in debian and ubuntu

94542
apache	nginx
yes you can all of shared host uses one ip and shared via apache or nginx some of them define an alias ip in etc hosts

94544
x86	64bit
hyper-v formerly windows server virtualization is a hypervisor for 64bit x86 platforms by microsoft

94568
overwrite	preserve
when i need to publish the public key to a remote system all of the how-to web pages suggest either overwrite destroying existing keys or append which is good preserve existing keys

94578
udp	tcp
is there any way to test accurate 1gb packet transfer live from pc1 to pc2 over tcp or udp and do a full-duplex test if the kernel is not causing frozen or crash

94626
sudo	passwd
as a privileged user i am trying to set the sudo passwd to another then the one used at login

94626
sudo	passwd
sudo has an option to ask for root passwd instead of invoked user passwd rootpw but sharing root passwd is definitely not an option that is why we set up sudo

94626
sudo	passwd
the closest solution i have found is to only allow ssh private key and setup pass-phrase with a key which differs from the sudo login passwd

94627
sudo	passwd
the purpose of the sudo passwd prompt is to ensure that the person issuing the sudo command is the same person that is logged in and the easiest way to do that is to ask for the currently logged in user to re-authenticate themselves

94627
sudo	passwd
in other words the purpose of the sudo passwd prompt is not to establish authority it is to establish identity

94629
google-chrome	safari
linux x86_64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 27.0.1453.110 safari 537.36

94645
filesystems	hfs+
well having used the in-kernel hfs+ filesystems driver before and

94646
sudoers	passwd
if you want to ask for the root passwd as opposed to the user s passwd there are options that you can put in etc sudoers

94646
sudo	passwd
you can change that include common-auth line and have pam and thus sudo use an alternate passwd source

94646
sudo	passwd
now to sudo i must use passwd instead of my real login passwd

94646
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for anthony p a s s w o r d return

94656
bash	zsh
with grep assuming the columns are tab separated here using the ksh93 zsh bash quotes

94684
kde	gnome
uninstall kde and gnome you can reinstall after

94684
kde	gnome
install kde and gnome or whatever desktop you will be using if any

94695
sudo	passwd
if someone can get your ssh passwd they can probably also get the alternate sudo passwd so you re better off investing time into making your connections more secure than spending time just making things more complicated just for the illusion of more security

94717
sudo	passwd
but when i use sudo to execute commands it needs passwd so i can t use sudo any more

94717
sudo	passwd
is there any solution that i can use sudo again another question is how to forbid passwd login both in ssh and console but keep sudo passwd auth available

94763
kde	gnome
you could also switch to kde at least temporarily as the bug and forum thread both point to gnome as the source of the problem

94763
kde	gnome
then switch to kdm default is gdm which will work with kde as well but you probably need to skip anything gnome related for now

94765
ubuntu	linux
baseon your uname -a you look to be running a pretty old version of ubuntu 2.6.35-22-server is the linux kernel version

94765
ubuntu	debian
you might want to check out the kitware site to see if a newer version is available as a binary installation or try the .deb file from a newer version of ubuntu debian

94793
bash	zsh
zsh sets it to 1 bash sets it to 130

94793
bash	zsh
launch zsh or bash

94802
rpm	yum
what are the commands to add a yum rpm repo so i can update the curl version if this makes sense

94808
bash	zsh
but there s another similar problem if you suspend a command you ll get exit status 20 zsh 5.0.7 or 148 bash and zsh 5.0.7

94816
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux ubuntu machine for my htpc

94822
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
in a general-purpose distribution like fedora ubuntu debian arch linux etc. pretty much any software can go

94825
bash	zsh
in bash ksh or zsh typeset -f lists functions with their definitions

94825
bash	zsh
â¹ exception a few builtins called special builtins cannot be shadowed by a function â bash and zsh don t comply with posix on that point in their default mode though

94827
mint	live-cd	debian	mint	debian	linux
my linux mint debian edition installation worked well until i used a live-cd to boot and then copied some files back and forth to and between the hard drive and a usb device

94828
folder	directory
this should reset the permissions of all files and folder in your home directory

94829
filesystems	fat
an usb device usually contains some windows fat filesystems which does not know about users and permissions

94837
rar	gzip
for example one starts like gzip compressed data â another starts like rar archive data v1d os unixâ another starts like compress d data 16 bitsâ

95853
sudo	passwd
also how does the sudo program behave when neither the root nor the calling user have passwd

95853
sudoers	passwd
i tried it and it didn t even ask me for a passwd it just worked since i have that line in my sudoers file should i change that

95854
sudo	passwd
sudo can be configured to not ask any passwd

95857
sudo	passwd
also how does the sudo program behave when neither the root nor the calling user have passwd

95857
sudoers	passwd
i tried it and it didn t even ask me for a passwd it just worked since i have that user all all all line in my sudoers file should i change that

95857
sudo	passwd
yes without passwd using sudo becomes more difficult

95857
sudo	passwd
see this u l q a titled set sudo passwd differently from login one

95860
vmware	virtualbox
when i tried to restore it in vmware or virtualbox to a virtual disk there were a lot of write errors

95862
vmware	virtualbox
the .img files appear to be usable by virtualbox and or vmware

95862
vmware	virtualbox
according to this article titled converting a clonezilla image to a virtualbox kvm or vmware virtual machine image

95890
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	mint	centos	mint	centos	linux
i use linux mint ubuntu as well as centos

95898
redhat	fedora
on of possible reasons for that bug - incorrect selinux policies but according to redhat bugtracker such errors were fixed in fedora 17 18

95900
ubuntu	centos
if you check in rhel centos 5.x the default permission is 700 but in ubuntu it is 755

95904
bash	zsh
in bash ksh93 or zsh you can use recursive globbing instead of find

95904
bash	zsh
note that in bash but not in ksh or zsh recurses through symbolic links to directories

95905
disk	ram
also you may get better results if you preload the video into the disk cache or to read 123mb starting at offset 456mb â â but unless you have a lot of ram the compilation is likely to claim the cache space back

95914
filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs permission model doesn t map one-to-one with the traditional unix-style filesystems permissions

95914
filesystems	ntfs
but by and large i wouldn t plan on observing parity between ntfs and traditional unix-style filesystems permissions

95925
sudo	passwd
i assume that you re refering to the second meaning you ve made these accounts impossible to log in with a passwd but still accessible via ssh with a key or with sudo

95925
sudo	passwd
if you ve disabled the passwd for your account you will no longer be able to use sudo

95925
sudo	passwd
you have a grace period during which sudo isn t prompting you again for your passwd

95925
sudo	passwd
after that unless you ve changed the default configuration in an unusual way sudo will prompt you for your passwd which you will be unable to enter since there is no more passwd

95925
sudo	passwd
for your account pick a shorter passwd that you can memorize disable passwd for ssh logins optional and type your passwd to sudo to become root

95927
apache	nginx
you can use apache but for such a fast simple task nginx is popular

95932
chown	chmod
it combines cp with chown chmod and strip

95941
bash	tcsh
the reason i suspect this is a tcsh shell is that when i run the command usr bin time in a bash shell the output looks like this

95952
bash	zsh
i m fairly new to zsh shifted yesterday from bash

95953
debian	linux
i have access to some debian linux vps servers however i cannot access their controls panel directly only server administrator himself can do that

95953
xen	openvz
i need it only to know which kernel header package should i install xen openvz or any other

95967
debian	linux
as naftuli tzvi kay asked about debian above beginning with debian 6 your script should contain a lsb linux standards base header which indicates its dependencies and capabilities see debian wiki page

95999
cpu	processors
so the hardware name is the cpu architecture while the processors type is the name of the instruction set used

96001
debian	mint
first of all don t add mint repositories to debian not a good idea

96001
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
mint is based on ubuntu which while based on debian is not 100 compatible with debian repositories

96001
debian	mint	debian	linux
instead add lmde linux mint debian edition repositories

96014
ubuntu	linux
question one do ubuntu and redhat or all linux in general use the same drivers

96014
ethernet	wireless
i haven t tested ethernet but the wireless works

96016
ethernet	wireless
network ethernet wireless

96023
ubuntu	linux
question one do ubuntu and redhat or all linux in general use the same drivers

96023
ati	nvidia
there are some exceptions to that -- ati and nvidia make a show of distributing their own ogl drivers and where they work they should be optimal although this can be more of a hassle than it is worth

96023
ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora
redhat repackages fedora like ubuntu repackages debian

96023
ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora
whereas debian is more conservative in it s approach than ubuntu hence less frequent updating fedora is more radical than redhat hence more frequent updating

96038
children	parent
but a fork can create multiple children for the same process so that makes me think that there is a tree structure because multiple processes will point to one parent process

96040
children	parent
one of the many things that come into play when deciding such a thing is for example what happens once the parent process exits - on unix the init process adopts orphaned processes with all of their children processes

96042
ubuntu	linux
i have what i can consider a big bug on nautilus under ubuntu linux

96042
ubuntu	linux
open nautilus in ubuntu linux

96043
vim	emacs
vim should work or emacs

it should be pretty easy to take the source rpm srpm versioning of the package providing cifs apply the patch recompile and upgrade to it

96051
redhat	fedora
i can share an experience i had with fedora redhat with the networking setup

96058
ifs	dash
in normal bourne-style shells such as the bourne shell dash ksh and bash the syntax means â œtake the value of the variable split it into separate words where characters from ifs appear and treat each word as a file name wildcard pattern and expand it if it matches one of more fileâ

96058
bash	zsh
your bash function doesn t cope with whitespace in file names and using in zsh wouldn t either

96058
bash	zsh
here s a different way of parsing the argument that works in both bash and zsh and copes with any character except in a file name

96078
debian-based	linux
if you want to rename all files and the directory in one go you can use the rename command which at least on debian-based linux distributions is included with the perl package

96107
for-loop	arrays
gawk provides since 4.0 thx manatwork true multi-dimensional arrays though the man page imho misdirects a little immediately after introducing if i j in arrays it follows with the in construct may also be used in a for-loop to iterate over all the elements of an arrays

96136
ubuntu	debian
while i know that ubuntu 12.04 is lts and will be supported until april 2017 i d like to know what the projected support lifetime of debian wheezy will be

96137
next	except
the security team tries to support a stable distribution for about one year after the next stable distribution has been released except when another stable distribution is released within this year

96152
ubuntu	linux
i would like to convert to linux ubuntu at first

96155
xfce	gnome
you ll likely run into issues with much of the configuration files that are stored in the user s home directory for the setup of the windowing environment xfce gnome etc.

96156
debian-based	ubuntu
as chrunchbang is like ubuntu a debian-based distribution most programs should find their configuration files

96160
width	height
i know i could wget the image and then use imagemagick to determine the height and width of the image

96167
width	height
to run it type and you will get the height and width of the image

96170
gif	png
i ll describe some of the more common ones png jpeg jfif and gif

ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu question here

96179
xfce	cinnamon
the only way i have been able to install cinnamon 2 on my linux mint 15 cinnamon and xfce editions was to remove the base linux mint repository

96185
stdout	stderr
the arguments to cut are -d -f 9 and the whole command has its stderr output redirected to stdout by 2 1

96185
unix	bsd
cat etc passwd put the contents of the file etc passwd the well-known unix linux bsd file that defines a user id s characteristics on its stdout

96203
bash	tcsh
i ve read determining path to sourced shell script but the answers focus on bash and tcsh and fail if a posix shell is used

96209
debian	linux
note this is run on a debian linux environment

96216
ubuntu	debian
if that does not exist then install the appropriate library package libbz2-dev on debian ubuntu

96221
xfce	gnome
this post also suggest that there s no update manager gui for xfce i don t use it myself so you either will be working with unattended-upgrades or pull update-manager-gnome which as far i see doesn t have any gnome dependency

96225
rpm	yum
and then use either rpm or yum to install the bundled rpm files

96238
bash	zsh
if requiring bash or ksh93 or zsh is good enough you can use this snippet

96238
bash	zsh
the only reliable way to locate a sourced script is to use bash ksh93 or zsh

96249
put	get
the help link under apropos offers some info to get a copy of the script to put on your own server with links to download the man page collections

versioning	upgrade
upgrade the current versioning but sudo apt-get install tells me i have the most recent versioning

96286
gentoo	linux
my linux is gentoo my locale is echo lang en_us.utf-8

96300
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu 12.04 though i d imagine this question spans all linux variants

96304
ubuntu	debian
i would first see if there is a newer version of zlib in one of the ubuntu debian repositories which contain all the software that you can install prebuilt for ubuntu debian and other oses that derive from either of those 2 distros

96305
bash	tcsh
this is confusing since i am running tcsh but the commands are interpreted by bash

96307
unix	bsd
this should work on most recent unix linux with a ps that supports the bsd syntax

96361
ubuntu	linux
after disabling 5 ghz wireless wps 802.11 n automatic channel selection and setting security to wpa2 only i m now able to get a connection within seconds in both ubuntu and windows and a very sketchy connection as in 30 seconds connectivity every few minutes with wpa_supplicant with an up-to-date arch linux

96369
redhat	fedora
that directory is a redhat fedora rhel directory so i wouldn t expect it to be on any other distributions of linux

there is also a discussion on this subject in mac os x and ios internals to the apple s core by jonathan levin in chapter 16 to b -tree or not to be - the hfs+ filesystems

96510
freebsd	linux
coming from a freebsd world i wish to make the linux terminal behave like freebsd one especially the 9.1 version basically when you type cd in the terminal and push the up arrow you can browse all the commands in the history starting with cd which makes you gain a lot time

96510
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
i don t know how to enable this feature in linux debian or centos which force me to type the whole could someone please help

96511
bash	tcsh
many shells including bash and tcsh use readline for command line editing

96533
folder	directory
i ve tried the following command but it doesn t do a whole directory automatically and doesn t increment the folder number automatically

96549
freebsd	linux
what s happening is that freebsd and linux use different shells by default

96549
bash	tcsh
freebsd defaults to tcsh which had better interactive features than bash in the past but bash has caught up but markedly worse scripting features

96549
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
instead of bash and tcsh you could switch to zsh which has some neat features not found in other shells

96549
put	get
to get up and down like you had in tcsh put the following lines in .zshrc

96549
bash	zsh
if you d like to use the same shell everywhere you can use bash or zsh on freebsd too provided that the port is installed again ask your system administrator

96552
folder	directory
reading your reply in the comments it sounds like you are possibly trying to copy the root folder my device won t boot using the copied directory

96570
kde	gnome
if so - is there a tool that can work with most desktop environment frameworks gnome kde ... that could query list the widget names of a running gui app but without using the accessibility technologies layer

96574
folder	directory
this is very close to the so how to extract only a specific folder from a zipped archive to a given directory

96603
integer	unsigned
epoch is a single generally small unsigned integer which is included to allow mistakes in the version numbers of older versions of a package

96608
lsof	pstree
on solaris there s no such thing as pstree or lsof out-of-the-box

96631
udp	tcp
dns knows nothing of which applications are querying it only that a service opened up a port at host connection to it assuming tcp or sent a udp packet to the bind server and the bind server replied with a response to this mystery application over that same connection

96643
filesystems	xfs
as of linux 3.10 the namespaces support is basically complete the major missing thing apparently being support in xfs a filesystems

96646
ubuntu	debian
udev will take care of mounting things like usb sticks cameras and flash cards in ubuntu systems but not in less user friendly distros like debian slackware etc

96646
sudoers	passwd
what is more with sudoers is that you can mount devices and shares transparently - even without providing a passwd if you choose to do so be extra careful about that

96647
dpkg	apt
another technique is to look through the .list files that are maintained by dpkg which is the workhorse that actually does the package installations under the hood for synaptic and apt

96653
bash	zsh
bash 4 has a fantastic option called globstar that emulates was stolen from zsh s syntax for globbing across multiple directories

96653
bash	zsh
i think i ve read that zsh s implementation is more flexible and doesn t have this problem but unfortunately i can t just switch to zsh because we source a lot of bash scripts at my workplace and i don t have the time or the know-how to convert all of them to zsh and keep them up-to-date

96653
zsh	subshell	bash	zsh	bash	subshell
i suppose it might be possible to start a bash subshell source the desired script then somehow backport all the changed env vars aliases functions etc into zsh but i m not sure how to do that either.

96659
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql by ulogd is easy and then you can create such accounting

96661
children	parent
on late 2.6.x you can mostly guess by the the parent pid being 0 for that often will have pid 2 and all threads will be its children init may have ppid 0 too

96663
debian	linux
i m trying to install slime on a debian wheezy distro 64 bit called crunchbang trying to install common lisp followed this tutorial although the title says it s for windows i installed it on linux and slime seems to work perfectly or so i think

96674
put	get
the easiest way to get this is going to be to get two new disks put then in the nas and have the nas create a new array on them

96675
cinnamon	gedit
when you type cinnamon or gnome-shell or gedit or any other x app a.k.a

96694
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout stderr are some integers that index into a data structure which knows which i o channels are to be used for the process

96712
put	get
i have this script and i need to count the lines inside a file then pass the number of lines counted to a for-loop so that i can get the contents of each line and put it in a variable

96724
cat	tee
yes there s cat foo bar | something for having both foo and bar as inputs and there s tee for outputs

96740
stdout	stderr
grep that print errors to stderr and the expected output to stdout

96761
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
but my eventual solution was to use gnome2 mate eventually replacing ubuntu altogether with the linux mint distro

96763
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
debian is the base linux distribution that ubuntu derives derived from so both distributions make use of the same type of packages

96766
ubuntu	mint
i tested this with an ubuntu 13.10 partition but it should equally work for mint

96799
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox only and some other programs like gvim or google-chrome which make special provisions for storing state in failure a simple

96807
stdout	stderr
gnupg also has options to report status data on other file descriptors so you can have the payload output on stdout error messages on stderr and status information on another file descriptor

96812
bash	zsh
zsh doesn t implement all of bash s features â â almost all of bash s functionality exists in zsh but sometimes with an incompatible syntax

96812
bash	zsh
you could also try to run the scripts wih ksh93 versions since 93o+ support like in zsh and most but again not all of bash s features are from ksh so your scripts may be easy to port to ksh93

96812
bash	zsh
switching to ksh has the additional benefit that it tends to be faster than either bash or zsh

96813
post	get
searching regarding this turned up several forum post such as this one titled i can t get l2tp ipsec + psk vpn working with samsung chromebook

96828
installation	upgrade
in ubuntu we can upgrade from text-mode installation to gui desktop environment by installing ubuntu-desktop package

96830
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
unfortunately that s somewhat more complex to answer as debian can be installed with various desktops gnome kde xfce lmde or even no desktop instead installing a bare window manager such as twm

96830
cinnamon	gnome
cinnamon installs the cinnamon desktop a gnome fork principally used by the linux mint distro

96832
ubuntu	debian
this is kind of the difference between ubuntu and debian if you want just the one standard desktop go with ubuntu

96858
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
redhat has spawned centos very popular server os scientific linux and fedora of course there are others

96858
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
debian has spawned ubuntu which has spawned mint and others

96876
put	get
if i put it in a file i get four or five empty lines about the number of lines in the output of ls

96881
pop-up	dialog
for example i can t see anything in the file properties dialog or in the pop-up that occur when doing file operations etc

96927
bash	zsh
the above should work in any bourne-like shell ksh ash dash bash zsh et cetera

i have a similar issue with a microsoft wheel mouse optical usb and ps 2 compatible since upgrading a linux mint debian edition system to kernel 3.10-2-amd64

96971
daemons	systemd
finally set the systemd so that the daemons ccpd starts correctly when turning on the printer

96971
daemons	launchd
if you used the automated installation using a bash script or you had already automated at startup as indicated in my askubuntu answer linked above the ccpd daemons will not take into account the two above conditions it is simply launchd every time with the pc

96990
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i haven t encountered this issue with ubuntu 12.04 lts or linux mint 13 xfce i used these on this same computer before deciding to use debian 7 wheezy as both these oses handled sound just fine so it s really becoming frustrating

97002
kde	gnome
most modern applications including all gtk â gnome and qt â kde applications use xft which performs the rendering client-side and sends an image to the server

97007
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
vmware fusion virtualbox and parallels desktop can all nicely virtualize most linux unix and windows os s

97009
centos	linux
i have installed linux centos 5.5

97017
bash	zsh
i m trying to configure zsh to closely fit how bash behaves before i fully switch and one behavior i m trying to modify in zsh is when it inserts a tab character

97048
ready	each
your dispatcher needs to know when each program is ready to read another line and there s no standard i m aware of which allows for that

97103
for-loop	loops
that still involves spawning a find command and use a slow while read loops so it will probably be slower than using the for-loop unless the list of files is huge

97103
bash	zsh
in my tests on a directory with 200.000 files with short names on ext4 the zsh one paragraph 2. is by far the fastest followed by the first simple loop though as usual bash is a lot slower than other shells for that

97124
freebsd	linux
i m implementing atomic writes fwiw in python on linux freebsd and i m writing to a temporary file in the same directory with the file i m planning to write to in order to ensure that they are on the same filesystem and thus rename 2 succeeds and writes can be atomic

97132
debian	linux
on my debian linux no login is possible on terminals 2 to 6

97145
tunnel	vpn
4 with vpn you also create an encrypted tunnel from your local host to your proxy server

97165
ubuntu	linux
i ve seen after a few hours of googling that ubuntu and other linux distro s run great on this very exact laptop

97200
rar	zip
i have a huge file that contains zips and rars with zip and rar files located within on a linux box

97200
rar	zip
i basically need a script or one-liner that will recursively hunt through the directories and unzip and unrar any rar or zip it finds

97214
folder	directory
i have some folder with account user openerp and i created new folder web_theme under this directory

97242
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu i am trying to send at commands to a modem at dev ttyacm0

97244
gentoo	linux
i want to check this by looking at the list of all system wide available ssl keys on a gentoo linux system

97246
chown	chmod
i would like to get warnings whenever the script program tries to write chmod chown or perform any other attempt that i disapprove of

97255
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
if your system supports dtrace solaris and derivatives freebsd oracle linux mac os x a dtrace script can log and even prevent the mentioned actions to the files you want by whatever user including root

97260
ubuntu	debian
no it is not safe ubuntu repositories are not compatible with debian

97265
disk	ram
also we can get a size value for kernel modules unclear whether it s their size from on disk or when in ram by pulling these values from proc modules

97277
bash	zsh
alternatively or in addition in bash and ksh and zsh but not plain sh you can specify a command that s executed in case a command returns a nonzero status with the err trap

97287
folder	directory
but when i try to run that command i get an error no such file or directory. sublime text 2 is in my applications folder -- but it looks like there is no bin folder in my home directory

97291
versioning	upgrade
for example the distribution may suggest to upgrade firefox versioning 23 to firefox versioning 24 bad example this is not a minor release but you get the idea

97292
kde	gnome
older systems used the generic xdm as the display manager newer desktop environments have their own display manager gdm3 for gnome kdm for kde cde-login for cde

97299
versioning	upgrade
i don t think there is any specific technical reason at all for using versioning upgrade and i doubt it would require much for a traditional versioning distro to convert to rolling release

97342
uniq	grep
grep error tmp file | sort | uniq -c | sort -r

97353

97354
ubuntu	debian
the ipcalc tool is slightly different on debian ubuntu but serves a similar function

97356
cinnamon	gnome
the full gnome unity cinnamon desktop is overkill but i find the minimalist tiling window managers just conflict with the way i use screen

97357
solaris	bsd
i ve never found a distro that didn t have it bsd solaris included

97364
vim	emacs
what s a terminal text editor or a vim emacs plugin with this feature

97388
chmod	rmdir	chmod	mkdir	rmdir	mkdir
it is easy to make a mistake when copying cp moving renaming mv removing rm rmdir creating dirs mkdir and changing file permissions chmod

97397
zsh	tcsh
or with zsh or ksh93 -g or with tcsh after set globstar globbing

97397
fish	bash
you can also do that with fish or bash -o globstar but beware that bash versions prior to 4.3 and fish follow symlinks when descending directories

97398
filesystems	btrfs
but there is for example filesystems which supports snapshots like btrfs

97423
folder	directory
the hierarchy is often emulated as a bunch of folder in one directory with the name reflecting the hierarchy getting there

97440
bash	zsh
you can write it instead ksh zsh bash syntax

97445
dpkg	apt
dpkg error processing var cache apt archives rsync_3.0.9-4_armhf.deb --unpack

97450
disk	ram
my system configuration is 256mb ram 80gb hard disk pentium 4 2.40gz

97463
kde	gnome
install gnome my preference you can do kde if you want via yum groupinstall desktop

97479
mp3	flac
i am attempting to create a variable rate mp3 from a flac using the following command

97486
put	get
then to get only a delta of the inbox and put it in the correct dated snapshot at a location that makes sense run

97519
daemons	systemd
needing a systemd daemons to support this is ok and other schemes like ftp or scp would be ok too does not have to be http s

97554
ubuntu	linux
hello i wanted to switch to linux but the only distro so far i could even boot from a live usb was ubuntu

97559
pull	push
note cloning push and pull operations could done instead but the code needs to compile on the virtual machine os and not on the host machine -- long story it has to be this way

97569
bash	zsh
zsh with versions prior to 5.1 in bash or sh emulation

97569
bash	zsh
and are not needed in bash or ksh or the sh of freebsd 9.3 or newer where the command is somehow parsed like some sort of assignment nor zsh where word splitting and filename generation is not done implicitly upon variable expansion

97569
bash	zsh
if the export local command name itself is quoted even in part like or even the quotes around are needed in the cases above and also in bash as well as zsh all versions when in sh emulation

97569
bash	zsh
in the case of however pdksh and derivatives the quotes are not needed in bash at t ksh and zsh they are in pdksh and derivatives

97583
vim	gedit
you can override the editor by setting one of the environment variables mentioned above with the name of an editor to use such as vim or gedit for example

97594
bash	zsh
here using ksh zsh or bash syntax

97601
sysv	systemd
the reaction was a little like the reaction to systemd -- while there are a lot of good reasons for it these were largely meaningless in many contexts and for users who were comfortable with the sysv style init scripts it seemed a pointless hassle esp

97606
xfce	kde
the user may pick another desktop environment such as kde or xfce but that would not be the default

97606
kde	gnome
gnome or kde

97617
ubuntu	linux
how can i access these network drives from the command line in linux ubuntu and red hat

97620
freebsd	linux
linux has the magic sysrq key to reboot frozen machines remotely and it works over the serial console but what about freebsd

97639
kde	gnome
i know you asked about command line tools but the file manager of your windowing environment also might have the ability to connect to a windows file share too the dolphin file manager on kde can do this and nautilus on gnome can do this as well

97641
ssid	wlan
we have a mesh network here in my town where every node creates the same client wlan with the ssid kiel.freifunk.net

97648
bsd	aix
stat is available on most unixes osx bsd not aix from what i can find

97649
debian	linux
it runs a variety of linux distros including a variant of debian with access to a wide variety of packages

97692
hide	show
bash behaves better in this case it will show both file and file2 without adding a space but any solution that does not hide possible matches would also be interesting

97702
postgresql	mysql
ideally this is just a bonus point it would store information into some sql database such as mysql or postgresql which would allow to execute arbitrary select statements in order to obtain custom reports for example monitor all the activity coming from a single ip or extract a list of all ips using a specific service

97709
debian	linux
when i am trying to copy the program and running it in linux debian

97722
ubuntu	linux
i set the bios to legacy mode with secure boot option disabled and booted into the live usb which i had been able to install linux with backbox 3.09 which is based in ubuntu 12.04

97752
udp	tcp
i have a process which listen to 2 ports 45136 tcp and 37208 udp actually i assume it is the same process

97775
stdout	stderr
output to stdout goes to and output to stderr goes to

97784
put	get
it is a good practice to put it into double quotes in order to get the actual value of the argument shell will skip interpreting the special characters in the argument if there are any

97807
spaces	linefeed
tells grep to include white spaces tab spaces cr linefeed if there are any at the end of the current line

97840
for-loop	loops
one way can be to keep the original file names in a file in the same directory and instead of reading the files in a for-loop you can use the following while loops to read the file names and add the time stamp to the names

97853
cpython	pypy
could fail2ban be run under pypy instead of cpython with minimal nonstandard wizardry the os is raspbian 7 so mostly debian 7

97864
mouse	keyboard
now the problem is that mouse and keyboard are not working

97864
mouse	keyboard
even though i installed desktop the mouse and keyboard are not working

97864
mouse	keyboard
but mouse and keyboard are enumerating

97864
mouse	keyboard
the lsusb command is showing the usb mouse and keyboard

97887
jobs	cron
the difference lies in the fact that at is occasional while cron being so repetitive is more suited for system jobs which really need to be executed forever at fixed intervals in fact at gives you your own environment with your own settings and choices of environment variable while cron uses a minimal set of environment variables just check the difference in path as an example

97900
jobs	cron
you can execute batch jobs in unix linux using any one of the three commands â at batch or cron

97902
google-chrome	safari

i just switched from gnome 2 to xfce 4 so i have still to find my way around how xfce works.

97931
folder	directory
from servera i shared directory u001 app oracle folder and trying to mount this on severb under media

97936
stdout	stderr
started with still has it s stdin stdout and stderr connected to the terminal it was started in

97936
stdout	stderr
you may of course redirect stdout and stderr to a file or to dev null to prevent the background-job from writing to the terminal

97936
stdout	stderr
even if it was manually started from a terminal a daemon will be disconnected from the terminal so it can neither write stdout stderr nor read stdin it

97936
children	parent	child-process	spawn
when this happens the parent creates a child-process identical to itself using the fork system-call - and immediately goes back to waiting for another event and maybe spawn more children

97936
stdout	stderr
it s often a good idea to redirect stdout and stderr to a file or to dev null though

97971
sysv	systemd
some of services run by process manager such as upstart systemd openrc your case sysv and so on

97974

i ve decided to switch to elementary os luna fork of ubuntu 12.04 as my main linux distro

98015
kde	kubuntu
i am on a kubuntu machine and sometimes reach another xubuntu machine over ssh and launch some kde apps from there these apps look really weird while the gtk apps look normal

98018
sudo	passwd
everything works okay but i want to have possibility to run applications as the root user without providing the root passwd just like sudo in the terminal

98021
bash	zsh
assuming gnu grep with pcre support and a shell supporting process substitution like ksh93 zsh or bash

98044
bash	zsh
you could always do assuming gnu date and bash ksh93 zsh

98075
ubuntu	linux
in amazon linux ami it s not ubuntu

98088
ubuntu	debian
if not to make it the default usually already the case on debian and derivative like ubuntu

98114
bash	zsh
with bash zsh and ksh processsubstitution

98149
sudo	passwd
in dolphin when clicking on the icon belonging to my home user partition a pop-up asked me for my sudo passwd

98149
sudo	passwd
the passwd i entered was not my regular sudo passwd but the passwd that belongs to the live dvd

98151
sudo	passwd
when you booted this live dvd and provided the passwd to sudo that was the passwd of the live distro and not your own

98155
gentoo	debian
if you want a normal distro that can connect to the internet and has a gui dsl has both these things mind you and some basic configuration tools etc go for debian or arch or gentoo

98156
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
the other one is when the bash is not available by default in some oses mostly unix like aix solaris so the shell history feature is not available so the way you get the past commands by setting the shell editor to vi and esc ctrl + k or ctrl + l

98162
redhat	fedora
disclaimer i work for redhat on fedora but not on the installer team.

98167
ubuntu	mint
you can get ubuntu debs which should work for mint as well here

98167
debian-based	ubuntu
ubuntu software center installed by default on ubuntu systems but can also be installed on other debian-based distros

98167
debian	mint	debian	linux	debian-based	linux	debian-based	mint
mint software manager mintinstall installed by default on mint systems including linux mint debian but can also be installed on other debian-based distros

98175
versioning	upgrade
the other half of the argument is that ubuntu provides a tool to upgrade your system without touching your data that is only available to switch between lts versioning not your case and to move to the next release exactly your case

98194
centos	linux
i ve got a linux box running fedora 19 that i want to move to centos 6.4

98194
put	get
rather than trying to do something fancy with the current disk which has also accumulated a lot of sludge over the years i m going to get a new disk put centos on that and then move the to-be-preserved bits of stuff from the old disk to the new one

98216
ubuntu	linux
i recently had to change my linux work environment from a personal ubuntu system having full admin rights to a corporate red hat system having very limited control on the system

98268
apache	nginx
load balancing apache tomcat with nginx

98268
apache	nginx
nginx is just one type of web browser you could just as easily use apache or something else to provide the frontend layer

98293
disk	ram
this warning typically indicates that there is a problem with your ram disk

98293
disk	ram
once there you should be able to recreate your ram disk

98293
disk	ram
you may need to configure your options by editing etc mkinitcpio.conf before creating the ram disk

98330
cvs	svn
if they are under some outdated revision control system svn cvs convert the source base

98330
feedback	review
the review feedback can be given by committing and pushing your changes and the others can just do a graphical diff to see what your comments where per file or for a bunch of files

98355
sudoers	visudo
sudoers file has which passes a visudo -c check and has no other apache_usr lines

98416
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
depending on use and how comfortable you are with linux command line i d suggest looking at crunchbang linux it s still based on debian as ubuntu is so the command line is much the same but it uses the openbox desktop environment which is very lightweight

98427
post	get
once a deb package get installed a post installation script get executed

98429
tunnel	vpn
in researching that i came across vpn bonding which explains how to bond multiple ssh tunnel with ifenslave in balance-rr mode

98450
ethernet	wireless
you will thus need drivers for ethernet possibly wireless various usb components and so on

98451
dpkg	aptitude
since you want to check that an install and not an upgrade has gone well you can count the number of files in var lib dpkg info before and after the aptitude run

98455
daemons	systemd
syslog daemons can serve as loggers for multiple systemd

98456
filtering	grouping
then i need some command that can filtering grouping and show them but only the category name

98470
bash	zsh
at least bash and zsh do

98480
wav	flac	wav	ogg	flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
the following command will print the folders that don t contain any music file here music file means has an extension mp3 flac ogg wav or m4a but feel free to add some more

98528
rpm	yum
installing the rpm fusion repo requires another yum repo called epel - extra packages for enterprise linux

98528
mp3	wav
how do i convert a wav file to mp3 format using sox

98534
sudo	passwd
so the big take away is that the method used to become root sudo -i is advantages over the others because you use your own passwd to do so protecting root s passwd from needing to be given out

98544
debian	linux
do note that the actual application file is not in that directory i m not sure how this works in debian linux

98578
bash	tcsh
how can i configure csh or tcsh to show available choices by pressing tab twice just like bash

98587
bash	zsh
you should be using bash zsh ksh or something else entirely

98602
png	tga
encoding from multiple input image files jpeg png tga etc.

98636
ubuntu	debian
this functionality is provided by installing the debian ubuntu package command-not-found

98667
mouse	keyboard
after opening a terminal with my mouse ctrl-alt-t doesn t work and i haven t checked the keyboard shortcut yet. i typed in grub-install but it complains command not found

98672
wav	flac
supported input formats wav flac ape wavpack true audio tta

98672
wav	flac	wav	ogg	flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
supported out formats flac wav wavpack aac ogg or mp3

98688
udp	tcp
there are many types you ve probably heard of tcp or perhaps udp packets

98691
jobs	cron
does running cron jobs like that where the scripts they run are not resource intensive have a non-neglible negative impact on performance stability or anything else

98693
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and debian

98694
jobs	cron
to answer the question in the title no most system do not experience much of a burden from running cron jobs

98694
jobs	cron
much of the automated tasks that occur on a modern unix system are kicked off by cron jobs

98694
jobs	cron
things such as rotating logs and regenerating index files used by man are all kicked off via cron jobs

98707
chown	mount	chown	chmod
how can i mount a share so that a the share is run on boot b that i can control things like chown chmod from the client

98708
ubuntu	debian
gethostip -d name.domain from the syslinux package on ubuntu and probably debian

98719
anjuta	kdevelop	codeblocks	anjuta	codeblocks	kdevelop
also check out this q a from programmers se site titled comparison of ides for c++ and c development on linux kdevelop eclipse netbeans codeblocks and anjuta closed

98743
put	get
basically i would like to put in a pdf word document compressed file or anything else and get the text it contains out

98745
folder	directory
i miss every file and folder that were in the vhosts directory chroot default fs and fs-passwd

98747
sudo	nohup
try prefixing the command with nohup as in sudo nohup usr local tomcat bin startup.sh

98752
unix	bsd
bsd linux and unix all basically follow it

98759
put	get
you can either get rid of the symlink at home jzhu other and create a directory in it s place or put them in a shared location somewhere else on the system without knowing what it is i can t recommend a good location though

98765
folder	directory
the r-s means that any files or directory created inside this folder will have the group automatically set to the group group

98775
solaris	sunos
sun and at t worked to combine sunos and svr3 and that became svr4 and solaris 2

98775
sysv	systemd
so when that web site says on sysv unix bin traditionally has been a symlink to usr bin they really should have said on systemd v release 4 and followons ...

98802
debian	linux
the first one is for debian and derivatives the second one for arch linux fedora and in general systemd systems

98832
subnet	vlan
my lan interface on the linux router is eth1 so i created a vlan called eth1.2 and gave it an ip in a separate subnet

98837
spaces	delimiter
the awk delimiter can be a regular expression so if you want to split the line on say spaces and slashes you can use

98887
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
debian and derivatives ubuntu mint etc use usr bin x-terminal-emulator which is a symlink managed by debian s alternatives system so that it always points to the system s preferred terminal emulator

98887
rhel	slackware
that doesn t help you with rhel fedora slackware or many other distributions but you can check for the existence usr bin x-terminal-emulator first when implementing radu s answer

98912
unix	solaris
most if not all remaining unix and unix like releases including solaris 11 do provide a posix compatible shell as bin sh because posix mandates the sh command to launch a posix shell not the legacy bourne shell which is not compliant

98912
bash	zsh
a modified bash on os x though it used to be zsh

98929
ubuntu	linux
see my answer to this question titled can t play dvds on linux ubuntu laptop

98932
stdout	stderr
cron typically has a default user that get s any output that is generated on the stdout or stderr already

98934
octal	decimal
is the shell internal arithmetic expansion operator note that it supports decimal octal and hexadecimal numbers

98934
bash	zsh
if you need floating point support that s where you ll need a different shell like ksh93 or zsh not bash as bash only supports integer arithmetic though you could also use awk

98950
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
if you re looking to do just base conversions between hex octal dec i usually use the binary calculator command line tool bc to do such things

98956
unix	bsd
despite the efforts to widen its audience the fhs is mostly relevant only to linux distributions and ignored by bsd and commercial unix vendors see this posting

98957
rpm	yum
this software was installed from source and is not part of an rpm or yum install

98985
spaces	linefeed
also s s may not be on all systems if yours doesn t recognize it you can use a literal spaces or if you want spaces and tab those in a bracket expression or the character class note that strictly speaking s is equivalent to and includes vertical spacing characters as well like cr linefeed or vt which you probably don t care about

98999
udp	tcp
you ll want to understand that and to know that the -u option lets you use udp instead of the default tcp

99006
daemons	systemd
processes started at systemd startup by etc rc are assigned to the daemons login class

99009
sudo	passwd
allows the user to run the passwd command on any machine and on any terminal â â sudo doesn t care about that

99011
integer	unsigned
the ipv4 dotted decimal address can be stored into a 32-bit unsigned integer and bitwise operations are efficiently performed by network hardware

99013
pull	push
stream relay support for distributed streaming push pull models

99022
versioning	upgrade
again i don t want to upgrade or change the versioning of python

99032
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i installed mailutils on my linux machine with linux mint 15 basically ubuntu 13.04

99039
filesystems	ntfs
it s apparently not possible to reduce the size of this vhd using standard hyper-v tools because the filesystems used by the ubuntu vm is not ntfs

99043
ubuntu	debian
the udev rules debian ubuntu source package and ubuntu ppa are maintained here

99045
filesystems	hfs+
i am transferring a large number of files on a hfs+ filesystems

99065
ubuntu	linux
under linux ubuntu 12.04 i want to mount a windows share windows partition named winshared on the network

99084
gentoo	linux
while i originally wanted to entirely replace the linux distribution my nas uses i meanwhile came to the conclusion that it would be better to leave the existing system as unmodified as possible and merely supplement it via gentoo or arch linux - which is basically what the answer to the previous question suggested

99084
gentoo	linux
now i can simply ssh into the host via port 22222 and end up in the chroot environment which basically behaves like gentoo linux and this script can be run from the host s etc init.d rcs

99084
gentoo	linux
what gentoo command should chroot execute in order to properly boot the gentoo linux on top of the host linux with as little interference as possible

99084
daemons	systemd
the host systemd is running these daemons plus my thoughts so far

99088
debian	linux
i m running raspbmc which is running a minimal linux distribution based on debian

99093
bash	zsh
with zsh in case you don t have to use bash since it supports floating point numbers internally

99104
ubuntu	debian
i am using debian wheezy stable and before used ubuntu 12.04

99134
bash	zsh
in ash zsh pdksh bash the bourne shell is 128 + n

99134
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
csh tcsh and fish same as the bourne shell except that the status is in instead of note that zsh also sets for compatibility with csh in addition to

99134
bash	zsh
maybe for completeness we should mention zsh s and bash s arrays that contain the exit status of the components of the last pipeline

99142
ubuntu	linux
if i have to install rhel or ubuntu or any linux distribution in these hard disks how should i install

99146
ubuntu	linux
if i have to install rhel or ubuntu or any linux distribution in these hard disks how should i install

99152
put	get
it would be safer to put the commands in etc rc.local but beware that if you restart the iptables service service iptables reload your custom rules will get removed if they re not in etc sysconfig iptables

99197
centos	linux
the answer can be different by linux distro but i am more interested for these distros rhel centos fedora sorted by importance

99197
rpm	yum
the answer is enough for me if i can know it was installed by yum rpm or zip

99200
rpm	yum
whether of not the rpm package came through a yum repository or not displays from which repository the rpm package is available

99200
rpm	yum
if the yum repository is now disabled or the rpm package was installed manually yum will list repo installed

99210
libavformat	mpeg
detected file format mp2 3 mpeg audio layer 2 3 libavformat

99214
ubuntu	debian
had debian made a -6 and ubuntu chosen to take it you d have had a 2.2.14-6 in ubuntu and probably a 2.2.14-6ubuntu1 and so on and the number would have been bigger which is important if you want it to be considered an upgrade by apt

99225
debian	mint	debian	linux	cinnamon	gnome
on my system cinnamon 1.8.8 on linux mint debian edition i can disable it in the gnome control center

99225
debian	mint	debian	linux
it may be possible to do the same on linux mint 15 by going into cinnamon-control-center but that is not available on the debian edition so i can t check

99231
ubuntu	freebsd
the old storage system is a netapp the new system is just a freebsd box with a large san attached and the email server is ubuntu

99261
centos	linux
what tool function can we use on our linux server running centos to monitor the http headers that are sent from our application to another application on a different server

99264
stdout	stderr
so this command first redirects stdout to dev null and then redirects stderr there as well

99270
udp	tftp
i have a tftp server which listens on standard udp port 69

99281
folder	directory
i need to unzip a folder in the current directory

99285
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
easy part first there is no firewall set up by default on debian or ubuntu or most linux distros i know of

99294
folder	directory
if you re just trying to unzip the contents of a directory within the zip file without retaining any of the hierarchy this folder is inside of in the zip file

99377
stdout	stderr
so you bash actually must first open the new stdout before saying and redirect stderr to whatever stdout is currently set.

99389
ubuntu	linux
i have got a dvd-rw on which i d like to install some linux distributions but i ve tried a few ubuntu 13.10 crunchbang elementaryos and some others don t really remember but they didn t work which has me worried that it might not be possible

99466
google-chrome	firefox
i used to use firefox on a daily basis but have switched to google-chrome and have been using it for 2+ years now

99474
hid	keyboard
if this is a usb keyboard which it likely is it s possible the qwerty dvorak switch is another hid input device or something else as well.

99479
ubuntu	debian
the other big contenders in that category would be fedora and debian from which ubuntu is derived but there are more

99488
vmware	virtualbox
my suggestion is to use virtualbox or vmware and install the linux os in them

99488
vmware	virtualbox
for this purpose virtualbox or vmware serves as the perfect practice bed

99507
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
in the past i ve installed it properly on ubuntu mint or debian

99516
folder	directory
my main goal at this point is to remove the reference to my home directory in this folder rm doesn t seem like the answer but i m also curious to know what s going on

99541
debian	linux
debian linux clients see odd behaviour relating to open and

99541
udp	tcp
tcp and udp which is interesting indeed

99549
ubuntu	debian
i read here that this file no longer exists by default and must be created although that advice is on a ubuntu forum though i believe ubuntu is based on debian so could that be my issue here

99549
ubuntu	debian
the offical debian site mentioned previously makes no reference of needing to create the etc x11 xorg.conf file however i attempted to create the file as directed on the ubuntu site anyway but that also fails

99564
debian-based	ubuntu
to install these on a debian-based distribution ubuntu run the following command

99594
ubuntu	linux
unetbootin allows you to create bootable live usb drives for ubuntu fedora and other linux distributions without burning a cd

100588
min	max
rtt min avg max mdev 0.188 0.308 0.537 0.161 ms

100594
spaces	delimiter
as long as the data is spaces delimiter you can load the contents of the file into an array like so

100594
for-loop	arrays
once the data s been loaded into the arrays you can then use a for-loop to go through it and perform your division by 1024

100595
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
debian ubuntu mint .

100597
ubuntu	debian	dpkg	aptitude
for debian ubuntu you can use apt-get aptitude dpkg dselect orphaner debfoster and probably a few more

100599
ubuntu	linux
when deciding to run ubuntu or some other linux distro on a computer it helps to select hardware known to be linux-compatible

100611
daemons	launchd
a daemons process on detecting the presence of a text file in a particular directory then launchd an executable file which opens the aforementioned text file in order to read and then transmit its data over a tcp socket

100614
tunnel	vpn
configuring an ipsec tunnel between a cisco vpn client for linux and a vpn 3000 concentrator

100623
cpu	processors
processors intel pentium r 4 cpu 3.00 ghz x 2

100633
vim	gedit
doubt gedit has any integrated support for it but other tools such as g vim gives you the opportunity to connect to the cscope database internally

100646
ubuntu	debian
i have tried using the ubuntu based guides but they don t work on debian as the xdebugging step through does nothing

100697
filtering	grouping
also the error that you are getting is because sed interprets as a filtering for the line that the operation should be performed as the operation and as a flag for the operation in this case you need to use a grouping and separate the expressions with a new line

100707
filesystems	ntfs
i ve been using rsync for android to backup my phone to a remote ntfs filesystems on a linux system for a while

100707
filesystems	ntfs
recently the hdd containing the ntfs filesystems has started to fail or throw i o errors so i took the opportunity to copy all the files onto a new hdd and new ntfs filesystems

100707
filesystems	ntfs
given that i recently copied the remote rsync files from an old ntfs filesystems the remote file s ctime is different using ls -lc

100717
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to set a new password for linux ubuntu 12.04 but on running command

100723
stdout	stderr
this will capture both stdout 1 and stderr 2 and send them to dev null

100724
chown	chgrp
basically you need to chgrp chown the etc samba smb.conf file

100724
chown	sudo
sudo chown coreigh.coreigh etc samba smb.conf

100728
debian	linux
i m playing with a rather old heavily customized linux installation based on debian etch running on a netgear readynas device

100734
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu both have rsyslog available

100734
ubuntu	debian
on debian 5+ it is the default syslog on ubuntu it is an option so you ll have to install it

100737
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and other debian based distributions usr bin java is just a symlink to etc alternatives java which is itself a symlink to

100738
ubuntu	debian
this is slightly different on fedora than debian ubuntu but seems to amount to the same thing

100748
jobs	cron
you can capture output of these commands by scheduling them using crontab h owto add jobs to cron under linux or unix

100755
debian	linux
so i currently have boss linux and i am going to install debian currently installing right now

100755
debian	linux
and i want my older os boss linux on the first position and the debian freshly installed to be on the second

100787
debian	linux
so i currently have boss linux and i am going to install debian currently installing right now

100787
debian	linux
and i want my older os boss linux on the first position and the debian freshly installed to be on the second

100804
awk	ksh
many programs such as awk perl python bash sh ksh work in this manner

100833
jobs	cron
no cron implementation that i ve seen allows you to use different logging configurations for different jobs

100833
daemons	systemd
the de facto standard for syslog filtering is to run rsyslog which may or may not be the default on your systemd as the syslog daemons

100863
stdout	stderr
to avoid these messages to spawn in your shell while doing other stuff you may redirect stdout stderr to the big void

100867
bash	zsh
on my different shells ksh zsh bash i have the expected bahaviour i only have 1 2 not 3

100878
children	parent
the oom selects a process based on his memory consumption and many other elements parent gains 1 2 of the score of his children

100883
openbsd	freebsd
are there any patches floating through the internet that would enable ndis on openbsd so i could convert this driver as a workaround like the one used on freebsd

100883
openbsd	freebsd
edit1 - the intent here is not to stick with freebsd or question the openbsd binary policy and that is why iâ m looking for guidance

100887
ubuntu	debian
config options acquire forceipv4 and acquire forceipv6 were added to version 0.9.7.9 exp1 see bug 611891 which is available since ubuntu saucy released in october 2013 and debian jessie released in april 2015

100888
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m running linux mint debian edition with update pack 7

100888
manjaro	archlinux
the password is correct and works both on android ubuntu and archlinux manjaro

100899
freebsd	debian
you can build the guest additions on native freebsd but likely due to the fact that debian used gcc-4.8.x and freebsd is sticking with gcc-4.2.1 the module will be incompatible with kfreebsd s running kernel

100910
traceroute	packets
if we look at the firewall rules above we can see that the traceroute udp packets were reaching the last all encompassing reject rule of the input chain

100934
folder	directory
i am searching for some folder in my current directory

100956
bash	zsh
this syntax is also available in bash if you run shopt -s extglob first and in zsh if you run setopt ksh_glob first

100957
buffering	sigpipe
in most practical scenarios the program on the left-hand side of the pipe buffering writes and it will only receive a sigpipe the next time it flushes its buffering

100960
bash	zsh
in bash ksh zsh

101009
stdout	stderr
you d want to change stdout or stderr to line-buffered

101058
bash	zsh
you did not specify bash explicitly so i m taking the freedom to offer you a very simple solution for zsh

101059
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
i use both linux and freebsd specifically i use debian linux and pc-bsd and i found something weird about sed

101059
freebsd	linux
is there a syntax with freebsd sed that is different to the one on linux

101068
vim	emacs
usually you edit files in text mode using a text mode editor like vim or emacs neither of which debian ships by default

101068
sudoers	visudo
in the particular case of the sudoers file you should edit it using visudo because it does syntax checking for you before writing the file

101071
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and am trying to install ubuntu 12.04.3 lts from a live-usb and have it run alongside my windows 7 installation

101074
debian	linux
please correct me if i m wrong for working on my computer with a gnu linux distribution named debian i know two

101078
kde	gnome
it depends on your windowing environment gnome kde etc. but in gnome for example you ll see daemons running called

101079
folder	directory
you ll notice in the run user folder there is no 0 directory for the root user

101096
ubuntu	linux
i have an arch linux box that has a folder from an ubuntu server mounted via nfs

101118
ubuntu	debian
installing two glibc alongside in debian ubuntu

101144
google-chrome	firefox
if immediate applications like google-chrome firefox were compiled statically the additional memory requirement for the average system would be a few 100mb

101152
bash	zsh
you can use the process substitution operator of bash or zsh

101161
stdout	stderr
if you want both stdout and stderr to go to the same file

101161
sudo	passwd
btw the above assumes sudo will not prompt for a passwd and that you will not close the terminal window

101162
stdout	stderr
0 would be stdin 1 - stdout 2 - stderr

101164
stdout	stderr
you ll have to redirect stdout and stderr to something else than their defaults to hide them

probably most what you can to get is some online debuging and systemd s journald daemons which records everything from very early on way before traditional logging facilieties

101518
debian	linux
the same way that i think that red hat linux is fine or suse linux or debian linux because if you actually make your own distribution of linux you get to name the thing but calling linux in general gnu linux i think is just ridiculous

101539
freebsd	linux
under non-embedded linux or cygwin or any system with gnu coreutils and freebsd

101540
solaris	bsd
however this doesn t work with other sed implementations bsd solaris â

to make password recovery difficult the system doesn t store the password but a hash of it a slow salt hash to make brute force attempts to guess the password more difficult

101553
scrypt	pbkdf2
luks uses pbkdf2 one of the de facto standard key stretching functions though technological progress in password cracking makes bcrypt or scrypt preferable

101554
pbkdf2	hash
i think the hash algorithm cannot be configured per slot it s always pbkdf2 with a globally-chosen hash function

101555
hash	salt
to make password recovery difficult the system doesn t store the password but a hash of it a slow salt hash to make brute force attempts to guess the password more difficult

see installing two glibc alongside in debian ubuntu a very similar situation for more explanations and how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

101712
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
this unfortunate situation seems to only have three answers new video card old gnome gnome2 no gnome something like xfce lxde or kde

101712
xfce	gnome
on the bright side xfce is built on gnome libraries so if you go that way it is not too much work

101724
sudo	passwd
i ve installed vsftp and set the home directory of user ftp with sudo usermod -d var www ftp i ve also set the passwd with sudo passwd ftp and restarted the server but i can not login with user ftp when i try with ftp 127.0.0.1 why not

102235
stdout	stderr
no controlling terminal - stdin stdout stderr associated with starting terminal are redirected

102251
ubuntu	linux
i am imagining the microphone problems have something to do with the fact that elementary os luna is based upon ubuntu 12.04 because when i boot into manjaro linux the internal microphone works as expected

102275
wan	lan
then can be used in a lan setting getting reasonable performance but never should be carried over the wan

102286
debian	linux
i m using linux app-server 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.41-2+deb7u2 x86_64 gnu linux

it also notes that it can be installed in arch linux debian and ubuntu

102406
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
in the grub menu the default option says ubuntu instead of linux mint but i can live with that

102423
mouse	keyboard
so i m using the mouse keyboard and screen of the workstation to control the linuxcnc application

102423
mouse	keyboard
therefore i wonder if it is possible to attach a mouse and keyboard to the beaglebone directly and only use the screen of the workstation to display the application

102428
bash	zsh
zsh being zsh there is probably a simpler way of doing this but since i m a bash guy this is what i came up with

102431
ubuntu	debian
now regardinng the other method you were trying there is a confusion in your question you are using debian and following instructions on how to install java in ubuntu

102435
ati	nvidia
if this causes the graphical corruption glitches to go away then you might want to install the appropriate drivers for your system if it uses a nvidia ati card chip as they will likely work much better - and shouldn t experience this graphical distortion you are reporting

102449
bash	subshell
this differs from under certain circumstances such as subshell that do not require bash to be re-initialized

102451
centos	linux
stdbuf is from gnu coreutils it was added in version 7.5 in 2009 so it has made its way to all current non-embedded linux systems apart from centos 5

folder	directory
i found some ideas in internet that i should create .trash-uid folder in the root directory of the mounted share where uid should corresponds to the uid of the user

102467
vmware	virtualbox
there s a tutorial on how to do this for vmware and virtualbox over on the askubuntu site

102467
vmware	virtualbox
an important note when installing software do not install the virtual machine add onâ s virtualbox or vmware tools vmware as this is almost always likely to cause a bluescreen due to the ide controller driver being totally and not even remotely the same as a physical ide controller

102471
udp	tcp
confirm that when you opened this port on your router that you specified either both tcp udp or udp

102472

102483
vim	emacs
i m a vim user so i m learning emacs commands for use in the bash cli

102486
cpu	processors
yes creates a process which acts as a dummy cpu loader and results in 100 processors usage

102490
zsh	tcsh
alt-4 alt-b like in ksh and zsh and tcsh where they all most probably copied it from

102491
daemons	systemd
in order to allow user processes including daemons and other systemd services access the permissions need to be granted by a root process at some point

102511
binutils	glibc
i try to compile a new gcc including binutils and glibc

102511
binutils	glibc
my idea was that i d first compile binutils then compile a gcc which is linked with the new binutils and finally the two compile glibc without need of my system s glibc of usr lib

102511
binutils	glibc
however after binutils and gcc were compiled and installed correctly gcc fails to compile a simple program while configuring glibc

sata 0 is connected to a hdd primary which is loaded with debian linux os

102590
jobs	cron
number one issue with cron jobs not working check your

102593
stdout	stderr
however the program apparently sends the success output to stdout and the error output to stderr makes sense really and keeps a separate buffer for each

102637
execl	fork
if you for example want to run ls in shell shell fork new child process which then calls execl bin ls

102640
installation	upgrade
can i upgrade my installation to have a ubuntu 13.04 base but still use elementary os s desktop environment and applications

102645

i have a samsung laptop chronos s7 with one sata hard disk on bus ata 1 which is detected as dev sda an 8g ssd on ata 2 dev sdb and various other devices on the rest of sata interface

102662
fish	bash
a simple though slightly fiddly and not-guaranteed way is to try and fish the host or hostname variables set by some startup scripts and shells bash at least sets hostname out of the core dump environment

102678
folder	directory
however the ruby installation i performed via ssh created a folder called .rvm in the pi user s directory whereas the webide uses the webide user account

102682
rar	zip
rar and also zip come from the dos windows world where you don t normally chain together tools

102692
filesystems	hfs
if you re using osx the filesystems that s used under that unix is hfs

102692
filesystems	xfs
time stamps are always maintained in the filesystems so you re limited by whatever time tracking is offered through them ext3 ext4 xfs etc.

102715
umask	chmod
and change them back afterward chmod +w to get umask based value

102764
cvs	svn	cvs	rcs
you typically manage it via text files these files are often under rcs cvs or svn control

102765
debian-based	ubuntu
on debian-based systems including ubuntu you can find out the installation status as well as the possibly installed version of a package if you know the package name using dpkg -l that s ell not i or one

102781
rpm	yum
roughly yum works on top of rpm yum creates a transaction and then rpm runs the transaction .

what is the range min and max of the possible values that can be returned

102820
debian	linux
i have some files with really long names lying around on my server and writing the complete names is kind of a pita so i m asking if my linux system debian 7 can guess the complete filename

102822
titlebar	window
unlike the widget toolkit the window is not determined per application and so the border titlebar etc

102829
trash	tmp
the folders trash cur new tmp do exist

102858
bash	subshell
the kernel then launches the specified interpreter in this case probably a bash subshell

102859
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
autocompletion is available out of the box in bash zsh t csh and fish as well as some busybox variants

102861
fink	homebrew
however unlike homebrew and os x package managers fink does not use usr local path to install software

102865
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh but not ksh you can use builtin to force a command name to be interpreted as a builtin excluding aliases functions and external commands

102941
ubuntu	linux
i think there is no such use of # in ubuntu as it s linux bash oriented and # is use to comment a whole line

102972
bash	zsh
you can either use the standard as suggested by joseph r. or with some shells ksh bash zsh you can use let

102990
folder	directory
how can i loop through each directory recursively and whenever it finds a folder called video_ts let genisoimage convert that folder s content to an dvd-video iso image the name of the iso would be the parent folder s name

102994
ubuntu	linux
everytime when i want to build application from source on linux i have to install dependencies libraries in my operating system ubuntu

102994
ubuntu	linux
maybe there is another way to building software on linux ubuntu from source

102996
filesystems	ntfs
you may configure create and make a filesystems the partition you want for windows then install windows on them you should see them at installation if they are ntfs

103000
gentoo	linux
however portage it is the core of gentoo linux it is possible to use it alongside other package managers but i have no experience how well this actually works

103013
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
bash csh and ksh emulate the cooked mode edition characters whereas tcsh zsh and fish stick to their own key bindings

103023
ubuntu	mint
every time i boot up ubuntu or mint after choosing an os from grub menu before logging in screen brightness is set to 0

103023
ubuntu	mint
i encounter this in ubuntu 12.04 13.10 mint 15 and mint 16

103024
ubuntu	mint
i can t seem to download files from the internet on my laptop with mint ubuntu due to strange bandwidth fluctuations

103029
innodb	myisam
for example database files such as myisam or innodb files for mysql databases are binary files too but not executable

103045
put	get
i can put the entire command in there and remove the aliases but is there any other work-around to get the aliases working with watch command

103053
bash	zsh
note etc profile.d contains files for multiple shells csh bash zsh etc.

103053
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
a .csh will provide for csh tcsh a .sh for bash zsh etc

103060
kde	kubuntu
i have kubuntu with kde and replaced kwin with awesome wm

103062
solaris	bsd
on all of bsd linux macos and solaris i made an observation - no matter how busy the system is top always reports very few usually 1-2 running processes

103063
mouse	keyboard
most processes are waiting for something to happen a packet coming from the network a disk i o to complete a human typing on its keyboard or exercising its mouse these days with such fast cpus being the norm

103065
fish	bash
that only works if the login shell of the remote user is a normal unix shell of the bourne csh rc or fish families at least and bash is installed over there and sshd allows passing environment variables whose name starts with lc_

103065
bash	zsh
also note that we re using bash here on the basis that it s installed on all gnu systems but if you know zsh is installed on the remote system you can use

103098
debian	linux
i m running crunchbang linux a variant of debian

103102
folder	directory
it is set just like home directory but users still can see only their home folder without sample

103111
stdout	stderr
to capture stdout and stderr as well do

103122
bash	zsh
is a form of brace expansion introduced by zsh and supported by recent versions of bash and ksh93

103122
bash	zsh
a more efficient way to do it is to use the ksh for style of loop also supported by bash and zsh for decades

103140
put	get
so my question is how i get the dict entry xesam artist and xesam title out of this result so i can put it in my status bar

103151
bash	zsh
first run set -o globstar in ksh93 or shopt -s extglob in bash or nothing in zsh

103159
protected-mode	real-mode
is fully capable of booting without legacy bios real-mode uefi protected-mode half-assed compatibility hacks or at least well enough to fool a bootloader which is good enough for our purposes

103173
mouse	keyboard
it can however have a keyboard and mouse

103174
stdout	stderr
i was thinking about having the programs that start on login output their stdout stderr to files so i can check the stdout stderr for any of them if necessary

103176
temp	tmp
if the filesystem you fill is also where some of your common temp space lives tmp usr tmp var tmp programs trying to use that space will likely die if running or fail to start if not

103180
sudo	passwd
actions such as system shutdown and changing system time are accessible only to a sudo user after entering the passwd

103191
scipy	skimage
i need to use the module skimage which calls the module scipy i need to find contours

103216
ubuntu	linux
in recent versions of linux the keyboard and mediabuttons work but the touchpad does not however in ubuntu 10.04 the touchpad also worked

103216
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
would there be a way to find out what driver the device was using and somehow get that working in later versions of ubuntu linux mint

103218
put	get
what is the right blurb i can put into a rsyslogd.conf file to get this exact output

103222
kde	gnome
in gnome and other freedesktop.org -compliant desktop environments such as kde and unity applications are added to the desktop s menus or desktop shell via desktop entries defined in text files with the .desktop extension referred to as desktop files

103251
debian	linux
being a linux application bitcoin qt is updated regularly when the application in the repository is updated for example on apt-get upgrade on debian

103261
filesystems	ntfs
now you can install windows from the installation disk because windows will be unable to recognize the ext4 filesystems and thus will occupy only the ntfs partition on your hdd

103268
cpu	processors
so all diff type of binary program use elf only and cpu detect the processors architecture of the compiled program via e_machine field in elf format

103290
sudo	passwd
as stefan already pointed out run su postgres as root by running sudo su postgres and entering your passwd

103291
daemons	systemd
in debian based systemd the start-stop-daemon utility which handles pid-files changing the user putting the daemons into background and much more so postgresql will start by postgres user which is define in init scirpt or postgres cluster binary itself

103298
disk	ram
before that you didn t attempted any writes just reads so everything was on the arc in cache on ram and disk corruption remained undetected

103331
ubuntu	debian
some operating systems like debian ubuntu also have it packaged python-bs4 package on debian ubuntu

103337
unix	solaris
this only happens on hp-ux itanium while other server like solaris hp-ux-mp 32 bit and other unix platform can run the file smoothly

103338
disk	ram
most applicaiton on a regular distribution does use libraries and are not compile statically because the overload of ram and disk would be much more important

folder	directory
if you want to put your application into a sub folder using the library inside that directory instead the one of the system you will have to set ld_run_path when lunching your application to include the library you pack with it and not the system library

103352
bash	zsh
it seems to be possible with lynx using this trick zsh bash syntax

103353
folder	directory
which resulted in rsync copying for a long time showing progress and very good transfer speeds but at the end the target directory only contained .files.ext.ke5wt or something similar that corresponded to the names of the files in the source folder but all of them had 0 length

103414
octal	decimal
but in a c program or similar 0777 is octal three sets of three 1 bits which is what you intend while 777 is decimal and it s quite a different bit pattern

103419
dpkg	apt
i had assumed that apt and dpkg they would at least utilize the same package names is that not the case

103419
dpkg	apt
is there a way of figuring out what the dpkg name of an apt package is

103421
dpkg	apt
it s the same name apt is just a frontend to dpkg

103422
debian-based	linux	debian-based	mint
i m on linux mint 15 if it matters but i d think it d be the same in any debian-based distro

103439
openbsd	freebsd
i m running openbsd or maybe freebsd

103441
redhat	fedora
this failure is a little unnerving since it occurs while running the anaconda installer tool that s typically used by all the redhat products centos fedora rhel and the failure is not graceful

103465
openssl	gnutls
gnutls is a little nicer than openssl imo

103492
installation	upgrade
i recently upgrade a minimal installation of ubuntu with no full-fledged de from precise to saucy and since doing so i m no longer able to mount removable drives as a normal user

the .deb files are meant for distributions of linux that derive from debian ubuntu linux mint etc.

103534
redhat	fedora	opensuse	centos
the .rpm files are used primarily by distributions that derive from redhat based distros fedora centos rhel as well as by the opensuse distro

103536
redhat	fedora
redhat package manager in fedora redhat based linux distributions

103560
rpm	yum
users however do not typically interact with dpkg or rpm but instead use apt-get and yum to install packages

103577
sudo	passwd
with sudo which requires having prior authorization and typing your account s passwd

103577
sudo	passwd
gui environments have ways to run commands as root by invoking su or sudo under the hood and prompting the user for a passwd in a dialog box

103585
redhat	fedora
i can t check since i don t have a redhat based machine but as far as i can tell from searching here it should be installable on fedora with

103586
redhat	fedora
.rpm files are rpm packages which refer to the package type used by redhat and red hat-derived distros fedora rhel centos

103586
ubuntu	debian
.deb files are deb packages which are the package type used by debian and debian-derivatives debian ubuntu

103610
opensuse	linux
the mono download page has a download for opensuse but not any other version of linux

103610
ubuntu	opensuse
why is that is opensuse better suited for mono for some reason than say ubuntu

103614
ubuntu	linux
i tried to have the first vpn connection inside my linux ubuntu system start another system instance in a virtual box and inside the virtualized system open a vpn connection to our network

103616
ubuntu	debian
my guess would be that the third parties packaging mono 2.10.x for ubuntu and debian have not submitted the packages to mono

103629
rpm	yum
to install software on a linux system many tools like yum apt-get rpm dpkg and so on are available to either fetch a package from a repository or install a downloaded package

103635
rpm	yum
once rebuilt i ll install it using yum or rpm

103679

mouse	keyboard
any x11 application needs two things to connect to a display server which provides keyboard video and mouse to the application it needs to know which server and it needs permission

103710
ubuntu	debian
it was written by someone at redhat and is i think now the standard on all .rpm based systems but available to install as a replacement for the old man on debian ubuntu et

pyenv	virtualenv
python pyenv virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper

103726
kde	gnome
i want to have either kde or gnome on it

103733
stdout	stderr
you can further redirect the stdout stderr to appropriate files so that they don t appear on your terminal while you are doing something

103739
kde	gnome
after installing gnome or kde disable the automatic start

103740
kde	gnome
you can uninstall the display manager -- for gnome gdm for kde kdm -- although this maybe a hassle if it s regarded as a dependency

103740
sysv	systemd
runlevel is a sysv init concept and this won t apply on systemd e.g fedora or upstart ubuntu systemd

103748
ubuntu	linux
now i m using arch linux before i switched i was using ubuntu and i could connect to vpn using nm-applet so it is possible

103770
stdout	stderr
while the other answers using to background will work you have to redirect stdout and stderr

103778
stdout	stderr
errors are printed to stderr and not stdout and can be redirected to a file in the same way but using

103778
stdout	stderr
if you wanted to redirect both stderr and stdout you can use

103791
unix	bsd
however during the sco vs ibm lawsuit it was shown that linux contained some code from a unix os based on bsd known as dynix

103806
filesystems	ntfs
it provides safe handling of windows ntfs filesystems viz create remove rename move files directories hard links etc

103807
filesystems	ntfs
that changed with ntfs3g where this is no longer necessary praise the coders hence the explicit mentioning of safe handling of ntfs filesystems

103812
restrict	shared
the typical way to restrict access to your files is to have the permissions on your home directory chmod 700 in case the group owner of the homedirectory is shared with others or chmod 770 in case you have your own group that no one else is a member of

for-loop	loops
the 4 commands contained within the for-loop run in series each loops taking around 10 minutes

103944
cdr	cons
the value of org-time-stamp-custom-formats appears to be a cons cell where the car is the format for a date and the cdr is the format for a date+time

103946
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
interactive shells such as bash ksh csh tcsh zsh and fish provide a command line editor which allows the user to edit the line before it is executed

103951
versioning	upgrade
update solaris delivery model has changed and instead of the major disruptive versioning that used to be the norm is moving to a continuous delivery model where new features and changes are introduced by updates not upgrade

103953
bash	zsh
if you re using ksh93 bash or zsh you can use their recursive globbing facility searches for a wildcard pattern in a directory and its subdirectories recursively

103960
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
the tempfile utility is a debian utility which you won t find outside debian and derivatives such as ubuntu and linux mint

you could by pass determining the difference all together and simply merge stderr and stdout

103974
postfix	dovecot
i have recently set up my mail server with debian 7.2 wheezy dovecot and postfix as described in this guide

103976
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
it runs on gnu linux solaris freebsd os x and windows and can be ported to other posix-conformant platforms

the servers to be backed up are a smorgasbord of ubuntu rhel oel and centos servers

104042
versioning	upgrade
i have been trying to figure out a way to get my scientific linux box to upgrade to versioning 6.5

104048
mouse	keyboard
when i start memory-intense processes such as git gc in a repository with huge files linux starts becoming unresponsive after some time at first the ui lags a little then the mouse stops moving and then the keyboard stops working too

104056
ubuntu	centos
i installed centos over ubuntu on the ssd and the install put a 2.3gb logical volume on my two storage drives

104066
vpn	wlan
if you control both the vpn server and the wlan ip address range that should be straightforward

104067
filesystems	btrfs
i ve made backups of my btrfs filesystems using clonezilla and have restored one of those backups to a file named 2013-11-29.sda3.img

104067
filesystems	btrfs
as i understand it btrfs stores uuid information in every block on the filesystems which complicates things for my purposes

104080
ubuntu	debian
as someone who s been using ubuntu for a couple of years now both in production and at home when seeking answers to certain administrative questions for my systems i often hear the that s what you get for being on ubuntu | debian comment seemingly indicating that there s something fundamentally ineffective about this specific distro that i m using

104080
ubuntu	linux
now would anyone be so kind as to explain why ubuntu tends to receive much criticism from the linux community and what my options are

104087
redhat	fedora
on redhat distros such as fedora this directory is here etc ld.so.conf.d

104098
bash	zsh
up until this month my shell configs have been pretty simple just a .bashrc or .bash_profile with some aliases mainly but i have been refactoring it so i can get different behavior depending on whether i m using zsh and bash

104128
put	get
so is there any way to get rsync to function like mv instead of cp but also leave the skeleton of empty directories in the original location only erasing the files so that i can put more files into the directories and rsync it again to add the new files to the external drive without erasing the old ones

104146
hard-drive	hdd
as i understand it linux-swap partitions are more-or-less unallocated space within a partitioning scheme on a hard-drive that acts as a stack of memory in similar fasion to ram but had a larger databus waiting time since it is a hdd ssd managed in part by the drive itself rather than true ram managed directly by the cpu

104180
freebsd	linux
in this case a workaround is to do the following tested on freebsd may be slightly different on linux

104199
sudo	passwd
i d recommend you to still use a regular user but to configure sudo without passwd

104203
ubuntu	mint
mint 14 adds a different folder and installs things a bit differently than ubuntu or xubuntu

104203
ubuntu	mint
mint also seems to block versions of ubuntu software that are available in the ubuntu software center as mint has its own versions.

104229
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
openbsd and dragonfly or netbsd would help too if anybody has them installed but i mainly need the freebsd information

104231
subnet	packets
if the default routes aren t specified correctly then the packets wouldn t be able to get to the correct gateway network device so that they could be delivered to a device on that particular subnet

104234
ubuntu	debian
the distro installer will modify it when the kernel is updated and will leave your entries alone at least on fedora ubuntu and i am pretty sure debian although it may add one to the top and make it default so when that happens you ll have to move some entries around or change the index in set default

104250
debian	linux
the solution is a dummy mta already provided with debian linux

104259
mouse	keyboard
if the history entry is long use the mouse not the keyboard that stops the search to copy and paste part of the command to edit back in

104292
rpm	yum
for rpm s you can cd to the directory where it has been downloaded then sudo yum install package-name.rpm for fedora and other rpm systems

104309
jobs	cron
every unix system needs an mta to report system errors such as the output of cron jobs

104315
vim	emacs	vim	sublimetext	emacs	sublimetext
we currently support sublimetext vim and emacs

104316
disk	ram
since it s stored on disk it isn t erased when the power goes out unlike the ram content

104316
disk	ram
the data can t be used directly while it s on disk so it needs to be loaded back into ram when it is used

104318
freebsd	centos
i tried sh on centos which is really bash and sh on freebsd which is not bash

104323
ubuntu	centos
recently i ve changed my vps operating system from centos to ubuntu

104327
bash	subshell
it uses emacs s comint-mode to run a subshell bash

104342
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	debian
the beauty of using a debian based system as ubuntu is is that upgrade between versioning are very easy and safe

104342
versioning	upgrade
simply edit etc apt sources.list and or to reference the new versioning that you want to upgrade to see a list here

104342
versioning	upgrade
also be sure to check the upgrade notes for the versioning you re upgrading to for any known issues

104349
gentoo	linux
i have root on both server and client running arch linux on client and gentoo on server

104366
powerpc	i386
even debian having a port to loongson mips compiled zfsonlinux just works with amd64 and the package zfs-fuse have ports to amd64 i386 sparc and powerpc only

104373
installation	upgrade
also this file is replaced each time you run apt-get upgrade so make a copy and after the installation process begins put the copy over the file in var lib dpkg info

104375
arp	tcp
the tcp ip protocol will not work without arp so that is always available

104375
arp	udp	arp	tcp	udp	tcp
arptables is a method in the linux kernel to manage packet filtering on arp packets comparable to the iptables command that manages packet filtering on tcp and udp packets

104380
rss	feed
you could use curl or perhaps use this script instead how to add an rss feed to conky conky-rss.sh

104389
ubuntu	linux
i have a little linux ubuntu based server with 2 network cards which acts as a router dhcp dns server firewall etc

104398
icmp	tcp
remember ip is best-effort only and icmp does not have tcp s connection-oriented nature and guarantees

104407
daemons	systemd
i m curious if there are any implementations provided as a file systemd or a service daemons that facilitate the following

104421
put	get
please remember to put the arguments inside doubles quotes otherwise you can get problems if they contain whitespaces

104425
freebsd	linux
there is a tool called nethogs on linux but since it heavly depends on proc could not be trivial to port it to freebsd - m 127092700612560 w 2

104433
range	max	range	min	min	max
min and max specify a range for the value and

104433
min	max
a missing min implies the lowest possible value usually 0 and a missing max implies infinity

104433
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
you can also install htop which is a nice colourful alternative that is also available on osx and freebsd where it relies on the linux layer but afaik not on solaris

104447
sysv	systemd
whether it is sysv init or systemd is not relevant for this discussion one process is started

104452
vim	emacs
in addition to the command listed by strugee most set ups will allow you to run your usual editors vi vim nano emacs

104471
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
the key pair is stored in two files located at etc ssh_host_rsa_key and etc ssh_host_rsa_key.pub or similar locations in the directory etc ssh or with dsa or ecdsa instead of rsa

104472
dpkg	apt
dpkg doesn t know about automatically-installed packages only apt does

104482
ubuntu	debian
i just moved from ubuntu to debian wheezy and i thought i d be finally free of all the unnecessary clutter

104490
int	chars
for example i ve got an elf executable that contains a function int foo chars a long b compiled with debug info

104494
stdout	stderr
then mv will receive a sigpipe and die if it tries to write anything to stdout or stderr like an error message

104494
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
to avoid it next time if using tcsh zsh or bash before shutting down the machine press ctrl-z to suspend mv enter bg to resume it in background and disown to disown it

104538
clang	llvm
i am running ubuntu 13.04 on my end and i have installed clang as well as libclang-dev and llvm through apt

104540
uptime	reboot
this is okay but if you care about uptime and sla it would be difficult to reboot just to use the updated kernel

104553
installation	upgrade
after that i want to be able to do packages searches with the new package list in order to do upgrade and software installation

104562
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m pretty new to using linux distributions and for some reason i decided to install some ubuntu packages on my mint distribution a few months ago

104562
ubuntu	mint
i recently attempted to update the distribution of mint by running sudo apt-get update however the installer seems to also be updating all of the ubuntu saucy packages which are on my computer

104566
ubuntu	mint
well actually mint petra uses ubuntu repositories for stuff and only installs some extras

104593
dpkg	apt
the apt tools understand that in order to install a given package other packages may need to be installed too and apt can download these and install them whereas dpkg does not

104620
bash	zsh
bash and zsh have a special command_not_found_handler function there s a typo in bash s as it s called command_not_found_handle there which when defined is executed when a command is not found

104620
bash	zsh
hash would meet those criteria at least for ash and bash not yash nor ksh nor zsh

104645
put	get
i need to figure out how to get the biggest number that was put in the last file the script stopped at when making them then have it beginning that number+1 when i start it up again so that it does not start all over again with the value of zero only to over write the other files it created the last time i ran it

104656
stdout	stderr
if you don t want to see any output you need to redirect both stderr and stdout to dev null

104705
cifs	smb
details are highlighted here in this article titled how to mount a smb cifs share as an automount on centos fedora rhel

104709
ubuntu	debian
i ve had the problem with debian ubuntu and now archlinux so this does not seem to be distro specific

104711
disk	ram
so what you are seeing is your programs being discarded to free up some ram then having to be read in from the disk again

104714
unix	bsd
what is the very fundamental difference between unix linux bsd and gnu

104718
unix	bsd
unix and bsd are older implementations of posix that are various levels of closed source

104718
unix	bsd
unix linux and bsd have different ideals that they implement

104718
unix	bsd
for more info i suggest your read a brief article on the creation of gnu oss linux bsd and unix

for-loop	loops
all i would like is for someone to help me and write me a control loops to stop my for-loop at the count of 4 as

104736
int	chars
the second is turning chars into int values to work with

104742
vmware	esx
my company has an internal cloud that provisions vms either in an openstack kvm or a vmware esx hypervisor

104785
debian	linux
you are running debian linux -- in other oses apache will most likely have different paths for configuration files and commands

104785
debian	linux
set and on the file where you put your apache environment variables on debian wheezy it s in etc apache2 envvars on red hat enterprise linux it s etc sysconfig httpd

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux
this is an example for debian and debian-based systems like ubuntu - as you haven t given the linux os you want this for

104855
rpm	yum	dpkg	apt
typically gnu autoconf or similar maybe just an archive for a proprietary app wrapped in rpm or dpkg to standardize their meta data fetched with tools like apt or yum

104858
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu uses dpkg and apt-get

104858
rpm	yum	rpm	zypper	zypper	yum
fedora suse etc use rpm and usually some frontend like yum and zypper on top of it

104873
ubuntu	debian
if it s a debian ubuntu system they use upstart to mange services at least with the newer versions

104877
daemons	systemd
but if you can t figure out what sort of systemd your have and therefore how daemons are started and stopped the comment from uprego might be your best bet

104886
daemons	systemd
i am running postfix and it seems it is willing to accept emails for systemd users such as man sshd daemons www-data .

104887
bash	zsh
bash s string manipulation can handle it also available in ksh where it comes from and zsh

104890
bash	zsh
ksh zsh bash yash and busybox ash when built with ash_bash_compat

104899
jobs	cron
any user can potentially run cron jobs

104899
jobs	cron
if any of these cron jobs give output often to indicate a problem it is nice to let someone know and cron does this by default by mailing the running user

104945
openbsd	freebsd
on freebsd we have sysctl values for kern.maxfiles and kern.maxfilesperproc - i expect openbsd to have the same

105016
cifs	smb
its purpose is to serve files to clients using some file sharing protocol like nfs smb cifs afs and the likes

105031
ubuntu	linux
there s an ubuntu linux system installed on a disk da mounting the other disk db

105046
xfce	gnome
xfce works -- with compositing -- perfectly fine but gnome 3 shows a lot of glitches like you can see in the pictures below

105047
sudo	passwd
3 try to suspend with the command sudo sbin pm-suspend you will be asked your passwd or root passwd or using the key-combo to suspend if any

105071
tunnel	packets	tunnel	vpn
good example can be vpn - client opening connection to server and packets move via this tunnel

105086
stdout	stderr	jobs	cron
for the many cron jobs that i run i purposely make them so if run on command line appropriate outout is generated but the same script if placed in crontab i always capture both the stdout and stderr to a log file

105089
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu server 11.10 x86 and after i make my normal selection ubuntu with linux 3.0.0-12-generic-pae from the grub menu the screen just goes blank - there s not even a cursor showing up

debian	mint	debian	linux
if that matters i m on an asus eee pc 900 and using the lastest linux mint debian edition

105157
stdout	stderr
most of them should make good use of syslog but what they report there may not be the same as what they report to stdout stderr at start-up

105157
debian	linux	sysv	systemd	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
sysv init debian gentoo others originally this was the only init systemd used by major linux distributions

105157
redhat	fedora

105158
width	height
and a limitation with this is that the sticky pane here has to span the whole height or width it can t be a corner

105196
ubuntu	linux
1 it works in windows 7 and linux livecd ubuntu 13.10

105196
gentoo	linux
therefore hardware is fine and it s not a general linux issue the cause must be in my gentoo installation

105206
xmodem	zmodem	kermit	xmodem	kermit	zmodem
zmodem ymodem xmodem kermit and ascii - securecrt is an old-school sort of terminal emulator supporting several in-band file transfer protocols

105206

debian	mint	debian	linux
i am new to linux and i can t decide whether to choose debian or linux mint for my first distribution

105256

linux mint is based on ubuntu if i understood right and ubuntu is based on debian

105258

whatever-distro-you-like will have approximately the same boot times for the same software stack the software stack includes your choice of desktop environment -- gnome kde cinnamon etc. 1

105258
ubuntu	debian
the one used by debian is perhaps the slowest note that the one used by ubuntu is not the same but for normal personal computers this will only amount to a few seconds

105258
kde	gnome
i.e if you use kde on ubuntu your experience will be more like a fedora system running kde than another ubuntu system running gnome

105259
debian	mint	debian	linux	debian-based	linux	debian-based	mint
in general linux mint is friendlier and more appealing to the newcomer but since it is a debian-based distro the underlying system is more or less the same with debian

105325
bash	zsh
in respect to what happens on the active line it is possible to demonstrate that bash acts in a line-oriented way and that some operations trigger a clearing of the active line then at the prompt type a char and backspace it - demonstrated a contributor - the extent of which may vary from a cli to another zsh

105346
sudo	passwd
we want that some users should be able to do sudo and become root but with the restriction that the user can t change root passwd

105347
sudoers	visudo
you use visudo to modify the sudoers file

105348
sudoers	passwd
the problem is there s nothing you can do to prevent your users from editing etc shadow or etc sudoers for that matter directly and dropping in a replacement root passwd to hijack root

105349
sudo	passwd
if that application in turn launches passwd root there is nothing sudo can do about it

105349
sudo	passwd
a quick sudo rm etc passwd or sudo chmod -x bin bash or whatever shell root uses and you are pretty much hosed anyway

105350
sudo	passwd
write a wrapper script program which will copy the etc passwd file to some other location before calling actual sudo

105350
sudo	passwd
once he finished his task or when he came out of sudo restore the etc passwd file

105355

the only thing i can imagine restricting access to changing the root passwd is not giving full root access maybe with sudo or using selinux to restrict access to the passwd file.

105358

but when i try to do sudo svn update on the 5 repositories it is prompting for passwd

105530
sudo	passwd
this assumes the source of the problem is that the users that are changing the root passwd are doing it due to a misunderstanding like maybe thinking they are changing their own passwd after having done sudo bash

105530
sudo	passwd
under special rare circumstances if complete trust is not possible and it is not possible to break the sudo access to adequate but reasonably safe chunks you might consider establishing organizational sanctions against passwd changing or any other specified form of system tampering arrange monitoring of critical resources so that it is not easy to go undetected to get around the set policies - and be public and transparent about the usage rules and monitoring

i tried many times to restore a tar ball from a different server to a fresh installed vps with the same linux debian version exactly the same but every time when i restore the tar ball on a different fresh vps that vps would reboot with no problem at least if the tar ball from a vps that uses the same virtualization system as the new one but once it boots back on i can t use the ssh terminal and even the site won t show up when i call the ip address

106641
stdout	stderr
one problem with your first command is that you redirect stderr to where stdout is if you changed the to a as suggested in the comment and then you redirected stdout to some log file but that does not pull along the redirected stderr

106641
stdout	stderr
you must do it in the other order first send stdout to where you want it to go and then send stderr to the address stdout is at

106641
stdout	stderr
suppose stderr is address 1002 stdout is address 1001 and the file is 1008

106641
stdout	stderr
the command reads left to right so the first thing it sees in yours is which moves stderr to the address 1001 it then sees which moves stdout to 1008 but keeps stderr at 1001

106641
stdout	stderr
the other way around it moves stdout to 1008 and then moves stderr to the point that stdout is pointing to 1008 as well

106664
ubuntu	linux
if you are running ubuntu 12.10 or distributions of similar state ideally the linux 3.4 kernel or later and other recent components you should be in good shape

as someone hinted you need to have something specific like systemd v and coherent filesystem support compiled in the kernel in order to use something like mount -t sysv

the sysv string is not so suprising since this is part of at t unix systemd v 386 release 4 version 2.1 install media - a port which was supported by sun until 2006 - and these images ended up in the wild in 2007

basically i m looking for an alternative to dpkg --get-selections or apt equivalents etc that i can use on a non-running drive such as a raw file location where this info may be stored

106988
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
in ext4 or ext ntfs fat filesystems if i overwrite a non-contiguous file will the same non-contiguous storage spaces be used or there s a different way to handle such

107007
folder	directory
the shared folder is set up with auto-mount but it doesn t appear in media directory as said in the user manual

107012
sudo	passwd
and run it as root su root for which you need a root passwd you may also be able to use sudo -i with your own passwd

107013
unix	bsd
the same will also work under at least all dos windows mac linux unix bsd based operating systems

107018
chown	chmod
with an ext4 partition as you can see you use chown and chmod to manage permissions

107026
disk	ram
particularly since i expect those files i use all the time to reside in the ram cache from boot till shutdown so they will be read from disk only once for every boot

107051
freebsd	linux
however operating systems like freebsd haiku and gnu linux for example are mostly-posix-compliant

107081
vmware	virtualbox
sounds like this is more of an issue with whatever you re using to virtualize vmware or virtualbox or whatever where it s not telling the virtual machine that the connection has been reset and since the virtual machine still has the dhcp lease from the first network it doesn t know it needs to get a new one

107082
mouse	keyboard
use keyboard mouse to a run the ctrl + alt + option above b navigate to a utility that can be used to terminate the offending program c launch a terminal to initiate a or similar as detailed above

107089
versioning	upgrade
it appears there are many missing modules preventing me from completing the upgrade to the latest os versioning

107089
versioning	upgrade
next i tried upgrading to versioning 19 by running the command fedup --network 19 but it seems to do an upgrade to the same versioning 20 instead

107106
bash	zsh
since you re using bash bin zsh might be a nice option

107116
folder	directory
to figure out if a directory is a git repository git first checks to see if there is a folder called .git in the current working directory

107127
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade to cinnamon 2.0.14 on my lmde laptop and in this new versioning i am unable to change the gtk engine used

107127
cinnamon	gnome
starting from version 2.0 cinnamon has become independent of gnome and in fact conflicts with it

107127
cinnamon	gnome
i have therefore had to remove gnome to install this version of cinnamon which may be relevant

107180
sudo	passwd
the issue with trying to do something like is that it backgrounds sudo which happens before it gets a chance to prompt for the passwd

107180
sudo	passwd
this way you ll get the sudo prompt for the passwd and then sudo will launch so the backgrounding will be handled by a new shell instead of the current one

107195
folder	directory
the character refers to your home directory so it will look for the desktop folder in your home directory home jgallardo rather than the root

107211
bsd	minix
the minix 3 license looks very similar to a standard bsd style license which is more permissive than the gpl for example it will allow commercial use of the software in binary form without forcing a release of the source code

107244
hash	md5
since no one has yet considered a bad iso try comparing the md5 sum of the iso you have downloaded to the sum on the website of the iso provider should be able to find the correct hash on the debian website

107246
ubuntu	centos
i have amassed a small collection of nix boxes fedora ubuntu centos and puppy and there are a couple of projects i m considering that i need to install additional libraries

107246
ubuntu	centos
however his instructions are for ubuntu using apt-get and i want to do the same on centos which uses yum

107247
ubuntu	debian	dpkg	apt
for example ubuntu and debian both use dpkg and apt

107248
versioning	upgrade
as you can see apt is trying to upgrade from 1.4.4-1 bpo70+1 1.4.4-1 bpo70+1 which is basically two identical versioning but my installed deb package has custom nginx modules added to default nginx-full and after the update my custom modules are all gone and replaced by the standard debian wheezy backport deb

107281
ubuntu	debian
i have tried several distros ubuntu debian slackware but with no success

107282
versioning	upgrade
be careful because your custom package will still be upgrade if an even greater versioning is found on the online repository

107295
wan	lan
this allows hosts from the wan to connect services from a lan hidden behind their router

107295
wan	lan
in this case the forwarding consists in the translation from 1.2.3.4 80 available from the wan to 192.168.1.2 80 available from the lan only

107304
range	median
or mean median mode and range

107305
express	node.js
mean is a boilerplate for applications using mongodb express angularjs and node.js

107315
switching	screens
that s a nice feature but it really breaks the --quit-if-one-screen switching of less since in that case less switches to the alternate screens displays its data figures out there is only one screens and exits taking the contents of the alternate screens with it

107315
switching	screens
the commonly suggested workaround is using the --no-init switching to avoid using the alternate screens altogether

107317
post	get
in your original prompt you had the brackets around the entire prompt and this will tell bash your prompt is 0 bytes long and so your prompt will get overwritten under certain circumstances that you discovered leading up to your post

107335
bash	subshell
this will run in a subshell and redirect the error output of bash to bar

107338
debian	linux
i saw a post on google+ where a guy copied a lib firmware from arch linux to his debian machine and his wi-fi problems stopped

107353
ubuntu	linux
and i m asking on unix linux se instead of ask ubuntu because i believe the more technical questions would be better off in this se

107355
switching	screens
you might prefer to see the lines on the main screens as they come in and switching to the alternate screens if the lines would cause scrolling

107358
ubuntu	centos
i have ubuntu and i ve installed virtualbox in the desktop and installed centos but how would i go about connecting to it remotely via ssh as if i type my ip in

107361
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu 13.10 dell has dropped support for linux except for one server line and none of these solutions work because the linux16 command is gone from grub2

107370
bash	zsh
bash and ksh treat export specially and parse the argument like an assignment and zsh doesn t do variable splitting unless explicitly told to but you don t have this luxury in zsh s sh emulation mode or in dash

107378
stdout	stderr
as i am storing the stderr of my shell script and stdout as well
