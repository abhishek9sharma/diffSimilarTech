214768
bash	zsh
if your shell supports it zsh bash some implementations of ksh you could utilise process substitution

214791
for-loop	loops
inside a for-loop i d like to let a bash script execute command a in 33.33 of all loops and else execute command b 66.66

214794
prng	random
the random tag is used to discuss the behavior of these pseudo- and true-random-number-generator prng hwrng devices and the usage of random numbers

214798
prng	random
for example to get a decimal random number from the pseudo random number generator prng you can use

214803
mouse	keyboard
if i use keyboard mouse xorg server understand that then computer involved into user input activity

214820
disk	ram
the unix system i used at school 30 years ago was very limited in ram and disk space

214842
ubuntu	linux
use a live-cd ubuntu fedora and acess your linux partitions copy the files data from there to your windows partitions

214873
filtering	grouping
i am working at a place where e-mails are sent to multiple grouping very often which means that e-mails will be filtering into random directories even in mid-thread if a new grouping is added to the thread

214876
debian	linux
i am planning to buy a sound blaster z or zx sound card for my computer which will run both windows 7 and linux debian 7 8 or fedora 21 22 but i heard it does not have a good support on linux

214876
debian	linux
if not can someone give me similar sound cards options around 120-ish that work on linux debian or fedora

214884
put	get
if i run the lines on their own they work fine but as soon as i put them in a script like above and try to run it i get the following error

214903
jobs	cron
when i run both the jobs using as single cron job it throws bad minute error

214909
stdout	stderr
below is the log of a script that should select all the text in gedit and copy it but it does nothing instead along with its output captured by redirecting both stdout and stderr

214909
debian	linux
operating system debian gnu linux 8.1 linux kernel 3.16.0-4-amd64

214932
ubuntu	linux
i m currently on ubuntu 14.04 but i d imagine the process is similar for most linux unix machines

214961
folder	dir
we have a number of bash scripts that work fine using sftp what i would like to do is to simply re-direct an ls or dir of a folder to a file on our sftp server

214967
ubuntu	centos
tried to add a startup script for centos but can t find upstart script directory which typically is in etc init on my ubuntu system

214997
put	get
to get the value of ls you need to write or more generally to put between double quotes

214997
bash	zsh
you can use an array variable in shells that support them ksh93 bash zsh

215020
mouse	keyboard
i am going to ignore the video mouse issues as they are mostly solved except for movies games with high frame rates and focus on the keyboard

215037
subnet	packets
it happened to be caused by aws-system double layer routing and the nat instance in the subnet that did redirect packets over wrong network channel causing ssh to drop connection

215050
folder	directory
after a forced reboot a particular folder in my home directory is owned by nobody

215050
chown	sudo
this is the command i sudo chown -r root databases and this is the permission of the folder

215052
filesystems	ntfs
it could be that your filesystems either does not support linux permissions ownerships ntfs or that something corrupted when you forced the reboot

215052
chown	sudo
this might be a silly suggestion but have you tried also with chown -r root root databases either with sudo or directly as root

215058
folder	directory
if you are inside the root directory then you can use this command to delete the required folder

215118
mp3	m3u
i have an m3u file which has links to many mp3 files online

215118
mp3	m3u
my question is what s a good way to join all the mp3 file links in the m3u file into a single mp3 file for offline listening

215131
gtk	gio
perhaps poco glib gobject gio from gtk are offering wrappers working on both windows posix

215165
ubuntu	centos
this file httpd.conf is still exits in redhat centos ferodra however now this file does not exist in ubuntu

215176
folder	directory
explanation of what the file structure looks like the directory in question has one folder for each month for the past 7 years called for example jun-09 and each of these subdirectories has a folder for each day for example 11 for the 11th day of the month

215185
icmp	tcp
problem actually already very well described here but unfortunately without any explanation why traceroute with tcp is not displaying the icmp responses and with the for me unsatisfying solution of using another tool instead of traceroute

215185
icmp	udp
sending out traceroutes with icmp or udp works fine

215195
hash	md5
if this is something that needs to be checked on a regular basis you could setup a cron job to create a digest of the md5 hash of the files something like

215214
unix	solaris
is there an existing tool for solaris unix that keeps a history trail of the list of running processes

215277
debian	linux
i m using debian 7.0 i m newbie with gnu linux so i m not sure about the advantages in upgrade to debian 8.0

215281
debian	linux
actually come to think of it since you re new to gnu linux there is one compelling argument in favour of upgrading to debian 8

215282
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i have a sis 771 671 graphical card on my laptop and till now i ve just got the conviction that it just does not works very well on debian 7.0 linux mint 16 17 and some old ubuntu versions

215296
ubuntu	mint
also with ubuntu 14.04 lts which mint 17 is based on the packages are supposed to be more stable vs being new and up to date

215305
apache	nginx
check your etc php-fpm.d www.conf file and be sure to change the user and group from apache to nginx

215309
hid	keyboard	mouse	keyboard
it is a small standalone board that runs python 3 and plugs into the usb where it can appear as for example a mouse hid or keyboard hid

215309
i2c	spi
there are ttl level serial ports i2c spi etc ports

215313
ubuntu	debian
this used to work fine on debian and ubuntu back in 2011

215331
udp	tcp
80 is a weird choice though as you won t be able to run a web server on the same port dns uses both udp and tcp

215360
inotifywait	crontab
a crontab running every few minutes a custom service using inotify and the inotifywait command or just a simple wrapper script to commit your changes run the command

215371
vmware	virtualbox
tried virtualbox and vmware does not change so i don t think they ruin my eth0 connection

215380
kde	gnome
note i dont think the gnome activities are the same as far as i know this kind of power is only achievable via the latest kde you get with debian 8 jessie

215381
ubuntu	linux
however on my home automation system a ninja sphere which is an armv7 system running ubuntu 14.04.2 lts gnu linux 3.12.10-ninja-spheramid-dev201412211738 armv7l it doesn t show up there

215387
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
so i have a 64-bit linux mint 17 system and i am trying to set up a chroot environment with a 64-bit ubuntu 12.04-based system actually something called vinux an ubuntu remix

215408
debian	linux
a default install of the sudo package on most linux systems already have the group sudo setup for access i know debian does as thats what i use myself so simply adding any username to that group will grant access to use sudo

215412
ubuntu	debian
i would like to create a new user on some of my debian ubuntu hosts that is able to update the server using the commands apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade but i do not wan t to give them full sudo access to be able to do anything else

215414
stdout	stderr
i would like to create a new process that pipes its stdin into tmp in and writes the contents of tmp out to its stdout and the contents of tmp err to its stderr as they become available

215414
stdout	stderr
if you work with an external process from java read the stdout and stderr of the external process from daemon threads call setdamon true on those threads before starting them

215414
fflush	gets
apparently unbuffered means buffered but we don t wait until the buffer gets full but fflush it as soon as we can

215415
google-chrome	firefox
because the use of the default flashplugin-installer v.11.2 entails this problem and in a more severe form as the answer accepted there doesn t work i have preferred instead of digging farther in that direction to use this solution to install google-chrome s pepperflash plugin in firefox

215419
sudoers	visudo
you can edit the sudoers file with an existing sudo user with the command sudo visudo

215419
sudo	passwd
now if you try sudo apt-get update or sudo apt-get dist-upgrade those commands will execute without asking for a passwd

215419
sudo	passwd
if you try to run anything else as the sudo user you will be prompted for a passwd and fail

215419
ubuntu	centos
how to edit the sudoers file on ubuntu and centos

215423
subtraction	add
first do almost as you did before but no subtraction - and add one to the count

215423
lseek	posix
it is this distinction which enables posix to guarantee lseek for files existing on block-devices - it s a very basic principle of blocked i o

215441
stdout	fflush
neither the c nor the c++ example do explicit flushing after each line because i think leaving that to stdbuf is a better design decision but you could always add that by calling fflush stdout in the c example after each line replacing n with endl in the c++ example or more efficiently by pre-setting the buffering to line buffering in both cases so you don t have to make those expensive c c++ function calls

215461
debian	linux
i have tried to transfer about 50 gb files from a redhat linux variant unsuccessfully to my debian 8.1

215467
ubuntu	debian
note that ubuntu has the same command locale-gen but its implementation seems quite different than debian

215467
ubuntu	debian
more notably ssh will automatically send local locale settings to remote host sessions per default in debian ubuntu

215483
opensuse	linux	opera	google-chrome
my system freezes totally and immediately any time i view html5 video or audio on my linux opensuse 13.2 x64 system using a webkit-based browser google-chrome chromium opera all do it of any kind

215490
hide	show
i was hoping to make the tablet a little more functional by having an on-screen keyboard and i have set it up so i can show hide the keyboard and have it work

215490
hide	show
etc whether or not i have a text area focused so that i can create a daemon to automatically show and hide the keyboard

215501
sudoers	visudo
for users who should have access to the group run visudo to add a rule in the sudoers file like

215517
folder	directory
so i re-ran the tests again to test the answer below that a directory folder entry takes up 4kb and this was skewing my numbers so this time by placing 20 000 files in a single directory and doing the cp -al to another directory

215517
folder	directory
ok so then for completeness working on the answer given below that this is due to each entry for a directory folder taking up 4kb i did the test again but this time i created thousands of directory and placed one file in each directory

215517
folder	directory
the result after the maths increased space taken on hd by number of files ignoring directory was almost exactly 4kb for each file showing that a hardlink does only take up a few bytes but that an entry for an actual directory folder takes 4kb

215518
sudo	passwd
the sudo command asks for your own passwd and can only be used by users who have been authorized by the administrator

215535
put	get
if you put single quotes into a variable you get single quotes back sets a to the 14-character string hello world

215535
bash	zsh
this requires ksh bash or zsh it doesn t work in plain sh

215543
mouse	keyboard
when a keyboard or mouse event is generated by an application rather than by an input peripheral that event is marked as â œsyntheticâ

215543
gtk	gdk
it seems that there s a way to send fake events to a gtk application via gtk signals or gdk events but i don t know how that works

215580
vlan	packets
is it possible to create an interface which receives and sends untagged packets for vlan 10

215589
vlan	packets
sending packets through eth1.10 results in those packets being tagged while packets received with vlan tag 10 come in through that interface

215589
vlan	packets
sending packets through eth1 results in those packets being untagged while packets received without a vlan tag come in through that interface

215589
vlan	packets
there is no such thing as sending untagged packets for vlan 10

215589
vlan	packets
untagged packets don t have any vlan tag by definition

215593
for-loop	loops
your four loops will only run once if you want to run a for-loop four times then you should

215598
chown	chmod
i want to use chown to make myself the owner of all my important data and then use chmod 700 on all those folders to give rwx permissions to only me

215598
chown	chmod
i know that this is a unix linux forum and i m running mac but this question is a lot more about using the shell chown chmod and permissions and any solutions posted here will be applicable to any unix-based os

215602
chown	chmod
but you can recursively use chmod and chown eg

215637
ubuntu	debian
if the packages are only available for ubuntu and you need to install the package that is the best match to your debian release you ll need to adjust the appropriate repository entry for example to change the release from jessie to utopic or vivid by default the repository will be added with the release name that matches your debian release as you d expect

215651
for-loop	arrays
you also may be better using the arrays index to process the arrays items rather than trying to assign to the variable directly within the for-loop it avoids relying on the shell splitting correctly

215675
daemons	systemd
section 8 is systemd administration commands and daemons

215681
filesystems	ntfs
but generally you d avoid using ntfs or any microsoft tech on linux because windows and linux just do not work the same way and ntfs isn t as well supported as other filesystems

215695
opensuse	linux
i wanted to replace a corrupted raid5-device on my linux system opensuse 13.2 but missed the step of set-faulty removing the device dev sdc1

215708
for-loop	loops
i am using a while loops yeah the for-loop didn t work out the way i imagined it would and no seq modifier whatever in my shell

215710
ubuntu	debian
i booted my live iso in a virtualbox mounted the usb and installed it like any ubuntu debian derived distro

215714
sudo	passwd
all of these approaches to gain sudo privileges result in the incorrect passwd attempt message

215721
multiplying	add
when we add another checksum to the train we multiplying the probability of detecting an error

215747
ubuntu	debian
true of debian 6 therefore ubuntu and maybe others

215775
mouse	keyboard
i understand this security model it relies on the user having control over the keyboard and mouse

215785
ubuntu	debian
for debian 8 jessie you need different options to find the iso image the option you specified are valid for ubuntu

215800
sudo	passwd
if so you should be able to use sudo without a passwd in that environment

215838
bash	zsh
you can just do this in bash dash zsh no need to revert to utilities that might not be installed

215843
ubuntu	linux
this works on linux ubuntu

215844
versioning	upgrade
once the database files have been upgrade there s no guarantee that a client using a previous versioning of the client libraries will be able to access the database files that have been upgrade

215925
chown	sudo
note that if you dont use sudo u can use su to gain root so u can chown the directory and files

215932
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr to stdout which you then redirect to tmp file.log

215962
spaces	delimiter
-d sets the delimiter as spaces

215971
sudoers	visudo
run sudo visudo or alternatively open etc sudoers

215985
i2c	spi
platform drivers are used to communicate with platform devices like the controllers in your soc i2c spi etc

216001
gentoo	linux
did you consider installing some source based linux distribution like gentoo

216014
ubuntu	linux
i need the usb stick to install ubuntu on some computers and possibly use some other linux distributions later on

216021
gentoo	linux
this script checks for new files on remote computer b gentoo linux then rsyncs any new files to computer a

216029
centos	linux
i have centos running a linux vm on a windows machine

216051
versioning	upgrade
a i was hoping there would be a way that i could simply add the link from sourceforge to the software manager similar to how its done with ppas and that way you d always have the latest versioning installed every time you do apt update upgrade

216103
folder	directory
i usually delete empty files and folder in my home directory with find using the following command

216137
ubuntu	linux
the dell eport plus ii docking station is not recognized under linux both fedora 22 kernel-4.0.6-300.fc22.x86_64 #1 smp x86_64 gnu linux and ubuntu 14.04

216139
ubuntu	centos
i m ambivalent between xen with ubuntu as dom0 and xenserver with centos as long as they do what i want multi-boot

216195
int	chars
it includes both int and string chars

216205
jobs	cron
my method was leaving a computer in each one playing 24 7 or with other specific cron jobs depending on the client

216213
centos	linux
if you re a linux hobbist and trying to run an evaluation copy of red hat you might want to install centos instead which is basically a free rhel

216237
debian	linux
on linux debian based if i copy files onto a floppy disk in an external floppy drive and put this disk later into another floppy drive the disk output is â interesting

216249
daemons	systemd
iscsid is the daemons systemd service that runs in the background acting on iscsi configuration and managing the connections

216250
daemon	cron
several environment variables are set up automatically by the cron 8 daemon

216259
wan	lan
sending single udp packets from laptop through google dns server 8.8.8.8 i could confirm that only rx lan and tx wan were incremented

216270
folder	directory
if you think about directory or folder in the context of a fancy filename the folder is still a file but folder is rather a pointer to a container like a file folder in your filing cabinet so if you denote or use a slash or slash dot . it is helpful for a script to know an be sure you don t mean a file rather than a folder

216289
jobs	cron
that will add the line to your cron jobs but call it at login by adding it in a line to etc init.d rc.local

216298
ethernet	wireless
this sets up your device so that it bridges traffic between the ethernet interface and the wireless interface

216298
ethernet	wireless
your ethernet interface needs to be connected back to the rest of your network so that wireless devices connecting to the access point can see your network

216325
daemons	launchd
launchd it in the background if it doesn t fork by itself most daemons actually fork a child as soon as they start and let the parent immediately

216328
ubuntu	centos
command says incomplete so i am wondering why this is not working i tried this same configuration in ubuntu and centos

216329
binutils	mpc	mpfr	mpc
i did it numerous times and usually you just need a recent enough version of the binutils gmp mpfr and mpc

216360
chown	sudo
this assumes you have enough privileges to run sudo rsync and sudo chown

216364
punctuation	words
it does annoyingly drop all words that have even a single punctuation point attached as is evinced by 9nine

216364
punctuation	words
now that version will read input a paragraph at a time and when it has found a blank line it will reduce all of the input read so far to only words as might be composed of any number of chars and which might be lead or trailed by at most one punctuation mark on either end

216368
octal	hex
if you enter u81ea u52a8 in the ascii unicode escaped text area you ll get è ªåš as output because è ª is unicode character u+81ea whose utf-8 representation is e8â 87â aa in hex or 350â 207â 252 in octal and åš is unicode character u+52a8 whose utf-8 representation is e5â 8aâ a8 in hex or 345â 212â 250 in octal

216414
bash	zsh
i wonder if it is possible to set a global alias in bash like zsh s -g alias option - not global from the user s point of view but from the shell s point of view

216421
bash	zsh
bash aliases only work based on the first word on the line and can not be defined in a global sense like zsh

216460
interpreted-language	compiled-language
from my understanding you need to create a make file i believe that a make file is made for compiled-language not interpreted-language

216461
stdout	stderr
only whole streams stdin stdout stderr more generally any open file descriptors not just these standard ones can be redirected

216489
sudoers	passwd
as root su - root and provide your username passwd you should be in the sudoers file

216512
daemons	systemd
there is also a systemd daemons called logind which seems to start up the whole login mechanism

216519
spaces	delimiter
anyway first sed gathers 4 input lines - or pulls in input lines until 3 n ewline delimiter are found in pattern spaces - and next it looks for an n which does not occur on either the first or last of the 4 lines just gathered

216533
folder	directory
i want to mount a directory in my home folder on the os drive to a directory in media to get easier access to the drives storage space

216537
stdout	stderr
i presume this is in the correct direction because it came through stderr and not stdout

216567
stdout	stderr	jobs	cron
edit i should specify i need the cron job output stdout stderr in a log file not just the jobs that were run

216577
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	opensuse	centos
i also tried other distributions ubuntu 14.04 ubuntu 15.04 opensuse centos elementaryos and get similar errors

216584
ubuntu	debian
i use vnstat which keeps track of daily stats for the last 30 days and is available in the ubuntu debian and probably many more repos

216589
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and left mouse button the switch will happen between main

216606
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	unix	sunos	sunos	bsd	solaris	bsd	solaris	sunos
the script works on many unix systems including linux bsd osx solaris sunos etc

216632
udp	tftp
i also added a bunch of of udp ports including 58162 43595 and 59037 which i saw in the tftp data when i checked in wireshark

216664
filesystems	xfs
for the ext2 ext3 ext4 filesystems the most common linux filesystems you can use debugfs for xfs xfs_db for zfs zdb

216688
folder	directory
is there any way to add all folder without their parents and without cd -ing into their directory first and adding them step-by-step

216722
ubuntu	linux
i am switching from ubuntu to arch linux and encountering the issue that a udev hwdb rule that has worked until now does not work anymore

216793
folder	directory
say directory 0.1 0.2 0.3 should go to folder one

216793
folder	directory
directory 0.15 0.25 0.35 should go to folder two etc

216802
bower	npm
npm install -g bower

216805
filesystems	ntfs
you have an ntfs filesystems

216811
mouse	keyboard
before v220 the id c52b was used for all parts of the device a multi-button mouse however now i need the id 402d to address the keyboard

216865
capitalize	uppercase
at the application level the class name is usually fixed for a given application typically to the capitalize application name and sometimes other letters are also in uppercase xterm xcalc gv nethack .

216891
sudo	passwd
how do i make sudo remember my passwd for longer so that i don t have to keep typing it

216894
sudoers	visudo
and make sure you edit your sudoers file using visudo which checks your syntax and which will not leave you with wrong configuration and inaccessible sudo

216897
lvm	xfs
i have a software raid 5 lvm xfs with three 2 tb drives

216910
put	get
i have a collection of bash scripts and i want to put some common shell options and variable declarations into a setup.sh script which would get sourced at the beginning of each script

216925
debian	linux
i am using debian gnu linux 7.8 wheezy

216932
xfce	cinnamon
i ran mint 17.1 rebecca xfce for months before upgrading to rafaela 17.2 cinnamon x64 and i have never had issue with installing network printers using mint

216936
post	get
i got this from a reddit post to get replicable mouse settings over different installations

216953
bash	tcsh
i m new to bash and would like my prompt to show something that in tcsh was trivial yet after a good google search i still cannot do

216977
pulseaudio	mixer
i am looking for a alsa mixer gui for xfce or better yet desktop-independent to replace pulseaudio mixer

216981
udp	tcp
so if someone access to my v-server like tcp 80 or udp 9987 then it will redirect it to my server and the same vice versa.

216981
debian	linux
vserver - linux debian 7

216982
centos	linux
i am connecting from a mac with osx 10.6 to a linux machine with centos 6.6 by using the ssh command ssh -x

216982
vim	emacs
after logging into linux i can use emacs emacs -nw or vim for my programming without problem but all the other applications like emacs window mode firefox visualization software etc do not recognize my keyboard input correctly

216999
toolbar	tabs
i am experiencing a strange problem with firefox though the firefox controls toolbar bookmarks tabs etc. in firefox look huge compared to the rest of the kde environment and i haven t found a way to change that

217000
openbsd	freebsd
in addition i believe the console font files used by freebsd and openbsd are not the same format as used by windows making finding a converter even trickier

217002
debian	centos
there is no hybrid iso for centos like there is for debian

217009
postfix	dovecot
a customer of mine wants to use gmail as their default mail client but i have rolled forward to a new centos server version 6.6 ok it s not new new and the dovecot and postfix settings are default to be fairly hardened

217020
filesystems	btrfs
command will be different for different filesystems btrfs filesystems resize dev loop0 max or xfs_growfs test.img is mounted here

217024
stdout	stderr
it will also redirect stderr to stdout as here on my box some errors which are caused by prelink being enabled are reported as errors but we want them on stdout

217072
folder	directory
however as noted by gilles that code only shows the current directory at the time .bashrc is loaded but it won t change as you navigate the system to other folder

217077
folder	directory
test_1 3 gb folder and ctrl-c during sudo cp -a the current file is truncated left as root and so is the directory

217086
versioning	upgrade
it will install the package if it isn t installed yet and it will upgrade it if you have an older versioning

217092
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
debian and derivatives ubuntu linux mint elementary os raspbian etc. use two program families to manage programs

217097
zsh	tcsh
if you want a nice interactive shell experience switch to zsh where all of these prompt expansions largely encompassing tcsh s chpwd etc. are native features

217104
wan	lan
you can use libvirt to virtualize an openwrt router map the wan network card directly inside the vm and bridge the lan card as another card in the vm

217113
ssd	sata
assuming it s not the ssd causing the trouble i exchanged the other drive and sata cable with parts that are working without errors in another system

217143
daemon	cron
i found it is flooded with about 300 k messages from the cron daemon notifying me of a certain unimportant warning in a certain cron job

217143
daemon	cron
i would like to automatically delete all the messages sent by the cron daemon but not the other messages

217157
bash	zsh
this works in bash zsh and ksh and possibly other shells

217160
filesystems	fat
the real problem is that the fat filesystems doesn t offer much in the way of intelligence of any kind - whether that be in the way of user-space tools or otherwise

217169
daemon	cron
messages from the cron daemon

217213
xmonad	xmobar
new to xmonad xmobar haskell trying to get the name of the current workspace to show up in xmobar

217258
google-chrome	firefox
after i installed google-chrome on my work laptop pidgin links open with google-chrome even though firefox is set as my default browser

217265
filesystems	ntfs
is there any good guide on internet how to write custom automounting rules especially for ntfs filesystems

217303
post	get
i ll post my question on a more relevant stackexchange now that i know it s not a docker issue and if i get an answer i ll update this one so others can benefit

217341
sudo	passwd
i have tried with passwd root but if i log in with ec2-user and run sudo su i get a root bash without asking for a passwd

217344
sudo	passwd
sudo su asks for the user s passwd the user has to be in the sudo adm admin wheel group depening on flavour of the os to be able to execute sudo

217344
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
check the settings in etc sudoers file to see why you are not being asked for a passwd while using sudo

217344
sudo	passwd
most likely the time-out is set to a few minutes allowing you a passwordless sudo for 15 minutes after a successful passwd entry

217345
udp	tcp
now i am trying to check if rsyslog is having a tcp udp listening connection on port 514 using

217351
folder	directory
you should have a debian directory inside your source folder

217364
bash	zsh
or with csh bash zsh ksh

217364
bash	zsh
if you know the login shell of the remote host is bourne-like bourne ksh yash zsh bash ash... and your ssh client and server allows passing environment variables you can also do again without -s

217369
debian	linux
i am building an image for an embedded linux based on debian

217390
mouse	keyboard
if you re in a desktop environment then xdotool is an x.org utility that simulates mouse and keyboard activity but your distro may not include it by default

217390
bash	subshell
looking at the command again the first set of parentheses started a subshell bash 6524 6524 with its file descriptor 0 its standard input being assigned to the pts which is opened read-write as returned by another subshell that executed to unlock the pts associated with file descriptor 3 created in the preceding step

217390
bash	subshell
because the subshell is running bash interactively it can be sent commands to execute like this example which displays the subshell s file descriptors

217391
folder	directory
modify user home directory from default to a new folder

217439
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
i am normally an debian ubuntu guy but i wanted to test the foreman on centos 7 but i am having some trouble with the rpm command

217442
ubuntu	linux
or is it not required to make images of the partitions â žefi system partitionâ œ and mrp because it is possible to rebuild these both partitions maybe with a windows installation disc or with an linux tool after restoring the images of windows and ubuntu on a new disk

217473
xmonad	xmobar
in that case you don t have to launch xmobar from xmonad

217473
xmonad	xmobar
you can for example keep launching xmobar from xmonad using spawnpipe and have myloghook write the status to a pipe that you pass to it

217476
hex	binary
i think it is rather like some sort of hex to ascii or binary conversion issue

217488
udp	tcp
â¹ zsh has a different way of using udp and tcp sockets

217503
jobs	cron
if you find your system sluggish in the morning this may be because nightly cron jobs such as updatedb filled the memory with inode cache entries

217522
bash	zsh
that should work with a posix sed and a bash zsh ksh mksh shell and many others

217579
switching	screens
when i press my power button to switching it on the screens just shows black or navy blue for some seconds goes off and then show a dimmer version of the color basically till i switching the system off

217583
switching	screens
under lxde desktop manager alt + f11 can be used to switching a program to full screens

217599
filesystems	ntfs
namely i d like to state that any removable device for which filesystems is ntfs should be mounted with windows_names option see doc

217729
filesystems	fat
the disadvantages are a slightly more complicated fstab and the fact that you cannot have symbolic links in boot a fat filesystems

217752
ubuntu	linux
use the file command on linux ubuntu

217768
ubuntu	debian
i m hoping that the behavior of ifup in ubuntu 15.04 is the same as the behavior of ifup in debian jessie

217770
smarthost	exim
to me example.com you specified it with mailx but it s refused by the smarthost bounced so bounce mail from to me example was newly composed and sent by local exim then it s also refused by the smarthost double bounced

217793
folder	directory
delete the .kodi it s hidden so hit ctrl+h directory in your home folder

217794
centos	linux
i have created one linux centos 6 instance in amazon ec2 and installed cpanel on it and started running my websites there

217804
disk	ram
this is impossible because it s the linux kernel that creates and manages the ram disk

217804
disk	ram
if you have assigned a portion of memory to your ram disk content written to that ram disk will not get overwritten

217804
disk	ram
your available memory is shared between the ram disk and everything else

217810
filesystems	fat
the syslinux bootloader will boot linux from a fat filesystems and can be installed on a floppy

217815
packets	pcap
i m trying to make a simple bash script to calculate packets captured in pcap files i used tcpdump to get packets in each pcap file and add them using a bash script but it doesnt seem to work

217846
stdout	stderr
dd will report its read writes to stderr and still copy all of the file to stdout

217854
disk	ram
you should probably not have created any ram disk use tmpfs not ramfs see this

217854
disk	ram
linux is managing ram better than you can and its page cache is very good so you might not need to create any ram disk just use a tmpfs mounted tmp and put your file there or even any file in any file system with a lot of ram very often the data stays in the page cache and no actual disk io is involved but see sync 2

217854
disk	ram
and assigning a ram disk to a specific process is impossible on linux

217854
disk	ram
a ram disk is generally a tmpfs filesystem or perhaps an obsolete ramfs one so you assign it to a file system not a single process

217854
disk	ram
how can i be sure that this ram disk is only used by the mentioned process and other processes wont change its data

217854
disk	ram
i guess that if you did not create any ram disk your linux system will perform or can be configured to perform better than with explicit ram disk

217859
freebsd	linux
and i suspect this might be the genesis of this question linux has this performance thingy why does freebsd not have it

217883
folder	directory
running in the top directory gives 110g for a particular folder whereas running the same command inside that folder gives a total size of 11g

217888
lvm	btrfs
on top of each of them there is lvm - one with only 1 os volume which is btrfs another one detached with 3 volumes - swap ssd cache and btrfs data

217888
lvm	btrfs
the one with os performs more or less like raw btrfs on luks without lvm the one with data achieves like.

217908
versioning	upgrade	bash	zsh
you need to upgrade to bash versioning 4 or use other shell which supports that recent zsh

217969
for-loop	while-loop
i think in general a for-loop is the most convenient way to do this but if you re interested you can use a while-loop a bit closer to your basic program

218003
dpkg	apt
first install libapt-pkg for the version you need and then install the apt package for your system using dpkg -i

218003
dpkg	apt
in case of conflicts look for apt packages in dpkg -l and uninstall it using dpkg -r

218015
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and am trying to install pcre 8.37 on ubuntu 14.04 but am getting the following error

218019
spaces	delimiter
i want to do something similar however my file is tab delimiter instead of spaces delimiter

218052
ubuntu	linux
i ve recently made the move from ubuntu to arch linux and could use some help configuring grub

218053
postgresql	mysql
the most common solution is to have both php and the operating system authenticate against the same database such as ldap or a sql database like mysql or postgresql

218056
centos	linux
for some reason i want to configure the date time in my linux centos 6.5 to be different from the real date time but the setting won t work if i turn my computer desktop not laptop if this matters and this computer has no access to the internet on after a sudden power cut the date time will be the old date time before the configuration i unplug the power adapter manually to simulate the sudden power cut situation

218105
switching	screens
how can i create new switching between screens windows on host2

218113
installation	upgrade
after going through the usual process of sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade the installation of udev is failing with

218120
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu you need bsd-mailx package installed to send emails

218124
centos	linux
mailx is available for rhel centos scientific linux or their

218124
ubuntu	debian
mailutils is available in debian ubuntu or their variants

218132
sudo	nohup	sudo	passwd
sudo probably asks for a passwd and nohup disconnects the process from the controlling terminal

218140
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
using command 2 chown root root usr bin sudo chmod 4755 usr bin sudo we fix the permissions ownership of sudo

218168
ubuntu	linux
in my local linux ubuntu i have two directories for linux src

218175
sudo	passwd
sudo -i is nearly the same as sudo su - the -i simulate initial login option runs the shell specified by the passwd database entry of the target user as a login shell

218232
tar	gunzip
the z option tells tar to decompress an archive using gunzip or its internal equivalent and is appropriate only for gzip -compressed archives typically with a .tar.gz extension

218249
solaris	aix
the behavior of the program is based on what i saw on solaris and aix

218262
bash	zsh
so when we execute bash script 1 under our interactive shell zsh we expects an output of zsh

218262
bash	zsh
for example in the case of zsh first interactive shell - bash second interactive shell - bash batch shell for script 1 - bash batch shell for script 2 we want to output bash the second interactive shell

218291
post	get
this might not be the best approach to rename the files but it worked for me and this is why i would like to post it as an answer so that if anyone else reads this might get some help to change the file names the way i did

218310
sudo	passwd
a configure sudo access such that your username does not require passwd for tail command or for all commands if you so require

218310
sudo	passwd
by setting timeout to negative values you may have to enter the passwd only once and sudo will not pester you after that

218311
sudo	passwd
please follow this link to set up sudo to run without passwd for specific commands

218333
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
however when used on linux ubuntu on my laptop debian on my rpi i swipe a card the green led goes off the same happened when i deliberately chose a random driver for it in windows so i assume it is a driver issue and there is no input at all when a usb keyboard works fine on the same system

218335
folder	directory
i want to create gcov files from openssl and from other projects but i can only create them in the same directory of the project and only for the files in the current folder

218341
stdout	stderr
note also how i had to add to the end of the python invocation because the output of unittest is on stderr so i transferred it to stdout so that i could pipe it into colout

218352
bonjour	avahi
i shouldn t need avahi bonjour since i m using samba netbios and i don t want to use hosts file modifications since i have several machines i want to use this with

218371
cifs	smb
that is the smb cifs protocols have three ways of doing name lookups but the other two are really only used if you configure a domain which you re not doing

218377
daemons	systemd
tuned is a daemons for linux which offers dynamic systemd tuning depending on usage

218390
rpm	yum
without hitting the books for you here i think you may be able to get what you want in this case by configuring iptables as root to route a non-privileged port to the one you want to use or by using authbind if you can get it for your system either by compiling or via yum rpm apt-get whatever

218475
bash	zsh
with bash zsh and ksh93 you can use start..end..step brace expansion form

218481
debian	linux
it turned out that debian actually never packaged and shipped the linux specific rme firmware

218489
ubuntu	debian
if i want to work between ubuntu and debian or switch to one or the other would there be a good way to know what commands will work on both

218489
ubuntu	debian	sudo	passwd
i have set up debian with sudo by not choosing a root passwd and i want to do a basic server setup install postgresql etc but i m not sure how much of the things in the ubuntu wiki for example will map over to debian

218489
ubuntu	debian
i like the way the ubuntu wiki is laid out and it seems more thought-out than debian s wiki

218493
ubuntu	debian
as i m sure you know ubuntu is based upon debian ubuntu releases are rebased against debian testing periodically and a there is a lot of similarity between the two

218493
ubuntu	debian
for example for many years ubuntu used upstart as its default init system whereas debian stuck to sysvinit both use systemd as the default now though

218493
ubuntu	debian
in general though a lot of the ubuntu wiki should still be applicable to debian

218494
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is debian based

218496
bash	zsh
certain shells bash zsh and ksh off the top of my head but i m sure there are more can deal with recursive globbing

218504
stdout	stderr
this also logs any error from the stdout instance of logger to the stderr instance

218519
stdout	stderr
if you want your process to have also stdin stdout stderr closed use this

218519
stdout	stderr
this will close stdin 0 stdout 1 and stderr 2 then background

218519
stdout	stderr
in the former you are duplicating a stream to dev null which is what you want in the latter you are duplicating dev stdout to stderr and then closing stdout

218522
for-loop	loops
in this state rather than skipping the for-loop bash will run loops exactly once where d is equal to

218537
folder	directory
another misconfiguration issue that requires correction is this any user who requires access to folder . appuser2 must be granted execute x permission on that directory

218537
folder	directory
as stated in the chmod 1 manual for folder the execute x permission grants a user search permissions on the folder-- the user is granted permission to execute a change directory action into the folder to access the folder s contents

218548
stdout	stderr
since it is an error message it should go to stderr not stdout

218558
chown	chmod
when acting on symlinks you must tell most of the tools chown chmod ls... not to dereference the link you must add the -h parameter as stated in the manpage

218558
chown	sudo
so try sudo chown -h askar.admin etc init.d jboss1

218561
rtl	verilog
i have multiple verilog rtl files in which we have use asynchronous reset

218579
versioning	upgrade
upgrade means upgrade all packages which have newer versioning available in the configured package repositories than the ones which you currently have installed

218579
versioning	upgrade
install means add a particular package with the latest available versioning or upgrade to that versioning if an earlier versioning of the package is already installed

218593
dpkg	apt
to answer your question dpkg calls the same scripts on a per package basis whether you are using --only-upgrade with apt or not

218616
daemons	systemd
i would like to ensure that the daemons is always running restart it after a crash and start it when the systemd boots crucially before any user logs in this pi runs headless

218617
filesystems	ntfs
clean ntfs filesystems the linux-based ntfs tools will refuse to touch a ntfs filesystems unless it is already perfectly consistent so as to minimize the chance of data loss

218617
filesystems	ntfs
at this stage it is necessary to delete the partition and create a smaller one to match the new size of the ntfs filesystems

218617
filesystems	ntfs
we know the filesystems is ntfs so use the command action â tâ for type and the listed hex code â 7â for ntfs

218645
debian	linux
in some linux distributions debian usr bin gcc is an indirect symbolic link to usr bin gcc-4.9 thru etc alternatives gcc

218650
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
i was hoping that either redhat debian centos or ubuntu could help me in my journey to get it up and running

218653
rpm	yum
with yum becoming more stable i believe most of us are utilizing that path first then individual rpm s only when no alternative exists

218666
debian	mint	debian	linux
now i m trying to get the same cables working on linux linux mint debian edition 2

218689
spaces	delimiter
not match and d elete it but for those that do e x change edit and hold buffers so your current pattern spaces is all of the last fully delimiter record and hold spaces contains only the very first part of the next delimiter sequence

218703
ubuntu	linux
edit my amazon linux is at utc+00 00 while my ubuntu local machine is at utc-05 00

218715
sudo	passwd
if it is it will use sudo to prompt the user for a passwd

218716
filesystems	btrfs
my filesystems is not btrfs but ext4 when i try mount -t ext4 dev sdb2 mnt tmp i get

218729
mkdir	chdir
fabricate traces open stat stat64 lstat lstat64 execve exit_group chdir mkdir rename clone vfork fork symlink creat

218749
bash	zsh
under bash zsh ksh just use ifs t n skip all the rest of this answer

218755
bash	tcsh
your best bet is to use a shell like bash or tcsh that puts the terminal in cbreak mode to implement its own line editing capabilities

218822
mouse	keyboard
explanations i was the one disconnecting and reconnecting the ethernet cable keyboard and mouse

218860
ubuntu	linux
i have got an ubuntu linux without x server installed on it because it s only a gateway

218889
spaces	linefeed
if you don t need the context of the adjacent content and there are spaces separating tokens just use tr to turn spaces into linefeed

218906
folder	directory
i would like to move all the folder contained in the folder example named _jony to a new directory call jony

218911
versioning	upgrade
on my kubuntu 14.4 which has python 2.7.6 as standard my python is broken after i tried to install python 2.7.10 after building from source from python.org with the help of how to install the latest python versioning on debian separately or upgrade

218918
for-loop	arrays
i use an arrays to define different projects and i want to get the values of these environment variables by rebuilding them in a for-loop

218926
stdout	stderr
while not identical to your requirements this earlier question would be worth a read where someone wanted to differentiate stdout stderr by color

218926
stdout	stderr
how to set font color for stdout and stderr

218936
debian	linux
i m working with a small arm board emtrion running debian linux

218942
bash	tcsh
i would like to use tcsh and not bash

218953
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	centos	debian	mint	centos	mint
install the ntp server package ntp on debian ubuntu mint as well as on fedora rhel centos and configure the servers to be your head node s as well as some internet servers

218956
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is a derivative of debian and also uses d-i plus it also supports another installer called ubiquity which can be automated in a different way

218956
ubuntu	mint
i am not familiar with mint but it is a derivative of ubuntu so what applies to ubuntu may also apply to mint

218956
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
the debian ubuntu mint installer is not one single script but a collection of components some written in c others shell scripts

218966
cinnamon	gnome
i also know it s a function of the window manager e.g cinnamon and not gnome

218974
ubuntu	linux
i switched to linux ubuntu 14.04 from windows 8.1 about a month ago because i wanted to get more out of my laptop lenovo flex 2

218986
centos	linux
i have a learning environment based on linux centos with postfix and squirrelmail running but my assignment is more in general

218992
ubuntu	debian	debian-based	ubuntu
ubuntu itself is debian-based but with debian s focus on stability for good reasons debian usually does not offer the latest software versions

219005
symlink	dotfiles
i tried to create a dotfiles directory and symlink all the dotfiles into there

219012
folder	directory
most of directory and files contained in linux-headers-x.x.xx-xx-generic folder are symbolic links which pointing to actual directory and files under linux-headers-x.x.xx-xx

219034
debian	centos
1 debian main - 192.168.1.1 1 centos backup 192.168.1.2

219034
wan	lan
there are 2 networks 1 lan and 1 wan going through main and from there over isp1

219035
bash	zsh
portability needs ksh bash or zsh and a system with the gnu seq command available

219043
bash	zsh
a variation on chaos solution bash 4.0 or above or zsh 4.3.11 and above

219051
vim	gedit
looking at the contents of etc mtab the lines in there all refer to software i have installed since first booting the usb stick install namely vim full version instead of the mini one that comes with the install chrome and gedit a text editor

219072
width	height
ideally the screen size width and height of the monitor screen is

219072
width	height
where the display size width and height is in millimeters

219073
mouse	keyboard
but i got my desktop completely freezed several times screen and keyboard frozen sound and mouse pointer ok having to brutally shut-down my computer crossing my finger that loosing all ongoing work will be the only side-effect of such a brutal shutdown

219074
debian	linux
i am developing a node.js application --- which frequently crashes my debian linux kernel the computer becomes unresponsive and doesn t even respond to ping

219081
folder	directory
itself depth 1 is the files in the current directory doing -prune for them will prevent find from descending into those folder that are 8 levels deep so the 9 and above ones will never be seen

219092
filesystems	xfs
i have a xfs filesystems with many small and a couple very large files 100gb its on a lvm2 volume

219100
dpkg	aptitude
note that aptitude may be used to replace apt-get if the dpkg behavior noted above is undesired

219100
dpkg	apt
the problem is not in apt variants the problem is in the underlying dpkg implementation

219116
bash	zsh
differences from linked script i am using zsh and the remoteloginautoscreen uses bash

219126
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
how do i determine installation date when the system was first booted for linux darwin freebsd and netbsd

219127
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
currently i have to install ubuntu debian centos same problem with the driver in all distros first and then install the correct network driver add it to the kernel and then blacklist the old one

219146
init.d	pid
looking through the killproc source code it seems that if there s no pid file specified killproc searches through functions in the init.d looking for a match to the program name specified

219163
daemons	systemd
since mpd is a systemd service and pulse audio is session-based i have to stream music from mpd to the currently active pulse session daemons

219173
ubuntu	debian
instead of using privilege escalation to achieve what you re trying to do consider using a proper chroot as outlined in the debootstrapchroot documentation for ubuntu or the official debian documentation for debbootstrap

219188
ubuntu	linux
i am still learning linux this works on arch linux but i believe for at least ubuntu you may need to change the path to a different directory appropriate for your distribution

219203
opensuse	debian
i have successfully used the exact same procedure on both debian and opensuse

219206
clang	llvm
by the sounds of it lld has not matched the maturity of clang llvm yet so it isn t included in the main packages

219222
button	checkbox
but launching with something like could change gtk s pngs like button and checkbox not the color scheme

219225
debian	linux
i m running debian linux

219276
sudo	passwd
generally running sudo from scripts is not viable as it will prompt for a passwd

219276
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
it is possible to stop sudo prompting for a passwd in specific situations by editing etc sudoers

219298
vim	emacs
for the text editor obviously emacs or vim

219337
crypt	hash
this computer appears to be using the traditional des-based crypt 3 password hash

219337
crypt	hash
if the contents of the field are the valid crypt hash of some password you can log in with that password

219337
jobs	cron
the point of having user ids in the password file who can t log in is that they can still own files they can still have cron jobs and daemons can use setuid to assume that identity

219348
kerberos	ldap
whaty would be a quick way to compare the kerberos ldap files for a working client with the non-working client

219348
kerberos	ldap
surely there s a list of all the files affected affecting ldap kerberos authentication

219366
ubuntu	debian
for all practical purposes readers may replace every occurrence of ubuntu with debian in the quote above

219366
ubuntu	debian
as such the same command to add a repository that exists in ubuntu exists in debian and that is add-apt-repository

219366
binutils	glibc	toolchain	binutils
if apt-get build-dep ever states that any part of your toolchain needs updating glibc gcc binutils etc need updating stop building

219370
gtk	xlib
there are workarounds for qt and gtk but what about xlib -based applications like xterm xcalc xman xfige etc

219371
stdout	stderr
if you want to differentiate stdout and stderr in your cron job sending only stderr to the logger you can use a construct like this which i m sure others will improve upon

219397
apache	lighttpd
however it also requires libapache2-mod-php5 or php5 which is why i think it still pulls in apache while you have installed lighttpd you may have forgotten to install the matching php package

219400
folder	directory
using the sticky bit this will allow the web server to write files to the directory while also carrying the group of the folder allowing you to still access the uploads directory as your user chmod g+rws o+rwx public_html wordpress wp-content

219403
bash	zsh
because you used bash also work in ksh zsh mksh pdksh posh you can use where base is a decimal number between 2 and 64

219415
bash	zsh
an alternative approach is to ditch find and use the recursive globbing feature of ksh93 bash or zsh matches subdirectories recursively

219427
rpm	yum
are there any advantages to you yum or rpm for the same task

219448
bash	zsh
with ksh93 bash zsh mksh recent freebsd sh

219460
mouse	keyboard
for example i want to run an app which requires some mouse clicks or keyboard interaction such as installers so i could programatically send these clicks or keyboard key press signals to the app from the script until it finishes

219536
kerberos	ldap
i have several machines running debian that i m configuring to work with kerberos and ldap

219538
daemons	systemd
afaik this seems now deprecated and they returned to the package management way pbi is now a wrapper for ports and all the linux distros run in the same direction hundreds of dependencies to the very end even desktop environments are expected to depend on systemd management daemons

219538
freebsd	debian
what are the options to install a software in nix let s put it debian freebsd for simplicity in order to

219538
versioning	upgrade
keep a single certain versioning of a software running for years without upgrade and ensure that can be kept untouched regardless of the subsequent base os and libraries upgrade ala apt-get hold but forever

219542
kerberos	ldap
using a debian system with a kerberos ldap client - login fails on kde as a user directory isn t being created

219542
kerberos	ldap
in var log auth.log on the kerberos ldap server i see

219543
ubuntu	debian
however because your distro might not have static versions of libraries available debian and ubuntu don t for the most part you ll need to compile those libraries on your own to get the static versions of those libraries

219557
freebsd	linux
however i am uncertain as to whether the swap space has a special structure in freebsd and whether i need to reinitialize this structure like in linux with mkswap after zero-filling the slice using dd

219571
mouse	keyboard
so far i ve found xdotool tool which can fake input from the mouse and keyboard quite easily

219572
mouse	keyboard
i m running xrdp on my rpi and it works how it s supposed to but since the keyboard on ios behaves weird in microsoft s rdp app i would like to be able to use my iphone ipad as screen + mouse and use a small bluetooth keyboard connected to the rpi to type

219576
ansible	puppet	debconf	apt
in general you should use the distribution s package manager apt to install software and proper configuration management tools eg ansible chef puppet as mentioned in a comment or debian s local debconf to propagate site-specific information and files

219576
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
it may be too late in your case but in the future you might want to install the etckeeper package for debian which will automatically versioning control the contents of etc which makes identifying and documenting your changes including the installation upgrade removal of packages much easier

219600
ubuntu	debian
i m currently doing some work which requires me to ssh from a debian machine into a ubuntu box and run a qemu instance running minix

219610
crypt	hash
then dd that disk block s into a file replace that string with a known password hash the old crypt one - same length and write the disk block s back to the old location - possibly doing a full backup of the disk before

219613
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am using ubuntu based linux mint 17

219657
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
for rpm based distributions redhat enterprise linux fedora centos etc. doing so is fairly easy

219657
ubuntu	debian
for dpkg based distributions such as debian ubuntu it appears slightly less trivial .

219663
zsh	tcsh
tcsh and zsh also have an echoti builtin for that

219668
ubuntu	linux
i have installed ubuntu linux 14.04.2lts and added aircrack-ng for wireless auditing suite by following official docs too the ubuntu repositories aircrack-ng package was obsolete

219669
ubuntu	linux
even when they have been working very well during years some features of aircrack-ng are still considered as experimental so you need to install the svn development version to obtain them kali linux includes it but ubuntu repositories don t

219687
udp	tcp
by contrast think of an abstract socket more like a tcp or udp port number

219687
udp	tcp
so just think of the abstract socket name like a tcp or udp port number just picked from a much larger set of possible port numbers that happen to look like pathnames but are not

219689
hash	salt
this hash method is broken in that the hash calculation is relatively fast and the password is limited to 8 characters and the salt is too small too

219689
crypt	hash
you can use perl -le print crypt swordfis aa to generate a password hash for swordfis

219712
hash	salt
i have extracted the hash and the salt value from the etc shadow file and saved them in a variables hval and sval respectively

219712
hash	salt
now in order to generate a hash password using password and the salt value i need to use command given below reference

219721
joystick	keyboard
i m running archlinux and i have a weird problem my microsoft wired keyboard 600 gets picked up as a joystick and a keyboard for some reason

219721
joystick	keyboard
i d like to have the joystick part of this keyboard not even show up in dev input but still have the keyboard bit work

219728
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 14.04 lts 32bit unity

219730
debian	linux
i m on debian 8.1 fairly new to linux and somewhat confused.

219747
folder	directory
therefore my question is the following how can i organise each folder and subfolder in such a way that in each subfolder gfdl hadgem ipsl ... 4 new directory are created 1 2 3 4

219747
folder	directory
and then that the folder amazon_gfdl already present in gfdl is copied in each of those new directory and finally that amazon_gfdl1 is moved to the new directory 1 amazon_gfdl2 is moved to the new directory 2 and so on

219748
yacc	bison
in my case i am confident i resolved all discrepancies except for linking usr bin yacc to usr bin bison

219748
yacc	bison
the provided script results in yacc is bison bison 3.0.4 as opposed to

219748
yacc	bison
i ran sudo ls -il usr bin | less and found yacc and bison had slightly different inode numbers 152077 and 152078 respectively

219749
crypt	hash
you can crypt the password to verify the hash really match

219753
yacc	bison
so your file names usr bin yacc and usr bin bison are matched to different inode numbers means that those two names refer to different metadata and different file data

219753
yacc	bison
as far as your script and the almost identical inode numbers yacc and bison are related

219753
yacc	bison
the file names yacc and bison identify inode numbers only one apart probably because they got created one after the other

219753
yacc	bison
but yacc is related to bison in that it s a shell script that invokes bison

219753
yacc	bison
your script invokes usr bin yacc which actually just executes usr bin bison

219764
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
linux mint builds on top of ubuntu and ubuntu on top of debian i know that there is lmde but i am intentionally skipping it

219764
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
if someone will create a program for debian that can be installed with .deb for simplicity then it can be run on ubuntu as well as mint

219764
ubuntu	mint
i had troubles installing intel drivers on mint as they where intended for ubuntu

219764
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
now ubuntu has some stuff that debian does not have by default but probably can have by manual install but that s not the point like software-center and mint has stuff that debian and ubuntu does not have like mintupload mint-whatever

219764
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
so it would be reasonable if mint would have more packages in default repo than ubuntu and ubuntu than debian right

219764
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
debian ubuntu linux mint

219764
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
at first i thought that that can be own packages so ubuntu would have number of packages equal to itself plus debian s but that would mean that ubuntu has nearly double and mint triple more packages than debian so this looks strange too

219764
ubuntu	debian
if ubuntu builds on debian then ubuntu will always have older packages than debian right

219764
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
if i am not mistaken very much then adding all 3 repos debian ubuntu mint with their newest versions would be quite redundant and could cause problems with dependencies right

219764
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
does linux mint s repository contain everything that can be found in ubuntu s or at least 95 and same for debian ubuntu

219764
ubuntu	debian
if 5 is true then why would anyone use debian or ubuntu

219767
debian	linux
how to create installable customized debian linux

219790
lzma	lzo	lzma	lz4	lzo	lz4
squash supports any of gzip lzma lzo xz or since kernel 3.19 lz4 compression methods

219790
filesystems	btrfs
and the compression ratio you see noted there is in addition to my regular filesystems s default lzo compression - my root fs is btrfs and all files are compressed w lzo already - which is not to mention that much of downloads is occupied by downloaded compressed archives in the first place

219793
yacc	bison
bison is an implementation of yacc

219793
yacc	bison
more precisely bison -y emulates a posix yacc

219793
yacc	bison
in your case it looks like you installed bison twice once as usr bin yacc and once as usr bin bison

219793
yacc	bison
in dash ksh or bash you can use to test whether usr bin yacc and usr bin bison are the same file they re chains of symbolic links possibly of length 0 leading to hard links of the same file

219805
pthreads	fork
what s more it only puts the separate sections of a pipeline in a subshell environment which is a sort of pthreads euphemism for at least it acts like a subshell and so doesn t even do the fork

219805
bash	subshell
though bash subshell definitely are separate processes the special shell parameter is not a reliable source of this information

219835
stdout	stderr
its stdin stdout and stderr are linked to that window and they can t be changed from the outside from another process

219837
dpkg	apt
i m working a patch-set to compile dpkg and apt onto cygwin

219844
daemon	cron
i m not familiar with freebsd - is the cron daemon not named crond

219853
udp	tcp
tcp ip and udp captures can be made using tcpdump dumpcap and produces a pcap pcapng file which can be fed to wireshark for further analysis

219854
opensuse	linux
but i d like to try using some rpm-based linux distro like fedora or opensuse

219860
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
and also remind that i can only answer debian - ubuntu repo relationship since i can t catch up mint development goal and way

219860
ubuntu	debian
despite the fact that ubuntu is based on debian it only picks the packages that it wants 89 as of 2010 then modifies them ubuntu regular stable releases draw from debian unstable branch sid while ubuntu lts releases draw from debian testing branch which draws from sid

219860
ubuntu	debian
so depends on the goal some debian packages may be or may not be in ubuntu

219860
ubuntu	debian
for now 2015 ubuntu and debian are no longer compatible to use each other s repo

219860
ubuntu	debian
as i mentioned ubuntu takes most of its repo from debian sid or unstable but i prefer the previous name what is fairly up-to-date

219860
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
mint is based on ubuntu and the later un is based on debian but doesn t means they share the same dependencies

219860
ubuntu	debian
wit debian you can archive nearly perfect stability but not in ubuntu or you can t have attractive installer in debian

219889
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade a package yum sets the file permissions to the permissions that are set in the new versioning of the package

219916
xfs	umount	filesystems	xfs
kernel reported device errors overnight the 3 tb xfs filesystems was umount and now after a reboot the array won t assemble

219933
hash	salt
looking in etc shadow i can see several users that have the exact same salt and hash value and thus password

220005
hex	binary
how can i store the string fields as the binary that it is and then convert to hex

220006
octal	binary	octal	decimal
awk only does decimal octal and hexadecimal not binary

220006
bash	zsh
with bc assuming your syntax error was about the zsh operator used in a shell other than zsh or recent versions of bash ksh93 mksh yash

220016
debian	linux
another solution for a debian jessie desktop without systemd would be to look at antix linux

220027
dpkg	apt
raspbian wheezy has versions of dpkg and apt that support multiarch but i think the feature needs to be enabled explicitly with dpkg --add-architecture armhf

220028
jobs	cron
you may want to experiment with this â â either a low value the default is 100 to keep more entries in the cache so that the ones from hg aren t displaced or a high value so that the entries from nightly cron jobs don t stay to pollute ram

220029
hash	salt
setting a password with passwd or chpasswd generates a random salt so users who happen to have the same password would not have identical hash

220035
sudo	passwd
asking for the user s passwd and running as root is a basic configuration of sudo the de facto standard way to elevate privileges

220035
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
to allow user alice to run usr local bin myprogram as root with any arguments of her choice after typing her passwd use the following line in the sudoers file the sudo configuration file

220035
sudoers	visudo
to edit the sudoers file run the command visudo

220039
hash	md5
but not md5 which is broken and not a crc such as with cksum which is not a cryptographic hash two files have the same hash if and only if they have the same contents

220066
versioning	upgrade
this problem appeared after i upgrade it to a new versioning

220069
daemons	launchd
normally you can just launchd it as a daemons with

220073
ubuntu	linux
i added kali linux repositories in my ubuntu 14.04 and successfully installed kali tools like sqlmap join-the-ripple

220073
ubuntu	linux
the problem after adding kali linux repositories i found is lsb_release changed from ubuntu to kali

220118
ubuntu	mint
you probably need to point the ubuntu repositories used by mint at instead of since ubuntu 13.10 on which petra is based is no longer supported

220118
versioning	upgrade
given the lack of security support for mint 16 now though you should really upgrade to a later versioning of mint

220123
kde	gnome
in you can find gnome and kde live cds too

220150
centos	linux
i am using centos linux release 7.1.1503 core php 5.4.16 and 5.6.26 mysql community server

220180
folder	directory
or find folder since i was in the parent directory of folder

220193
emacs	kate
some applications like kate libreoffice writer work as expected with the keyboard but others like firefox emacs donâ t

220206
mouse	keyboard
a google for lenovo g500 touchpad linux returned the laptops and netbooks support page for lenovo g500 setting the component dropdown to mouse keyboard yields the following

220206
mouse	trackpad
the easiest way i ve found to trick the installer is to leave your external mouse unplugged during an install thereby forcing the installer to choose the trackpad as the only pointing device

220229
cpu	affinity
how can i set cpu affinity for the specific program say gzip to always run on specific core or cores core 1 for example

220264
putty	winscp
the router via webui 192.168.1.1 putty and winscp

220283
xfce	gnome
maybe a gnome shell like dashboard for xfce

220349
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
when downloading a large file in this case 1gib and reloading nginx via nginx -s reload the download gets interrupted in numerous browsers including but potentially not limited to opera google-chrome and firefox

220353
folder	directory
or should i just create some folder in my home directory to save them there

220368
freebsd	linux
changing configuration keeping up with a changed time zone only for freebsd and linux starting new worker processes with a new configuration graceful shutdown of old worker processes

220393
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am wanting to dual-boot ubuntu 14.04.2 lts and linux mint 17.2

220393
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have a custom built pc that i built with 2 hard drives 500 gb w ubuntu 14.04 and a 250 gb that will have linux mint on it and i m wanting to have a dual-boot so that i can familiarize myself with linux mint on a native system

220415
ubuntu	mint
i would like the equivalent in linux-based os distributions for at least ubuntu mint and elementaryos

220419
folder	directory
i need to copy this directory to other place skipping specific folder there is a lot of them

220441
filesystems	fat
presumably the external drive uses a filesystems such as a fat variant which doesn t store permissions and was mounted with all permissions allowed to everybody

220488
debian	linux
i use scp command on debian linux to transfer a file to my colleague via lan

220488
wan	lan
and when i use ping to ping wan website it works well but when i ping a lan ip address it does not work

220509
ubuntu	debian
probably a bug or just a misconfiguration i m not a ubuntu user and there s not such feature on debian this question would probably fit better on askubuntu the feature looks to me like an ubuntu customization unique to ubuntu not available on other distros

220509
ubuntu	debian
or the maintainers of the package unity-control-center i don t know if ubuntu have something like debian s bugreport wild guess

220518
xlib	xcb
even for x11 there is xlib and xcb

220549
imagemagick	mogrify
you can batch process your files with mogrify and convert from one format to another using the -path option as of imagemagick v6.2.0 to specify a different directory in which to output the processed images

220572
mouse	keyboard
my logitech hardware bluetooth hub suddenly stopped working so i am trying to connect the logitech mx900 mouse and keyboard units directly to my samsung 900x laptop runnning linux mint 17.1 rebecca

220572
mouse	keyboard
the hcitool cc command doesn t output anything at all but the keyboard is still not working and doesn t appear in the connection list that s the mouse listed above

220593
bash	zsh
i am using ubuntu 14.04 and bash for my scripts willing to switch them to zsh if necessary but would like to leave them as bash for portability

220619
width	height
you could also use the fx operator to filter images based on height width

220630
dpkg	apt
two mechanisms that can be used to place restrictions on apt s behavior are apt_preferences and dpkg blacklisting

220630
sysv	systemd
sysv init binary which can be used to boot the systemd via the

220632
move	drag
i have a soft link that was accidentally move as a result of a user drag drop operation in a filezilla ui

220646
disk	ram
basically i want to see which one is more powerful and also compare them with disk capacity ram like which machines has more disk capacity and ram as well

220658
bash	zsh
for zsh ksh and bash afaik ifs could be set to the default value as

220663
bash	zsh
and i run it with bash some_script.sh it still lists zsh instead of bash even though the interpreter used is bin bash

220663
fish	tcsh
i want to support as many shells as possible such as fish csh tcsh

220682
opensuse	mint
i found a way to make this work in opensuse and i hope it won t be too different in mint

220691
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	fish	ash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash	ash	tcsh
you could probably do it if you split into bourne sh ash dash bash ksh pdksh zsh etc. and c style shells csh tcsh fish etc. but the variation between csh variants presents various interesting challenges

220701
fish	zsh
some users would set their shell to zsh csh and variants or to fish

220701
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
as other comments and answers explain finding reliably the shell out of bash zsh tcsh fish is already challenging

220701
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
so just explain what you are doing and code for the common case of bash and perhaps zsh tcsh ..

220704
ubuntu	linux
so although there probably isn t a book released by canonical called ubuntu internals or linux internals i m looking for something as close to that as possible

220753
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
because without a valid filesystems ext3-4 ntfs fat the partions can t be mounted

220794
children	parent
there s a linux specific feature that may be used to tell the kernel to send children processes a signal when their parent dies but in your standard unix this does not take place as far as i know

220815
vim	geany	vim	gedit	geany	gedit
i don t like gedit and always use geany or vim or something else

220822
osx	yosemite
so on stock mac osx yosemite if i run vi tmp foo and then type in some text and finally do wq a common typo i make and then wq

220835
bash	zsh
with recent bash version 4 or later and zsh you could remove any backup file even deep in the file tree with

220869
dnf	yum
i m using emacs 24.5.1 via dnf formerly yum much like apt-get on fedora 22 and what worked for me was navigating to usr share emacs 24.5 lisp and running

220875
disk	ram
i see in top that they appear quite sporadically whereas each script is supposed to take at least 100 of one core without interruption there is no disk io involved no network io and no swap as of the server has around 100 gb of ram and the script ram requirements are pretty light

220877
execl	fork
process and threads fork execl pipe semaphors shared memory kill scheduling parameters nice sched_ sleep

220910
mouse	keyboard
like keyboard mouse or rs232 disk or disk-like mass storage device

221971
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
some old shells don t expand the way bash tcsh zsh etc

221972
ubuntu	debian
i found out to my surprise that meanwhile it seems any distributions nowadays - whether ubuntu or debian and even when advertised as lightweight - uses compositors requiring gpu acceleration that is hard to remove

221983
dnf	yum
dnf replaced yum in fedora 22

221990
xfce	gnome
at that time a dozen of years ago i chose xubuntu it is ubuntu with gnome replaced by xfce but it is possible that it grew fat since then i don t know

221990
ubuntu	mint
you may give it a try or opt to mint which is also an ubuntu derivative proposing xfce it adds supplementary packages installed by default mostly non-free applications for multimedia purposes like dvd

221991
gentoo	linux
install gentoo gnu linux

222016
g++	gcc
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make dkms fakeroot

222043
dnf	yum
to install nano in this case it would be as simple as doing a dnf -y install nano dnf has replaced yum

222054
ubuntu	linux
i know the network configuration matters are a rather complex thing but i am just trying to make a computer say a to act as a gateway for another say b both running ubuntu linux

222082
strlen	substr
you re only sending sizeof float bytes which is only a substr of depthstring whose actual size is strlen depthstring +1 not sizeof float

222110

debian	linux
is it possible to restrict the permissions of usb ports on a debian linux system

222197
bash	zsh
so bash ksh and zsh do tail call optimization dash and mksh don t

222198
cinnamon	gedit
if you want to remove gedit but keep the rest of cinnamon mark the dependencies of cinnamon-desktop-environment except gedit as manually installed then remove cinnamon-desktop-environment

222198
cinnamon	gedit
note that some cinnamon configuration may still believe that gedit is present and attempt to call the nonexistent binary

222202
bash	zsh
if you want that for the last path element and you re using bash or zsh you can use their command-not-found feature to invoke custom code if a command is not found

222214

if the newer libc6 was installed to support some other package then you ll need to either remove that other package or upgrade the packages related to libc6 to the appropriate versioning from the logs you give these are locales libc6-dev libc-dev-bin and libnih1

222315
width	height
having installed grub as boot manager allows the operating system linux to boot on specific video mode so the tty virtual consoles change its columns and rows width and height

222315
ubuntu	linux
but now i have an embedded linux device utilite pro from compulab and i am testing ubuntu 12.04 and kali linux v1.1.1 for it

222328
stdout	stderr
start it with make it read from something other then the default stdin dev tty dev stdin dev fd 0 + make it write to something other than the default stdout dev tty dev stdin dev fd 1 same for stderr and make sure the job isn t or doesn t get suspended stopped

222328
stdout	stderr
if your orphaned process groups aren t suspended via sigttin or z or otherwise they don t have to be afraid of the sighup signal and if they output to a file rather than the terminal on both stdout and stderr and read from a file rather than the terminal then they don t have to be afraid of sigpipe

222328
bash	zsh
i played with zsh and it turns out that while bash does behave like i described above the above described behavior should be conforming to posix.1 zsh sends sighup to running background jobs even

222405
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu was my first linux os and i chose it because it seemed to have the most support and documentation for different software

222411
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian so you may find that distribution familiar

222411
ubuntu	debian
most of the things you use do in ubuntu will work just as well on debian

222419
versioning	upgrade
it updated some packages but not too much as usual when versioning upgrade

222444
versioning	upgrade
given the order in which maintainer scripts are executed the earliest time at which the new versioning of your package can intervene is the preinst upgrade step which happens before the new package is unpacked well before the postinst configure steps

222455
sudo	passwd
in every other situation my passwd works sudo log in etc

222465
postfix	dovecot
i have postfix for smtp and dovecot for imap pop with froxlor

222475
pull	push
from what i have searched till now i only found command to push one day old data from local server to remoteserver but what i want is to pull one day old data from remoteserver to localserver

222494
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
if there s no non-hidden file it will display alone except in those shells where that issue has been fixed csh tcsh fish zsh bash -o failglob

222509
gentoo	linux
sabayon linux is an italian linux distribution originally developed by fabio erculiani that is essentially a beginner-friendly alternative to gentoo linux gentoo

222509
gentoo	linux
it is more beginner-friendly as unlike gentoo linux it works out of the box that is as soon as it is installed it is able to be used without any further configuration or software installation can be installed via a live medium for example a live cd or live usb and can install not only source software packages but it can also install binary software packages

222509
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
there is one for each of the following fluxbox called spinbase gnome kde xfce and bash minimal

222510
gentoo	linux
sabayon linux is an italian linux distribution that is based on gentoo linux but unlike gentoo it is designed to work out of the box and can work with both binary and source software packages

222522
bash	zsh
with bash 4.2 and above or ksh mksh pdksh lksh zsh you can use ansi c quoting

222538
ubuntu	linux
the four values above are from an ubuntu 12.04 machine and it looks like these defaults are unchanged from current linux kernel defaults

222540
spaces	delimiter
2.1 - for all following use one or more + spaces as field delimiter

222558
children	parent
renice-ing a parent process won t affect existing children only future children

222575
symlink	dotfiles
the major things i did was to move many of them .bash_profile .bash_prompt . aliases etc. to a dotfiles folder and symlink them to the home folder

222580
mouse	keyboard
i know that there are many questions on the internet about setting keyboard mouse multimedia keys buttons in linux nevertheless my question is more specific

222580
mouse	keyboard
i want to assign to two mouse buttons the same actions which are assigned to the volume up down keyboard keys

222587
mouse	keyboard
if you have access to a computer that can run logitech s mouse setup software you could make the mouse s usb keyboard component send multimedia-key presses i think with autorepeat instead of handling it in software on the gnu linux side

222587
mouse	keyboard
idk how to set up autorepeat for mouse buttons mapped to keyboard keys as you ve done

222606
apache	nginx
most people go with nowadays nginx udev apache rsyslog syslog-ng etc but it s possible was preferred back when file paths could only have a few characters

222609
freebsd	solaris
it will also work on freebsd or solaris but for another reason

222609
freebsd	solaris
however on freebsd and solaris pipes are bidirectional

222621
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
now i want to uninstall ubuntu and install linux mint 17 instead

222625
solaris	aix
producing products like xenix aix and solaris

222634
mouse	keyboard
i tried adjusting the turbo boost multipliers in the bios setup hint use the keyboard navigation you can get to settings that you can t select with the mouse and setting this to 45 made i7z report the turbo boost multipliers as 45x 45x 45x 45x

222640
filesystems	xfs
i assume that s a swift term and isn t talking about making 100 different xfs filesystems on each sata disk

222662
folder	directory
when the installation script of catalyst starts running it detects the architecture of our computer and look for the following folder in the following order if architecture is x86_x64 will search for the usr lib64 directory if the directory does not exist then use the usr lib for installation

222662
g++	gcc
apt-get install gcc g++ make dkms fakeroot

222685
bash	zsh
zsh bash

222695
dnf	yum
after i followed this guide with slight adjustments for the debian system as the guide is for red hat-based systems using the yum dnf package management system both guest systems were able to run seamless mode no-problem

222698
tiff	png
i want to resize convert or resize + convert images in jpeg png and tiff in each direction jpg â tiff tiff â png etc

222723
hash	md5
my idea was to find all the files build a new file name based on the md5 hash of their file path and copy them to a new directory they aren t very large and i may not alter the originals

222727
folder	directory
i am trying to delete a folder environment tests from my home directory

222738
ubuntu	linux
this is on ubuntu linux

222775
udp	tcp
http is connection-based the traffic would have to be transported from tcp to udp hello overhead

222795
folder	directory
but now while being in docs folder i want to move to it s parent directory media mtk study collage in this case

222808
stdout	stderr
file descriptors 0 stdin 1 stdout and 2 stderr are all standard fds used by all programs

222825
stdout	stderr
in your program by default file descriptors 0 stdin 1 stdout and 2 stderr will be associated with the terminal unless you use redirection or pipes in the command you use to invoke the program

222835
solaris	aix
i know ipcs command for linux system but now i m looking for ipcs command for solaris hp-ux and aix system i have searched lot in websites almost everyone suggest ipcs -am ipcs -as or ipcs -a

222835
solaris	aix
but when i execute this command in aix solaris and hp-ux i got nearly the following output from all these system

222875
filesystems	xfs
this will work for ext2 ext3 ext4 filesystems as well as reiserfs and xfs

222887
bash	zsh
bash can set the failglob shell option to behave like zsh in this regard

222888
mouse	keyboard
when i m remoted in the local desktop is open - so i need to put the mouse keyboard under the desk so people don t accidentally type into my session

222904
ubuntu	openbsd
i have a bash script i would like to run on two different computers one is openbsd with the program sha256 the other is ubuntu with sha256sum

222907
sudo	passwd
vagrant user should be able to run sudo commands without a passwd prompt

222924
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu based systems x11-common package actually provides such a symlink

222935
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	fish	ash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash	ash	tcsh
gnu parallel quotes any string in ash bash csh dash fdsh fish fizsh ksh ksh93 mksh pdksh posh rbash rc rush rzsh sash sh static-sh tcsh yash zsh

222935
bash	zsh
which does not need quoting in bash but needs it in zsh

222952
libc	ldd
but still openssl is taking up gcc as the c compiler.so on running ldd on the final dynamic executable it is showing up libc dependency

222983
mouse	keyboard
the basic use case i have in mind here is network transparent keyboard mouse pen midi events

222983
mouse	keyboard
if i plug in a usb keyboard our mouse how do i capture the events from it and for them not to go to any other process

222983
mouse	keyboard
how can a program generate virtual keyboard and mouse events as if a user physically used a probably usb keyboard mouse on that machine

222986
mouse	keyboard
it s software for sharing your mouse and keyboard between multiple computers on your desk

222998
stdout	stderr
this will work as -v will only send successful removed â fileâ or dir output to stdout while all others go to stderr

223006
folder	directory
how could i run a process dostuff such that it can only access files folder in the directory somedir

223014
innodb	myisam
- the database is huge and includes both myisam and innodb tables

223030
folder	directory
zip the contents of a folder without including the folder itself - this post guides to changed the current directory and then create the archive

223049
ubuntu	linux
well this is not really a specific ubuntu s problem but i only experienced it on linux ubuntu so i ll ask it here

223069
disk	ram
in my specific case i had used something like the above to unify several layers including a ram disk for temporary writes

223075
disk	ram
if you want to do it explicitly though you can create a ram disk

223075
disk	ram
foo is the location you want to mount the ram disk

223089
stdout	stderr
in unix-world stdout is generally used when everything is working correctly and stderr is generally used to print messages when something goes wrong

223089
stdout	stderr
by default stdout and stderr both print to your screen

223089
stdout	stderr
the main difference is that the and | operators catch stdout by default but not stderr

223090
folder	directory
apparently a bug in the firmware flipped the bit in the directory entry for the file making the os think it s a folder instead of a file

223090
folder	directory
if there s someway to flip the bit or whatever that says an ntfs directory entry is a folder vs a file i d like to know about it

223098
daemons	launchd
the challenge for supervisor is these scripts launchd a daemons process and detach where supervisor expects things to run in foreground without a fork

223134
persistent	transient
it consumes memory but any disk usage is transient use of swap space that would not persistent across a reboot

223143
redhat	fedora
fedora redhat centos

223143
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

223154
uptime	reboot
if you need to track the system uptime behavior try tuptime it report the historical and statistical running time of the system keeping it between each reboot

223160
cinnamon	gedit
that s why on them apps mutter overrides cinnamon s window manager aka muffin - in your case gedit using mutter instead of muffin so it looks different from other applications

223160
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon
about the tilling maximizing with apps using mutter i think some how cinnamon can t recognize them correctly and count the shadow as a part of the window i m using xfce and don t have no problem with tilling gnome apps

223160
debian	mint	debian	linux
solutions you might want to upgrade cinnamon i think you re using debian jessie with cinnamon 2.2 which came out before the time header bars introduced so an upgrade to debian testing with cinnamon 2.6 might help or switch to linux mint or lmde

223185
spaces	delimiter
then the read builtin reads the filenames delimiter by the nullbyte and finally mv replaces the spaces with an underscore

223203
ubuntu	linux
what i wondering can i change somehow under linux ubuntu redhat the name of processor like in windows by registry edition

223218
bash	zsh
on linux and with openjdk at least the value returned by exitvalue is the same as what a shell like zsh or bash and most sh implementations but not ksh93 or yash would assign to its variable

223254
debian	linux
install smbclient on your linux host on debian you can do it with sudo apt-get install smbclient

223259
kerberos	ldap
i m switching some servers over to debian 8 and using realmd for active directory ldap kerberos authentication

223261
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon
i have tried using xfce and gnome to see if it was a cinnamon issue

223261
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome chromium or opera all bring up the same issue

223273
postfix	dovecot
what you want can be achieved by reconfiguring dovecot or postfix

223285
jobs	cron
cron jobs run with only a few variables set and those not necessarily to the same value as in a logged-in session in particular path is often different

223313
disk	ram
as far as i understood which is not saying much.. os partitions were only disk partitions not ram partitions

223317
post	get
i couldn t get to mount them since there was some header bytes added to those images by mkimage as i was told by some blog post

223331
x86	64bit
more recent 32-bit x86 cpus can access more than 4gb of physical memory through a processor feature called pae .â¹ 64bit x86 cpus always have pae

223331
cpu	processors
to find out whether your processors is a 64-bit one run grep -w lm proc cpuinfo â if a line with flags â lm â appears you have a 64-bit cpu

223340
post	get
using the solution from another post here i have been able to get mostly what i want

in a 7-state process model new ready blocked running blocked suspend blocked ready exit are processes in the blocked and blocked suspend states for each event that processes are blocked on put into the same queue or are they seperate

223368
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
is this only a problem of gnome distros or kde and xfce has the same problems too

223402
vim	emacs
for easily specifying remote files for editing with vim or emacs from the shell i would like to have tab-completion like available for scp

223419
debian	linux
yesterday i have set up wifi connection on my bananapro with bananian a linux distribution based on debian 7

223443
hex	binary
that being out of the way i was wondering if it is possible to view the binary of a file in the 00101000 form and edit it i am able to view it but in the hex form and i am looking to view and edit it in a the 8 digit form i have been able to view it in the correct form just not edit it so i believe it is possible thanks for any help and sorry if it is a stupid question

223443
hex	binary
so moral of the story trying to view the binary in the 8 digit form and edit it rather then the hex

223465
switching	screens
using the gnome settings i can add the dvorak keyboard layout and switching between with the shortcut key but whenever start the computer the login screens has the qwerty keyboard set

223469
mutt	thunderbird
i m thinking about moving from thunderbird to mutt as my email client

223476
folder	directory
your home folder contains two directory you own home sougata and home sougatapc

223479
chown	sudo
you don t need to sudo or chown because both directories had the same numeric uid owner

223488
pop-up	dialog
i use an android device to connect to it the dongle doesn t support sspmode so on the pi i launch bluez-simple-agent on another shell to wait for the pin when i connect from android a dialog pop-up with a random pin i enter it on pi and everything seems fine android show pi is paired great

223566
udp	tcp
the above iptables config will only let tcp and udp packets get past the firewall unless they came from loopback

223566
udp	tcp
there should be no weird packets from loopback so only tcp udp packets are allowed in

223566
udp	tcp
e.g. there are fundamental differences between the purpose of transport layer protocols like tcp and udp and application layer protocols like smb

223581
put	get
i have since formatted my storage drive and removed the data windows put into my efi partition yet when i go to my boot menu in my uefi the windows boot manager is still an option i can select and when i do so i get an error stating there s a problem preventing windows from booting

223613
folder	directory
on my home box i have a folder structure with directory names like this images yyyy-mm-description sometimes there are subfolders with varying names below

223704
ubuntu	linux
a quick search revealed this a very detailed guide on how to setup vpn on kali linux and ubuntu

223721
ubuntu	linux
i recently learned that my ubuntu linux file system may cache the result of some commands such as searches sorts and perhaps build commands such as make

223758
ubuntu	debian
although john the ripper has been packaged for debian and ubuntu it seems that as of august 2015 the packaged version doesn t actually work

223760
folder	directory
this recursively finds all directory in the current folder

223760
folder	directory
for each directory it finds up to 10 files in exactly that folder -maxdepth 1

223760
folder	directory
i also accounted for directory and folder names with spaces by quoting and having find print each filename within quotes using the -printf option

223771
folder	dir	folder	directory
suppose your master directory is tmp dir from which you want to archive only n e.g n 10 files of each sub folder under it to a backup.tar.gz file

223771
folder	dir
this will create a backup.tar.gz with 10 files of each sub folder from under tmp dir

223779
post	get
i m gonna post my findings because this might get higher in the google search results

223782
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
it is a web server immediately kill all apache nginx lighttpd processes

223784
ubuntu	linux
when one tries to dual-boot a linux distro say ubuntu with a pre-existing install of windows or other oss the installer detects the presence of the other os

223835
stdout	stderr
i want to catch the output of all the commands to both stdout and stderr

223882
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
is this ordering accepted by posix or just accepted by many shells in my fedora 21 it is accepted by bash dash tcsh ksh and zsh

223887
for-loop	loops
the for-loop will loops into the list of the files it got in the find command and will clean them out with a cat dev null

223908
bash	zsh
if you can t use zsh but have access to bash the shell of the gnu project you could do

223950
folder	directory
but when i try to access the folder i get cannot open directory media sambashare permission denied

223955
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
question is there some systemd feature for launchd systemd daemons only once the desktop is fully up

223965
sudo	passwd
so i wrote sudo echo user passwd | chpasswd

223975
sudo	passwd
in your case sudo echo user passwd | chpasswd the sudo is applied only to echo which is incorrect

223979
ubuntu	linux
unlike the debian-installer the menu-based thing that the ubuntu installer is based off of the arch linux installation process is entirely manual so the command line is what you should see

223983
daemons	systemd
there s no such facility in systemd - because this sort of logic really belongs inside of daemons

224001
emacs	gedit
and check later that tmp batchstart.stamp exists and look inside it using some editor like emacs or gedit or pager like less

224018
ubuntu	debian
dvips is provided by texlive on ubuntu debian at least

224045
switching	screens
adding slim i still get a black screens at boot but then if i switching vt and back i ll get it to display properly

224062
post	put
i made such a long post about it i dont want to put all the detail in here

224070
debian	centos
note that in centos 7 lib security does not exist and is thus not the location of pam modules as in steve s link which is for debian

224102
stdout	stderr
grep without any option will generate an error message on stderr as usual and you are piping the stdout of grep to stdin of crontab which is blank hence your crontab will be gone

224130
udp	tcp
syslog traffic over tcp not udp

224131
ubuntu	debian
installing a reasonably recent version of eclipse on ubuntu as its upstream debian requires a manual install downloaded directly from the eclipse website or a ppa if one can be found

224160
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my system and got a new versioning of the gnupg2 package 2.1.7-2 previous was 2.0.28-2 and i ran into problems when trying to use my private key encrypt decrypt sign messages in enigmail since then

224186
dpkg	apt
note assuming one uses apt dpkg for package managing

224219
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
you will have to enter your passwd for sudo as per usual unless you alter the etc sudoers file using a sudo visudo command in the following way

224219
sudo	passwd
note that this modification will make it so that no sudo commands need a passwd system-wide

224255
ldd	glibc
my ubuntu 14.04.3 lts has glibc 2.19 according to ldd --version

224270
ubuntu	debian
i recently installed debian 8 on my workstation which before ran ubuntu 15.04 but after debian 8 came into my life i have not succeeded in running ssh with x11forwarding

224314
cat	tee
this is completely false dd and cat and tee and the others all read bytes from their input and write the bytes to their output

224411
stdout	stderr
note however that in that case all of stdin stdout and stderr are redirected to that pty

224424
disk	ram
also disk i o time is a lot slower typically many thousand times for sdd and nearly a million times slower for mechanical hard disk than ram

224431
multiplying	add
and if you don t you suffer the achey slow performance of sata but multiplying it by 6 and add some contention in there

224439
unix	bsd
bsd added the fsync system call so a program could be certain that its file data had been completely written to disk before proceeding and subsequent unix systems have provided options to do synchronous writes

224452
waitpid	posix
note that you need to have a posix compliant waitid to be able to use this feature so mac os x and linux currently don t offer this but the waitid is emulated on the waitpid call so on a non-posix platform you will still only get 8 bits from the exit code

224452
freebsd	linux
freebsd fixed their waitid kerlnel bug within 20 hours after my report linux did not yet start with their fix

224458
stdout	stderr
redirects both stdout and stderr in this case to the logfile

224473
bash	zsh
in bash version 3.0 2004 and above ksh since ksh93r 2006 and zsh version 5.0.6 2014 and above

224488
daemons	systemd
otherwise if the daemons forks and you set then the whole thing will triple-fork not double-fork and systemd will kill the daemons

224491
sudoers	visudo
you can edit etc sudoers with the visudo command and add this line

224497
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu systemd based systems it gets propagated to child getty processes by definitions in lib systemd system getty .service

224511
subnet	vlan
- the vlan id for the subnet 10.0.20.0 24 is 12

224518
ubuntu	mint
here s my typical workflow for installing ubuntu mint

224521
filesystems	ntfs
i recommend to use a more modern filesystems like zfs that supports the modern acl standard that was derived from ntfs and is now standardized in the nfsv4 definition

224539
unix	aix
it is the modern character encoding standard in the unix world in general and it is the default on ubuntu but it might not be the default on aix

224546
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and flash work perfectly on my computer in windows 7

224552
cinnamon	gnome
working with linux mint cinnamon and gnome terminal how do i use the term colors files available from here

224602
freebsd	linux
i have been reading from advanced programming in the unix environment stevenson and rago and i am currently reading about how user data is stored on various systems including linux freebsd and mac os x

224602
freebsd	linux
one of the interesting things mentioned was how various user data like uid and passwords on freebsd and mac os x don t follow the same storage format as etc passwd and etc shadow on most linux distributions

224630
debian	linux
i have several linux mostly debian servers running on a proxmox platform

224673
debian	linux
description debian gnu linux 7.6 wheezy

224692
bonjour	avahi
this question is different because octopi uses avahi aka bonjour here s a how-to and all the docs and videos refer to octopi.local thereby implying that we re working with a dns name

224711
sudoers	passwd
if i run it as a sudoers how do i handle the periodic requests for passwd

224711
sudoers	passwd
or does the fact that it is in a shell script mean that you only have to give the sudoers passwd when you first call the script

224714
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if you require sudo for a particular step then you ll either need to set your id up with a nopasswd flag in sudoers or accept an interactive prompt for your passwd during the script s execution

224733
sudoers	passwd
note that i want the user to provide the root passwd and not being a sudoers

224739
debian	linux
debian defaults to su because it s part of the base system â under linux there s an su program both in gnu coreutils along with ls cp etc. and in util-linux along with mount fdisk taskset etc.

224741
g++	gcc
you can only get so far with gcc and g++

224741
g++	gcc
i don t usually use gcc g++ for anything

224766
debian	centos
i am trying to migrate a number of user mail accounts from dovecot 1.0.7 on a centos 5.11 server to dovecot 2.1.7 on a debian 7 server

224766
debian	centos
is there a way i can import the mail from the source centos server to the destination debian server without forcing the user to potentially having to sort through and delete hundreds of duplicate emails

224775
mouse	keyboard
after my laptop comes back from suspend and i log in via lightdm i have to use the mouse to open a terminal then type on the command line before my keyboard is responsive

224785
bash	zsh
but as jakuje noted in the comments you probably want to go with arrays if your shell has them ksh bash or zsh

224800
filesystems	fat
the other common place where this is particularly visible is with the mtools package which is a userspace fat filesystems implementation

mounting the floppy and using the kernel fat filesystems is much more responsive except for umount which is synchronous and very important for it to be that way to prevent data loss especially for removable devices like floppies

224809
folder	directory
i am looking for a way to move folder that are not already present in the target directory on my linux server

224809

xfs	btrfs
xfs ext4 btrfs and zfs all use it

224881
jobs	cron
doing a search on the net yielded me headache nauseating results about cron jobs modifying scripts or installing wi-fi managers

224903
solaris	bsd
this means that on many oses including linux distributions with newer versions of the kernel and of libpcap as well as bsd os x and solaris the kernel will buffer up packets until either its buffer fills up or 1 second has elapsed and will deliver the entire buffer of packets for efficiency

224910
installation	upgrade
upgrade was of 2 gb and after 1 gb download i wanted to download openssh-server so i did an apt-get install but an upgrade message was shown apt-get upgrade since it required only 74mb 1gb download i preferred to do it first and after installation i rebooted my laptop and was welcomed with this message

224932
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a supported versioning of ununtu

224932
versioning	upgrade
but as your versioning is no longer supported you can t easily upgrade in-place but would rather need to install over

224938
versioning	upgrade
as huygens suggests though you should really upgrade to a supported versioning of ubuntu

224943
versioning	upgrade
i suggest you not to download the upgrade instead go to kali linux offical site and download the newest kali linux versioning and re install it

224958
debian	linux
we have a linux server running debian 4.0.5 kernel 4.0.0-2 with 32g ram installed and 16g swap configured

postgresql	mysql
note that this is just an example i have seen this happen to redis amavis postgresql mysql java openjdk and others

224966
kde	gnome
however while i know that gnome supports touch and high-res very well i d like to know whether it s supported too in kde

224977
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade my versioning which is natty 11.04

224990
bash	zsh
this question is about zsh not bash

224993
gtk	jhbuild
i am trying to compile gtk from source and have installed jhbuild for this purpose

224993
jhbuild	pygobject
i ve already managed to build pygobject using jhbuild and the sanitycheck runs without output

224993
gtk	jhbuild
for building gtk it seems that jhbuild needs gnutls version 3.0 as it states in the terminal

224993
gtk	jhbuild
now i thought jhbuild would surely run fine until the next error in the build process of gtk but that wasn t the case

224999
gtk	jhbuild
i am trying to build gtk using jhbuild

mouse	keyboard
i had this issue with an sharkoon drakonia mouse a couple of years ago and while the mouse is supported by the linux kernel by now the detachable keyboard of my new medion p2213t is not

225016
for-loop	loops
when the script reaches the for-loop with no arguments the start of the list is the same as the end and loops s condition is false

225035
ethernet	wireless
when i m at my desk i want to be hooked up to the network via ethernet and when i want to sit on the back deck i d like to be on wireless

225050
for-loop	loops
to loops this over multiple html files in the same working directory you can use a bash for-loop with wildcards

225127
wan	lan
i have only one ethernet card em0 and i want to open a port on wan but not on lan

225127
wan	lan
in all the examples i ve seen that separated wan and lan it was with two nics and freebsd played the role of an intermediate a firewall

225127
wan	lan
there will be some ports that i want open in both lan and wan but i want to impose some limits on wan

225134
sudoers	passwd
on a brand-new install of linux mint latest version fwiw and whenever i want to do something that requires root privileges change date time update-manager ... it asks me for root passwd which does not work as i have none instead of my own passwd which would work as my users is in sudoers

225135
sudo	passwd	put	get
if you don t start with sudo it will ask you for root privileges and the only way it can get those is to have you put in the root passwd

225137
centos	linux
i m quite new to linux i m running centos 6.7 and i m trying to follow best practice procedure of creating a user instead of using root but i want to restrict their ssh file browsing capability to their home directory

225162
filesystems	fat
i remember old floppys - they were 1.44mb but with a ms-dos fat filesystems they could only hold 1.38mb

225190
awk	ksh
if you have any bourne-derived shells available to you sh ksh mksh ash dash bash you should consider reimplementing your work in one of those or use a more complete scripting language such as awk or perl

225192
wan	lan
rate-limiting wan but not lan say for example you want to rate-limit traffic from the internet on ports 80 and 8080 but impose no rate limiting from the lan on those ports

225192
wan	lan
this snippet would track and block abusive wan hosts while permitting access from the lan

225200
disk	ram
once you ve rebooted into the new kernel if you re satisfied that it works you can delete the old kernel and initial ram disk file and remove its entry from elilo.conf

225217
hash	md5
when it comes to passwd user-password-crypted statement in a preseed file most examples use an md5 hash

225217
pbkdf2	md5
for instance is pbkdf2 supported or am i limited by the algorithms used in etc shadow that is md5 blowfish sha-256 and sha-512

225219
put	get
hence if i only put the following in my personal crontab without setting shell to bin bash via crontab -e i expect that once per minute the script will be executed and i therefore expect to also get the above error sent per mail once per minute

225219
daemon	cron
from root myhost.com cron daemon

225225
ubuntu	debian
this has been asked a lot about on ask ubuntu but i didn t find a solution for debian yet

225270
stdout	stderr
based on my reading of the vixie-cron source it would seem that the job s stderr and stdout would be captured by cron but it must be getting lost by the subshell

225281
stdout	stderr
so it seems cron waits for the child process s exit then send a mail with all stdout stderr output it can slurp at that time

225290
ubuntu	debian
i use to enjoy watching my red hat then debian then ubuntu machine boot the boot process was not hidden from my view now it is in most of all distros now i know i can somehow connect a terminal to a serial port and see the boot process but i m not sure what happens after the gui starts also pressing the esc key during boot in ubuntu shows some info what i m looking for no big deal if i have to setup another computer just for the task is to vew all the stderr or whatever the name for that is like a constantly refreshed dmesg command

225295
debian	linux
since the archbang bootloader works download the linux and initrd.gz files into it from the 64-bit debian netboot installer and manually add a corresponding item to the archbang boot menu or invoke them from the bootloader command line

225303
daemons	systemd
i want to use this user to run a daemons on my systemd

225318
sudo	passwd
i also tried the passwd for the current user who is member of the sudo group but that also fails

225321
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my mint i m using 64bit versioning on cinnamon

225331
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i cannot boot up any linux distro i have tried mint ubuntu and elementary os

225335
ubuntu	mint
if i want to see those messages hidden by x i change to the console with ctrl + alt + f7 on mint ubuntu might be different

225347
gentoo	linux
the host is running gentoo gnu linux 4.1.5 openrc

225348
dpkg	apt
if you remove packages using dpkg that won t appear in apt s logs

225362
redhat	fedora
for example on an rpm-based system redhat fedora centos etc

225362
ubuntu	debian
similarly for apt-based systems debian ubuntu etc you can use

225392
ubuntu	mint
given these parameters i finally chose mint also based on ubuntu as i liked their 2 main popular desktop environments - cinnamon mate

225405
wav	flac	mp3	flac	mp3	wav
flac m4a mp3 ogg_vorbis wav tracks with tagging renaming charset

225414
ubuntu	linux
anyway i am guessing that your first linux distribution was ubuntu

225414
ubuntu	linux
step 1 boot and login to ubuntu 14.04 or your first linux distro

225414
ubuntu	linux
so if you had installed any linux distribution after that boot into ubuntu and run sudo update-grub to tell grub of the changes made to the hard disk

225451
post	get
i see a lot of post out there that say you type in sudo su to get an interactive prompt with root privileges and i see equally many post debating the pros and cons over sudo -i vs sudo su

225458
ubuntu	linux
but in most modern desktop- linux distributions for example ubuntu the root user is disabled and has no password set

225459
ubuntu	debian
i thought not debian or atleast ubuntu and descendants will automatically find all swap partitions on all mounted-at-boot disks and allocate swap correctly by default

225474
sudo	passwd
sudo su sudo -i and all other sudo requires the users passwd

225475
rpm	yum
also use rpm directly you can just use yum downgrade blah.rpm

225476
mouse	keyboard
if i attempt to select either through mouse or keyboard the text would appear

225494
freebsd	linux
i have been using gnu linux for several years and now i am giving freebsd a try

225494
freebsd	linux
the disk on which i installed freebsd contains another primary partition which is used by gnu linux

225494
freebsd	linux
using fdisk under gnu linux i set the type of one partition to a5 freebsd i wanted to install freebsd on this partition slice

225497
folder	directory
this works fine and both users user1 and user2 are able to see their own nfs-test directory under their home folder on the client machine

225497
folder	directory
home shared_homes here each user has a folder which is exported to all clients and which is automatically linked in to its home directory

225503
ubuntu	linux
i run matlab and emacs on a linux server and use ssh and x forwarding so this all shows up on my local ubuntu laptop

225522
postfix	dovecot
it is running dovecot and postfix

225522
postfix	dovecot
i have tried re-installing postfix and dovecot with no success and google was of no help

225523
sudo	passwd
the su command can only prompt for the target user s passwd assuming a default pam stack while sudo can be configured to authenticate as the source or target user or neither or always root - and can do so per command

225527
wan	lan
this is because i want to enable lan users to connect unencrypted but wan users to connect only encrypted

225534
rpm	yum
for static network settings like yours you may want to install networkmanager-config-server rpm package using yum

225587
ubuntu	debian
2gb a debian jessie server with plenty of services running about 3gb a working ubuntu image with remote desktop i leave the os reside in var lib lxc and use a separate partition for the container s data

debian	centos
i am currently running centos 7 and debian jessie with gnome

225636
post	get
but if your script would be longer i recommend to do this in more commands using controlmaster as ansible does it otherwise you will get lost in all the quotes backslashes and stuff you can see in your post

225655
apache	nginx
every article i find about web servers suggest creating a sites-available and sites-enabled directory within apache nginx etc

225682
spaces	delimiter
using spaces as the delimiter does not align the columns properly

225683
mouse	keyboard
then i discovered xdotool which was able to emulate mouse clicks as well as keyboard key presses

filesystems	btrfs
given a path filename on a btrfs filesystems how can you see the other reflinked path filenames to the same file

225781
ssd	sata
i found out that my ssd actually only supports sata speed 3.0gbps with a good shell script

225781
ssd	sata
in the grub configuration set the sata port of the ssd drive to maximum speed 3.0

225781
ssd	sata
changed the parameter in this line to allow only 3gbps for sata port 7 my ssd

225801
folder	directory
note that it doesn t work with as alias for home directory you need to specify the folder explicitly

225802
daemons	systemd
to debug a jack pulseaudio issue i want to understand when and why the pulseaudio daemons is started by systemd on fedora

225802
daemons	systemd
i see that the pulseaudio daemons is being started by systemd pid 1

225802
daemons	systemd
a is there a way to determine the systemd unit that caused the creation of a specific process in my example output process 2738 the pa daemons

stdout	stderr
a posix reference unix systems without dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr

225813
bsd	aix
well the -mmin primary is a gnuism that is most likely not supported on aix as it is a silly expansion compared to what the bsd people and i used as extension in the 1980s already

225852
sudo	passwd
there the issue was with entering passwd on sudo -v and here it is about commands not allowed by the config

225855
daemons	systemd
a is there a way to determine the systemd unit that caused the creation of a specific process in my example output process 2738 the pa daemons

the usb should have a fat32 filesystems insmod fat

225913
debian	linux
i m using matlab r2015a under debian linux

225918
google-chrome	firefox
installing it with yum immediately fixed the problem although you have to use firefox because google-chrome doesn t support the protocol they are using

225944
folder	directory
i want to create a directory in my public_html folder that includes read write access for everyone so that i can easily create files there via php scripts executed when a user loads a web page

225951
bash	zsh
with bash and zsh and ksh93 but that s it an alternative is to do

filesystems	btrfs
this is a mount point vm-data is dev sda3 which is a btrfs filesystems

folder	directory
for info liba.1 and liba.2 are version of a directory content of this two folder may be almost same and there can be more such folder

226039
debian	linux
in my debian linux terminal some fonts looks like this

226040
subnet	packets
meaning of this information is that the routing system knows that packets to this subnet should be routed to this interface

226040
subnet	packets
additionally subnet defines broadcast address so that the host knows how to send broadcast packets and when to accept packets which have several 1 s in the end of the address

226041
debian	linux
distro debian gnu linux 8 jessie

226067
filesystems	btrfs
then during boot systemd waited 1 minute and 30 seconds apparently for the btrfs filesystems to appear on a disk with completely different layout

226076

the issue is when i put the lid down i cannot seem to wake the computer up again all i get is a blank screen

226168
postfix	dovecot
i ve succesfully set up postfix and dovecot at my home server to use maildir as the mailbox storage format

226178
vmware	virtualbox
note i haven t had success with opensuse 13.2 using virtualbox or vmware 12 xen or kde qemu

226185
versioning	upgrade
it has the advantage to be a rolling release so you don t have the problem to upgrade to a new versioning every 6 to 12 months and you always get the latest software a few days after they are released by the upstream

226185
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
also you might be interested in fedora ubuntu or linux mint which also provide virtualbox 5 and are more ready to use and user friendly

226207
bash	zsh
zsh also made the change earlier than bash from zsh 4.3.4 in 2007

226227
sudo	passwd
now you can close the original tab which is waiting for your sudo passwd

226257
rpm	yum
i have a limited understanding of the yum package system but i do understand that once the rpm is created then it can be put into a repository for deployment

226277
vim	emacs
both emacs and vim work properly in a text console

226282
disk	ram
maybe i don t mind my applications loading slower from the drive but want it to occupy ram immediately without the lag time to unmap memory from disk caching

226282
disk	ram
how can i limit how much ram my disk cache is taking up

226287
folder	directory
i need this folder to become an svn repository so my friends and i can edit everything straight on the production server with no need to copy it from the repository directory

226325
ubuntu	linux
i need to boot ubuntu or another linux distribution less than 10 sec

226343
ubuntu	debian
you can use prename rename perl script comes with perl package in debian ubuntu

226351
ethernet	wireless
the ethernet works fine when logged into windows but when i log into ubuntu the connection icon right on the top tray shows the wireless icon and it s searching for wireless connections i have no wireless connections configured so this icon shouldn t even show up no

226351
ethernet	wireless
i click on the ethernet and it just closes the dropdown and just continues searching for wireless connections as if i never clicked it

226376
xfce	kubuntu	xfce	kde	kde	kubuntu
there s xubuntu xfce kubuntu kde and lubuntu lightweight

226376
ubuntu	linux
all the ubuntu flavors install ubuntu-standard and ubuntu-minimal to give you a bootable and usable gnu linux system underneath whatever graphical desktop they launch by default

226379
debian	linux
iceweasel is provided by the linux distribution that offers it debian

226392
filesystems	fat
a symbolic link may refer to files on a different filesystems even to a filesystems which does not itself support hard or soft links like fat

226393
versioning	upgrade
a remaining problem will be that no easy upgrade route is available when a newer versioning of openssl is released

226394
dnf	yum
when you run yum history or dnf history it will give you the list of action starting from the last most recent action being on top of the list

226394
dnf	yum
is there a way to list yum dnf history in ascending order so the latest step would be at the bottom of the results

226396
filesystems	fat
when i connect my usb with fat filesystems to fedora and after that when i try to connect it to my windows 8 machine it says that drive is corrupted or data is unreadable

226403

226423
solaris	bsd	centos	solaris
so how much more effort this would need to work in fedora centos free bsd and solaris

226437
sysv	systemd	solaris	bsd
ps is an especially not-portable command especially if you intend to use bsd gnuisms on a sysv systemd solaris

226450
puts	gets
just before it runs a program in your example stty bash puts the terminal back into canonical mode where you have just a few special editing characters available courtesy of the operating system such as backspace and control-w and basically the program gets input only after you type enter

226454
min	max
and do the runs like a 100 times each with the min max avg and standard deviation

226455
vpn	wlan
did it by using opposite idea - routed all except direct user to vpn instead instead of routing direct user to wlan interface

226456
debian	linux
it used to work when i used the trisquel linux distribution but now when i have switched to debian it does not work

226472
128bit	64bit
id will get too big or id size must be allowed to grow 32bit 64bit 128bit â

226486
tar	gunzip
based off the book it uses gunzip -c httpd___.tar.gz | tar -xf -

226486
tar	gunzip
am i supposed to do gunzip -c httpd___.tar.gz | tar -xf - c home downloads httpd_source__xxxxx

226488
sudoers	visudo
in sudoers visudo

226488
chmod	sudoers
bin bash to fix you got one of the paths wrong in sudoers you forgot one of the chmod commands your wireless interface is not called wlan0 use ifconfig or ip link to find out and then rename all mentions of wlan0 to whatever it is your interface is named or of course you re missing a dependency

226495
ubuntu	debian
this is also the case on debian derivatives such as ubuntu

226496
ubuntu	linux
are the mdoc macros commonly used to create bsd manpages commonly available on non-bsd systems such as ubuntu and other gnu linux distros

226505
switching	screens
the select command allows switching between windows in a screens session

226518
ubuntu	debian
i looked on 3 sample os s i have ubuntu 14.04 debian 7.8 fedora 21 and they

226553
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
given the fact that in the early 1990s sun did even donate the old a.out based code solaris at that time was already elf based to the freebsd people and that this code later was handed over to many other systems including linux you may understand why there is no big difference between platforms

226564
curses	readline
this line editor is useful it s what lets interactive utilities that use neither readline nor curses to read complete lines of input from the terminal while allowing the user to make typing corrections

226600
debian	linux
it seems debian based linux s have wlan soft-blocked by default

226612
ubuntu	debian
eg not in openssh_6.0p1 debian but ok in openssh_6.6.1p1 ubuntu

226618
rpm	yum
i am not a root user so whenever i try to use the yum utilities to download and install the rpm files it demands root access

226627
daemons	launchd
it runs its applications using sudo launchd by my regular user and accesses my regular user s pulseaudio daemons and my regular user s x server via xpra

226628
rpm	yum
i am not a root user so whenever i try to use the yum utilities to download and install the rpm files it demands root access

226638
stdout	stderr
when connecting to a host with ssh usually three pipes are provided between host and guest for stdin stdout and stderr

226673
udp	tcp
the external script then needs to send data to that clients socket via tcp or udp in json using the following format

226675
stdout	fflush
here we would be executing an empty command but actually using it for the fact that awk fflush its stdout before running the command

226681
redhat	fedora
redhat based fedora centos sl ...

226681
ubuntu	debian
debian based ubuntu ...

226692
filesystems	ntfs
i guess it does not do this based on partition type codes seen in the gdisk output because those would be 27 hidden ntfs win for partitions 1 5 6 7 and for example ef efi for dev sda2 but in parted output there are clearly different filesystems listed

226697
filesystems	fat
the filesystems information shown by parted is not terribly accurate the above example shows as fat filesystems but it s actually being used as md-raid luks lvm

226701
dlsym	dlopen
you tell the compile-time linker that you want to link with libdl from which you then using the first method can call the dlopen and dlsym functions

226701
dlsym	dlopen
with dlopen you get a handle to the library which you can then use with dlsym to receive a function pointer to a particular function

226732
vmware	virtualbox
i m stuck at setting up fencing and i m not sure if it possible to setup fencing stonith on virtualbox or vmware workstation as according to some documentation i m referring to it requires special hardware like hp ilo management board ipmi management board some special network switch

226768
jobs	cron
i assumed that cron was the only way to achieve my goal but i was wrong because cron is for starting background jobs

226775
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade versioning 13.10 to 14.04

226787
freebsd	solaris
note that the original iconv implementation on solaris was is in libc and i guess that freebsd did put their new code into libc as well

226788
next	except
now we could just block entirely all other ports except for 80 and 443 if the next line is as such

226821
debian	linux
i want to build a linux debian live usb stick to modify my partition tabel

226825
ubuntu	mint
in order to boot into mint i have to hold f12 while booting select my hdd and then select ubuntu or ubuntu from a list of items which brings me to grub

226841
ubuntu	linux
use a live linux cd or dvd i suggest ubuntu live and repair the grub or reinstall it

226853
daemons	systemd
the conclusion is that number 1 would be an ideal place to store scripts that are run by a systemd daemons service

226867
opensuse	linux
you need special software to do that dd linux command utility or if you new to shell use something as opensuse image writer to write the iso

226868
daemons	systemd
its job is to manage and load all systemd services daemons or whichever startup programs you defined

226871
vmware	virtualbox
this is usually a problem that occurs with virtualbox for me but this time it resolves the issue with kali 2.0 on vmware

226877

226917
ubuntu	debian
i decided i wanted to set it up to do some routing and installed debian on it then when i couldn t get it to see my second network adapter i decided i d try ubuntu in case they had some better non-free driver solution going on but it didn t work any better

login works fine but then - if lan is connected on my machine i cannot access any websites except the local intranet websites

226948
lan	intranet
if i turn the lan off and use the wifi connection i can access both intranet sites as the web itself also

226961
unix	solaris
solaris takes its queue from i think unix 7 the rc scripts ie run command scripts as does oses

226967
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
config linux mint 17.2 based on ubuntu debian

226971
bash	zsh
note to figure out what will eventually be executed when you enter a command under a posix or bourne shell sh ksh zsh bash ash dash etc. make sure you use the type command and not the which one

226979
xfce	cinnamon
i have installed many desktop environments on my debian8.1 such as cinnamon mate lxde xfce

226993
dpkg	apt
there are two suggested configuration options to install post-install hooks into debian s apt dpkg system dpkg post-invoke 1 and dpkg post-invoke-success 2

227014
sudo	passwd
you have to provide the sudo passwd only once

227068
sudo	passwd
i want to run a bash command at startup .config autostart mycommand.desktop that requires sudo but rather than it prompting me every time i would like to include the passwd in the command something like

227076
bash	zsh
for zsh bash -o globasciiranges strangely named option introduced in bash-4.3 schily-sh and yash matches on the characters whose code point is between that of a and that of z so would be equivalent to the behaviour of bash in the c locale

227076
bash	zsh
adding multi-byte support to shells like bash and zsh has been a huge effort and is still ongoing

227106
hash	md5
i am looking for shell scrip in unix to replace the first word of each row with its md5 hash representation

227106
hash	md5
but it what this solution returns for md5 hash value looks wrong

227122
ubuntu	linux
iâ m working in a manufacturing company small one and one of our clients required a test using a linux ubuntu computer we are testing some wi-fi modules

227122
sudo	passwd
inside a terminal use command sh mfg.sh file provided by them which has sudo inside so it will require passwd the first time used

227122
sudo	passwd
like just double click it it opens terminal do his thing and closes also it would be the best to not be ask for passwd to use sudo

227125
sudo	passwd
next configure sudo to not need passwd for the required commands

227126
ati	nvidia
i have done most of my testing on arch linux with an intel graphics card but have also tried ati and nvidia cards without any luck

227128
freebsd	debian	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	debian
newer derivatives of the openbsd netcat including freebsd 1 and debian 2 support a -d flag which prevents reading from stdin and fixes the problem you described

227138
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
didn t test other distros such as debian ubuntu or mint but i would think they should all work the same

227140
wpa	dhcp
the line iface default inet dhcp tells the wpa supplicant to configure and activate each default network with dhcp upon a successful connection to an access point

227142
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
is it possible to install all of freebsd openbsd netbsd and dragonfly bsd on a single disc

227143
switching	screens
i have to run specific commands to put my hdmi screens to standby and switching it back on

227161
debian	linux
in fact the default rules of udev in debian and most other linux distributions already does this for you

227164
ubuntu	linux
i know the darwin kernel is based on unix but will all the linux system calls behave exactly the same on osx as they do on let s say ubuntu

227195
debian	linux
i m using debian gnu linux 7.8 and would like to have pdfxcview.exe as the standard application to open pdfs

227225
ubuntu	centos
i ve found a lot of guides on how to install the required libraries on systems such as ubuntu fedora and centos see for example an answer on superuser

227229
umask	sudo
brush up on the use of umask file folder permissions possible use of sudo local per user elevated privileges or if you wish to use ad a combination of pam modules supporting nis krb5 and ldap

227239
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if you are happy that the support users should not need to provider their own passwd to run the tool as requested by the sudo invocation within the script itself you can amend the sudoers definition thus

227258
xfce	gnome
i ve been running gnome v1 and v2 and use xfce now

227285
installation	upgrade
the upgrade process is very careful about what it does and how it writes files to disk so your installation should be ok depending on how exactly you stopped the process...

227305
stdout	stderr
if the line fails to execute i m worried the user could end up with stderr and stdout redirected leaving their terminal unusable

227309
folder	directory
and so currently the items directory consists of the count01 folder as well as several other items that was the same contents as the ones in count01

227319
debian	linux
i am trying to install linux debian on a new laptop

227324
unix	aix
this works on all unix platforms since 1982 except for aix alien unix

227350
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i gave ubuntu zorin mint kubuntu linux lite elementary os and few others a try some time ago but they all needed too much tinkering to get it to the way i want

227352
gentoo	debian
you can also trust other people - like gentoo or debian or fedora or any other distro developers

227373
bash	zsh
by portable i mean ideally something that shells not as powerful as bash or zsh wouldn t choke on

227394
daemons	systemd
it seems systemd-journal-gatewayd daemons was introduced in systemd version 193

227394
daemons	systemd
i m running debian jessie with verison 215 of systemd but do not have this daemons

227411
zsh	subshell
in this case zsh store all jobs in a table when you enter a subshell and will use that job table if there s no jobs in subshell

227423
switching	screens
i ve noticed in particular that this fails when i remove my laptop from my docking station and switching to the laptop screens instead of my monitors because this also seems to cause the keyboard layout to be reset to plain us english without altgr-intl

227453
ubuntu	linux
i have tried them in ubuntu linux

227517
ubuntu	debian
as a temporary workaround i downgraded to tar v1.26 from here if you use debian ubuntu download your corresponding .deb version and install with dpkg -i it s pretty straightforward and it worked for me

227560
filesystems	btrfs
i have a btrfs raid-1 filesystems with 2 legs

227571
cpu	hyperthreading
i am aware that i need to pick a cpu with vt-x amd-v support and i would benefit from hyperthreading but how do less high-frequency cores compare to more lower-frequency cores in hypervisor environment

227577
kate	kde
i m thinking that if i have the kde editor kate installed in software kate bin x86 bin kate then i m ok with having to type the full path to the binary to start it

227583
centos	linux
so im using linux oess centos

227588
disk	ram
you must configure dhcp on a server such that when your system boots up it provides a pointer to a kernel image and an initrd initial ram disk image usually via tftp

227588
udp	tcp
ipsec will encrypt an entire ip stream while a socket-based solution will require that nfs use tcp not udp

227648
hash	md5
could i pass it to a file that is atleast md5 or better hash and protected to increase security but make the command require no user input

227664
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
so to answer the security part of my question chmod 0600 sudo chown user nogroup will prevent unauthorized access to file once created

227670
debian	linux	cinnamon	gnome
whats the desktop environment in kali linux 2.0 sana i am to able understand because they have some mixture of gnome + cinnamon and tell me how can i do this with my fresh debian installation

227685
ubuntu	debian
if you want pure apt-get i d go with debian minimal or maybe ubuntu server edition if you want ubuntu packages

227687
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
however apt-get is mostly used on debian or ubuntu - there are many other package managers pacman is used by arch portage is used by gentoo etc

227712
ubuntu	debian
edit in case you don t have mentioned man pages if you re using ubuntu or debian you might want to install manpages-posix-dev

227807
versioning	upgrade
because of this i can t install an old kernel versioning and then upgrade since it needs an internet connection

227809
ubuntu	debian
fedora 22 alpha has got it debian and ubuntu also

227821
sudo	passwd
needs the current user sudo passwd user to change and their passwd

227889
vim	emacs
i installed cygwin and also added some useful packages gvim nedit emacs vim g++

227910
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
it does not matter on what linux distro i built it and it will work on debian archlinux ubuntu opensuse .

227918
ubuntu	linux
does ubuntu 15.04 or maybe just linux in general have any sort of measurable event that fires when a laptop s ac power is disconnected and the unit flips over to battery power

227931
ubuntu	debian
i am trying to list all the ffmpeg processes that are currently running on debian machine ubuntu 15

227934
bash	zsh
use zsh or bash interactively and don t use csh for scripts

227947
stdout	stderr
that output is writen to the ternminal not printed to stdout or stderr

227984
centos	linux
i ve installed postfix on the linux server centos 5 and setup as follows

227987
mouse	keyboard
i like to connected an external keyboard and mouse to it whenever i can and i put the keyboard over the embedded keyboard

228009
ubuntu	debian
if the vbuf package debian ubuntu is there then the file sender will show a data progress

228020
mp3	wav
i ve been trying to search around for a audio transcoder for linux where i can set specific presets maybe batch transcode say a wav file into diffrently converted mp3 files using diffrent codecs bitrate etc

228035
cpu	hyperthreading
for instance your cpu has 8 cores but with hyperthreading they become 16 so you have 16 vcpus

228043
solaris	bsd	opensolaris	bsd
ibm has some general unixish installers that have shocked me by working everywhere i have tried them several linuces from several kernel generations opensolaris or whatever it is called now solaris and bsd

228058
ubuntu	debian
g++-arm-linux-gnueabi package is provided by gcc-defaults-armel-cross in ubuntu 12.04+ or cross-gcc-defaults in debian unstable sid

228063
folder	directory
how to set default file permissions for all folder files in a directory

228073
freebsd	linux
according to this post can stat be used to give the atime on linux but freebsd 10.1 doesn t have the gnu stat

228085
folder	directory
using scp myusername university_computer home myusername filename home myname folder results in the error message home folder no such file or directory

228091
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
i was wondering about the different types of keys you can create with ssh-keygen -t dsa | ecdsa | ed25519 | rsa | rsa1

228101
udp	tcp
consequently the tcp udp port pools don t matter

228106
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this dongle is worked with ubuntu linux mint even in arch previous installation

228107
stdout	stderr
if the log file is being created by output to stderr or stdout and if you can control the way in which the program creating the log file let s call it bar is started start it with which will redirect all standard outputs or error messages to dev null

228147
jobs	cron
one of them is fcron which adds lots of extra ways to describe when to run jobs including the very useful don t run two of these jobs simultanuously something traditional cron isn t capable of

228157
rsa	dsa
you generally can t compare key sizes across algorithms but between dsa and rsa the strength is about the same

228157
rsa	dsa
it s significantly faster than rsa or dsa for the same security level and has smaller keys

228157
ecdsa	rsa
ecdsa support is less ubiquitous than rsa partly because it s newer and partly because of patents on efficient implementation techniques

228157
ecdsa	rsa
so the default rsa is fine but if you use less powerful computers low-end smartphone router â prefer ecdsa or ed25519 if supported

228167
jobs	cron
then most ways to log in but not cron jobs execute a login shell which reads system-wide and per-user configuration files

228170
debian	linux
kali linux 2.0 is based on jessie and is from now on a rolling release where they pull packages from debian testing

228180
versioning	upgrade
from what i read one cannot upgrade from -32 to -64 and there are no versioning of 7.x-32 on the centos site so i did a new install

228216
folder	directory
i have a directory which has folder of everyday and every folder has 1000 of images in it

228220
disk	ram
besides the disk firmware disk caches and kernel ram caches if you can also employ the systems cpus in some way to concentrate the amount of data exchanged per burst then you should do so

228223
filesystems	fat
the last step is to create the fat filesystems

228225
stdout	stderr
but not stdout nor stderr which can lead to confusing printing in the terminal when the background process print some messages

228260
selinux	jail
does it make sense to use selinux inside a chroot jail

228260
selinux	jail
is there still a benefit of using selinux inside a chroot jail

228269
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	xfce	kubuntu	google-chrome	firefox
in linux mint xfce 17.2 that is the same os different de it is normal one that is the one that i prefer and have on the other systems that i tested ubuntu unity lubuntu manjaro kde5 and netrunner kde5 kubuntu 14.10 kde4 windows 7 and 10 and this no matter the browser firefox google-chrome

228269
google-chrome	firefox
the same happens in google-chrome and firefox it is system specific

228269
xfce	kde
i have even tried to see if the same difference is present between firefox for windows installed under playonlinux in lmint xfce and lmint kde yes the same difference

228303
debian	linux
i haven t been able to get this linux setting to work in xfce-terminal evidently because it requires termcap which is not in debian repositories anymore not even the compat package that used to be there until 2005

228313
chown	sudo
if you want to change ownership of the file to root just do sudo chown root root somefile though i m not sure how that will affect processes with an open filehandle to it

228362
ubuntu	linux
i use bootable linux ubuntu 15.04

228378
sudo	passwd
caveat - these users are ldap d and my account bypasses the enter passwd prompt when sudo su ing

228390
udp	tcp
it listens on tcp and udp port 53 for queries

228396
for-loop	loops
so it can break at 3 for-loop inner loops breaks

228413
hid	keyboard
i have a usb rfid reader which acts as a hid - pretending to be a keyboard

228424
folder	directory
i have created a directory for it in the root home folder and given chmod 777 permissions to this directory so that anyone can write there but no luck with this

228461
kde	gnome
there s a million ways for something to trigger a shutdown including gnome kde networkmanager and of course systemd itself

228463
umask	mkdir	777	tmp
if my shell s umask is 022 then mkdir -m 777 tmp foo can only work as expected if it s first calling umask internally to zero out the umask it inherited from the shell.

228476
umask	chmod
if for security reasons you never want to create an object with temporarily higher rights than intended chmod without umask isn t enough either

228476
chmod	mkdir	umask	mkdir	umask	chmod
in some corner cases you have to use even both resulting in the rather ugly sequence umask mkdir chmod umask

228476
umask	chmod
so --mode can be replaced with chmod and umask but not with only one of them

228518
ubuntu	debian
the debian and ubuntu mdadm package contains the file

228570
freebsd	solaris
freebsd or solaris tr don t have the problem

228596
dnf	yum
if you are using fedora 22 or later where dnf has replaced yum as the default package manager then you can use this command taken from here

228645
ubuntu	linux
i am an ubuntu user for some time now and i am thinking of trying some other linux os

228645
debian	centos
after extensive search i decided to try either debian or centos

228645
debian	centos
both debian and centos are said to be very stable so some of the packages featured in them are old versions

228645
versioning	upgrade
so if a program has a bug or a security vulnerability and one must upgrade immediately to a newly released versioning will i be able to do so or i will have to keep using the problematic versioning

228645
versioning	upgrade
as far as upgrade go newer software versioning or system bugs security upgrade etc. does those operating systems get automatic upgrade as ubuntu does once in a while or the only way to upgrade either software packages or the system will be to install the newer versioning of the os when it is be available

228654
ubuntu	debian
i moved from ubuntu to debian a couple of years ago and never regret this decision

228654
versioning	upgrade
this is a difference to ubuntu where you have to upgrade to the new versioning every once in a while to get new software

228654
ubuntu	debian
coming from ubuntu you might want to consider that debian is more similar to ubuntu to be precise ubuntu is built upon debian

228654
ubuntu	debian
both debian and ubuntu use apt

228654
centos	linux
centos is a derivate of red hat linux and uses rpm instead

228659
for-loop	arrays
the outer i for-loop is for looping over the entire arrays and pointing

228663
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian - so your best bet would be switching to debian

228663
ubuntu	debian
please note that they are rare - ubuntu has fixed development cycle - debian doesn t

228664
sudoers	visudo
modify etc sudoers preferably using visudo and add line

228669
filesystems	xfs
inode numbers may change though again depending on what filesystems xfs ext4 ufs...

228683
ubuntu	debian
debian or ubuntu

228687
openbsd	freebsd
after spending two gruelling days trying to get freebsd to recognize my realtek card i decided to give openbsd a try

228690
dumpsys	adb
i ve a string android.permission.camera to match in the output of adb shell dumpsys package

228690
dumpsys	adb
consider this example if i do adb shell dumpsys com.google.android.googlecamera i would get

228690
dumpsys	adb
in the original command adb shell dumpsys package you would get to see the permissions et al of all the apps installed

228690
dumpsys	adb
complete dump of adb shell dumpsys package or

228788
voip	xmpp
voip although i never tried it with xmpp

228793
bash	zsh
further more sh refer to posix sh does not support array strictly speaking it has only one array you need to call other shells on your system which support array like bash zsh or ksh

228823
uninstall	upgrade
if i do a sudo apt-get upgrade -f it tries to uninstall critical applications

228824
put	get
however if i try and put this into a variable which i want to use later i get this error

228847
debian	centos
the root directory on centos 6 has permissions 0550 but on debian 7 it is 0700

228847
debian	centos
further usr local on centos has permissions 0755 while on debian it is 2775

228852
folder	directory
creates a directory named .cat_installer in your home folder

228924
bash	zsh
most shells including bash and zsh will get you a secure temporary file automatically when you request a here-document

228935
width	height
character height and width are in dots

228942
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
most development packages in debian and derivatives including ubuntu mint etc. are called lib name #-dev where name is the name of the library collection which is not always the name of the specific library you link with for example the libc6 package includes other libraries such as libm and # is a version number

228960
put	get
is used to insert before the current line otherwise as you start on the first line and put insert after the current line you d get an empty first line

228988
mouse	keyboard
i know i can use xinput to disable my mouse and keyboard and i usually type three commands every time i plug in my keyboard and mouse to my keyboard

228988
mouse	keyboard
so is there any way i can automate it so whenever my keyboard is plugged in my computer will run the top two commands and when my mouse is plugged in my computer will run the bottom command

228988
mouse	keyboard
same with re-enabling the devices when my mouse keyboard is unplugged by running xinput reattach

229000
postfix	dovecot
i have successfully installed postfix dovecot with virtual domains and tls support like this article describes -

229030
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
socks5 supports tcp and udp traffic but not icmp as far as i know

229035
subnet	packets
1 - allows you to have multiple network interfaces on the same subnet and have the arps for each interface be answered based on whether or not the kernel would route a packets from the arp d ip out that interface therefore you must use source based routing for this to work

229042
fish	bash
in fish ... is for command substitution the equivalent of in bash

229066
trojan	virus
first of all i m not sure you can be over confident of the ctrl + alt + del login window on windows this is also the role of a virus trojan to hijack interruption and implementing it is very possible

229073
ubuntu	centos
we test this on ubuntu 14.04 and centos 6.6

229090
dnf	yum
in my case it happen whatever i try to do with yum or dnf

229091
xfce	kde
in kde the menu is triggered with right-click in xfce with left-click tested in mint

229104
bash	zsh
if you need it to be recursive you can use for bash zsh can do this by default use set -o globstar in ksh93

229127
folder	directory
how do i find all files in a folder and its subfolders terminated with 3 digits and move them to a new place while keeping the directory structure

229131
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux 12.04 is the version i learned on which was super easy to understand and use

229201
virtualenv	tox
if you are using virtualenv and or tox you should consider making the package s you develop dependent on my ruamel.venvgtk which does setup those links on installation including the ones for gtk in case your use pip for python2

229221
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i m running debian gnu linux 8 jessie and my wireless problems also occurred when trying ubuntu and linux mint debian version also but works fine with windows 7

229236
sysv	systemd
even for distros that ostensibly used sysv init systemd had shell functions that were distro-specific

229284
tftp	telnet
i know how to tftp with telnet over wifi but i m feeling that i get a lot of errors because i m running iperf simultaneously

229290
udp	tftp
tftp is a protocol that runs over udp ip so you need an ip network

229290
tftp	telnet
how to tftp with telnet over wifi

229290
tftp	telnet
tftp and telnet are two separate protocols that run over ip and have nothing to do with each other

229290
tftp	telnet
i don t know what you mean by running tftp with telnet

229290
tftp	zmodem	xmodem	zmodem	ppp	tftp	ppp	zmodem
then honestly xmodem and zmodem will be much better options that running ppp and tftp on top of that

229295
debian	linux
i m following this guide to install snort on my debian linux

229327
packets	pcap
other programs like hexinject tcpflow and tracedump all use pcap so they delay a bit before displaying the packets

229328
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
i cannot load kde xfce or any desktop environment other than gnome in my fedora 22 system

229336
solaris	bsd
...except that it s not bpf-specific so it s not restricted to bsd os x and solaris 11 and uses --immediate-mode rather than -b and it s already in the standard tcpdump 4.7.x releases so if you have tcpdump 4.7.x or later you don t have to apply the patch

229361
bazaar	git
this is exactly the job version control software like git bazaar or subversion is doing plus a little bit extra

229385
spaces	delimiter
the -d specifies the delimiter a spaces and the -f the field number fields being separated by delimiter

229404
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
you could install less via macports or homebrew or fink

229413
ubuntu	mint
on ubuntu you should give command as sudo service lightdm restart after the ctrl alt f1 i think you can find easily the analogous for mint

229421
debian	linux
could anyone please help me with this its my first time on debian and i am new to linux as well

229426
spaces	linefeed
this sets the fields separator to the linefeed character which stops the for-loop from splitting up the files on the spaces or tabs it s technically possible for a file to have a linefeed in its filename as well you re unlikely to ever encounter such a file and it won t cause serious problems in this case if you do run into such a file but it s worth being aware of the possibility in case it ever does matter

229451
x86	64bit
ubuntu mate is currently available for four architectures pc intel x86 64bit pc amd64 mac powerpc and ibm-ppc power5 and raspberry pi 2 aarch32 armv7

229455
installation	downgrade
for example if you need full support for 32-bit code ... is just wrong since ubuntu supports 32-bit package installation even on 64-bit systems so there is definitely no need to downgrade to 32-bit just because you need to install some 32-bit software

229455
x86	64bit
more importantly x86 arguably designates both 32-bit i386 and 64bit amd64 or x86_64 systems which makes it confusing terminology

229474
filesystems	btrfs
i want to free up some space in my btrfs filesystems by deleting some snapshots

229476
ubuntu	debian
i m copy a sed script form ubuntu debian to osx but getting

229477
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux v14.04 on desktop computer

229486
filesystems	btrfs
if dev sda1 is a btrfs filesystems with subvol s root and persistent

229486
filesystems	btrfs
and i ve mounted dev sda1 subvolid 0 to btrfs so i can access all the other subvols yes now exists as a duplicate btrfs root which i find desirable so everything in here is treated as being on the same filesystems

229487
bash	zsh
this works in shells with arrays ksh93â¹ mksh bash zsh

229487
zsh	subshell
but in most shells att ksh and zsh excepted both sides of a pipe run in a subshell so the variable assignments are lost outside the pipe

229487
bash	zsh
alternatively in ksh93 bash or zsh you can pass the input in a process substitution

229487
bash	zsh
if you want to store the words in an array you can use read -ra words in mksh ksh93 and zsh or read -ra words in bash in bash

229517
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
currently i boot other latest linux like centos ubuntu using unetbootin

229517
centos	linux
so is it either possible to run my system through any latest linux like centos instead of that old one

229519
rhel	suse
i have done this with fedora rhel mint suse and mageia so just take your pick

229528
centos	linux
i have dual booted linux centos with windows

229535
stdout	stderr
if your process has a controlling tty then dev tty is a driver alias to the real tty driver your process is using for stdin stdout or stderr

229537
rpm	yum
on minimal installation you still should have yum thus you should also have python and rpm python package

229552
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
i ve always been running chmod chown commands as a sudo user

229552
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
but today i wondered if i don t use sudo what permissions do i need to actually execute chmod chown command on a folder file

229593
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
not all filesystems support extended attributes ext2 3 4 xfs btrfs do but they require a mount option which might not be the default on your linux distro

229598
daemons	systemd
this special file unlikely is used significantly by systemd software but dev console is virtually an â œaliasâ for tty0 and dev console has much use by syslog daemons and sometimes by the kernel itself

229621
udp	tcp
if the packet is tcp use -j reject --reject-with tcp-reset for udp and other port-based protocols use -j reject --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable

229646
sudo	passwd
i want to be able to run a sudo command inside of a bash script but i was wondering what if i want any user in my server to be able to execute the script without to provide them with my root passwd is this possible

229677
stdout	stderr
and then accepting the location of stdout as stdin and also redirecting stderr to stdout 2 1

229712
octal	binary
so a umask of 222 or 0222 which are the same since the number is traditionally octal is 010010010 in binary

229735
debian	linux
i have never seen some guest additions for linux or debian

229744
sudo	passwd
so currently i must enter sudo passwd twice - i don t want that

229755
sudo	passwd
you will then be asked for the sudo passwd only once

229761
bash	zsh
that syntax at t ksh zsh and bash specific is only needed if you re looking to reuse a result from inside the loop though

229812
google-chrome	firefox
also an idea is that using certain internet browsers seamonkey epiphany etc - but not firefox and google-chrome an youtube title could be dragged and dropped onto mpv or a mpv fron-tend to play youtube videos

229824
folder	directory
for each file or directory in the current folder print the modification date in seconds since the epoch s and the file name n and end each line with 0 instead of n

229841
ubuntu	debian
which works on my debian ubuntu system

229856
bash	zsh
i tend to jump between zsh and bash on a few of my own machines

229872
centos	linux
i am running all this on a rocks cluster the linux version is centos 6.5 and the job scheduler is sun grid engine sge

229887
centos	linux
i am experimenting with linux and my work uses centos 6.5 so i am using that at home

229897
debian	linux
for the first time in my linux debian career it seems necessary for me to compile a piece of software myself

229908
width	height
the reason c2 1 and c3 0 for me is that in my situation the height is fine so i only need to scale and shift the width

229909
width	height
the reason c2 1 and c3 0 for me is that in my situation the height is fine so i only need to scale and shift the width

229916
tunnel	lan
to do so you need a host on the internet you can establish a tunnel to so you can route traffic into your lan

229920
stdout	stderr
your record.py probably writes either to stdout or to stderr at some point

229930
put	get
similarly if i print out count_array i by itself i get 66964 ...but when i put them both in a string the count_array number gets thrown into the start of my string and overrides the error part

229939
sudo	passwd
i can use sudo sshfs 192.168.0.102 mnt sshfs which pops up with root 192.168.0.102 s passwd however the passwd is not the unix passwd that i m able to set up through the passwd command on the beaglebone

229939
sudo	passwd
i know that the sudo passwd and su passwd are different and i can t login to su without using the command sudo su on the beaglebone

229940
sudo	passwd
when you use sudo you type the passwd for your account not the root passwd

229946
bash	zsh
i keep chroots with older debian releases to get a range of versions of various software my personal configuration should in principle work with bash 1.14 and zsh 2.5 though i haven t used versions that are that old in years

229946
bash	zsh
you can share some things between bash and zsh mostly aliases and some functions

229946
bash	zsh
bash completion functions can be used with non-ancient versions of zsh

229989
centos	linux
centos linux release 7.1.1503 core

230038
ubuntu	linux
context a wifi vpn gateway linux ubuntu computer

230038
ubuntu	linux
simply one distant server www.example.com and one client paul ubuntu linux gateway linked with openvpn

230093
put	get
this is usually where things get put if you run the standard autoconf incantation from a source tarball

230099
zsh	shellcheck	bash	shellcheck	bash	zsh
shellcheck is a static analysis and linting tool for sh bash ksh zsh scripts

230101
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
you ve not mentioned which linux distro you re running but i know lib4j is available on ubuntu and redhat centos

230108
mouse	keyboard
disabling it seems problematic for linux users as it requires microsoft s mouse and keyboard center which is only available for windows xp to 10 and os x version 10.4-10.7

230109
mouse	keyboard
download the mouse and keyboard settings software

230109
mouse	keyboard
open the mouse and keyboard settings and look for the vibration setting towards the bottom

230109
mouse	keyboard
i searched github and google for open-source alternatives to microsoft s mouse and keyboard settings but have yet to find anything

230109
mouse	keyboard
you could try running the mouse and keyboard settings application under wine but i have yet to test that

230119
ubuntu	debian
this is a fedora system but it is the same on ubuntu and i notice on raspbian a debian variant it also links to libncurses itself

230136
ethernet	wireless
so computers a and b are connected via ethernet through a switch and computer a is connected to another network 192.168.1.0 though a wireless router 192.168.1.1

230145
debian	mint
i use debian mint

230162
ubuntu	linux
i have been given a computer with arch linux i am used to ubuntu

230164
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu starting with udev 220 you can enable the new names by renaming this file

230171
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i was wondering what is the difference between mint linux and ubuntu in regards to something other than the interface

230171
ubuntu	mint
what other major differences are there between ubuntu and mint

230175
ubuntu	mint
mint actually uses ubuntu s repositories for most of the packages you d install

230175
ubuntu	mint
so outside of the things which mint specifically overrides in their own repository mint is ubuntu

230178
ubuntu	centos
the predecessor is centos and the successor is ubuntu

230181
ubuntu	linux
but if i do the same with linux ubuntu 15.04 then after inserting it the second time i get warning messages in the log like

230181
put	get
and if i subsequently put it in a windows pc i get a message popping up prompting me to check it for errors

230183
jobs	cron
i am using a script to create cron jobs in .tmp crontab.txt which is then moved to var spool cron under the user apache

230183
jobs	cron
i would prefer all cron jobs be created under one user as i am the admin and sole user of this server

230193
x86	64bit
if you re emulating 32 bit x86 i might suggest trying to emulate the 64bit version of the same software and testing if it occurs there too

230194
ubuntu	linux
many linux distros can be used in ram using a live install i had fedora ubuntu and derivatives on a pendrive once just check if the live of that distro offers persistence so you ll be able to keep modifications

230199
daemon	cron
the cron daemon doesn t read the new files if you just copy them

230199
daemon	cron
it also signals the cron daemon to read the files

230223
vpn	wlan
how do you do to route bind such a configuration to access vpn server from wlan through eth

230225
centos	linux
on the server where it works on login runs scientific linux release 6.7 carbon on the server where it does not work runs centos release 6.6 final

230229
ubuntu	linux
is it possible to set up from scratch a linux server ubuntu as i m more comfortable with that on laptop that has no keyboard display ethernet or usb ports all damaged - without any hardware fixing replacement

230230
bash	zsh
on a 50mib file here i can see for instance bash being 6 times as slow as ksh93 but slightly faster than zsh and twice as fast as yash

230232
mouse	keyboard
questions concerning use with server having no monitor keyboard or mouse

230234
ubuntu	linux
install linux ubuntu in your case

230237
switching	screens
i m trying to get my banana pi pro to switching between 1920x1080 and 1280x720 resolutions on an hdmi screens

230252
ubuntu	mint
for example i m most familiar with ubuntu but also am familiar with mint and fedora

230252
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is a flavour of debian

230262
ubuntu	debian
relation is not really ubuntu is flavor of debian

230262
ubuntu	debian
in fact ubuntu and debian are separate project sharing same package manipulation tools building from similar sources actively sharing improvements

230262
ubuntu	debian
but you can say that during creation 10 years ago ubuntu used debian as base but that is different thing from being flavor

230262
freebsd	linux
talk about unix if you want to talk about whole class of unix-like operating systems like macos freebsd linux

230264
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is most certainly not a flavor of debian

230264
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is not a debian so it can t be a flavor of debian

230264
ubuntu	debian
for example canonical takes debian adds its own packages and tweaks and calls it ubuntu

230264
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
mint takes ubuntu adds its own things and produces linux mint

230264
unix	bsd
this includes unix linux osx bsd and various other operating systems

230265
debian	linux
variants with linux arguably the most important debian are called â œdebian gnu linuxâ

230265
debian	linux
not all debian os variants are linux

230265
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu technically is a modification of debian not its flavour

230289
ubuntu	mint
i have a predefined version i m successfully using on other systems running ubuntu or mint

230295
chown	chmod
i m trying to set my local computer which has linux mint 13 maya so that i can chmod chown any file with my regular max user account

230295
chown	chmod
i got the locations for chmod and chown using which

230295
sudo	passwd
i then open a new shell tab and try to sudo chmod a file which is owned by a different user group and it asks me for a passwd

230310
filesystems	xfs
so while xfs for example was supported back in the time of the release this filesystems has evolved in the meantime but grub did not follow with a new release

230323
sudo	passwd
they just give you a pretty gui way to enter the passwd like you do with sudo

230323
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
otherwise you could edit etc sudoers to allow anyone to run it without a passwd then have a double-clickable shell script that contains sudo gizmo.sh

230330
stdout	stderr
my next understanding is that the three main file descriptors stdin stdout stderr need to be closed to prevent

230344
ubuntu	linux
i can access the camera from the given camera manager but it is not listed as webcam or any kind of camera under linux ubuntu 15.04 x64

230383
umask	chmod
umask -s to get the inverted mask as a chmod like symbolic mode

230391
stdout	stderr
the problem turned out to be redirection of stdout and presumably stderr

230395
hash	md5
however barring unusual circumstances like if you re playing around with md5 hash collisions that will mean they had the same contents so you don t lose any data anyway

230398
debian	linux	postfix	dovecot
i have a debian linux box hosted on the cloud that i want to provide mail services with postfix dovecot

230404
sysv	systemd
however i m now using a distribution angstrom that uses systemd rather than sysv so i need to know how to get equivalent functionality there

230404
sysv	systemd
i was under the assumption that since i have systemd and connman the old ways of doing things sysv sysv init etc network interfaces pre-up post-up pre-down etc. were unavailable to me or at least superseded

230424
debian	linux
you will need have linux kernel header installed you can usually get them from packages linux-headers-x.yy.zz-your_arch on debian

230432
ubuntu	linux
like an idiot i plugged in the sd card to my ubuntu machine it automounted both boot #1 and the linux file system #2

230437
disk	ram
there s a little more overhead in ram disk space cpu and maintenance but it s still very much doable

230438
folder	directory
i am using rsync to backup some folder in my home directory to a remote server using the following commands

230454
mouse	keyboard
monitors that share a common keyboard and pointer mouse tablet

230471
centos	linux
my centos vps displays linux or gnu linux depending on what i run

230518
ubuntu	linux
i have configured the things for a standard ubuntu installation preparing a partition for linux remove windows fast boot

230525
ubuntu	linux
if you want to try btrfs especially in raid-5 or 6 stick with the most up-to-date linux distributions arch linux latest ubuntu fedora etc.

230525
filesystems	btrfs
one note about your use case your btrfs filesystems is rather small compared to the size of the files you put in

230538
folder	directory
but then it takes the whole directory structure and places it into the lib folder

230538
folder	directory
what i m aiming for is for the file and its directory files structure src - server - data - diceware.json to be merged into the new folder lib - server - data - diceware.json

230557
tunnel	vpn
in continuation of my last question about using netns as a relugar user i m now looking for a way to open vpn tunnel as a regular user

230557
tunnel	vpn
i could just allow opening vpn tunnel by editing the sudoer file but i really would rather not do that

230573
filesystems	ntfs
my filesystems here is ntfs

230580
switching	screens
today i needed to switching onto fedora and was surprised by the same fuzzy corrupted screens on both monitors lg 22m45

230584
folder	directory
just explaining a little better the user would not be able to see etc or any other system directory or folder from others

230585
ubuntu	debian
you can remove your resolvconf package with i m assuming debian or ubuntu here but i think resolvconf is a debian thing

230587
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
how can a user script launchd from a systemd daemons with sudo -u obtain a proper value of display so that it can display things on an x session of the user it s running as preferably the display id of the x session that was most recently active in case the user is on multiple x sessions

230600
subnet	packets
this is what you need to do set up a second routing table then add a rule which says that all packets coming from the tun0 subnet must be routed via this second routing table

230637
jar	war
i m creating a docker file that from s the official tomcat 8 docker file and also seeks to use the jar command to extract content from a war file so i install openjdk-7-jdk

230640
sudo	passwd
this closes the connection how do i keep the connection open after the passwd has been written to stdin for sudo

230652
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
for debian ubuntu mint arch edit etc network interfaces

230652
redhat	fedora
i believe in redhat fedora centos etc

230662
bash	subshell
i think that you got the expected behavior in bash each command in a pipeline is executed in a subshell

230695
zsh	subshell
ksh and zsh didn t output because the last part of pipe in these shells was executed in current shell instead of subshell

230695
bash	zsh
zsh in interactive session and output is terminal do not terminated bash yash and schily s osh reported the error but didn t terminate the shell

230709
folder	directory
this was working till a bit extent what the problem is that the user can do things only in his folder directory which is read write and edit but the user can also go elsewhere and open files and copy scripts from there which can be risky as while having a game server on the vps

230710
bash	zsh
depending on the level of randomness you want you could simply go with bash s also zsh and ksh possibly others builtin variable

230714
next	except
they both work quite well except for one issue anytime i hibernate the machine and i boot up say the next day and i forgot that i hibernated x operating system i end up messing up the fs journal

230719
mouse	keyboard
but as i have said i my purpose is to learn key logging and know more about files which relate to keyboard and mouse input.

230737
chown	chgrp
you should use -h flag for chown chgrp and or -mount for find in case you have dedicated filesystem

230741
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for terazer

230742
bash	zsh
not sure whether bash and zsh will have similar solutions

230790
debian	centos
i am completely new to centos coming from the debian world so maybe there is something simple i am missing but it seems to be pretty odd to me that a 500mb package would take more than 100x the space required to install

230819
udp	tcp
netstat -tunlp to list both tcp udp ports

230823
centos	linux
what is the alternative of this technique with linux based on redhat like centos

230838
ubuntu	debian
it seems i have read it in a comment docker guarantees that their package is running both on ubuntu and debian

230849
ubuntu	debian
if not to make it the default usually already the case on debian and derivative like ubuntu

230862
daemons	systemd
systemd is a suite of systemd management daemons libraries and utilities designed as a central management and configuration platform for the linux computer operating systemd

230899
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
the openldap server is running on ubuntu 14.04 and the other machines are running ubuntu 14.04 centos 7 and arch linux

230921
versioning	upgrade
that way the package is an upgrade to the -1 versioning but if a system is upgrade from stable to testing the -2 deb1 stable versioning will be upgrade to the -2 testing versioning

230921
versioning	upgrade
official backports use bpo number for the same purpose this way a 4.2 bpo7 versioning will be upgrade to 4.2 if that ever appears in the main distribution

230970
debian	linux
i m not sure at what level this problem is generated that is to say is this xfce s fault or debian s fault or linux s fault

231009
toolchain	binutils
popular musl+clang toolchain ellcc also uses binutils

231015
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu

231022
cinnamon	gnome
i have found some answers for gnome but not for cinnamon

231040
unix	solaris
due to several deficits and bugs the gnu linker is no alternative to the unix ld on solaris

231062
ubuntu	linux
the file was produced by volatility on ubuntu linux 12.04 using linux_dump_map command for a specific process

231083
mtu	dhcp
edit i should also mention these interfaces are static not dhcp so they would not be getting their mtu from a dhcp server

231107
kde	gnome
i ve had several font packages installed on my fedora 20 machine but for some reason - neither kde nor gnome apps notice them

231155
ubuntu	debian
you have talked about both ubuntu and debian in the same breath and question

231156
ubuntu	mint
on ubuntu mint and relatives strlcpy and strlcat are available in the libbsd-dev package

231174
filesystems	btrfs
the drive with the broken controller is recognized but will not join the btrfs filesystems

231179
tunnel	vpn
i want to enable ufw firewall or iptables so that there is no connection that goes out of the vpn tunnel or that comes in except that for vpn server

231194
put	get
i ve tried to put a dependency of hwclock and and even for my init script but i still get this problem

231200
stdout	stderr
i ve captured stdout and stderr of mail and it is throwing no errors

231238
ubuntu	debian
2014a only supports debian squeeze and ubuntu 12.04 13.04 and 13.10

231238
folder	directory
i set up a vm running ubuntu 12.04.5 extracted the .iso on my host machine and copied the directory to my vm s home folder

231254
disk	ram
virtual address space refers to the fact that the addresses being used are virtual and do usually not correspond to the actual physical address space which could be made of several non-contiguous blocks due to having many different memory devices like ram and a portion of a hard disk

231264
mp3	ogg
assuming you re playing music in compressed format mp3 ogg or similar there s no way for it to be a disk problem

231278
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
each filesystems has a uuid which stands for universally unique identifier fat and ntfs use a slightly different scheme but they also have an identifier that can be used as a uuid

231317
daemons	launchd
sometimes some tricky daemons needs to be launchd in the terminal

231318
redhat	fedora
if you re using recent versions of rhel redhat enterprise linux or fedora see the accepted answer to this question

231325
versioning	upgrade
dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versioning of packages

231325
versioning	upgrade
while this command is used to upgrade to a new major versioning of the operating system it does not do this by default

231365
solaris	bsd
ps1 wine is an implementation of windows apis for linux bsd solaris and mac os x - and therefore my concern

231370
chown	mount
could you try to chown that dir after mount

231370
chown	mount
if i insert chown user user target.work work after mount then all works okay

231377
stdout	stderr
which starts the main executable in background and re-directs both stdout and stderr to append to the app.log file

231399
clang	llvm
i m compiling llvm clang but want to give a different name to the executable

231399
clang	llvm
the trick is that i want to rename every tool that comes with llvm clang

231405
fish	bash
share environment variables between bash and fish

231411
ftp	telnet
you connect to a linux host in multiple ways telnet rlogin in the old time ssh sftp ftp ftps x11 remote rdp mysql http vnc .

231493
debian	linux
it s available in debian and rh and pretty much every other linux distro i know of

231501
waitpid	fork
the usual mixture of fork 2 execve 2 waitpid 2 and then waitpid gives you the exit code using wexitstatus when â wifexited

231501
waitpid	fork
both system popen are using the fork execve waitpid system calls and some others see syscalls 2 for a list

231509
folder	directory
the directory sys module shows all modules in the system by their name as folder with diverse information needed by the system

231509
folder	directory
the directory contains the kernel module files stored in a folder hierarchy according to their function

231528
cifs	smb
i can only mount it with cifs smb

231542
centos	linux
i m a linux beginner and using tmux 2.0 on centos 6.7 without x

231584
fontconfig	freetype
wine is built using the system fontconfig freetype which works fine and supports rgb subpixel antialiasing and slight hinting which is what i want

231626
folder	directory
on its way to the some folder it will include root and a number of other directory that you do not have permission to access for example many of the pseudo-directories underneath proc

231627
filesystems	xfs
in case it matters used xfs filesystems because that was the default

231642
spaces	delimiter
assuming the delimiter is a single spaces

231685
disk	ram
â¹ or rarely on something other than a disk if your system keeps its root filesystem elsewhere over the network or in a ram disk

231715
bash	zsh
if it is ok for you to use zsh instead of bash you cona use oh-my-zsh for that

231718
switching	screens
when i get to a file i want to tag i ll double-click on the filename at the bottom of the less screens switching to the vi tab middle-click paste it and hit enter then switching back to the less tab

231750
debian	centos
on debian 7 or centos 7 out of the box i can find that out by issuing

231753
debian	linux
we found many strange files with random 6 characters name are created in the root folder in a short time at our linux server debian wheezy hosting in google compute engine

231794
ubuntu	linux
i am a linux ubuntu user and i do not really know which features i should select at least

ubuntu	debian
i ve added the ubuntu base repo vivid main and a couple of ppas into my debian installation to get access to some software that s not available on a debian repo

232007
chown	chmod
there are lists in the internet how to re- chown or chmod the filesystem but you can never cover all files

232012
ubuntu	debian
in a system which do not use yum as packaging system such as ubuntu or debian

232017
ubuntu	debian
as far as i know the best way for apt-based distros like debian or ubuntu is to install alien which converts individual rpm s into the native deb format and then install them individually with dpkg

232030
folder	directory
where can i create a folder of my own outside my own home directory

232039
binutils	glibc
in particular i want to get the same result of the archive libc.a when compiling glibc from source on a different machine same version of gcc make binutils etc though

i have postfix dovecot installed on ubuntu with this guide

232146
installation	upgrade
i have a freebsd installation that had an upgrade failure between 8

232155
rpm	yum
does anyone know why yum is attempting to find this one rpm from run install repo instead of run install repo packages

232184
tar	md5sum
the script part first validates the tarball by md5sum then unpack the tar which contains multiple .tar.bz2 archives

232192
wan	lan
is it possible to sniff with tcpdump or mirror lan traffic that doesn t get routed to wan using openwrt

232244
bash	zsh
i changed my default shell from bash to zsh and after rebooting i am stuck in a loop where it brings me back to the login prompt after my password is entered correctly - cannot log into root either

232250
chown	chgrp
use chown instead of chgrp

232253
octal	decimal
the posix specification for the aka test utility says operands have to be integers without specifying which forms of integers decimal octal hexadecimal... are to be supported but that s actually covered in point 6 at the utility argument syntax which states what the default would be when not specified

232253
octal	decimal
in practice only works with posh works in at t ksh but only because they re treated as 0 would return true as well and except for posh where s that a bug all implementations return false on as in 010 is treated as decimal not octal

232275
icmp	udp
port knocking works by encoding a password into a series of packets that don t require a connected protocol for example sending pings on a series of ports or sending an icmp or udp packet to a specific port containing a password

232276
spaces	delimiter
if 1234 must be delimiter by spaces or be at the beginning or end of the line then use

232292

but still when i go to settings - details - default applications the web dropdown menu doesn t include google-chrome as one of the choices and xdg-open still launches firefox

232298
ubuntu	debian
i am currently using ubuntu 15.04 x64 and now want to switch to debian so for that i have prepared a bootable usb stick but i don t want to lose my data that are in home directory of ubuntu but also i don t want to use ubuntu although it is good os

232298
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
as i am not very expert with linux installation so my question is how can i use the same home of ubuntu for debian like as we have in windows only by formatting and installing in c drive we can able to preserve our other disk ex d or e with the data

232332
next	except
d means find the next line to start with the word chapter searching forward from the current line then jump forward 50 lines and search backward for the word pete and delete the first line you find it in. except that it doesn t actually move the cursor it just does what you tell it

232333
versioning	upgrade
or if you wanted you could use the source to build the new versioning and upgrade that way

232333
versioning	upgrade
docs for that are in the handbook but beware there are cases where are required to upgrade stepwise ie without skipping a versioning in between and the handbook doesn t document

232336
redhat	fedora
if you are using redhat fedora or centos

232336
ubuntu	debian
if you are running ubuntu or debian

232343
punctuation	words
b means null inside of words so previous symbol is not any punctuation or space

232361
freebsd	linux
unfortunately this is also a visible remaining scar of the ancient schism between system v and bsd -- the tools you will find on linux are not the same as those on freebsd or osx or whatever

232361
dpkg	apt
both sets also contain things that are debian-specific like dpkg and apt

232385
spaces	delimiter
the -d is to set delimiter field separator which we specify is a spaces

232386
bash	zsh
you should be aware that bash as opposed to ksh93 zsh or yash only performs integer arithmetic

232430
bash	zsh
zsh is an alternative shell that has many nice features for interactive use that bash lacks including the possibility to choose completions in a menu

232437
chown	sudo
running command sudo chown -r root disk media usb1

232467
postfix	dovecot
i am baffled by an issue which is that dovecot accepts my ssl certificate just fine and allows me to receive emails without any problems but postfix rejects the connection the message i get in thunderbird is the message could not be sent because connection to outgoing server smtp mail.example.com failed

232488
starttls	smtps
starttls works because it uses the standard smtps port 25

232503
bash	zsh
in bash and also zsh and ksh93 the general form of parameter expansion or substring expansion is

232516
pipe	file-descriptor
if you really want the results in a current-shell variable and in a file-descriptor then you should steer clear of pipe

232529
filesystems	ntfs
your wish is only possible if the os and the filesystems in question support the acl standard that is used by ntfs and zfs and that is standardized by nfsv4

232541
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint 17.2 rafaela ubuntu 14.04 trusty running cinnamon2.6.1.3 amd64 on a toshiba satellite p755 intel 6gb ram + oodles of disk+swap

232547
versioning	upgrade
i had not upgrade my arch server in a few weeks ncurses has indeed changed to versioning 6 as of early september but php should have been upgrade with it

232548
subtract	add
i m hoping to find someone here who has already done this on any kind of system who can tell me what to add or subtract or shift as plain copy-paste of address of first ascii parameter doesn t work

232565
switching	screens
on my fedora 22 system every time i switching between text terminals using ctrl+alt+fx the system outputs junk to the screens

232577
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
below is a useful alternative command for unix users whose version of sed does not support the -i flag such as solaris -- and also os x which ships with bsd sed by default

232597
centos	linux
i have an ip address which is provided by my university to setup a server on centos 7 linux machine

232606
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	kde	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
i would like to measure the ram usage of several desktop environments including cinnamon gnome kde lxde lxqt mate and xfce running on my sabayon machine

232611
sudo	passwd
the typical lack of access to the passwd hash in the shadow file may make this request problematic for a random userland program to use the system passwd database as sudo and chsh and such tend to have the setuid bit set on them so that they run as root and can access the shadow file

232611
crypt	hash
once a program can obtain the password hash for a user whether from the system database or some other source it s the redacted bit in the above output a traditional crypt 3 call should suffice to verify the password

232612
pop-up	dialog
what i don t like is when i get a pop-up dialog where i have to select from a list that i can not use vim keys to navigate through the list

232613
spaces	delimiter
if your input is delimiter by a single character including spaces you may find this useful

232625
daemon	cron
in this case the main sendmail daemon need not be run possibly just the client mail queue runner or a cron job could handle that

232654
bash	zsh
in bash zsh and ksh variants you can use

232668
google-chrome	firefox
none of those files had any reference to web browsing firefox or google-chrome

232673
filesystems	ntfs
afaik it works by filling a database from the ntfs journal it doesn t work with other filesystems

232688
filesystems	ntfs
when we plug an external hard disk it gets automatically mounted in our filesystems the one our operating system is using.but how does the operating system know which filesystems format like ntfs or fat32 the hard disk is using

232692
pop-up	dialog	sudo	passwd
sudo asks for the passwd on the command line and gksudo pop-up a dialog box for it

232695
filesystems	fat
i believe the operating system takes a list of filesystems that it knows of fat ext2 ext3 etc. and matches each one of them in a defined order based on their popularity probably against the disk partition until it finds a match

232696
sudo	passwd
you could set up a sudo rule such that either all users some specific users and or all members of a particular group can run the script without a passwd

232717
mp4	webm	mp3	ogg	mp3	flv
usually mp4 and flv files contain aac audio webm files contain ogg and avi files contain mp3 audio

232731
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian

232731
ubuntu	debian
on debian or ubuntu it seems the realpath should be installed by default

232743
ubuntu	debian
java applications that are available from the debian or ubuntu repositories respectively should always be able to run with the default jre

232746
ubuntu	debian
debian doesn t support ubuntu ppas

232750
udp	tcp
an easier alternative is to use packet forwarding ipchains and masquerading to forward tcp udp packets which is what i think is what you want to do anyway you are not trying to set up a cluster with a custom network architecture right

232751
debian	linux
i have a linux debian machine that i own root access

232753
debian	linux
linux debian x86

232774
debian	linux
i did apt-get update and my os version is debian gnu linux 8 jessie

232782
ubuntu	debian
compare debian left and ubuntu right

if you use sudo to run system tasks type where version is the package version you compiled and enter your passwd when prompted

232807
lzma	lzo
if i dd my disk and compress the image with lzma or lzo the image is still big

232834
vim	emacs
a makefile can also integrate with emacs or vim based testing among other advantages.

232882
filesystems	fat
for an on-disk filesystems such as ext4 or fat this code works out how the pieces of data that make up the file are arranged and makes calls to the underlying storage layer the disk driver to read and write those pieces

232890
bash	zsh
in bash it needs to be activated with shopt -s globstar in ksh93 you need set -o globstar and in zsh it works out of the box

232914
filesystems	hfs+
one unusual exception is the mac osx hfs+ filesystems

232941
ubuntu	debian
you can work it out by chroot ing into your debian ubuntu system from any other livecd or liveusb distribution

232974
hash	md5
i have a 660297728 byte hdd image with md5 hash f5a9d398e974617108d26c1654fe7bcb

232974
hash	md5
now if i dd this image file to dev sdb disk and check the md5 hash of the disk then it is different from md5 hash of the image file

spaces	delimiter
after that in the pattern spaces there is now the second line followed by the first line delimiter by a newline

233026
freebsd	solaris
i know that freebsd does things different than solaris

233037
hex	binary
is actually a textual hex format - a text representation of a binary value

233053
opus	ogg
second idea was converting i usually use audacity for quick format swaps but after several attempts of exporting to ogg vorbis or ogg opus i noticed audacity already failed to read the proprietary file format

233053
opus	ogg
how to convert audio x-ms-wma to audio ogg audio vorbis or audio opus format

233097
bash	subshell
before shellshock day you can store function inside a variable export variable and using function in subshell because bash support exporting function bash will put function definition in environment variable like

233143
ssl	https
your biggest problem is https and everything that uses ssl

233148
cpu	processors
processors intelâ coreâ i7 cpu k 875 2.93ghz ã 8

233187
ubuntu	debian
until some smart-pants decided to improve them and now i am facing with debian ubuntu systems where the service script does nothing as i am supposed to use the stuff like systemctl start nginx.service much much longer no auto-complete working ...

233187
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
my question refers specially to debian and ubuntu but it would also be helpful to cover centos redhat distros too

233187
ubuntu	debian
in case it was not clear i am looking for a consistent way to deal with those one that would work on debian 7.x 8.x latest ubuntu lts and non-lts

233212
debian	centos
starting it made it available on port 80 and with debian information on the default home page and not centos

233221
perl	tcl
my question is - why not c python perl php awk bash script or tcl

233222
children	parent
when deleting directories after you delete a parent directory you can no longer delete its children - they re gone

233233
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
you will find this style of boot on rhel centos el through the 6 release fedora through 14 and on debian ubuntu based distributions up until 2015

233234
ubuntu	debian
your problem is that debian ubuntu have switched to the new systemd as a replacement of the old sysvinit

233241
button	checkbox
if you edit the launcher right-click select properties then click on the edit button one of the options will be a checkbox run in terminal

233242
mouse	keyboard
so how do i make the tablet work as well as my desktop monitor at home with shared mouse and keyboard and drag and drop able

233253
folder	directory
move them in another folder usr share jvm or another directory

233253
folder	directory
get permission to run bin software in bin directory in folder of your jdk

233270
xfce	cinnamon
tested with xfce instead of cinnamon and it doesn t show the same issue

233280
vpn	lan
vpn virtual private network where you connect to your gateway and establish a virtual private network which will make your laptop belonging a a virtual lan with gateway and your private network

233306
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
my system hard disk has crashed so now i want to run the os linux mint or ubuntu from a bootable usb but i don t know how to configure to save any config data so that it persist after rebooting also

233308
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
run the following commands in terminal to install avidemux gkt on ubuntu 14.04 linux mint 17.1 linux mint 17 and derivative systems

233308
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
run the following commands in terminal to install avidemux qt on ubuntu 14.04 linux mint 17.1 linux mint 17 and derivative systems

233353
centos	linux
under the assumption that you ve tried yum install aria2 instead of the literal yum install aria aria2 aria2c command you listed the install aria2 command-line download manager on rhel centos and fedora linux page suggests the following command

233358
sunos	bsd
linux and system v boxes tended to like -ef and error on -augxww vice versa for bsd and old sunos machines

233358
unix	bsd
it s always worth watching what errors command not found and what variants of commands ps -ef vs ps augxww work to determine what variant of unix or linux or bsd you just ended up on

233368
kerberos	ldap
you should also check out your distro s pam configuration files to see if you re only using local users or if you re configured to use ldap kerberos winbind sssd whatever

233396
switching	screens
it s not related to my kvm switching symptoms persisted when i disconnected it or the laptop hardware booting into the windows 10 partition and leaving either the screens saver or the on-screen keyboard up for hours showed no unexpected behavior.

233397
postfix	dovecot
i am running ubuntu 14.04.3 with apache2 postfix and dovecot

233403
ansible	puppet
try the configuration management orchestration tool ansible chef saltstack puppet or whatever

233404
for-loop	arrays
instead to output a list made from combining the same common starting word or string plus another part that is different based on an arrays i recommend a for-loop

233404
for-loop	arrays
in the quote plus is important to have the for-loop properly understanding each filename in arrays as separate arguments

233405
mouse	keyboard
on mine it affected the keyboard and mouse

233409
spaces	delimiter
by using the -d n option with xargs a gnu extension which tells xargs to use only newline or n as the delimiter rather than any whitespace and disables quote processing this even copes with filenames that have spaces and other potentially-problematic characters except for n or newline itself

233415
freebsd	solaris
now at least with env implementation on gnu system freebsd and solaris 11 i realize that they re not equivalent because env allow any characters except and 0 in var name

233421
daemon	cron
it would only prevent some tasks from predictably freezing everything if i remember to ionice them but what about a cron job an exec call from some running daemon etc

233450
chgrp	chmod
so i gave some permissions to the parent of my dev site folders that being chgrp -r www-data var www and i did chmod -r g + rw var www and also chmod g + s var www this last chmod is the best bit

233453
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
to boot into linux mint i have to each time press f9 to show boot options and choose ubuntu after which i am shown the linux mint boot screen option gives me option to boot into linux-mint compatibility and stuff - and then choose linux mint 17.2 to boot in it

233456
spaces	delimiter
the delimiter is set to spaces and comma

233475
sysv	systemd
systemd is backward compatible with sysv init scripts

233475
sysv	systemd
but there is one point where systemd and sysv differ in terms of init scripts

233478
post	get
get post arguments sent pwd wp-submit testcookie log

233478
centos	linux
forgot to mention that our server has linux centos 6 os installed

233479
debian	linux
my install is targeted on debian linux distribution

233491
unix	bsd
since you re posting on the unix and linux stack exchange site i assume that the server in question is linux or a bsd varian

233491
post	get
the get post arguments sent are consistent with a wordpress login

233525
rpm	yum
if you didn t install the package with yum or rpm you also can t remove it with yum

233553
ethernet	wireless
i ve recently installed debian 8 jessie and i m having trouble with dns resolving in a particular network configuration i must connect to 2 different networks 1 ethernet and 2 wireless

233554
macports	homebrew
if you want to learn with gnu tools you can install a gnu userland through macports or homebrew or can do a full linux install in a vm

233565
unix	bsd
furthermore linux command line mostly consists of bash + gnu coreutils which is very different from bsd unix and os x is a succedessor of bsd unix

233565
unix	bsd
there is a very big difference of preferences in writing arguments in bsd unix and gnu linux

233566
ubuntu	mint	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	mint
debian-based ones have apt such as deepin ubuntu mint

233566
redhat	fedora	dnf	yum
redhat and fedora had yum up to some point but now fedora has dnf

233571
vpn	lan
then i have a vpn connection established from my ubuntu laptop to a lan network

233571
vpn	lan
after establishing the vpn connection from my ubuntu laptop to the lan network i used rdesktop and other remote desktop clients like krdc to run the program on the windows machine

233608
ubuntu	linux
i have successfully used the vdi image to run the linux ubuntu which was installed on the disk

233616
uninstall	downgrade
after refusing n aptitude s first proposal which was more or less uninstall all the system it proposed to downgrade a few packages libc-bin libc-dev-bin libc6 libc6-dev locales

233617
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
if you didn t want to install linux proper you could manually install the latest versions perhaps via some port system like macports fink or homebrew

233643
sudo	passwd
i used to not need a passwd to use sudo however now a passwd is required and i have no idea what it is

233645
sudo	passwd
the point here is that root access or having the root passwd is not the same as having sudo privileges

233645
sudo	passwd
you will have sudo access and you now also know the root passwd for future use

233670
post	get
if i get an answer and manage to chroot inside my debian i will make a concise blog post detailing all the steps of this process for all the fellow developers that want root access to their tablets - and don t want to trust dubious-origin one-click-roots that do god-knows-what to their machines botnet members

233673
ubuntu	linux
this is gnu make 3.81 on linux ubuntu 3.13.0-51-generic #84-ubuntu smp wed apr 15 12 08 34 utc 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux

233679
dpkg	apt
this doesn t normally happen if you use dpkg and apt to manage packages

233696
bash	zsh
i was able to fix the issue by chrooting into my computer and then changing the shell back to bash i believe the issue came about in the first place do to a an issue with a shared library i have resolved this issue now and shall be attempting to make zsh my shell once again thank you all for your help

233728
bash	zsh
it happens in bash 3.2 and 4.3 but it works fine in zsh 5.1

233728
bash	zsh
this is surprising because the example was supposed to be for bash not for zsh

233739
put	get
you should put the thing in quotes because the could get interpreted by the shell

233811
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade the 7.3 machine to 7.5 in order to have all my machines with the same debian versioning

233811
versioning	upgrade
when i use apt-get upgrade or apt-get dist-upgrade with the --simulate option it tells me that all packages are going to be upgrade to versioning 7.9 which i do not want to happen

233811
versioning	upgrade
okay i have the word wheezy here not stable because this will upgrade to jessie but how to point out the versioning in sources.list

233812
sudo	passwd
it looks like you should be able to access sudo without a passwd when no passwd is set

233817
bash	zsh
how do you manage your bash zsh aliases

233831
debian	linux
after posting this and doing some digging i ve found that the issue isn t necessarily with debian or linux at all

233835
required	placeholder
this required having a tex document with placeholder that will be replaced by the arguments to a sh script

233840
ubuntu	debian
although the suse chkconfig program available packaged for debian and ubuntu is very different to the the fedora one they being written in entirely different programming languages even mdash

233897
copying	overwrite
right now i m using autocutsel to sync clipboard and primary but while this works well for copying text from urxvt to most other apps it generally degrades the overall usefulness of the clipboard because it gets accidentally overwrite any time i select text anywhere

233904
ethernet	wireless
if networkmanager doesn t manage your wireless ethernet controller then you cannot expect it to see wifi networks and connect to them

233908
stdout	stderr
and the email never arrives although this command exits with code 0 and no output to stdout or stderr

233912
kde	gnome
i m a long-time de user however there are some circumstances under which i prefer to use different tiling-based wms instead of gnome or kde i use gnome mostly for last year or so

233978
jobs	cron
i usually write my rsync backup scripts and several other kinds of cron jobs so that they have code like the folowing at the start of the script immediately after the #

233993
spaces	delimiter
because we use multiple capture groups the captured elements are returned as a list which we can then stick together with a delimiter of spaces using join

234016
bash	zsh
that assumes a shell like ksh bash or zsh with the operator to invoke split+glob on the content of a file

spaces	delimiter
here list is expected to be a spaces tab or newline assuming the default value of delimiter list of file patterns as in

234023
disk	ram
what i think your asking is does the video file need to be read from disk or will is be in ram

234023
disk	ram
linux stores file caches in your free ram of there is enough room then yes the file transfer will actually transfer from ram and not the disk

234023
disk	ram
however it s a transparent process and if there s not enough ram or if the file has been flushed from cache for some reason then it would read from disk

234059
bash	zsh
for fun a hacky solution that works in some shells bash zsh mksh ksh93 not yash nor dash

titlebar	window
the window title is what goes in the titlebar the calculator or xterm

234151
sudo	passwd
it calls usr bin sudo -u root tmp doit the programming running as zabbix is a daemon so the sbin nologin shell in the passwd file does not prevent it

234158
udp	tcp
when a client signs up for a given interface on a particular host usually with a clnt_create call the stub code asks rpcbind on that host a question something like on what udp or tcp port is protocol number x listening

234158
udp	tcp
rpcbind unlike most other onc services listens on tcp and udp port 111 so given a host name or ip address a program can just ask rpcbind on that host or ip address

234158
udp	tcp
some process es have registered with rpcbind giving their protocol number 100003 and whatever tcp or udp port they ve acquired

234164
mouse	keyboard
symptoms are 1 second of music is playing in the infinite loop no reaction for mouse or keyboard

234165
wav	flac
long story short i need a script to convert wav files to flac while taking the file name minus extension to place in the song title tag of the flac file

234186
post	get
you can also use logic for request type which is something you may want to look into if get seems to be working and post is giving unexpected behavior

234191
persian	farsi
in your case if you know the original text is in farsi persian maybe you can identify a number of possible encodings and iterate over those until you see the output you expect

234195
stdout	stderr
this will redirect both stdout stderr to stdout and to logfile using savelog to rotate and keep older logs 7 by default every time the script is run

234207
bash	zsh
with ksh bash -o extglob and zsh -o kshglob only

234214
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
from man exports available on debian linux i would be surprised if it s not on freebsd

234275
jobs	cron
afterwards the tz was changed affecting future processes but it was not until cron was restarted with the new tz that cron jobs ran at the correct time

234278
folder	directory
i get permission denied when trying to move folder music via mv although directory owner is set to my user and user permissions are set to 7

234293

234311
ubuntu	centos
is installation directory path is different in centos redhat rhel7 ubuntu

234319
systemctl	cgroups
once systemctl stops something it will after some timeout forcibly kill all the processes started by that application using cgroups

234326
chown	sudo	chown	sudoers
i already know i cannot use chown willi-nilly as a normal user however in my situation i have two users user1 and user2 where user1 is allowed by the sudoers file to sudo in as user2

234326
chown	sudoers
the only thing that occures to me so far is to put user1 as being able to run chown as root in the sudoers file

234343
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for testdude

234343
sudo	passwd
indeed if i change my shell by editing etc passwd you can see that sudo follows the shell of the caller and not shell

234343
sudo	passwd
-bash-4.1 sudo sed -i -e testdude s bash sh etc passwd

234351
spaces	delimiter
| column -t pipes it to column command which by default man column says by default the column command will merge multiple adjacent delimiter into a single delimiter when using the -t option so it handles the variable spaces between texts as a single delimiter

234367
debian	linux
i have looked at how to create a debian live usb with persistence but it is talking about debian on linux

234368
spaces	delimiter
btw this is a good example of why it s never a good idea to use a delimiter spaces that s also in the fields being delimiter

234376
ubuntu	linux
dev sdb is a usb pendrive with say some linux live distro like ubuntu inside

234388
rss	feed
background i am running tiny tiny rss which has a feed updater script that i run at regular intervals using a systemd timer

234390
xfce	gnome
i said this bug is gnome specific because both slim as an alternative to gdm and xfce as an alternative to gnome work perfectly well with dual monitors

234392
ubuntu	debian
i suspect you have other problems on your ubuntu system probably in your sources.list file s - on debian at least openssh-server is an actual package not a virtual package

234408
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
under debian and most derivatives ubuntu mint â all variables whose name begins with lc_ are also accepted by the ssh server

234413
chown	sudo
you could write a sudo rule perhaps with a small wrapper script that allows user1 to call chown on files that belong to user2

234458
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop runs trough every item in the arrays nodeid

234477
switching	screens
you could switching to using screens or tmux

234486
rpm	yum
you will probably want to use yum instead of rpm

234488
folder	directory
the main server is executing these scripts so directory must stay in root folder

234495
jobs	cron
cron is configured with a mail server so i get feedback from jobs

234495
stdout	stderr
normally these backup scripts are written to run without any stdout stderr output on success following the standard unix paradigm that no news is good news so that they don t clog up my email inbox with lots of junk

234495
stdout	stderr
from time to time these fail and i will get a mail immediately with the stdout stderr output

234495
stdout	stderr
also this would significantly complicate things as all stdout stderr the script then did would like need to sit in a wrapper function

234506
subnet	ip-address
nmap then makes a ping scan on every single ip-address in that subnet

234508
bash	zsh
should work as long as sh is based on at t ksh pdksh bash zsh ash or yash at least and i don t know of any posix sh implementation that is not based on any of those

234516
ubuntu	debian
that script should work on ubuntu debian arch and mac os systems without the need of installing extra packages

234516
ubuntu	debian
but in older versions of ubuntu debian and arch and in mac os the -i -flag is not available

234531
bash	zsh
even zsh would be a better choice than bash as it has a ksh emulation mode

234535
put	get
i d put everything on the ssd and then move specific directories as they get too big

234538
chown	chmod
when i try to change the folder with chown and chmod i am getting permission denied error

234538
chown	chmod
even root can t do anything ls rm chmod and chown are not working

234552
ethernet	wireless
how can i create a wi-fi hotspot with command line tool nmcli and share the ethernet internet connection to the wireless access point

234560
filesystems	ntfs
it s possible for instance that the ntfs fs code is reporting something more like the raw partition size while ext is subtracting filesystems overhead. without more details here it s hard to say

234583
ubuntu	linux
i m using a proprietary vpn client on my ubuntu linux work station astrill which support several types of vpns

234585
spaces	delimiter
just tell paste that you want to use a spaces as delimiter instead of tabs

234594
ubuntu	mint
looking around i found the question mint correct way to install lib i386-linux-gnu libgmp.so.3 whose author says i have a 32-bit binary that needs libgmp.so.3 on an x86_64 installation. â in that thread they suggest installing the compiled for 32-bit version ubuntu package which i did only to add usr lib libgmp.so.3 and usr lib libgmp.so.3.5.2 to locate libgmp and as should be expected change the error to

234642
post	get
how do i post process the two files to get the following

234661
chown	sudo
sudo chown bob bob privat.file it will change ownership of the file and now the owner is bob

234689
ubuntu	linux
allow new linux users to try out ubuntu on their windows computers

234689
ubuntu	linux
so is there any way to make arch linux behave the way ubuntu does with no modifications to the windows clock are necessary that is the hardware clock uses localtime and one can still have arch linux synchronize time since i barely use windows anymore but unfortunately cannot abandon it and don t want to remember how i fixed the time issue should i have to install windows anew

234692
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
this is true for most library packages on ubuntu and debian mint etc

234692
ubuntu	debian
btw python-igraph 0.6.5-1 is packaged for debian - are you sure it s not also pre-packaged for ubuntu

234710
folder	directory
the files in the linux-3.8.0 folder have say names abc.c but in their corresponding patch files have the names 001abc.c in the sources directory

234715
rtos	qnx
are there any opensource free unix like rtos that can run a virtual machine like qnx neutrino rtos

234716
icmp	tcp
use -p tcp -j reject --reject-with tcp-rst to pretend the port is closed the default action for reject is an icmp packet

234732
ubuntu	centos
i m moving a product from ubuntu 12.04 to centos 6.6

234750
rmdir	mkdir
removable device where udev mkdir and rmdir for you

234778
put	get
anyway if the output you get is -f command not found then you have to put a space between and the inside is a full featured command

234779
bash	zsh	solaris	bsd
if you want a list of all .gz files under a folder and do something to each result the following is a better idea if you re using bash or zsh and your find supports the -iname and -print0 predicate like on gnu solaris 11 or some bsd systems

234788
terminate	timeout
you can set to disable the timeout entirely may hang your shutdown if the script doesn t terminate or pass a larger value that allows the stop script to finish completely

234810
stdout	stderr
as i understand stdout and stderr are sent through the connection dev tcp host port and stdin reads through the connection

234832
centos	linux
is it possible for ping command in linux centos to send 0 bytes

234835
put	get
i have already run sudo yum install man --downloadonly on the guest to get the packages i need and sudo cp -r var cache yum x86_64 6 base packages vagrant to put the package files on my host

234874
ubuntu	linux
my goal is to have my usb drive loaded with a virtual machine that runs a linux distro preferably ubuntu but i m flexible

234885
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs
for most filesystems including ext3 4 xfs ntfs clonezilla is even able to automatically expand the filesystems so that you get to use the entire 500gb

234895
sudo	passwd
please login as the mawel user and execute the following authenticating the privileged mode sudo with the mawel user s passwd

234911
ubuntu	centos
converting a package for ubuntu into a package for centos is much more difficult

234911
debian	centos
in particular note that there s a good chance that the debian binariesare compiled against different library versions than what s present in centos

234911
debian	centos
if you want to run programs built for debian on a centos machine the least effort solution would be to install debian in a chroot this guide about installing debian on another debian version may be useful as there s not much dependency on the host side

234911
debian	centos
if you want to have â œproperâ centos packages then building them from source will be far easier than converting the debian packages

234914
punctuation	words
a token is a sequence of characters that forms a words or punctuation sign

234925
uniq	grep
grep home american.txt | sort| uniq -u works just fine

234934
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
for reference i did this on debian and linux mint testing but i m sure it works in ubuntu just as well

234949
switching	screens
it does not pertain to the lock screens itself though in terms of directly controlling it by switching that drop down option and selecting gnome or anything else

234957
daemons	systemd
if the systemd becomes short of memory the pageout daemons may try to move active pages to the inactive list in the hopes of finding pages that are not really in use

234963
for-loop	arrays
since you want the next occurence of that index when it appears again in file1 for example djf we need to delete that element of the arrays a and fall out of the for-loop break

234976
put	get
but when i put the make command nothing happens and i get the message

234985
xfce	kde
synapse is not depending on any panel toolbar or dock but in a similar way keyboard layout selection will work in any panel launcher like unity dash xfce whiskermenu kde launchers kickoff homerun lancelot etc etc

235000
folder	directory
git creates a folder .git in the top-level directory it tracks

235008
folder	directory
i have already tried creating a user and giving access as follows but when i login through winscp and change the directory to its going to all the root folder

235034
spaces	delimiter
i don t quite understand what this is a file and this command prints it with single spaces means so if fields in your infile are delimiter by more than one spaces then you could use tr first

235043
readonly	temporary
i know there is no way to stop root from either extracting the encryption key from memory or from copying the readonly data to a temporary location reformatting the encrypted device and copying the readonly data back to the device as read-write

235085
filesystems	xfs
again by the defaults of the installation these are in the xfs filesystems type

235091
umount	vfs
umount -f unfortunately just removes things from the vfs without actually umounting

235113
super	implements
an other way that is super easy to implements and allows a bit more flexibility in terms of adding multiple users is to use

235114
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have also tried linux mint ubuntu and fedora all with the same similar problem.

235114
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
numerous other linux distros including linux mint ubuntu and fedora

235114
redhat	fedora
fedora can be replaced with the other linux distros i ve tried that have this installer redhat and the gib amounts vary as well

235141
ubuntu	debian
the debian ubuntu nodejs packages use the command name nodejs not node

235167
debian	linux
if i need and old one debian or any other linux i can

235179
freebsd	linux
linux and freebsd no less than os x darwin technically qualify as unix but haven t paid the open group for unix certification and therefore cannot use the name

235181
debian	linux
as with most software for linux both libusb and libimobiledevice are packaged for debian

235234
ubuntu	linux
on my linux ubuntu 15.04 vm i m using bash 4 and the same command works fine.

235255
xfce	gnome
i have experienced this phenomenon when i had tested docky and plank during its early development in gnome 2 and xfce environments

235257
ubuntu	linux
os ubuntu linux

235280
bash	zsh
you can do something like the following in bash zsh or ksh

235302
passwd	chgrp
originally unix processes could belong to one group at a time there used to be a chgrp 1 command asking for the group passwd stored in the vestigial passwd field in etc groups

235309
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu

235338
versioning	upgrade
when a new kernel versioning came out you wouldn t be able to upgrade you would have to test every single piece of software you used

235351
octal	hex
the fs has byte value 28 hex 0x1c or octal 038

235373
folder	directory
create user account with home directory and default folder inside

235375
ubuntu	debian
like you see the way for ubuntu is nearly complete different how debian handle this

235383
debian	linux
i m using debian 8 and i m booting my system with linux 4.1.2 with systemd

235396
bash	zsh
bash and zsh only show

lets you search by section though outside of system or c related things there are only sections for fortran perl and tcl tk

235434
ubuntu	debian
my story is whenever i install any debian ubuntu distro i use the open-source ati driver btw my graphics cards are amd radeon hd 8850 r9 m200x and intel hd graphics 4400 i guess which is well and all but i want the fglrx -updates

235445
kate	geany
for language programming there are feature full text editors such as geany or kate

235479
debian	linux
i don t know if this is a debian problem or a hardware problem but the information is in linux

235532
versioning	upgrade
he also explains that one reason to make this a strong rule is to avoid dependency hell where you d not only have to upgrade another program to get some newer kernel to work but also have to upgrade yet another program and another and another because everything depends on a certain versioning of everything

235534
versioning	upgrade
to get the new stable versioning can i upgrade or do i need to fully install the new versioning

235537
readonly	temporary
a few vim and vile have some provision for temporary changing a file s permissions to write on a readonly file

235540
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu sample

235541
switching	screens
the xterm program unlike other programs which may emulate xterm has an x resource setting titeinhibit named for the termcap feature which tells it to suppress the switching to from alternate screens

235559
jobs	cron
in particular it won t apply to cron jobs unless they explicitly source etc profile

235561
splunk	logstash
tools like logstash splunk and similar may do what you want and both probably do a lot more

235578
mp3	aiff	opus	aiff
my selection command-line programs are sox sound exchange for convert mp3 files to aiff format in order to keep quality and metadata and opusenc the official encoder for convert aiff files to opus format

235578
mp3	aiff	opus	aiff
most important part of the work is use of mediainfo program for exporting metadata tags of mp3 files and giving them to opusenc program for importing metadata tags to encoding opus files also giving the original bit-rate value of mp3 files to opusenc for encoding large size aiff files in order to achieve the opus files with same bit-rate of original mp3 files so i need a script for automation listed below operations

235578
mp3	aiff
use sox for convert mp3 files in a directory with many sub-directory to the files with aiff format with same name

235578
mp3	aiff
delete mp3 and aiff files after encode successfully done

235578
mp3	aiff	opus	aiff
i choose aiff format because it supports id3v2 tags but when for test i convert a mp3 file contains metadata to aiff format with sox program and convert it to opus with opusenc result was the output opus file lacks metadata don t known what is the problem exactly also there was need to specify bit-rate value of mp3 file so use of mediainfo is necessary

235608
debian	linux
i m using kali linux 2.0 which is debian based

235618
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m using linux mint debian v2 64-bit

235640
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
for example there is a fork of imagemagick called graphicsmagick that provides largely the same commands with a large overlap in remit

235640
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
you get a binary called convert-im6 for imagemagick and if you were to use graphicsmagick you d probably get something like convert-gm i ve not checked but you get the idea

235642
switching	screens
i also tried switching to a different tty and running startx but the screens turns black and hangs there indefinitely

235645
spaces	delimiter
those files represent tables with some of them have a tab delimiter and other one spaces delimiter as follow

235650
switching	screens
is there a way to parse precisely how an employee last logged into their workstation and thereby identify whether the employee last used the switching users option to get back to the login screens

235655
spaces	delimiter
to change your cut command to use spaces as a delimiter you need to

235660
dlsym	dlopen
i ve demonstrated on my system ubuntu 15.04 that dlopen dlsym and dlclose can make this happen for me if i replace the file close the old library open the new version via the same file path and reload the symbol s i need

235670
wan	lan
i know if i d need a password if i wanted to access this from the web but for now i just want to get lan access working again and then i ll focus on wan

235677
sudoers	passwd
calling ls -l etc passwd etc shadow etc sudoers results in this

235700
stdout	stderr
usually i d do something like or sed -e 1 5d to get rid of dpkg -l s header lines but in this case we re redirecting stderr to stdout in order to catch complaints by dpkg-query as well as dpkg -l s output so we can t simply delete the first 5 lines

235714
fish	bash
syntax is part of the bash history substitution feature which fish does not implement

235722
ubuntu	opensuse
opensuse is running properly but now i can t go back to ubuntu

235722
ubuntu	opensuse
the first sda1 was setup for ubuntu and i initially tried to use it for opensuse as well

235722
ubuntu	opensuse
do i need to create another efi boot partition to start opensuse or in this case ubuntu

235735
spaces	delimiter
awk reads the input spaces or tab delimiter default

235738
ubuntu	linux
arch linux is not like ubuntu users are expected to be able to read pkgbuilds basic bash scripts essentially and the man page for makepkg and understand the build process sufficiently to responsibly maintain their installations

235739
spaces	delimiter
set awks delimiter to spaces and dot

235741
stdout	stderr
where -o is for stdout and -e for stderr

235741
spaces	delimiter
spaces in the input so the read with delimiter carriage-return -d

235746
mouse	keyboard
basically i would like the option to mark a window as view only so that no keyboard or mouse input is passed through to the program

235746
mouse	keyboard
my primary use case involves rdesktop which sadly doesn t have a way to connect to a remove machine in view-only mode and also is somewhat too greedy about detecting keyboard input but i ve also run into wanting this for other programs that i would like to monitor without accidentally passing them mouse activity

235759
cinnamon	gnome	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
i need 1 pixel width and not 3 or more pixel width like it s currently on all de including cinnamon gnome kde etc

235830
udp	tcp
unlike tcp udp is connectionless fire and forget

235831
stdout	stderr
i believe 1 is dev stdout 2 is dev stderr

235845
icmp	udp
there is an icmp message to signalize that a port even an udp one is closed

235847
vim	emacs
so the displayed value is the currently editor you are using may be vim emacs nano

235867
kde	gnome
i have tried different combinations of unity gnome 3 kde i3 and even e17

235891
rpm	yum
doing a yum localinstall of an updated jdk rpm as suggested in this other posting did not work

filesystems	hfs	filesystems	hfs+
currently latest version 0.23.0 the label and uuid features are not available for hfs and hfs+ filesystems

235904
stdout	stderr
any process get integer numbers as file descriptors where there are three reserved ones in posix 0 is stdin 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

235949
dnf	yum
the the product package name prefix system-release- is actually converted to fedora-release- by yum dnf

235957
width	height
rather than parsing the output of identify by eye or by text utilities you can use its -format option to output the width and height in whatever format suits you best

235957
width	height
a list of image properties that you can output can be found on this page but for the question here it seems all you need are w and h which give the image s width and height respectively in pixels

235968
opensuse	centos
but it seems no one has ever asked this for rhel centos or opensuse for that matter

235974
ubuntu	linux
both run ubuntu linux 15.04 x86-64 and can complete a compile of the linux kernel for raspberry pi when run independently

235988
spaces	delimiter
there are numerous methods for summing data like that one of the methods i use frequently is to pipe it into xargs to convert it into one line with elements delimiter by spaces then into sed to convert spaces to + symbols and then into bc to perform the calculation

235999
ubuntu	mint
i have tried fedora mint and ubuntu and all of them work fine

236004
ffprobe	avprobe
install ffmpeg to get ffprobe also known as avprobe then use

236004
stdout	stderr
this is because ffprobe uses stderr not stdout

236014
cinnamon	gnome
however since i am using cinnamon desktop rather than gnome it seems that this integration does not properly work

236023
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu you can use the command apt-get download available from version 0.8.11 of apt

236040
stdout	stderr
what is the shortest way to redirect last executed command stdout and stderr into single file

236040
stdout	stderr
of course we might use to redirect stdout and stderr into single file and then add and and at the beginning and at the end of file respectively

236054
filesystems	btrfs
to get information on a volume btrfs device stats mountpoint will give you plenty of hints on the state of the filesystems

236054
filesystems	btrfs	umount	btrfs
for an umount volume btrfs check --repair dev thedevice will check and repair the filesystems

236058
debian	centos
other system the relevant language pack for package can be include by the package itself at least on debian and centos

236069
ansible	puppet
edit to clarify i m not looking for any of the classic configuration management tools like puppet chef ansible salt cfengine

236086
ubuntu	centos
i haven t found anything about this specifically for centos - all my other seaches return ubuntu solutions for similar but ultimately different problems

236106
for-loop	loops
the for-loop loops over all provided arguments which are already escaped by the shell when you use wildcards like

236107
stdout	stderr
is it possible to have stderr and stdout printed to screen but redirecting the set -x output to the log file without having it printed to the screen

236107
stdout	stderr
the idea is to have all the info i can get inside the log but only print regular stdout and stderr to the screen

236113
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
machine a simply generates different kinds of network packets udp tcp icmp using a raw socket and sends them over interface eth0 which is directly connected to the eth0 interface of machine b

udp	tcp
sockets with tcp port 53 and udp port 53 are distinct sockets

236475
udp	tcp
can a port be used by two transport protocols tcp and udp simultaneously

236475
udp	tcp
does the quote mean that a port number 53 can be assigned to a port in tcp and to a port in udp at different times but not

236485
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are two different protocols on top of ip

236485
udp	tcp
the tcp port number is part of the tcp protocol and the udp port number part of the udp protocol

236485
udp	tcp
so yes the two can be used simultaneously as tcp and udp are two different protocols with different protocol numbers see etc protocols

236485
udp	tcp
a dns server can and does listen to both udp 53 and tcp 53 at the same time as udp is faster and has less overhead for everyday requests while tcp may be necessary for especially large dns requests on account of udp packet size limits from way back when

236485
udp	tcp
this named can serve hundreds or even thousands of simultaneous udp and tcp client requests via the two distinct ports listed above

236485
udp	tcp
tcp and udp otherwise are two distinct implementations of a transport layer and bear two fields of sixteen bits each that specify the source port and destination port for each tcp or udp packet

236485

you then need to set pinentry-program to a custom wrapper such as this that will run the ncurses or the gtk pinentry depending on that variable

236760
qmail	exim
for example the package mail-transport-agent is a virtual package which is provided by exim postfix qmail etc

236760
qmail	exim
so if you have a package which needs a mta you make it depend on this virtual package and don t have to make it depend on exim or postfix or qmail .

at a minimum it should distinguish between strings int floats and double

without a professional lab you may be able to scrape some of the data off there with photorec link to ubuntu wiki since you seem to be asking about linux mint

236795

it doesn t so much distinguish between strings int floats and double 1 as seamlessly convert between them as needed exactly as perl does

237195
sudo	passwd
depending on your exact needs if you want to do this because youâ re running a long script and donâ t want it to hang in the middle to that question you can ask for the passwd upfront and then execute chsh with sudo privileges reading the passwd from stdin

237195
sudo	passwd
-s causes sudo to read the passwd from stdin

237203
ubuntu	mint
with all the research i did i finally came down to ubuntu and mint

from this stackoverflow thread it seems there is a flag -s that tells sudo to read the passwd from standard input

debian	linux
actually i am having debian linux 8 installed in my system

237378
sudo	passwd
one security feature offered by sudo is that you can have a system without a root passwd so that root user cannot login directly

237391
sudo	passwd
i don t think it s a good idea to configure sudo to not require a passwd

237418
folder	directory
or you could check if a folder with your username exists in home directory

237420
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
all the shells i tested bash dash pdksh mksh tcsh zsh were ok with it but if you find one that doesn t you ll have to handle that with something like

237451
sudo	passwd
so without exaggerating too much we could say that you never need sudo or the root passwd to use your computer

237455
cifs	smb
with the right ports open on the firewall then one could mount and access a cifs smb share over the internet

237459

kvm could either be keyboard video mouse or kernel virtual machine a form of virtualization

children	parent
the shell knows of the parent process as that s the one it has forked itself before executing the command itself but it has no visibility on the children or grand-children that that process may have spawned

237744
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu use bash dash and while you can use and have access to other shells they don t work well with the kernel so for booting up purposes you have to have bash dash

237748
zsh	tcsh
the reason for their predominance over other options csh variants such as tcsh or other things like zsh is just that both are sh -compatible and the vast majority of shell scripts are written for that target

237772
debian	linux
i have a web based pos system running amp formerly on debian now switched to osx due to lacking linux printer drivers

filesystems	ntfs
to the best of my knowledge no certified unix has ever been distributed that could natively handle an ntfs filesystems

237979
filesystems	ntfs
at a higher level there are also uwin and cygwin packages that do much of the same today and these can definitely handle an ntfs filesystems - uwin at least actually requires ntfs in order to recognize and apply unix-style fs permissions on to files

237987
ubuntu	debian
i ve seen bugreports on similar issues in x kde debian and ubuntu and they show fixed

237991
udp	tcp
others like udp and tcp require that packets be addressed to a port as well as an ip address

237991
udp	tcp
sockets with tcp port 53 and udp port 53 are distinct sockets

237991
udp	tcp
if a service can be offered on both tcp and udp it s customary for the port number to be the same in both protocols

237991
udp	tcp
in the above case you d probably have a single dns server that creates two sockets one listening on 0.0.0.0 53 tcp and the other listening on 0.0.0.0 53 udp

237991
udp	tcp
for example 512 tcp is for rexec but 512 udp is for biff

237991
udp	tcp
rexecd listens on 512 tcp and comsat listens on 512 udp

i noticed that if i change the ownership of the newly created folder to tester - then the creating of nested directory is possible for the admin user

fish	tcsh
assuming you want to restrict to bourne-like shells many other shells like csh tcsh rc es or fish support arrays but writing a script compatible at the same time to bourne-like shells and those is tricky and generally pointless as they are interpreters for completely different and incompatible languages note that there are significant differences between implementations

238514
jobs	cron
i m aware of the config.conf possibility for not putting the username and password in the commnand but if someone gets into my server they d be able to see both my cron jobs and the conf file so i m not sure that i see any difference between the two

238543
ethernet	wireless
i was previously using windows 7 to to share wireless internet to a device without wireless capability over ethernet and it worked perfectly

238554
ubuntu	debian
you really should go to debian or ubuntu

238556
ethernet	wireless
i have a machine doing almost exactly what you re talking about only it s wireless on one side 17.16.0.0 24 and staticly-addressed ethernet on the other

238563
debian	linux
i have just installed wifite on debian gnu linux 8 jessie

238566
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
you re just going to have to get used to the chown chgrp and chmod commands

238573
bash	zsh
another comment explains how to fix the find -command your find must support print0 mostly bash and zsh

238578
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am currently running linux mint but i had this same problem on ubuntu 15

238581
chown	chmod
run chmod -r +w etc openvpn to open up a hole for that or do some chown thing

238587
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
so the ubuntu is on a 120gb drive and i would like to install linux mint in its place while also making a partition to install kali linux for college

238587
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
can i just shrink the ubuntu drive and overwrite with linux mint with no grub issues

238604
gentoo	linux
i am running gentoo linux through a virtualbox machine if relevant

238613
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
yes you should be able to just shrink the ubuntu drive and overwrite with linux mint with no grub issues if you are using the gpt partition table format and if your partitions are addressed using the partition guids maybe have a look at boot grub grub.cfg just to be clear

238627
cpu	processors
this may be desirable on systems with only a single processors core or else if overall cpu time is precious but in my experience it is better to saturate a processors and use all cores concurrently to complete the task sooner

238631
spaces	delimiter
not the last sed also pulls in the n ext line and appends it to pattern spaces following an inserted n ewline character delimiter

238656
ubuntu	linux
currently weâ re doing testing on arch linux with a 4.1.10 lts kernel but weâ ve also tried ubuntu 14.04 with mostly worse results

238671
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian compatibility

238671
ubuntu	debian
use ubuntu lts and debian stable or ubuntu and debian sid testing

238671
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian use different compilers

238671
ubuntu	debian
afaik ubuntu is compiled on the preceding ubuntu whereas debian is compiled on the preceding stable

238671
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian have some libraries in different places

238671
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu lts uses upstart whereas debian uses systemd

238671
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian have different package names

238714
chown	mount	chown	chmod
i can use chown and chmod but it certainly should be possible straight from the mount command

238719
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
you are stuck with chown chgrp chmod

238752
ubuntu	debian
i just bought a new laptop and switched from ubuntu to debian 8 jessie i am using gdm3

238769
debian	mint	debian-based	mint
debian and debian-based distros like mint start creating users with uid 1000 so if you created the same users in the same order on both systems they will have the same uids

238785
ubuntu	linuxmint
with linuxmint 17.2 and i imagine other versions of ubuntu you can go to your keyboard setting and then layouts on that page you will find a small options button

238797
udp	tcp
. iperf in udp mode has to keep track of the performance of every udp packet whereas in tcp mode the only interaction is the final summary

238802
debian	linux	disk	ram
this is how i create ram disk manually on linux debian jessie

238805
disk	ram
â¹ this isn t a ram disk it doesn t reserve memory only the space used for files takes up memory and its pages can be swapped out just like application data

238809
bash	zsh
i have already tried unsetopt sh_glob in zsh and set -o noglob in bash

238810
debian	linux	disk	ram
i ve been shortly using this on linux debian jessie to create a ram disk

238818
folder	dir
was wrong dir path on nas server i used the path for admin user which is full path but since pie only has access to the pi folder then it just direct connect to that folder

238827
bash	zsh
ksh93 bash and zsh have regular expressions with a different syntax that s backward compatible with globs

238827
bash	zsh
this syntax needs to be activated with shopt -s extglob in bash and with setopt ksh_glob in zsh

238827
bash	zsh
ksh93 zsh and bash can do regular expression matching with extended regular expressions basically the syntax of awk on strings with the operator of the construct

238834
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu 14.04 gnu linux this appears to be enabled by default

238843
bash	zsh
if you re not using bash or zsh or ksh or any other shell that supports then you can do this instead

238862
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu and probably any debian variant

238889
chown	chmod
change permissions or owner for home alice math only with chmod or chown

238896
procmail	exim
if procmail keeps on being restarted that is because your mail transfer agent mta - postfix or exim keeps on invoking it to deliver mail to user inboxes

238928
ubuntu	debian
as a debian and ubuntu user developer administrator and packager for over 15 years i would not like it if a vendor wanted to deliver software outside of the apt system because of the risks involved

238932
hid	keyboard
in terminal emulator programs the terminal emulator turns keystroke data that it has received through whatever user interface it uses to talk to a keyboard be that the x window system a usb hid device or a linux event device into escape sequences

238933
folder	directory
i have a directory tree that looks like this simplified in truth there are hundreds of folder

238958
kde	gnome
the arch wiki suggests removing the following files from etc xdg autostart if gnome or kde is installed

238978
bash	zsh
use zsh instead of bash where you can define the sorting by name by default

238978
bash	zsh
or use with bash 4.4 or above or in zsh use

238983
spaces	delimiter
to avoid that you can tell awk to use either spaces or comma as the field delimiter using the -f flag

238985
ubuntu	centos
so i m used to ubuntu and centos more than redhat so i m hoping there s some obvious solution to this that i m missing

239005
sudo	passwd
yes you can give your user the right to run sudo du var with no passwd i ll show you how later

239005
sudo	passwd
once you save the file the user schmiddl will have the right to run sudo du -ch var without a passwd so you can add this to your .conokyrc

239024
pull	push
however due to changes in our setup i can no longer push the file from servera to serverb and instead i now need to pull the file from serverb to servera

239027
sudo	passwd
you can configure sudo not to ask for a passwd

239034
sudo	passwd
you can configure sudo to allow your single user account to run the script as root but without requiring a passwd

239069
tunnel	packets
i have currently trying to have a program between two hosts send udp packets over a ssh tunnel

239069
subnet	packets
i believe my program is fine because when i put server02 on the same subnet as client my programs will exchange udp packets perfectly

239094
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux	debian-based	mint
if you are more used to debian-based distros like linux mint i would recommend debian or ubuntu server

239120
put	get
to get the behavior you want in the usual style put the output file name directly after the f or -f

239160
single-quotes	double-quotes
you re trying to pass into the awk script so you need to use double-quotes rather than single-quotes

239160
single-quotes	double-quotes
single-quotes are for literal strings double-quotes are for strings with variables in them

239176
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
we have in house linux servers from different vendors so each server has a different distro rhel centos debian ubuntu and tomcat or jboss

239203
bash	zsh
in bash also works in zsh

239205
pci	ioremap
i have some example code about pci driver but i have difficult on understanding the ioremap and file_operation.mmap

239229
for-loop	arrays
how can i use this sh script with for-loop and an arrays

239241
for-loop	arrays
it really does not make sense to go to the trouble of assigning some shell variable for the sole purpose of assigning a for-loop arrays - its twice the work and not as easy to keep track of

239241
for-loop	arrays
field is actually optional because there is a preset arrays that the for-loop will default to using anyway - the shell s arg arrays

239252
disk	ram
there are certain addresses in memory that are intercepted by motherboard between cpu and ram and redirected to other hardware like disk or keyboard

239258
ubuntu	debian
i run debian 8.20 on a virtualbox vm as my apache server and ubuntu 15.04 as my host os

239262
ubuntu	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux
working solution tested on ubuntu 14.04.3 but probably applies to other debian-based linux flavors and most certainly to red hat

239262
debian	linux
br in choosing a new location bear in mind that the tw database for a typical debian based linux desktop will occupy anywhere from 1.5 to 4mb

239265
ubuntu	debian
so i have a old pentium 3 pc with debian lxde but i would just prefer to ssh into it s terminal and an hp probook 4530s laptop with ubuntu 15.04

239274
ubuntu	centos
the vps provider also has centos and ubuntu images

239301
spaces	delimiter
there is a much more delimiter recommended by posix portable filename character set that doesn t include the spaces -- but it does include upper case

239302
range	max
my sound card can go between -100db and 0db how do i decide if i map it to 0-100 in the snd_ctl_elem_info.value.integer.min max or 0-15 or any other range

239365
bash	zsh
works with sh bash zsh at least

239371
put	get
how can i use bash commands such as sed grep to search for specific words and ignore some charachters in order to get the data and put them in one output file

239381
freebsd	linux
this answer should work with all versions of sed whether on linux freebsd or os x

239390
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
you can t really compare lvm with btrfs since btrfs is a filesystems and operates on files while lvm operates at the block layer and operates on disk blocks

239391
folder	directory
with this permission and configuration above sftp is working fine but i could not meet the requirement of the user because he needs to upload a folder directly in his home user1 directory

239408
folder	directory
i have a directory folder in user1 as home user1 software and i want to set this software folder as home directory of user2 so that whenever user2 logins he can see only software folder that too only with read access to it

239418
emacs	gedit
note in other editors like emacs gedit i don t see this problem

239431
postgresql	mysql
chances are that they re currently not installed the usual choice being mysql not postgresql

239431
postgresql	mysql
there also are thin connectors for several databases that allow rest access to mysql or postgresql through rest apis arrestdb or others

239443
debian	linux
my os gnu linux debian jessie 7 stable

239447
debian	linux
i am developing on linux debian x86-64 an application which runs a specialized web server using libonion -an http server library- fwiw my application is the melt monitor related to the melt domain specific language to customize gcc

239447
google-chrome	firefox
i m using a recent firefox debian iceweasel 38.3 and or google-chrome beta 47.0 as my browser

239452
imagemagick	libtiff
i m using a recent installation of imagemagick and libtiff under cygwin

239460
udp	tcp
you can tweak the filter rule given to tcpdump to exclude stuff you re not interested in port 80 or 443 and or include stuff you are interested in tcp and udp ports 137-139

239471
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome i believe firefox is the same you have the ability to hard reload the current page you can do this with ctrl + f5

239482
spaces	delimiter
the g et command appends sed s hold spaces to pattern spaces following an inserted n ewline delimiter

239482
spaces	delimiter
the n ext command appends the n ext input line to pattern spaces following an inserted n ewline delimiter

239494
filesystems	xfs
non exhaustive list of filesystems concerned ext3 ext4 tmpfs xfs and zfs

239522
ubuntu	linux
why ubuntu booting is taking a lot of time since the kali linux installation

239547
sudo	passwd
i now have a need to be able to connect from server1 to server2 in a shell script and execute a file on server2 as sudo without entering the passwd either in the script or manually

239554
vpn	wlan
if any part of your network is wireless and you don t trust the security of your wlan then you may consider connecting the wireless clients over vpn

239558
lseek	posix
i ve looked through posix tail lseek documentation and didn t find out any description

239564
libcurl	nghttp2
for example i am building libcurl with nghttp2

239571
folder	dir
and also setup sharing folder which is mapped to host dir folder_to_share using virtfs 9p protocol

239602
xfce	kde
i don t use kde so i m not sure if this really works in kde but it works in xfce

239610
daemons	systemd
it s a systemd performance statistics collection daemons highly configurable that has a disk plugin

239621
filesystems	btrfs
in a similar fashion both btrfs and zfs have a scrub command to cause all of the data on them to be read....and reading data on those filesystems causes checksums to be verified thus detecting any errors even on files that don t get accessed very often

239625
ubuntu	debian
the code for modifying users is for debian ubuntu

239625
sudoers	passwd
now configure server2 s sudoers file to allow this new user on server2 to execute only one script as root without a passwd

239625
sudo	passwd
congratulations you may now securely run privileged scripts remotely with no ssh sudo or system passwd

239628
xfce	gnome
themes that work with mate may partially fully work with many other desktops - gnome with relevant gtk3 version and perhaps gnome-shell xfce xfwm needed for windows etc

239633
daemons	systemd
yes in many cases the reload action does end up sending sighup to the daemons through whatever configuration the init systemd has be that init scripts systemd unit files upstart configuration or whatever

239634
sudo	chgrp	folder	directory
alternatively you can change the group of the files with chgrp py-installer -r my python packages directory and run your installer as that group with sudo -g py-installer python setup.py this is a bit more risky as you may end up with incorrect folder permissions if you aren t careful

239644
switching	screens
the tput smcup technically start cursor-addressing mode is often used with xterm and look-alikes to switching to the alternate screens

239644
switching	screens
when dialog exits it sends the rmcup sequence switching back into the normal screens whose content will be the same as before the script began

239644
switching	screens
that asks the terminal emulator to switching back from the alternate screens

239661
octal	binary
attributes are unrelated to the unix file permissions that are often referred to in octal notation which directly represents the 4-bit binary that each of the owner group and other perms require

239695
bash	zsh
this approach uses no gnu extensions and is tested on bash zsh ksh93 dash and ash

239748
single-quotes	double-quotes
i ve used single-quotes around the watch command so i ve used double-quotes around the sed command that s inside it

239751
bash	zsh
i know this type of redirection exists in both bash and zsh but i m not familiar with how it s implemented though i see the zsh manpages contain some implementation details

239765
filesystems	btrfs
this is the root filesystems so there are 3 partitions on each drive 1 boot ext4 2 btrfs 3 swap

239765
filesystems	btrfs
boot is ext4 because upgrading the kernel does not always work if boot was a btrfs filesystems new kernel installed but grub config not updated

239765
filesystems	btrfs
now this mirror is moved to smaller drives the new drives are 120 gb so the btrfs filesystems has to be resized

239768
vim	emacs
editors like emacs or vim has efficient keybindings

239769
debian	linux
i am using debian gnu linux unstable on a raspberry pi 2 and i want to make my system continue booting in case no suitable wireless networks can be found

239810
rpm	yum	package-management	packaging
consider using package-management packaging or the package manager for your specific os rpm yum dpkg etc

239876
width	height
--menu text height width menu-height tag item .

239887
bash	zsh
the bash and zsh etc source command while readable is not universal and does not exist in dash the most posixly correct shell i know

239888
udp	tcp
at the transport layer we have internet protocols like tcp and udp with port numbers ranging from 1 to 65535 on each

239888
udp	tcp
usually each internet standards document that defines a protocol specifies a default tcp or udp port that the protocol should use by default

239888
udp	tcp
such as tcp port 80 for http tcp port 25 for smtp udp port 53 for dns and tcp port 23 for telnet

239888
post	get
because its protocol sequences are made from 8-bit characters you rarely see the protocol itself and its mostly transparent when compared with other more modern protocols like http and smtp that use human visible words in ascii such as get post helo login etc

239888
udp	tcp
the nc program doesn t speak any application layer protocol and when you make a connection with it you are making a connection only at the internet layer ip address and transport layer tcp or udp

239907
filesystems	ntfs
mounted from an exfat or ntfs filesystems

239919
udp	tcp
common malware exploits certain bugs and flaws inside vulnerable services which typically listen to tcp ports or udp datagrams from the network

239936
centos	linux
now when i try to do that on a remote web server running on linux centos with sqlite3 enabled it does not work

239937
put	get
good i ve put in base-feeds.conf the links provided there and tried to run opkg update only to get a wget bad address error holy crap dude i m just trying to install a library

239999
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere k the beginning of the part until k which empties the matching variable so this wil not be part of what is printed

240008
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this happens on linux mint 17.2mate-64bit now and did the same with ubuntu 14.04 last year

240021
folder	directory
i was looking for shared folder in the public network of my schoolhouse and i noticed that a lot of shared directory and devices connected to the network that i can see in windows don t appear in debian s list especially windows shared folder and smart tvs

240039
disk	ram
but when i try to boot from the floppy on my old 128mb ram computer it says disk image failure

240043
bash	zsh
and by the way this isn t bash don t use a debug trap to simulate preexec zsh is where it s from but since zsh 4.3.11 you can use the command line syntax highlighting facility

240045
filesystems	btrfs
warning don t use gparted to resize a multi-device btrfs filesystems

240045
filesystems	btrfs
apparently it doesn t know how to resize multi-device btrfs filesystems and just runs btrfs filesystems resize but does not take care of each device using resize 1 49g and resize 2 49g

240045
filesystems	btrfs
this is what btrfs filesystems show said

240045
filesystems	btrfs
obviously gparted has not resized the filesystems on the second device so btrfs still thinks it s a 500 gb filesystems

240045
filesystems	btrfs
check btrfs filesystems show both devices should have the right size

240052
emacs	sublimetext
some examples of this are when i close shutter launch chrome launch sublimetext or close emacs

240062
portrait	landscape
i found mikher s code very useful however it lays out the pdf entirely as either portrait or landscape so i have modified it to check the layout of each input file and match it in the output

240067
folder	directory
i have certain network share folder mounted in the media directory

240092
ubuntu	linux
i first installed kali linux -c drive was full so installed kali on d by using unetbooting- then i got black screen with white cursor then i installed ubuntu with lili it successfully installed but there is no windows option in the start but only kali and ubuntu

240095
ubuntu	linux
host1 is running arch linux while host2 is running ubuntu 15.10

240117
debian	linux
recently switched all computer systems to debian linux had no issues with my other two systems

240149
versioning	upgrade
note that this kubuntu versioning uses plasma 5 so i did a new install and not an upgrade from the previous versioning

240166
bmp	png	gif	png	gif	bmp
wget -r -a jpeg jpg bmp gif png

240166
bmp	png	gif	png	gif	bmp
wget -r -p save location -a jpeg jpg bmp gif png

240171
ubuntu	linux
additionally i wanted to know if its time to move past ubuntu and try other flavours of linux

240182
postgresql	mysql
it wouldn t be difficult to modify the above script to use the perl dbi module and a postgresql or mysql database to store all of these records in a searchable database....with the case name as the title index field and the text in a text field

240190
stdout	stderr
notably dev tty dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr fall through undetected by the code

240212
centos	linux
scientific linux centos rhel have a dual layer everything dvd but it s less than 7 gb so i doubt it s really everything

240221
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs used up to 2763 mib presumably because it s a copy-on-write filesystems

240228
rpm	yum
you can probably do similar things with rpm yum repos but i m not as familiar with the tools

240248
ubuntu	debian
it s packaged for debian so will also be packaged for ubuntu and derivatives

240257
bash	zsh
without a dollar-sign in front of the name neither zsh nor bash would treat that as a variable rather than as a name or keyword

240265
ubuntu	debian
a good read on this topic is dontbreakdebian ubuntu is based on debian

240269
vmware	virtualbox
in case there is no virtualbox fencing agent you ll have to use vmware kvm xen to host them - they do have the needed agents

240274
bash	tcsh
csh tcsh sh ksh and bash behave the same

240296
stdout	stderr
this will start your command redirecting both stdout and stderr to some output.log which you can specify

240296
stdout	stderr
redirects stderr to stdout so that all output is caught

240308
rpm	yum
install rpm and resolve dependencies with yum

240322
bash	zsh
in supported by zsh where was first introduced inspired by the same operator in the unix port of rc ksh93 the operator was introduced by ksh mksh and bash

240358
sudo	passwd
passing a passwd to sudo in a script is utterly pointless

240367
mutt	thunderbird
due to limitations in mutt it s a bit less interactive than thunderbird s virtual identity

240397
sudoers	passwd
to run this as a normal user without a passwd you ll need a sudoers entry or set the setuid flag set on the telinit executable

240402
post	get
i m sorry this post is rather lengthy and better suited to an archwiki page but i would like to flesh this out a bit before posting it to the archwiki and at the same time wanted to provide you with something substantial enough that you could get started without hopefully feeling too intimidated preferably with archlinux

240409
.htaccess	httpd.conf
my concern is for httpd to read .htaccess i need to change the following settings allowoverride to all in httpd.conf which itself is a concern

240420
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
is there any setting or command in linux ubuntu mint that can disable this annoying enclosure behavior

240437
gentoo	debian
i know live-systems.org where you could customize your debian live but it s debian not gentoo based so not sabayon

240481
stdout	stderr
that redirects both stdout and stderr to the same file

240488
debian-based	linux
it s a debian-based linux system

240492
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox not loading google websites

240504
bash	zsh
bash yash and some versions of zsh allow characters classified as alphabetical in your locale so you could possibly trick those shells into accepting as a valid variable name character by constructing a custom locale where is classified as alphabetical but that would be a rather bad idea and is sure to break things for instance already has a special meaning in bash and zsh

240528
sysv	systemd
i m not interested in the politics around sysv vs systemd but i am confused especially around apache 2.4

240539
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to write a udev rule to allow usb mass storage devices but reject anything else keyboard mouse etc

240568
ffprobe	avprobe
i ve already looked at ffprobe avprobe and mediainfo to no avail

240579
sudo	passwd
the following will allow you to execute sudo commands on multiple hosts while only having to enter your sudo passwd once at the beginning

240579
sudo	passwd
the script creates a file in the temp folder that contains the sudo passwd but that file is deleted immediately

240579
sudo	passwd
this allows the command to use the sudo passwd without it being displayed in the terminal window or in your script

240596
ubuntu	debian
for i don t know what system you re actually running i recently ran into trouble calling a script usign bin sh -c myscript.sh under ubuntu which is a debian derivate which uses dash instead of bash

240612
bash	zsh
i know this is tagged bash but i think this would be easier with zsh

240616
bash	zsh
bin sh as the first line in your scripts yet the scripts use extensions from bash or zsh which are not available in bin sh

240617
openbsd	linux
i also know there is a linux compatibility layer in openbsd

240617
openbsd	linux
would this linux compatibility feature allow me to run the linux version of virtualbox on openbsd

240619
openbsd	linux
openbsd supports running some linux userland programs

240619
freebsd	linux
you need to be running linux freebsd mac osx or even windows if you want to run vbox as a host

240641
children	parent
you also need job controlled -m onitoring in your parent so it keep track of its children

240658
filesystems	xfs
i am trying to create a users quota in rhel-7 with xfs filesystems

filesystems	xfs
xfs filesystems manages quota differently from other fs

240709
daemons	systemd
the daemons will be restarted on systemd restart

240709
debian	centos
it is in the debian repositories i don t know about centos

240710
rpm	yum
on some centos vms i have a few mysql packages to remove via yum and then install mariadb via rpm all in a shell script

240710
rpm	yum
rephrasing the problem issue is not with rpm i only mentioned that for completeness of my problem the problem is with yum

240713
rpm	yum
if you install a package using rpm rather than from a yum repository yum will not know how to determine when the rpm has been removed because there is no relevant repository to refer to

240713
rpm	yum
if you want to make your script idempotent a better approach would be to use rpm -q for the given package to determine if it is installed and use that result to decide whether to run yum

240713
rpm	yum
if you use rpm for installing a package yum will not notice immediately but will warn you when you ask it to update your system that the rpm database was installed outside yum

240753
daemons	systemd
it looks logical to me to have local file systemd mounted and networking operational for uploading the files to svn while sshd is stopped for not receiving any new files before the daemons is stopped

240794
post	get
as i said i took this from a previous answer i get in the post i told at the beginning of this post

240805
bash	zsh
os x comes with zsh so you can write your script in zsh instead note that you were already using zsh syntax since your was not quoted which invokes the split+glob operator in bash

240806
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
1 - install the core system and install a graphical environment - this could be gnome kde xfce or ay other

240844
debian	centos	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian
config tiny is packaged for debian and derivatives fedora centos opensuse and other distros so is easily installed using the appropriate package management tools

240853
freebsd	linux
this construct should work on os x freebsd gnu linux and any other system which provides posix grep

240865
chown	sudo
used sudo chown -r pi pi

240868
chown	sudo
running sudo chown -r pi pi basically broke the ownership of every file on your system

240871
chown	sudo
you may try to repair it by executing chown root root over sudo but it might say that you do not have enough permission to do that so reinstalling might be the only possibility there

240907
wan	lan
it seems like the path from the lan to the wan should be 10.0.0.2- 10.0.0.1- 192.168.0.1- wan and that i should be able to ping a machine on the internet from the lan machine

240926
filesystems	ntfs
this is due to the fact that the best ntfs for linux implementation ntfs-3g is a fuse filesystems where every filesystems call gets redirected to a userspace program a strategy which carries with it a sever performance penalty

240926
filesystems	ntfs
apart from that the ntfs filesystems is written to implement windows security principles rather than linux ones

240926
filesystems	ntfs
if you want to share your linux home directory with a windows operating system rather than trying to use ntfs as your home directory s filesystems it s better to install something like ext2fsd on your windows machine which supports reading the ext2 ext3 and ext4 filesystems from windows

240931
folder	directory
it will move the folder named dir_source located in media to the directory

240944
debian	linux
for the record i m running linux #1 smp debian 3.2.68-1+deb7u2

240945
lwp	libwww-perl
that works well for simple tasks and often works well enough for moderately difficult tasks...but for difficult tasks involving parsing of convoluted html and following links and maybe using cookies i ll write a perl web-bot using the libwww-perl module aka lwp

240954
subnet	vlan
in a correct vlan implementation each vlan has a unique subnet

240964
sudoers	visudo
add to your sudoers file using visudo the following rule

240970
versioning	upgrade
recently i upgrade the bios to the latest versioning available in the acer support page

240994
subnet	packets
as all you have to do is send ip packets for destinations outside your subnet via that router you can use a fake ip address and create a static arp table entry for that router with that fake ip address

241022
ubuntu	debian
i found myself unable to use the vmware workstation 12 trial on debian stretch as well as on ubuntu 15.10

241031
for-loop	loops
before the for-loop and then at the start of loops check that your pattern matches an actual file

241033
for-loop	loops
a potentially more elegant solution would be to convert this to a python script and look into parallel for loops which would allow you to create a single for-loop and run through it in parallel allowing one script to do the work of two or more

241054
ubuntu	debian
i have multiple os on my machine debian ubuntu and windows i already have ubuntu and windows disks encrypted separately

241057
filesystems	btrfs
some modern filesystems like btrfs or nilfs whose structures are radically different don t have such a property though

241060
bash	zsh
the order of 1 and 2 is reversed in some shells like bash or zsh

241065
switching	screens
in theory if an application was designed to cope with an x server context switching it could be provided with the new display screens number save the state of it s windows connect to the new x server screens and resurrect it s windows but few applications would be designed in this way and would necessarily involve either a lot of boilerplate or the inclusion of a library that would facilitate this somehow

241107
bash	subshell
for a bash script this can be done with a subshell

241125
next	except
i m using a bash script which works fine except for some installs i m just calling the gui installer and installing that way clicking next next next.

241127
g++	gcc
g++ - you should use the newest gcc version supported by your version of cuda

241127
g++	gcc
gcc - comes with g++

241127
g++	gcc
i even think cmake might default to having nvcc invoke gcc rather than g++ in some cases with a -x switch but not sure about this

241127
ubuntu	linux
choose linux x86_64 ubuntu and then whatever latest version they have at the time of writing ubuntu 15.04

241127
g++	gcc
execute symlink usr bin g++-4.9 usr local cuda bin g++ and for good measure maybe also symlink usr bin gcc-4.9 usr local cuda bin gcc

241130
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to libmysqlclient versioning 5.5.3 or up or

241130
versioning	upgrade
can anyone please advise on how to upgrade the versioning of libmysqlclient as required

241142
disk	ram
is linux caching the vm disk accesses and that s why it s always using the entire remainder of my ram

241159
stdout	stderr
-cio only set utf-8 encoding on stdin and stdout two of three perl predefined filehandle you have -e for stderr as well

241161
ubuntu	mint
this allows ubuntu mint to automatically mount it to the directory

241177
udp	tcp
the ability to handle dev tcp host port and dev udp host port in redirection was added to bash in version 2.04

241178
for-loop	loops
use false at the bottom of the for-loop to define a default non-zero exit status - if the curl command succeeds - loops breaks and the exit status of the last command should be zero

241178
for-loop	loops
the problem is when the curl command fails loops retries the command five times - if all attempts are unsuccessful the for-loop finishes and the main script resumes - instead of triggering the errexit

241189
udp	tcp
and or try to use tcp instead of udp

241190
udp	tcp
dev tcp and dev udp are different from most other dev entries

241190
udp	tcp
the block and character devices are implemented by the kernel but dev tcp and dev udp are implemented in user mode

241190
udp	tcp
the bash shell is one program which has an implementation of dev tcp and dev udp copied from ksh93

241199
min	max
on bsd and osx you can use jot to return a single random -r number from the interval min to max inclusive

241199
min	max
therefore the interval s min and max are generated less frequently as demonstrated

241200
queue	fifo
there s also a thing called a named pipe or fifo fifo queue

241213
for-loop	while-loop
you can call me old-school to prefer a while-loop rather than a for-loop for two conditions but i find it better to read

241218
debian	linux
another suggested answer proposed using getent which also is likely to be on a linux machine with debian it is part of gnu libc

241245
gentoo	ubuntu
i ve only tested these commands on ubuntu and gentoo

241307
sudo	passwd
if the script is running as the root user this sudo command string should execute the command without requiring a passwd

241315
disk	ram
our key daemon crashed when it occupied about 20 gb of ram and because server doesn t have much disk space to spare there is for the max size of coredump just for 3 gb

241316
debian	linux
i have linux kali 3.12-kali1-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.12.6-2kali1 2014-01-06 x86_64 gnu linux

241380
debian	linux
is linux not included in debian for the arm architecture

241386
ubuntu	debian
encrypted swap partition on debian ubuntu 2008

241403
versioning	upgrade
the place to look for information is not upgrade but installing multiple versioning of a package

241454
wan	lan
lan side is 10.0.0.0 24 or similar so the reply packet is sent to the router s default gateway which is wan side on the public internet

241463
ubuntu	debian
i have windows 7 and ubuntu in the same machine it just happens to debian 8

241467
folder	directory
i have got the apache mysql and phpymyadmin packages working however i cannot find a way to have a folder in my home directory that i can use to work from

241494
folder	dir
my main dir is tmp folder

241497
spaces	delimiter
pipe the output of ls -tr into sed joining the first and last line with a comma option -n suppresses the default output 1h saves the first line newest filename in the hold spaces and at the last line of the file selected by appends the hold spaces newest filename with h to the pattern spaces delimiter by a newline and changes that newline to a comma

241501
folder	directory
it will allow you to navigate across last visited folder and also define a hotlist with directory of your choice

241511
ubuntu	linux
there are only inofficial packages for arch linux and ubuntu 64bit but the app is hassle-free to compile

241513
mouse	keyboard
is it really possible just using keyboard and mouse

241526
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
will work in zsh and fish by default in bash if you first shopt -s globstar in tcsh if you set globstar in ksh93 if you set -o globstar in yash if you set -o extended-glob

241526
fish	bash
bash and fish will switch to the alphabetically first match ignoring the ambiguity

241541
stdout	stderr
this ensures that no output goes to stdandard error even from the shell itself because having data coming on both stderr and stdout can be a source of deadlocks with popen

241541
content-disposition	content-type
how the file is handled by the client depends on the settings of these response headers and others content-type content-encoding and content-disposition see look at the response-header and the entity-header information

241552
installation	upgrade
however it was once a default fedora installation which has been upgrade whenever a new release came out

241553
mouse	keyboard
when i open too many more than 8 9 tabs in chrome the whole gui freezes and the mouse pointer doesn t move and the system responds incredibly slowly to keyboard input 20s delay

241558
single-quotes	double-quotes
single-quotes are fine here but if you wanted to embed the value s of any variable s in the url you d need to use double-quotes

241571
folder	directory
from the partition s root directory to set all file and folder permissions to what they are normally on my linux partition but i m a little afraid it might mess up windows

241572
filesystems	ntfs
permissions on ntfs filesystems are a mount option

241583
filesystems	ntfs
if the other partitions are formatted with a filesystems type understood by ubuntu including ntfs with the ntfs-3g packages installed your ubuntu system will be able to access files in those other partitions

241591
mp3	flac
mp3fs view your flac files as mp3 files that get created on-the-fly when you copy click-drag them to your mp3 player

241591
joystick	keyboard	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
if you want to create a virtual input device like a keyboard mouse joystick etc

241591
pulseaudio	mixer
the only user of the cuse api that i m personally aware of is the same program which prompted its creation osspd which implements dev dsp dev adsp and dev mixer the oss audio api in userspace so they can be routed through pulseaudio or dmix

241591
udp	tcp
for example you can open up raw communication with any usb device using libusb list of bindings on the page and then communicate with other programs through some other mechanism tcp udp sockets reading writing stdin stdout or regular files on disk etc.

241600
kde	kubuntu
in an older version of kubuntu with kde 4 it was at .kde share apps recentdocuments

241600
kde	kubuntu
there s nothing at that location in kubuntu 15.10 with kde 5 but recent documents are still tracked

241612
google-chrome	firefox
now i am using a wi-fi hotspot on iphone 4 in another building and typing localhost in both google-chrome and firefox loads a page of google search results rather than the web application

241613
tunnel	lan
if i bring up the tunnel between the ubuntu server and raspberry pi i can connect to the openvpn server internally from all clients browse the lan and internet and i get the pia external ip from the pia tunnel on the raspberrypi when browsing

241613
tunnel	lan
if i drop the tunnel between the ubuntu server and the pi i can get back in to my lan from the outside.

241613
vpn	lan
so the goal is wherever i am i can dial my home vpn be able to access the lan but also have the pia external ip not my home isp ip

241632
pop-up	dialog
return code is a failure you can run a pop-up dialog like zenity for example

241658
google-chrome	firefox
can anyone tell me how to do this in firefox and or google-chrome

241659
centos	linux
i m not very familiar with it but caps lock to control is a pretty common request and you should be able to find it if you search for doing it in centos linux or anything other than tmux

241704
move	drag
do not drag and drop the files there as they will be move completely

241705
debian	linuxmint
linuxmint is based on debian which apparently has no tool for this

241711
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried google-chrome and firefox in both linux xubuntu and windows and windows versions have the colors less saturated and more darker so it s more pleasant to read

241712
ubuntu	mint
mint 17.3 rafaela of course uses ubuntu 14.04 lts the latest kernel supported by which is 3.19 i think we re on kernel version 87.32 now

241712
ubuntu	mint
since mint is basically ubuntu i did

241722
pulseaudio	mixer
you could try to check if the problem is with pulseaudio or not by disabling it temporarily in configs and instead enabling alsa s mixer thingie

241726
folder	directory
when i run ls on a folder with directory that have a 777 permission the ls colors are purple text with a green background which is unreadable

241738
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade from firefox 24.1 to the latest stable versioning of firefox 42.0

241741
freebsd	linux
use the id command linux id freebsd id pretty standard to inspect the group membership

241761
sudo	passwd
use sudo to allow the backup user to execute that command without a passwd

241782
ubuntu	debian
if you use ubuntu you can run the liquorix kernel at least if it s current ubuntu not lts same for debian non stable releases

241808
folder	directory
assuming you put the nodejs folder in your home directory you can now do

241808
folder	directory
this will create a symlink from the nodejs folder in your home directory to the bin directory meaning that any updates to the directory in your home folder are reflected in the folder elsewhere via the symbolic link

241808
folder	directory
now you want to make sure that the bin folder containing the nodejs directory is in your environment variable so open the .profile file in your home directory

241826
debian	linux
debian 6 squeeze even with the linux 3.2 available as a backport the radeon driver will not handle your apu s turbo core feature

241826
debian	linux
debian 7 wheezy linux 3.16 is available as a backport

241826
debian	linux
debian 8 jessie based on linux 3.16

241860
sysv	systemd
i m trying to convert a sysv init script to systemd

241922
mouse	keyboard
after i boot on mint and the system started after like 2 minutes it just freeze first freeze the system and then the mouse and keyboard

241928
versioning	upgrade
redhat pretty much doesn t upgrade any software to a new major versioning

241929
mp3	flac
it should be noted that it makes no sense making a flac file out of an mp3 file because the mp3 is already lossy encoded

241929
mp3	flac
going from mp3 - flac and then flac - mp3 makes no sense as the quality will be impaired from the first original mp3 encoding step

241931
debian	linux
debian linux 8.2 64bit xmonad 0.11

241932
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
fortunately most linux distributions ubuntu redhat debian etc.. has this driver pre-installed

241952
gnome-terminal	stty
for example if i run stty -f dev pts 10 right now while i have a bash talking to a gnome-terminal via that pty i see

241964
ubuntu	linux
i have successfully build opencv using this linux install tutorial on an ubuntu distribution in the past but recently i needed to build it on a arch linux distribution

241972
jobs	cron
i have the following general question regarding cron jobs

241975
jobs	cron
cron will start jobs at the time it scheduled to do so

241979
sysv	systemd
it seems you are running a systemd with systemd yet you are using sysv commands

241979
sysv	systemd
did you create a sysv init script or a systemd unit file

241979
daemons	systemd
state active exited means that systemd has successfully run the commands but that it does not know there is a daemons to monitor

241980
jobs	cron
each cron job is executed independent of any other jobs you may have specified

241998
disk	ram
the specs of the guest are 2 cores 4 threads 4gb ram 15gb image which leaves 1gb of disk space for testing

241999
filesystems	ntfs
non-ssd non raid storage - encrypted linux filesystems - ntfs provides a lot opportunities for i o slowdowns

242001
kde	gnome
if you re doing this in x such as kde or gnome then once you select the text it will be in your x server s primary selection keyboard

242053
folder	directory
how would i use wget to download only folder that contain a specific term in their names from an ftp site that also has multiple other directory without that term in their names

242059
switching	screens
they are on every screens and after workspace switching they are focused instead of last window even if minimized

242069
unix	solaris
i am new to the unix section here in my company and now i got the task to install solaris 11 on a new ldom

242169
tunnel	packets	tunnel	vpn
i have a simple tunnel vpn program written in c that displays packets in plain-text

242208
min	max
i have a score matrix like below scorefile where the 3rd column 1 max 0 min says how close the 2nd column variable is to the 1st column variable

242224
mouse	keyboard
for example to read the keyboard you would use ncurses and to read the mouse you would use gpm

242249
versioning	upgrade
i know that zypper up updates the current installed packages and zypper dup is supposed to upgrade the whole system to a new versioning

242257
sudo	passwd
after that you should be able to use that passwd in sudo

242264
switching	screens
whatever was on the screens will swap back in pretty quickly but switching to another process and you ll be waiting a couple seconds as it swaps back into memory too

242264
disk	ram
i recently realized that this problem has a surprisingly simple solution after thinking about it for a bit take note of the tags that label what pages are on disk and in ram then restore this exact state on resume

242264
disk	ram
the moment the suspended userspace is reanimated all loaded processes are attempting to execute code and fighting to swap themselves back into ram causing massive disk i o

242293
ubuntu	debian
in debian 8 jessie and ubuntu trusty 14.04 lts the xbase-clients package has been replaced by a set of utilities found in the x11-xkb-utils package

242298
folder	directory
respectable projects release tar archives that contain a single directory for instance zyrgus-3.18.tar.gz contains a zyrgus-3.18 folder which in turn contains src build dist etc

242299
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
that s because in linux the default user shell is often bash and the bin sh was often symlinked to bin bash on redhat base distro or bin dash on debian and ubuntu base distro

242307
debian	linux
sorry iâ m novice in linux and i am looking for information how to create new user account in debian with pre-defined encrypted password

242325
postfix	dovecot
i have a single server with dovecot and postfix installed to handle email

242328
ansible	puppet
puppet ansible etc are great for mass-deployment and updates and pdsh is great for mass command-line server administration

242336
cos	sin
since in your script i see no apparent reasons to need the use the replot command i suggest to use directly the comma to separate the two curve to be plotted plot sin x cos x for example

242366
sysv	systemd
regarding the bluetooth.target file the concept of sysv init runlevels has been replaced with targets in systemd

242368
gentoo	linux
if relevant i m using the vi editing mode on a gentoo linux box

242379
next	except
next command will print all lines except line starting with include in file.txt

242383
filesystems	ntfs
i have already done this with other filesystems like vfat or ext4 but i am not able to do it with ntfs

242393
sudo	passwd
in that case use sudo which will give root-equivalent access using your own passwd

242399
ubuntu	debian
currently ffmpeg is missing from apt packages when using the stable versions of debian and ubuntu

242463
debian	linux
i ve got an embedded headless debian linux box which boots from a read-only filesystem image

242463
debian	linux
what is the proper way to do this in debian linux

242513
put	get
in these cases i use sftp to first navigate to required location then use get or put to actually download or upload a file

242514
bash	zsh
testing with debian testing bash dash bin sh zsh and ksh93 using strace -fo to capture system calls and process ids

242514
bash	zsh
i see that zsh and ksh93 use one process fewer than bash and dash

242519
put	get
according to the error you get you have put the stanzas from the gmail example in the wiki in the wrong sections

242543
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
with debian and derivatives like ubuntu mint etc you can save the current set of selected packages with

242557
debian	linux
i am working on a debian package which usually installs in tftpboot linux

242590
redhat	fedora
you can use fedora packages if the libraries dependencies didn t changed between what rhel has and what fedora has slim chance since redhat 7 is based on fedora 19

242599
apache	nginx
the aim is to learn installing linux services like apache mysql dns ftp nfs squid mail servers etc after which i d like to proceed to learn more complex areas like iptables nginx and try out other services like varnish docker memcached puppet chef salt and much more

242626
debian	mint	debian	linux
in both cases one would have access to debian s repositories and some additional linux mint packages through lm s software manager

242626
ubuntu	debian
i ve read for instance that ubuntu is using a different one compared to debian resulting in slightly different boot times

242633
jobs	cron
i m thinking this needs to be done entirely in the crontab checking if the current server is web01 and to run the cron jobs inside the if statement otherwise do nothing however i m not entirely sure the best way to express that with an if statement

242638
spaces	delimiter
cut -d -f4 uses single spaces as delimiter to choose 4th column

242650
bash	zsh
bash zsh etc

242663
debian	mint	debian	linux
one machine is running debian jessie kernel 3.16.0-4-amd64 and the other one linux mint 17.2 kernel 3.16.0-38-generic x86_64

242668
filesystems	btrfs
current versions are even able to fix typical errors in a btrfs raid-5 filesystems for example by replacing a failed drive although raid56 still needs improvement see update below

242673
versioning	upgrade
the syntax i was using was for a newer versioning of pf and in order to fix it i just upgrade to the latest versioning of openbsd

242693
jobs	cron
you have three almost-identically configured servers but you want to run the cron jobs on only one of them

242693
jobs	cron
if web01 dies you presumably want to pick up the cron jobs on another server

242719
debian	linux
update 11 19 although my final solution needs to run on linux probably a small version of debian i have installed windows 10 as it appears more compatible with the drivers on advantech s website

242720
sudo	passwd
you could try printf s n username encryptedpassword | sudo chpasswd -e - that may be able to bypass the passwd checking enforced by pam

242743
ubuntu	linux
hello i was wondering if linux ubuntu has a way of restoring the system if something goes wrong like a microcomputer software windows personal computer

242749
ubuntu	linux
the operating system is ubuntu linux

242750
ansible	puppet
i am not aware of ansible but i assume it would have something similar to facts in puppet where you could write a custom fact to gather this info

242755
g++	gcc
i also compared gcc g++ and ld versions between the two machines and they match

242781
packets	multicast
what does not work is the receiving the multicast packets and updating clock on the client s side

242781
packets	multicast
i am currently sniffing packets on the client machine and i can see multicast coming

242793
debian	mint	debian	linux	xfce	gedit
using thunar 1.6.3 and gedit 3.14.0 on linux mint debian with xfce

242794
octal	decimal
the value ctbl saves to is a valid shell arithmetic expression that if evaluated will concurrently set variable names of the forms to decimal and octal values of all respective bytes in the first character of its first argument but ultimately evaluate to the total number of bytes in its first argument

242834
lvm	btrfs
if you re not using lvm or btrfs or zfs then move and symlink is the best you can do

242835
cpu	processors
so the processors cpu gets loaded but i can t measure it with top

242855
bash	subshell
in bash ksh and similar you can use to avoid the subshell that | creates

i m not a linux expert and i just realized that it s not that easy to upgrade a versioning of gcc on a debian 7.x

242876
versioning	upgrade	debian	linux
what would be the best solution to upgrade the gcc versioning to a debian wheezy so that it supports c++ 11 features on my linux dev platform

242892

when i specify the download directory it actually creates the folder if it doesn t exist but then i go into the packages subfolder and there s nothing displayed

242918
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
it it has been in debian - ubuntu - mint for some time so it s a fair comment to say it s the better option most of the time

242937
bluetooth	usb
i have two usb bluetooth adapters one built-in doesn t work hci1 but seems to be the default

242950

backslash	double-quotes
that avoids having to use double-quotes around the awk script to use the shell directly...as that would require escaping every instance of and every in the awk script with a backslash

243003
sudo	passwd
deeper answer is you could compromise your system by making a sudo user user without a passwd

243016
versioning	upgrade
this will upgrade everything to the latest versioning

243040
sudoers	visudo
syntax would look somehow like this in file etc sudoers edit with visudo

partclone supports all common and some uncommon fileystems used on linux ext2 3 4 btrfs xfs etc and windows ntfs fat

243076
sudo	passwd
the easiest way to eliminate the passwd prompts is to do all of this as root sudo -i to get a root shell so you don t need to preface every command with sudo and to as root run ssh-copy-id hostip to install root localhost s ssh key in .ssh authorized_keys on hostip

243096

mouse	trackpad
the bug is occuring in the gui version of systemsettings - mouse trackpad settings

243162
libc	binutils
i also don t want to remove any system tools gcc binutils and libraries i believe the system should use its own libc or openssl rather than mine

243171
ubuntu	linux
several questions on ask ubuntu unix linux and serverfault have been posted that look like this problem but most of them aren t they complain about writing on reading files or on the filesystem being idle while in my case this never occurs the stalling only occurs when writing files

243263
inittab	fstab
as for as the names of crontab cron table inittab init table and fstab filesystem tables as far as i know besides the obvious association of tab with table it means they are the main files for configuring those actions

243263
daemon	cron
the manpage for vixie crontab specifically mentions the tables crontab is the program used to install deinstall or list the tables used to drive the cron 8 daemon in vixie cron

243346
ffmpeg	libvpx
i couldn t downgrade libvpx because of other dependencies on it ffmpeg

243348
cpu	processors
to know if you run into processors memory issues you can run system monitor and look at the overhead on the cpu and ram while doing transfers

243348
disk	ram
you can also create a ram disk with a file and then write from that to the ssd to gauge true write speeds

243353
fish	zsh
the closest thing i can see similar to set -o xtrace in zsh by calling fish with -d 4 or

243362

decoder	encoder
description-en encoder and decoder for quoted-printable encoding

243499
folder	directory
i noticed that the folder lost+found has a size of 16k while all of the other directory has a size of 4k

243529
sniffing	pcap
sniffing traffic with iftop also places a burden on the system which can be more or less significant depending on the volume of traffic as network data has to be fed to and processed by the pcap api

243530

you re following instructions written for arch linux on debian linux

243559
debian	linux
debian linux packages dkms in a very different way to arch linux

243559
debian	linux
debian linux uses modprobe.d files

243583

at first the problem was only associated with the tls ssl https lookups on on pretty much everything from time-to-time -- not all the time

243583
google-chrome	firefox
take github as an example in google-chrome or firefox

243605
daemons	systemd	cpu	affinity
i need to set the default cpu affinity for all the daemons managed by systemd except a specific service

243605
cpu	affinity
setting service s cpu affinity at etc systemd system myname.service.d scheduler.conf works just fine so i guessed i could set my service affinity to say cores 2-11 and let the rest of the system to live with cores 0-1

243605
cpu	affinity
i experimented a bit more and found that although i can setup default cpu affinity in etc systemd system.conf the setting in etc systemd system.conf.d doesn t seem to have any effect

243608
spaces	delimiter
i have a table ascii format with spaces delimiter as follow

243611
ubuntu	debian
i have tried following various fixes for ubuntu and windows which didn t work for me couldn t find any for debian

243614
bash	zsh
to solve that you can use zsh instead of bash see here for details

243617
bash	zsh
in general which came first from zsh bash and ksh copied it later where n1 and n2 are integers produce all numbers between n1 and n2

243645
wav	flac
i was having a very similar problem except that i wasn t using flac - the original rip was to wav instead i believe

243718
ctime	posix
the find program also documented in posix includes an option to use ctime

243736

bash ksh and zsh support arrays

243743
ubuntu	debian
the 1st vm is running debian 8.2 and the 2nd one is running ubuntu server 14.04.2 lts

243748
spaces	linefeed
checking the source code in the similar function gnu patch treats whitespace as spaces and tab with some special handling according to whether the lines have a trailing linefeed

243770
dpkg	aptitude
this se recommends using aptitude which fwiw i prefer and suspect does a better job than dpkg for both backup and install and this se recommends deborphan for the backup

243785
bash	zsh
when i m using a posix compliant shell es dash bash zsh ... can i be sure that will always expand in alphabetical order dictated by lc_collate

243794
stdout	stderr
fuser was written to send part of the output to stdout and part of the output to stderr

243816
spaces	delimiter
that s a good way of causing yourself pain like say - you want to extend it to include command line args which are spaces delimiter

243825
bash	zsh
recursively if you want a list sorted by filename with zsh or ksh -o globstar or bash -o globstar or yash -o extended-glob

243830
debian	mint	debian	linux
i work on linux mint debian edition 2 betsy.

243840

243940
pull	push
i would like git users to be able to clone push and pull using their linux username and password but not to be able to login to linux console

243945
ffmpeg	libav
for some time there was a so-called ffmpeg available after debian switched to libav but it was not from ffmpeg

243945
ffmpeg	libav	ffmpeg	libavformat
libav split from ffmpeg and kept the ffmpeg binary name it also kept the names of the libraries and the libav name was already being used by ffmpeg as a collective noun for the libraries libavcodec libavformat libavutils etc.

243945
ffmpeg	libav
the debian ffmpeg package maintainer at the time a member of the libav fork switched debian to use libav

243945
ffmpeg	libav
libav eventually deprecated renamed their ffmpeg to avconv then eventually removed the counterfeit ffmpeg but some downstream users such as ubuntu kept the old fake ffmpeg for compatibility and transitional reasons for some time

243945
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu eventually removed the buggy old dead fake ffmpeg

243945
ubuntu	debian
ffmpeg returns in debian stable jessie-backports and ubuntu vivid 15.04

243945
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu drops libav

243945
ffmpeg	libav
ffmpeg development is very active and now that libav has lost its major downstream users i think you can ask this question about avconv instead

243957
zlib	libjpeg
i also tried installing libjpeg and zlib but keeps resulting in same error

243966
sudoers	visudo
make sure to use visudo for changing the file and visudo -c to check your sudoers

243974
sudoers	passwd
the result is unexpected it ask for passwd and after typing the passwd i got ops_admin is not in the sudoers something like this

243978
debian	linux
i m a new user to linux i develop a project in which using beaglebone black board with debian in which i need connect the board automatically to open networks detected via wifi authentication without encryption when the board is start

243987
sudoers	visudo
you need to add a rule in etc sudoers with visudo that allows either user ops_admin or all members of group dev_admin to run some or all commands as root

243993
sudo	passwd
sudo is in itself a solution but the problem is that unless i leave terminal it doesn t ask for passwd when it s been entered once in a single session

244002
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian netinstalls cannot retrieve preseed files over ssl

244014
chgrp	chmod
then use chgrp to change the group of the directory to your new group and chmod to make the directory group writeable

244020

i m trying to launch live not ondemand rtmp stream from ubuntu but i succeed only with rtsp stream through vlc

244059

lvm	btrfs
this can be easily achieved if you have btrfs lvm or zfs but otherwise isn t practical

244120
filesystems	xfs
i want to change the label of the root filesystems xfs

244156
sudo	passwd
this is because su requires the root passwd wheras sudo makes use of the user s passwd

244156
sudo	passwd
this means if users have sudo access and their account passwd is compromised then the attacker now also can run commands as root

244158
folder	directory
but the problem is that i have seven folder in directory each of them has one xml file.is it possible to extend my script so that it enters all seven folder and gets the information from each off them

244160
versioning	upgrade
i cannot upgrade the kernel so i m wondering if arm versioning of slackware 14.0 would run on this kernel

244199
postfix	dovecot
i just set up a new email server using postfix and dovecot

244235
bash	zsh
outside of posix bash and ksh and zsh also have c-style for loops

244255
for-loop	loops
if you want a for-loop that increments an integer variable use the form of the for-loop that increments an integer variable or more generally performs arithmetic on loops variable s

244255
bash	zsh
this construct works in bash and ksh93 and zsh but not in plain sh

244257
sudo	passwd
as for the sudo passwd prompt my crystal ball tells me you put the nopasswd entry before another entry without nopasswd for the same user

244259
debian	linux
while this methods works on debian derivative gnu linux systems it is advisable to stick with the official kali repositories for the most part

244262

244262
switching	screens
switching to from the alternate screens tput smcup

244276
folder	directory
avahi didn t work for me due to what i am running on my server and frankly whilst it is nice to see your network share pop up on the finder sidebar a workaround to not installing avahi is to create a master share directory folder then plop all your shares in it

244276
folder	directory
then when you command-k smb yourserver.local your.master.share the drive mounts and there is the folder directory shareone sitting right there just drag it to your sidebar and then any time you need to log in just click it

244276
folder	directory
just one thing to note if the folder icon on the share has 3 little people in it you can t drag that to your sidebar that is why we have to put a secondary directory folder inside it so you can drag that to your sidebar

244292
fastboot	adb
after this adb fastboot and related development utilities like mksdcard all worked just fine on my 64-bit intel system

244293

you can replicate the chown chmod and find command on as many directories as you wish for any sharing purpose you wish not just git

244311
debian	linux
bugs in the chipset bugs in the default firmware of debian bugs in linux in several wifi drivers packages from the manufactures that are mostly old versions of the firmware that need an outdated hostapd that brings backs old bugs already fixed

244327
gentoo	linux
i have been writing shell scripts for converting the amd64 handbook of gentoo linux to pdf and this is my current shell script

244375
daemon	cron
however is important to note that ntpdate with contrived cron scripts is no substitute for the ntp daemon which uses sophisticated algorithms to maximize accuracy and reliability while minimizing resource use

244413
mp3	flac
the second if statement works it was only been letting in mp3 and flac and has been working i just decided to try this to get rid of the rest of files that are not mp3 or flac within the directories now and i ve tried all of the variations that i can think of with the quote marks var var and brackets var around the var name and the and on the if statement

244419
opensuse	linux
with some suggestions to try an older kernel as well as windows i tested a fresh install as well as updated opensuse 13.2 as well as a fresh install of windows 7 this one 32bit linux is 64bit with the marvell driver

one function that loops through a directories contents and makes an md5 hash for each file storing them in an .md5 checksum file in the same directory

244448
hash	md5
i am trying to keep the .md5 file standard which i believe is the md5 hash followed by the file name on one line for each file

244455
dnf	yum
specifically this wiki page which is linked in the question explains how to use yum dnf directly for upgrading which is not recommended it s not the official way

244549

244566
daemons	launchd
what i really want to know is whether or not it actually chroots and if so how a ssh user daemons 1 can be launchd in that jail in spite of the obvious lack of the required binary lib in the chroot

244566
daemons	launchd
1 i m talking about the actual transient daemons with user priviledges that is launchd upon connection by the main root openssh daemons

apache	lighttpd
scroll down until you find something labeled webserver i have lighttpd instead of apache and don t know exactly how the apache entry would look like and uncheck it

244629
filesystems	xfs
increased xfs filesystems size from 100tb to 500tb

mpfr	mpc
once gcc 4.9.3 has been compiled should i compile it again - and all other dependencies gmp isl mpc mpfr - with the built version 4.9.3

244680
ethernet	wireless
what it appears you have here is a wired connection eth0 ethernet wired connection the lo which is always the return ip of your nic loopback 127.0.0.1 and a wireless lan connection wlan0 wireless lan connection

244680
ethernet	wireless
this is because while an ethernet cable is plugged into your computer what i m assuming is a laptop it will temporarily disable your wireless connection from passing traffic

244685
bash	zsh
prints all the four yes in ksh ksh93 lksh mksh bash and zsh

244692
ubuntu	mint
this mint 17.2 seems to be a lot more compatible with my macbook pro than the ubuntu 13.04 but during the second install i am having problems during boot up

244701
centos	linux
if you care about security you can choose a linux distribution that has mandatory access control mac enabled by default - fedora or centos they use selinux

244708
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason google-chrome picks roboto thin instead of roboto regular whereas firefox picks the regular one

244718
debian	linux
i have installed debian and its version is linux version 3.16.0-4-amd64

244719
ubuntu	debian
b43-lpphy-installer is the name of the package for ubuntu not for debian

244735
filesystems	btrfs
i m running debian sid on a btrfs but i ve had the same problem with ext4 so i don t think it s a filesystems specific issue

244739
ubuntu	debian
and because ubuntu is based on debian it should work this way in firefox there too

244747
subnet	packets
this will set up routes for each of those subnet so that packets destined for 192.168.3.100 for example will be routed through eth1

244789
bash	tcsh
this is a bash command it won t work in tcsh or ksh

244796
for-loop	loops
similar to the for-loop above you could use a while loops to read the file

244835
ubuntu	centos
this was tested on ubuntu 14 and centos 7

244846
debian	linux
linux debian wheezy

244850
tunnel	vpn
any time you have a machine establish a vpn tunnel that isn t in a virtual environment on a nat connection the vpn tunnel is going to take over the connection and completely segregate itself from any other traffic

244859
versioning	upgrade
this is a work computer and my corporate policy states that i must keep my operating system up to date so i recently installed the aforementioned kernel versioning via yum upgrade the upgrade also pulled over 100 updated packages restarted and now i was unable to start my vms

consider the following setup my laptop is normally located at my desk connected to power external keyboard and mouse and an external monitor

244890
spaces	delimiter
the list of delimiter include a spaces three pipe and a spaces in that order will be used by paste circularly

244897
redhat	fedora
the correct place to edit the grub config on a fedora redhat system is the one file you specifically suggested as not being necessary to change etc default grub

244898
spaces	delimiter
you set 5 delimiter with -d ||| spaces | | | spaces and 4 dummy files - - - - that will take data from the empty string

244922
tunnel	packets
except that they aren t i know exactly what these packets are for where they re from and where they re going my ssh tunnel

244930
filtering	grouping
the word grouping is just an anomaly of the filtering and can be ignored

244970
folder	directory
if i want to open this directory in a gui-based file browser i have to double click folder after folder to reach it

244970
ubuntu	linux
for reference i have an ubuntu system but i d like to know what the commands are across the various distributions of linux

244975
vpn	traceroute
traceroute to google with vpn on

244976
kde	gnome
on kde there are two popular file browsers i m not aware of a command similar to gnome-open though gnome-open can be executed within kde but by default it opens gnome apps

244989
daemons	systemd
i m writing some testing code and i d like to know if it will be portable if it assumes that the user with uid 1 is named daemons on all unix systemd

244992
traceroute	packets
and of course traceroute will actually give you an indication of where the packets are also going

244992
tunnel	packets
another thing of note is that it looks suspicious that your tunnel is sending packets but receiving

245003
gnu	groff
however they have all been overtaken by the gnu mom macro package developed specially for groff and postscript pdf output

245010
public	protected
i d like to be able to do this so that i can secure all the admin services on my turnkey linux machine by binding all of them to the localhost address 127.0.0.1 and only allow them to be accessed via local port forwarding in an ssh secured environment with a passphrase protected public key file

245049
filesystems	btrfs
some filesystems offer a clone functionality for example btrfs

245051
daemons	systemd
you could use lmgrd which is a systemd daemons

245061
disk	ram
if this is done religiously there should be little to nothing worthless in ram that could be swapped out to disk without sacrificing performance

245085

ubuntu	linux
i have been thinking of migrating to arch linux from ubuntu but the only thing that is stopping me from migrating is the installation not the hardcore stuff but the internet connectivity.i am on a university wifi which requires us to sign into our accounts from the browser but on arch installtion there won t be any browser to login into.i am posting a screen shot of the login screen that we get immediately after connecting to wifi and opening the browser

245510
tunnel	packets	udp	tcp
one of them is that you actually pay for usage and traffic in aws other is the slowness of using ssh connections tunnelled inside ssh connections another is that it will be not impossible but cumbersome to tunnel udp connections on top of the tcp ssh connections and lastly the longer rtt involved in the packets travelling to the nearest aws center and coming back

ssd	sata
i placed the isp cable modem router combo in bridge mode and connected there a raspberry pi compatible lamobo r1 with an wifi chipset 5 ethernet gigabit interfaces and a sata port + ssd disk running linux

245520
stdout	stderr
also btw the correct way for a program to do logging is neither stdout nor stderr it s by using the syslog functions that are available in most languages

245536
folder	dir
had it check to see if parent dir was already created in the different desanation base folder then if true just copy into it then delete the old dir else move the whole thing

filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is more sophisticated than most filesystems and it includes support for multiple devices

debian	mint
i think it went wrong because i mixed the debian sources with mint other repositories

245631
ubuntu	linux
i should probably also mention that while the host runs on ubuntu 14.04 the guest vm itself is powered by arch linux

245668
folder	directory
problem - once i try and access the folder on the website internet the authentication popup comes up however when i fill in the username and password it does not proceed further and keeps showing the popup again and again without access to the directory

245675
jobs	cron
the way to avoid any discrepancy whatsoever is just include absolutely paths to directories and scripts when you know jobs will be executed via cron

245683
folder	directory
personally i have win osx and nix folder containing important tools and portable apps and these directory are on this same usb drive right alongside the multiboot directory

245683
ubuntu	linux
if you want to persistently-preserve files across reboots and run linux like a full installation i believe yumi has the option to create a separate static partition on the drive but it claims to be limited only to ubuntu

note this write up is using mint as the base from which to create the usb installation but you should be able to follow along easy enough from your ubuntu installation

as plugwash suggested i added ubuntu mirrors to a debian system

but probably none of them have a name with 0 in it so just cut away completely up to the first spaces delimiter string with one in it save it and cut all that follows

245984
filesystems	btrfs
you don t use a copy on write or overlay filesystems like btrfs or aufs

you can then use kali linux for attacking metasploitable via a network emulated by your hypervisor vmware virtualbox etc.

second the browser requests the os to get the dns and the os subject to various tcp udp parameters will keep trying the request to the dns server until it gets an answer

jobs	cron
since you say that the application log didnt show anything helpfull you should exame system logs like dmesg and cron jobs

246006
folder	directory
if you want to store all the files in folder under their name without a directory indication you can use the -j option

246006
folder	directory
if you have files in subdirectories they won t have any directory component in the archive either folder subdir foo will be stored in the archive as foo

246006
folder	directory
if you do that if you include files in subdirectories they ll have their relative path from the directory you changed into folder subdir foo will be stored as subdir foo

in a typical desktop installation this includes the windowing system commonly xorg the window manager and desktop environment unity on ubuntu by default others include gnome and kde as well as a whole host of other processes that perform essential operations so that you can interact with your system

the command s output known as stdout or the standard output also stderr or standard error are by default hooked up to the terminal so you see the output of your program

246582
zsh	tcsh
csh tcsh vim and zsh which have an operator to extract that part of the file name call it the root name or root of the file name well applied to foo bar.baz is foo bar so bar would rather be the root of the basename or the basename of the root

you might be interested that last year there was no working library support for suse linux and as a result i could not yet add linux nfsv4 acl support to star while this exists for solaris os x and freebsd

246616
ubuntu	debian
or to put it more clearly for anyone like me who lands here it seems that standard is debian without a desktop gui rather than with a default gui such as ubuntu s unity and debian + gnome is debian packaged with gnome as the desktop gui

it s been so long since i ve tinkered seriously with linux i can t remember the setup well i know that i have the os on a ssd and the data drive on a sata so i imagine from past experiences if i can access the home data drive through something like a bootable distro i can probably get what i need but i would prefer to get mint back up and running

247076
ati	nvidia
the text you quoted says that if you want higher resolution than what the ati es1000 supports then you can install an nvidia nvs300 which is a completely different and separate gpu card

stdout	stderr
2 1 redirecting stderr fd 2 to stdout fd 1 which is file in append mode in this context

247157
debian	linux
does the debian gnu linux distribution have an official real-time version

247158
solaris	sunos
solaris sunos had already other tools to achieve similar purpose as lsblk which is specific to linux

247162
stdout	stderr
i have seen stdout and stderr used in a variety of different ways - as far as i understand it is common to use stdout for general information and stderr for errors and the like

247162
stdout	stderr
however i have also seen stderr used to output information messages related to the program itself but not related to errors warnings debugging etc and for debugging purposes i assume the latter uses the error stream so that it can be filtered out to aid debugging and stdout for the more serious warnings which i would have thought would have belonged in stderr

247162
stdout	stderr
so i was wondering - when is it seen as ideal to use stdout or stderr in relation to what the program is outputting aside from general output and errors

247166
stdout	stderr
the reason for having separated stdout and stderr in the first place is to distinguish between program data output which might be stored in a file fed to a pipeline c. and diagnostics and fluff which are only really of interest to a human operator looking at the terminal

247166
stdout	stderr
there s no automatic way of doing the same for input but you can do it with a bit more trouble by opening and reading the controlling terminal device rather than stdin . thus if you have the choice between writing something on stdout or stderr the best heuristic is probably will this data be of interest to another program using my output

247167
stdout	stderr
one relevant factor is that stderr is unbuffered by default as one would not like to loose an error message to buffering when something fails while stdout is line terminal or block otherwise buffered by default

247170
bash	zsh
in short would it be sufficient to fill the free space on the mount points listed by using bash but likely also works with zsh

247179
post	get
in the below dev-netpro.sh script curl does not post anything if my fwk 8fwk3_dev 2fwk0_dev - could be up to 9 words and con in the example it is series of digits 72 43 172 28021 8261 14015 325 24 524 get more than one word

247191
spaces	delimiter
the spaces or other delimiter after is also required

247195
versioning	upgrade
also my kernel versioning is 4.2.0-18-generic because i upgrade it in order to get the wifi working

247196
cinnamon	gnome
cinnamon is based on gtk+ 3 which is similar to how gnome 3 works

247223
spaces	delimiter
i have a relatively small spaces delimiter file which looks like this but with many columns and rows

247227
postfix	dovecot
i have a server running postfix and dovecot with a local mysql database to store virtual domains and users

247233
bash	zsh
another alternative is command which vim which works the same way in both zsh and bash

247243
spaces	delimiter
i have a question that i would like to make simpler how do i split the second field of a file spaces delimiter by an underscore and add the second part as a new field to the data output as tab

247247
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i had ubuntu and windows installed on this 480gb drive on my laptop and decided i d like to try linux mint

247247
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
one of the options given in the linux mint installation wizard was to delete ubuntu 15.04 and install linux mint in its place

247252
spaces	delimiter
could this be because my second file is tab delimiter and my first file is spaces delimiter

247261
disk	ram
sadly to avoid this most windows software has resorted to shipping all of their libraries in their own program directory instead of a shared directory so each program has all of its own private libraries and will never share with each other which defeates the whole point of dlls in the first place and you end up using a lot more ram and disk space and time downloading all of the duplicate libraries

247267
put	get
you ll get back bits and pieces of a puzzle you ll need to learn how to put together without a filesystem to guide you.

247269
spaces	delimiter
if two consecutive spaces should count as two field delimiter use

247295
folder	directory
i have a shared directory from san whenever i create a folder or file inside that directory it already has permissions

247336
ftp	telnet
i would like to make a shell script that executes commands on a device that i telnet to or in programs such as ftp or openssl

247353
folder	directory	ready	each
assumptions you wish to split a folder containing thousands of files totaling up to more than 700mb into individual directory of 700 mb each - ready for burning onto multiple cds

247353
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
on linux you can use a script like dsplit or dirsplit - part of the genisoimage on debian ubuntu

247355
stdout	stderr
when considering whether to direct something to stderr or stdout what matters is whether that something is relevant to a generic outputconsumer or whether it would only make its life harder

247355
stdout	stderr
beware that lots of error reporting goes to stdout instead of stderr because people forget to redirect it to stderr even though that would have been the better choice

247367
gentoo	linux
i m using gentoo linux if you want to see if the tool is available in repos for me

so i m looking at setting up postfix and dovecot on a server that is currently hosting some web-sites via nginx and i ve stumbled upon the configuration option for nginx but i m having a hard time finding concrete examples that really show how i can use it

247518
postfix	dovecot
basically what i would like to do is have dovecot and postfix listen locally via sockets ports on the current system or another on the same local network if i move them in future with nginx handling all of the actual external connections

247518
postfix	dovecot
i.e- nginx providing external connections for imap and smtp for each domain and routing to postfix and dovecot which are both configured with the appropriate virtual users domains etc

postfix	dovecot
i know dovecot can handle multiple domains with individual certificates so if it s easier to configure it separately then i can do that but i d like to be able to point different domains to postfix as well without having to use a single certificate for all of my e-mail domains

247587
ubuntu	linux
i have done almost everything the kali linux official documents tell me to do except that after i dd the iso to my usb drive i used the parted command to create a new partition named work and created the persistence.conf file in my ubuntu system instead of rebooting into kali linux live from the usb drive to create the partition and so on

247627
bash	zsh
but all modern shells that aren t designed purely for scripting csh ksh bash zsh â read a configuration file when started interactively .cshrc .kshrc .bashrc .zshrc â so the 1970s method is no longer necessary

248111
dpkg	apt
after booting the 64 bits kernel and upgrading the dpkg apt binaries to 64 bits the migration itself from 32 bits commands to 64 has to be done almost in one go in order to have a stable environment either with a script or with the help of statically linked binaries or a mix of both .when i performed the migration besides the instructions i used a mix of busybox mc and debootstrap to allow me to correct mistakes made without losing control of the environment

248125

248249
ubuntu	linux
i have chosen to ask it here because i am assuming hoping that the flexibility of linux will allow me to remove modify the partition while within ubuntu

248253
disk	ram
as dev most likely is actually ram disk udev you exhaust the limit set on that partition .

248312

you can use printf with q in bash ksh and zsh to check

248364
filtering	grouping
i have filtering working for some users and grouping

248368
ubuntu	debian
this is because it is looking for debian packages but ppas hold ubuntu packages

248368
ubuntu	debian
and replace all debian version occurrences with an ubuntu version i suggest trusty as it is currently the most recent lts version of ubuntu

248386
kde	gnome
the version of okular is 0.19.3 on kde development platform 4.13.3 though i m currently using gnome on my ubuntu

248396
linefeed	delimiter
or reduced to a one liner reading stdin or a file linefeed delimiter which is usually good enough

248422
stdout	stderr
other than that lots of programs and scripts in unix create flocks of processes that need to share communication channels such as log files sometimes you need more levels than stdout and stderr or fifos for ipc

248426
centos	linux
on centos 6.5 and probably any linux i can create a group

248584

freebsd	debian
i am seeing much more higher inbound traffic on an interface that is exclusively used for handling nfs between the debian server bce3.101 on the freebsd box

248703
unix	bsd
unix linux and bsd operating system shells just happen to make environment variables look like ordinary non-inherited shell variables

248735
ubuntu	debian
and in ubuntu debian

248765
ubuntu	debian
apt-get debian ubuntu

248773
dnf	yum
i guess it is fedora 21 or older since the newer ones have dnf package manager instead of yum

248781
debian	linux
now that i ve started to understand linux better and debian in particular it seems that i got swap partition right i have around 3gb of ram and it s recommended to set around 1.5 or 2 times that on swap i put a little more but i think that can t hurt but i ve should created a home partition of 300 gb and a partition of 40 gb because all the programs and user data are stored in home this is probably false i m very new in linux i didn t installed almost any program except for a couple of packages

248790
sudo	passwd
this will ask for sudo passwd since iptables is used to route traffic

248790
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo
you can alter the etc sudoers file using visudo to avoid asking for a passwd

248794
vpn	lan
these lines indicate that the traffic with a destination lan 22 33 44 or 22 33 45 pass through the vpn

248821
kde	cinnamon
i am satisfied with cinnamon on another computer and prefer it so i decided to remove kde from the first computer

248825
daemons	launchd
launchd all the usual daemons

248868
ubuntu	linux
i toyed a little with linux netkit s telnet command the one shipped with ubuntu

248868
ftp	telnet
given that ftp stands on top of telnet if i telnet to an ftp server i d expect the same paranoid behaviour

248868
ftp	telnet
why does telnet bother to buffer characters for ftp specifically given the requirement above exists

248868
ftp	telnet
why does telnet buffer ftp control connection lines

248876
ftp	telnet
since ftp is not meant to be manually interacted with using telnet it doesn t support any of the advanced telnet telopt features

248881
children	parent
with respect to its children it doesn t matter whether the parent stays on as a zombie the children become orphans at the time the parent dies and then they lose any connection with their parent

248881
children	parent
specifically would init adopt them as its children only once the zombie was reaped or would they be adopted as soon as the parent became a zombie

248896
rpm	yum
is there an option that yum or rpm has that would allow me to leave specific files from the package in place

248896
rpm	yum
if no option in yum or rpm is there any preferable way of doing it than my suggestion of copying to tmp and moving them back afterward

248923
debian	mint	debian	linux
on debian desktop systems for example linux mint 17.2 the etc updatedb.conf file is configured to exclude certain areas from consideration including tmp var spool and home .ecryptfs

248926
stdout	stderr
it manages the buffering of stdin stdout and stderr

248926
ubuntu	debian
mawk the default awk for - at least - debian ubuntu does output buffering

bash	zsh
in bash ksh zsh is there an good idiom to set a variable to the first of a list of alternative programs that can be found in or otherwise callable by the shell

248983
for-loop	loops
the most straightforward and comprehensible way would just be a for-loop with a single one of your if s inside it which break s out of loops when it finds a match

248994
unix	bsd
mac osx even if belonging to the unix family based on nextstep and containing bsd userland is still a proprietary system and comes with its own set of drivers

248998
bash	zsh
with bash zsh and some implementations of ksh

249002
rmdir	mkdir
rm was made to remove the references to files rmdir was made to remove directories parallel to mkdir

249003
rmdir	mkdir
the consistency was maintained by user-space programs like mkdir 1 and rmdir 1 which were set-uid root so that they could make the privileged system calls on behalf of an unprivileged user

249003
rmdir	mkdir
sometime later mkdir 2 and rmdir 2 were added as their own system calls but the relation between rm 1 and rmdir 1 remains

249008
daemons	systemd
if the process is a direct child of a ssh daemons run a same shell via the caffeinate 8 command to prevent the systemd from sleeping during the ssh session

249021
gentoo	linux
i m on the hardened linux amd64 selinux profile on a recent stage 3 of gentoo amd64

249035
for-loop	loops
it works by nesting the while loops within the for-loop

249035
for-loop	loops
for each iteration of the for-loop the while loops iterates over every component in testing the shortest colon-separated string it can slice with and saving the longest string for the next iteration

249035
bash	zsh
aliases get the definition written into - which in zsh bash and yash looks like.

249091

that way the shell will wait for cat and that cat will only exit when all the processes that have that file descriptor 3 open on the writing end of the pipe it reads which includes tr find tee xargs have exited

249106
ubuntu	mint
i installed zorin 10 after trying mint and ubuntu

249120
disk	ram
how do you make sure the path where you persist the state because you have to store it somewhere persistent doesn t get wiped out at boot because it s a ram disk

249127
unix	bsd
of the different distributions of unix linux available for my mac hardware does bsd have an advantage because it s what is run under the gui for macos or does the mach kernel abstraction keep any optimisation of hardware getting to the bsd layer

249134
ethernet	wireless
i have raspberry pi raspbian wireless tor access point connected via ethernet cable to my local router

249135
freebsd	debian
i fixed it by just increasing the vm ram in virtualbox from 128mb to 384mb by default virtaulbox gave it 128 mb as soon as i selected freebsd but it recommends 768 mb for a similar net install version of debian

249135
freebsd	debian
i dont think debian non-gui needs 7 times more ram then freebsd non-gui

249185
cifs	smb
difference between nas ans smb cifs the difference is like difference between bottle and wine

249185
afp	smb	cifs	smb	cifs	afp
very roughly services can be smb cifs windows share nfs linux share or afp apple share

249185
lvm	mdadm
necessity of loop device you can create any software raid mdadm with any devices storage device at least including hard disk logical partition from lvm usb stick network disk

249185
cifs	smb	iscsi	cifs	iscsi	smb
to my experience iscsi is more efficient than nfs and much more than smb cifs the main issue is not how to share storage capacity but how to manage hardware failure computer reboot hard-disk failure network failure

249269
ssd	sata
either fix the bios config or swap the sata connections so that the ssd is now connected to the first sata port

249280

often this situation happens in servers that have been upgrade to new versioning several times as the kernel and associated files used to be smaller

249631
ganglia	metrics
recently i ve been working with a cluster monitoring tool ganglia which aggregates system metrics from on each machine

249637
ubuntu	linux
otherwise you can install something like ubuntu or tails borum onto a usb so you can boot up a live session on the laptop to give you something you can work from to do the installation if you don t have another computer running linux or if you just don t want to mess with removing the drive

that parameter expansion is available in ksh bash zsh at least

249943
fat	xfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	xfs
the filesystems we put on storage media ext4 xfs fat do the structuring part

249943

i can write a nodejs module that will help do the logging but am thinking maybe its useful to just grab whatever is in stdout stderr in cases where the server cannot even start

250509
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
in any case linux or even gnu linux are not operating systems but still core components on top of which some actual operating systems are built like slackware ubuntu red hat debian and the likes but not bsds solaris and others which are built on different kernels and posix layer implementations

250512

the bandwidth can get slightly smaller however ipsec works with udp and you won t be so much dependent on the mechanisms of tcp

rpm	yum	debian	centos
apt advanced packaging tool is the default packager used with debian based distribution whereas centos is rpm redhat package manager based distribution and yellowdog updater modified yum is the default package manager used in centos

250677
ubuntu	centos
you cannot use apt-get with centos this command is being used in ubuntu

250677
rpm	yum
so you can use yum or rpm command in centos to install rpm binaries

250681
bash	zsh
in bash you can use exec -a and in zsh you can alternatively also set argv0 to execute a program with a certain zeroth argument but is there also a posix way of doing so

250683
automake	autotools
i m using autotools automake for building - my debian rules looks like this

250730
stdio	fputs
a typical such api is stdio in c all the fopen printf fputs ...

250730
stdio	fflush
for instance if a file was opened with fopen 3 which returns a datatype not a file descriptor but will have created a fd underneath you ll want to close if with fclose thatfile which will fflush all the buffers not close fileno thatfile which would close the fd under stdio s feet

250731

this is the tool to use if you don t want to use bash at all but something else like zsh or tcsh

250738
folder	directory
is there a way you can setup a list of receipts of folder and directory of their correct default permissions that can be used as a backup to compare the correct permissions and be used to fix incorrect permissions caused by system or user changes and installed software

250738
folder	directory	chown	chmod
and so on and so forthâ and use the backup list in a script to run a check with the list and the directory and folder and correct them all with chown chmod and setfacl

ubuntu	debian
these reasons motivated ubuntu s and debian s big project over a number of years to remove bashisms and to make as many of the shell scripts run by system initialization which was a lot of shell scripts with system 5 rc and package installation removal use the debian almquist shell instead of the bourne again shell

251003
bash	zsh
these shells are typically ash derivatives like busybox dash bsd sh - zsh bash ksh and the bourne shell however all use temp files

unfortunately manufacturer provides packages rpm and deb for user-space drivers which are not exactly properly formatted missing dependencies other control information etc. to make it worse it supposed to be ran on specific linux distribution version ubuntu 12.04 ubuntu 14.04 but it s bundled with outdated libraries

ubuntu and mint happen use the same software to manage packages but each installation has its own database.

firefox counts as pretty complex. you can however use schroot to set up an environment to run ubuntu programs on mint with access to their libraries and to your home directory but not to mint programs

looking at it from the bash ksh zsh perspective

251126
tunnel	vpn
how would you be using the vpn tunnel varies based on the service being provided

251126
tunnel	vpn
you mention ssh tunnel but that would require the vpn end-point being such that also provides ssh access and doing ssh over a vpn tunnel would just be putting two layers of encryption over each other inefficient

251126
tunnel	vpn
if the vpn tunnel is configured so that it acts as your default route thus all traffic on that network interface would be passed through the tunnel then you would be accessing the target site directly by typing its address in the browser s address bar

251126
tunnel	vpn
if however the vpn tunnel just tunnel a specific subnet subset of the ip address space then it would not be good for your purposes unless you can manage adding a proxy at the end-point and again we d making the original simple idea just more complicated or some sort of address translation or routing to the target

251147

it is not a suitable owner -- nginx or apache -- knowing that http and www-data do not exist

also my mysql server versioning is 5.5.46 and i would rather not upgrade it as we are developing with that versioning

251265

note that the same package works on all supported debian and ubuntu platforms

251266
ubuntu	debian
mixing a debian release and an ubuntu release is similar to mixing different ubuntu releases

251266
ubuntu	debian
it s usually safe to install a more recent kernel but you ll also need to install corresponding x video drivers at least if you use proprietary drivers and you need to have the configuration and sometimes patches that the distribution expects and debian and ubuntu don t configure their kernel in exactly the same way

251266
ubuntu	debian
as a user and as an administrator there s not all that much difference between ubuntu and debian

251266
ubuntu	debian
whatever reason you have to prefer debian if the latest ubuntu has drivers for your hardware and debian lags behind not an uncommon situation if you stick to debian stable switching to ubuntu might be best

251266
ubuntu	debian
if you absolutely want to have some packages from ubuntu and some packages from debian â â or if you want to have packages from different releases of debian ubuntu that s especially useful for developers who want to test their builds on different generation of software it s fairly painless to install additional debian ubuntu releases in a chroot so you run one release for your system but can run applications from another release

versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
it aims to provide reliable and reproducible package management featuring atomic upgrade and rollbacks side-by-side installation of multiple versioning of a package multi-user package management and easy setup of build environments

251418
bash	zsh
it happens in dash ksh but not in bash or zsh

251418
bash	zsh
tz value affects the running shell in all shells except bash and zsh

251419
bash	zsh
instead this will retain assigned values except bash and zsh

251461
folder	directory
so you exclude the folder 1st then include the files you want then include directory that weren t previously excluded then exclude everything else

251504
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
apt-get is a command line interface for apt which is used by debian ubuntu mint elementary and others

251521
put	get
the only way to substitute a newline is to use the n escape - but the only way to get a newline in pattern space that might be found in a regular expression is to put one there yourself - and so that is usually not a problem

251521
spaces	delimiter
it then e x changes its hold and pattern spaces and escapes the left-hand-side before g etting the rhs appended to the lhs as separated by a n ewline delimiter

251534
dnf	yum
dnf equivalent of yum update --security

251549
ubuntu	debian
in the installation process ubuntu detected debian succesfully but did not mention to have found windows

251549
ubuntu	debian
i know how to do these things using basic gparted or other disks a ubuntu and debian native application to reduce create partitions and basic things about formats like ext4 vs fat32

251552
spaces	delimiter
the second line is entirely empty because sed substituted away the second sequence of the complement of the spaces character which matched all characters in pattern spaces except input newlines at that time and so the second sequence was the entire second line less its trailing newline delimiter

251562
folder	directory
also a sftp user should never be given access to a root level system directory like etc best to make a folder under something like usr local alcatraz and give them access to that

251582
tunnel	vpn
you can find the vpn tunnel pseudo-device with ifconfig

versioning	upgrade
so when a new stable versioning of ovs releases related packages will be updated in openstack repository so by entering apt-get upgrade or apt-get update you can upgrade open vswitch s packages

251616
wan	lan
input_rule deal with input from both lan and wan traffic

251619
debian	linux
however the debian standard iso my be useful for building a linux from scratch

251635
dnf	yum
if you are running fedora 23 you dnf rather then yum

251650
width	height
you could use the fx operator to filter images based on height width

251693
spaces	linefeed
the default s characters are now ht 9 linefeed 10 vt 11 ff 12 cr 13 and spaces 32

so far i have tried kde plasma 5 gnome and xfce in a combination with the docks plank docky and dockx but none of these is able to recapitulate the desired behavior

i am installing new linux distro gentoo and i want to copy the linux kernel config i have here in the linux mint live usb to the gentoo system

251746
gentoo	mint
the way mint has the kernel config file is boot config-3.19.0-32-generic but in gentoo it has to be proc config.gz specific file path in this situation is mnt gentoo proc config.gz

251751
ubuntu	linux
observed this behaviour both on ubuntu linux and mac os x

251783
post	get
i was able to use either with the generic post method only page to get wget to input the value that i wanted to access that i could not through get method that the site search blocks

versioning	upgrade
if sometime later you want to update simplescreenrecorder to a newer versioning along with its dependencies if required then upgrade it explicitly

251831

i have checked zsh and bash this behavior exists in zsh bash behaves similarly with different formatting

251875
button	checkbox	kde	gnome
for those who miss icons in gtk2 or gtk3 applications but not on gnome kde + pidgin one of the easy options is to use lxappearance on the other tab it has show images on button and show images in menus checkbox toggling which you can toggle these settings on the fly

251879
filesystems	xfs
the overhead of the xfs filesystems is around 0 5

251880
filesystems	xfs
many filesystems including xfs use inodes

251886
kde	cinnamon
each distro has a standard interface such as kde or cinnamon for example

i don t anticipate installing many non-free packages so instead of modifying etc apt sources.list and downloading from the non-free repository i decided to install this manually using dpkg with the packaged obtained from here

252013
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m planning on dual booting another linux distribution as i still need to use certain windows specific apps and i m currently considering linux mint as the desktop environment looks sleek and also due to the fact from what i understand that it has lower hardware requirements than ubuntu off of which it is built

252095
ubuntu	linux
on a computer with linux ubuntu 14.04 installed as os

252095
ubuntu	linux
in case both computers have linux ubuntu 14.04 installed this is as easy setting up a ssh public-private key pair connection and running the command

252096
udp	tcp
one more thing to take into consideration is that over wan you ll have to open tcp ports 139 and 445 and udp ports 137-138 in order to allow samba access

252117
debian	linux
i have pulled out the internal hard drive from the broken laptop and i want to install debian gnu linux and the ssh server onto this hdd using a working debian laptop

i also passthrough my keyboard and mouse and have a secondary keyboard in a different usb port which is used by the host

252147

distros like debian typically build modules for every piece of hardware that might be encountered so if you just install linux on the hdd and plug it into the laptop it will probably work

mouse	keyboard
i am getting problems when my ubuntu machine it hangs keyboard mouse stopped responding and screen looking blur

width	height
but every time i use my 11 laptop i find myself wishing those 23 pixels were taken out of the width rather than the height of my screen

252314
rpm	yum
usually when applying package updates via yum update rpm is intelligent enough to respect my changes to configuration files under etc

252329
gentoo	debian
i skipped the bootloader section of gentoo s handbook as i wanted to use my current grub2 install on dev sda1 so after finishing the installation i booted to debian and ran update-grub which successfully added gentoo to the menu

252329
gentoo	debian
fstab for debian and fstab for gentoo

252329
gentoo	debian
i tried editing gentoo s fstab to use uuids like debian to no avail

252337
vpn	lan
all routes are working and i am able to ping from lan to vpn or from vpn to lan both works fine

252337
vpn	lan
if i try to access the https server from 10.44.3.2 vpn to 10.44.2.11 lan the connection state of the server is syn_recv and the client shows syn_sent

252348
octal	hex
convert hex to octal 0373025

252350
folder	directory
the folder .ssh should be stored in a user directory as far as i understood

252365
bash	zsh
users who wish to remain incognito could bypass the logging by asking sshd to open a different shell zsh or run bash --rcfile ___ to prevent etc bash.bashrc from being loaded

252374
mutt	msmtp
msmtp cannot read output of gpg -d --no-tty home toogley .dotfiles mutt accounts devmailpw.asc

252374
mutt	msmtp
set sendmail msmtp --file home toogley .dotfiles mutt accounts dev.smtp

252380
int	double
the second reason behind this is probably the c code related to variables on zsh is using int or double int to define array indexes and since it uses two s complement to represent negative numbers there is no way to represent -0 signed zero like you can do on float point variables

252389
debian	linux
but i am using linux since 1995 and debian since end of previous century on my home pcs so i am at ease with the command line

252389
postfix	dovecot
i am using postfix dovecot on a vps ubuntu 15.04 64 bits at ovh in france for a small user base a big dozen of users mostly my family less than a thousand email day including spam for two dns domains let s call them starynk.net melt.org the actual ones are slightly different but you could guess them easily

252389
debian	linux
because i can send receive mails on my home debian linux pc which is not the vps server at ovh to my address basile starynk.net

252392
cpu	processors
i do know that sse2 is a function of newer processors which include the intel i7 cpu which is probably why the controlctr.bin file looks for those libraries

252398
ubuntu	debian
the perl rename script comes standard in debian ubuntu or available here will rename files based on a regular expression

252400
apache	nginx
why is the apache user there when i have installed nginx

252405
fish	tcsh
virtually all shell arrays bourne csh tcsh fish rc es yash start at 1

252415
single-quotes	double-quotes
so we have to keep the double-quotes from the shell and for that we using single-quotes

252424
rpm	yum
the motivation for the conditionals is probably the idea to have one yum spec file for multiple rpm based distributions different versions of fedora rhel ...

252428
gentoo	linux
i am installing kde on a gentoo linux hardened system

252428
gentoo	linux
is there any other way to have multiple active portage profiles at once on gentoo linux

252450
debian	linux
i just installed debian with encrypted i made a boot partition and converted an ntfs partition to efi it installed but now i can t boot on linux

252463
chown	chmod
if you do this just create a user put him in a group which is the only one with permission to run the command you are talking about chmod 010 or something and then chown your fresh-compiled wrapper binary to be owned by that user and set its suid bit with chmod 4511

252472
bash	zsh
if i recall it consists more or less to call sh s in bash s in zsh s so only the shells exclusive features are set in their respective configuration files

252472
vim	emacs
alsoâ long-time terminal user for vim and emacs i have enough to waste time

252472
bash	zsh
i always used sh bash and zsh â mostly the latter two â and am open to any suggestion â the better shell habits configurations et cã tera

252513
ubuntu	linux
i am testing a new network card on ubuntu linux desktop v14.04.3 lts 64 bits

252520
versioning	upgrade
since i think i upgrade plasma to versioning 5 kde applications seem to open my files encoded in utf-8 as in iso-8859-1

252525
mouse	keyboard
the usb mouse and keyboard do not work by the time its ready to log in

252525
mouse	keyboard
they always work in safe mode and the keyboard and mouse always works on the duel boot windows side

252525
mouse	keyboard
also i did tail -f var log syslog and unplugged and plugged in the mouse and keyboard

252544
dnf	yum
dnf dandified yum is the next upcoming major version of yum a package manager for rpm-based linux distributions

252548
cinnamon	gnome
i m using cinnamon now but even with gnome 3 the error happens

252561
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu 15.10 and i m very new in linux

252613
bash	zsh
in a shell that supports process substitution ksh93 bash zsh

252619

252637
unix	bsd
freebsd is a free unix-like operating system descended from research unix via the berkeley software distribution bsd

252637
unix	bsd
although for legal reasons freebsd cannot use the unix trademark it is a direct descendant of bsd which was historically also called bsd unix or berkeley unix

252642
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
if i understand correctly you mean the names and the paths of different programs should be the same across different distributions such as ubuntu debian and redhat centos

252658
hid	keyboard
you may want to change the keyboard mappings so they don t both have the same key press or you can actually change the input type to an hid class input that your system supports

252690
debian	linux
i use kali-linux sana 2.0 with kernel 4.0.0-kali1-amd64 but this should apply to all debian based linux distributions

252753
rpm	dnf
on non-config-breaking updates dnf rpm will just put the new configuration file next to the current one and append .rpmnew

252753
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu the default behaviour is to ask during the upgrade

252765

debian â ubuntu

252767

fedora â redhat enterprise linux â centos

252767
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu also takes some packages directly from debian unstable but that is a detail

252767
debian	centos
although debian stable and centos contain old packages compared to debian testing and fedora the security updates are backported which means that old versions are fixed as well

252767
debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
this is debian unstable fedora rawhide arch linux opensuse tumbleweed

252767
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu seems to be a nice linux distribution for desktop users with multimedia applications

252770
profiler	visualvm
full jdk no matter if oracle-java8-jdk package or jdk straight from oracle contains visualvm profiler

252776
ubuntu	debian
on a debian ubuntu system you can install like so

252778
bash	zsh
in ksh bash and zsh you can unexport a variable with typeset +x foo

252783
unix	solaris	unix	sunos	unix	aix	sunos	aix	solaris	sunos	solaris	aix
however by that time most unix systems were actually modified versions of the at t code maintained by other companies such as sun sunos later renamed solaris hewlett-packard hp-ux ibm aix etc

252783

252787
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
on debian and derivatives ubuntu mint elementary â modules listed in etc modules one per line and you can specify arguments are loaded at boot time

252787
put	get
put the .ko file that you compiled somewhere under lib modules version you need to do that anyway to get modprobe to find it and run depmod -a as root

252788
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i m trying to setup a debian print server for both my windows and linux ubuntu workstations

252788
ubuntu	linux
linux workstation can add a printer locally using ubuntu add printer wizard to look for printers that are shared via cups just have to type the print server fqdn ip

252788
ubuntu	linux
linux workstations ubuntu 14.04

252789
mouse	keyboard
i need to touch my mouse or keyboard to wake it back up

252798
unix	solaris
there are unix systems solaris for one that manage to keep the logging subsystem running even after a kernel panic but linux doesn t go that far

252799
sudoers	visudo
since visudo will parse the #includedir in etc sudoers all the relevant files in sudoers.d would be checked as well

252808
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 8.2.0 jessie - official amd64 xfce-cd binary-1 20150906-11 10

252830
post	get
get started and if you get hopelessly stuck post new questions here with specifics of where you re stuck

252830
solaris	sunos
also unless you have a reason to keep it on sunos 4.x you ll probably have a lot better luck if you can get it updated to sunos 5.6 solaris 2.6

252835
mpfr	mpc
my new problem is an apparent lack of gmp mpfr and mpc

252851
centos	linux
i got a linux centos 6 x64 vps and i installed a website on it

252870
solaris	aix
system v which is hp-ux and solaris and things like aix too but that s just a bit of a strange one

252870
freebsd	solaris
so for example you can get solaris for x64 which is a system v freebsd

252876
stdout	stderr
note if your command is outputting to stderr you would need to redirect it to stdout before the pipe

252878
mouse	keyboard
an x server is serving a display keyboard and mouse to x clients which are programs running on the same machine as the x server or on some other machine in the network

252901
stdout	stderr
so i can run a process in unix linux using posix but is there some way i can store redirect both the stdout and stderr of the process to a file

252914
versioning	upgrade
about two months ago i build a kernel 4.2.6-arch from source according to this page this is my current kernel versioning the problem comes when i try to upgrade from the repositories actually i did a system upgrade sudo pacman -syyu then query the package database pacman -q | grep linux and it shows linux 4.3.3-2 then after a reboot i run uname -r but it keeps showing 4.2.6-arch

252915
stdout	stderr
as you can see both stdout and stderr of the spawned process went to tmp foo-log

252917
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
you ll probably see 2 locations one in sites-available and one in sites-enabled directory not this is the default on debian ubuntu destributions these may vary on centos for example

252917
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
the sites-enabled has symlinks to the sites-available but only of vhost s that are enabled by executing a2ensite name on debian ubuntu or sybolic link on centos sudo ln -s etc httpd sites-available example.com.conf etc httpd sites-enabled example.com.conf

252917
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
if you do not have this default vhost-file or locations sites-available and sites-enabled on your system probably on centos and distributions other then debian ubuntu you can edit your httpd-config file default location etc httpd conf httpd.conf and add includeoptional sites-enabled .conf at the end of the file

252936
ubuntu	linux
hard disk 1 ubuntu linux with grub2 on mbr

252948

google-chrome and firefox have shipped tls 1.3 behind feature flags

252971
postfix	dovecot
i am running a debian jessie 8.1 server with a functioning postfix dovecot and suirrelmail rainloop

252992
gentoo	linux
i m using gentoo linux kernel 4.0.5

253018
ubuntu	debian
if there are no solution i ll stick with this i already run debian and ubuntu on my desktop pc so it s not a big deal mostly a challenging problem that i m trying to solve in those winter holidays

253027
keydown	keyup
previously when i d not split up the keydown and keyup parts the forward and back dysfunctionality had been suspended but no alt or control happened

253027
keydown	keyup
the keydown and keyup setup was extremely problematic because once i pressed the back button the alt key was for most intents and purposes stuck down as far as key combinations were concerned and i could not type anything although when i held the back button alt + click behavior returned to just click behavior and either way i had to hold alt on the keyboard to switch to another terminal and kill xbindkeys

253030
ethernet	wireless
my rpi is connected to lan using ethernet i don t need wireless support

253032
postfix	dovecot
lastly i installed postfix and dovecot again and ran the regular configuration and now it works

253038
int	chars
you can see that in the second file the lines which start with a b chars don t contain any more information while in the first file i have lines only starting with a b followed by some int values

253038
puts	gets
what i need now is something which gets the integers from the first file and puts them into the second files b lines the same way the appear in the first file

253049
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	filesystems	btrfs
create a recovery disk then use a live linux distro ubuntu live for example to delete the recovery partition and the tools if you want you ll likely never use them and then repartition with and extended partition taking up the remaining space with at least one logical partition formatted for your filesystems of choice ext3 ext4 btrfs and install debian to that

253049
debian	linux
the logical partition you use for debian should not take up the entire extended partition you probably want several logical partitions one of which you may want to use to share the data on it between windows and linux

253087
ubuntu	debian
it could also be that a certain debian package s on ubuntu kali supported the button

253101
stdout	stderr
i need that output redirected to a file and it does not seem to be comming from stdout or stderr because i have tried adding and and every time they are blank

253113
lvm	umount
first you ll need to umount any stale fs on the lvm

253118
daemons	systemd
2 look for warnings and or errors from ntpd daemons on systemd log

253169
postgresql	mysql
from that point onward if the other still-existing client process tries to use the database handle sending queries will fail with mysql server has gone away or with postgresql server closed the connection unexpectedly

253182
debian	linux
i am trying to get ipsec strong swan to work under raspbian linux distro of debian ihave been able to install all packages for ipsec

253204
ubuntu	debian
the ubuntu drivers of the correct architecture work on debian enabling brightness control

253209
daemons	systemd
the atd daemons is running and comparing its pid to other systemd daemons it looks like it hasn t crashed and respawned

253217
freebsd	linux
tested on freebsd macos x linux

253234
debian	linux
kali linux is debian

253322
ubuntu	mint	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	mint
i m not sure if it will work on debian-based distros ubuntu mint but there s a python script for input-wacom-dkms here

253341
centos	linux
i repeated the same test on my centos linux machine and it didnt let me set null password for root user

253343
udp	tcp
try tracepath and traceroute using tcp udp

253353
ubuntu	mint
i saw that in ubuntu this is somehow managed but cannot find any settings in mint

253370
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
to fix this my best solution was to chmod chown and chgrp the apps each app folder no de opt folder to my user and give permissions to users to write inside the apps folders

253389
folder	dir
in my web dir is around 100 folder

253389
folder	directory
within the folder of amazon and ebay we have a directory structure like

253389
folder	dir	folder	directory
what i am trying to do is scan the whole web dir and locate in folder that have more than 50 files in the in directory

253393
filesystems	xfs
other filesystems xfs have less filesystems overhead

253402
switching	screens
at the end make sure switching consoles with ctrl+alt+f1 or some other f# does not let you circumvent the lock screens

253441
debian	linux
linux debian 3.16.0-4-686-pae #1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u1

253478
centos	linux
to check linux version i browsed to the etc directory and checked redhat-release file and it says centos release 6.4 final

253497
mouse	keyboard
in that applet under typing weirdly not keyboard and mouse there s a section called ctrl key position with choices including

253497
mouse	keyboard
for version 3.26.4 of that applet the above option is under keyboard and mouse then look for additional layout options

253506
gentoo	debian
while i cannot advise you on gentoo specifics i hope that the debian system i use may be similar enough to help you find the right answer

253516
titlebar	window
when a window is opended with root priveleges i want to display some text in the titlebar to inform the user that he she is root in that particular instance

253522
dnf	yum
features in yum and its successor dnf include

253522
rpm	yum
on the other hand if you wanted to find the pathnames of programs executable files in a given package you could use the --dump option of rpm not provided or analogous to anything in yum although some use can be made of repoquery

253530
ubuntu	debian
lubuntu is an official ubuntu version but has the lightest footprint of all of the ubuntu versions has great support and it uses the debian .deb packaging system

253534
next	except
except that the above prints the time when the prompt was printed on the screen not the time that the next command is executed

253534
bash	tcsh
my question is essentially identical to this question except that i use tcsh and not bash and the other question s accepted answer setting precmd does not appear to work for me

253551
lan	localhost
localhost works and also accept connections on the same lan

253565
debian	linux
i would like to type easily these characters in some in firefox 38 or 42 on debian linux x86_64 under xfce4 or gnome and i want to avoid javascript tricks for that

253573
folder	directory
now i realized i should choose the parent java folder that has bin and lib as child directory

253603
apache	nginx
this allows you to have nginx apache and ssh listening on the same port usually 443

253606
bash	subshell
i m trying to use the bash substring built-in to replace the output of a subshell or another bash function

253606
folder	directory
the output should be the last folder of the replaced by latest when my current directory is trunk

253620
ethernet	wireless
ok then probably you should disable network manager and add manual entries in etc network interfaces skip wireless related things in this guide just focus on adding ethernet interfaces but it also says how to add extra wireless interface if you need

253636
centos	linux
i am using centos linux release 7.1.1503 core

253645
debian	linux
basically i didn t encrypt my linux debian partition when installing it

253661
folder	directory
is it possible to change the permissions of a particular directory containing some files from 640 with which it gets generated in that folder and change it to 644 once the files are generated for some specific users to access those files

253674
ethernet	wireless
here is the service file that i currently have located in lib systemd system and it works fine if i have an ethernet connection but does not work if i only have a wireless connection

253674
ethernet	wireless
this is running on an embedded device and sometimes the user will have an ethernet connection sometimes only a wireless connection sometimes both - so this needs to work with all these combinations of network connectivity

253687
wan	lan
dd-wrt s interface shows options to change the wan and wlan mac but not the lan mac

253688
spaces	delimiter
the quotes are there to gracefully handle spaces so they don t look like delimiter

253698
folder	dir	folder	directory
you want to maintain the permissions that directory currently has but you also want to give a specific group or user access to that dir and its descendants who can not access that folder or its contents

253720
debian	linux
i don t know the legacy unix flavors but under redhat and debian compatible linux distros there exist a binary called xclip which does exactly what you want

253728
debian	linux
in debian jessie i ve installed the linux source with

253733
folder	directory
i would like to flatten the the folder structure such that all the files reside in the parent directory with unique names such as folder1_0001.jpg folder1_0002.jpg etc

253741
centos	linux
in modern linux distributions including centos the xrandr library is responsible for things such as screen resolution rotation and so on

253763
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
in this screenshot if i had my way there would be no virtualization submenu rather arch linux centos 7-1511 debian 8.2 etc

253769
powerline	oh-my-zsh
so i was playing with oh-my-zsh themes and found out that some of them have the powerline symbols

253776
chown	chmod
than home test must have - chmod 700 and chown testuser test

253776
chown	chmod
and home test app must have - chmod 750 and chown testuser app -r

253784
centos	linux
some linux distributions will still ask you for password if the gui is not running as root i am using centos 6 and there is even no gui shutdown reboot option for my user there is only log out and lock option

253799
spaces	delimiter
but when it fails sed appends the n ext line to pattern spaces s ubstitutes away the intervening newline delimiter and then the second t est passes and sed branches back to the d elim label to look for a third pipe again

253813
debian	centos
switched from centos 7 to debian 8.2 jessie

253813
debian	linux
with the following kernel latest available linux debian-term1 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u1 2015-12-14 x86_64 gnu linux

253828
daemons	systemd
tuned is a dynamic adaptive systemd tuning daemons that tunes systemd settings dynamically depending on usage

253850
ubuntu	centos
is it possible to use a shared library compiled for example on a redhat centos system on a ubuntu system

253856
ubuntu	centos
meaning that if the redhat centos library was compiled for x86-64 the ubuntu machine s architecture must be x86-64 or compatible as well

253856
ubuntu	centos
meaning that if the redhat centos library depends on other libraries the ubuntu machine s linker must be able to find the same libraries or compatible ones somewhere in the system

253865
daemons	systemd
file may crash the cron daemons or could at least theoretically misuse it to gain more privileges on the systemd

253892
debian	linux
i have two debian linux servers

253903
daemons	systemd
on my systemd the limit is set to 30306 and for the docker daemons and inside docker containers the limit is 1048576

253918
postfix	dovecot
my mail server run postfix and dovecot

253931
put	get
wherever i put the above statement in the network-script i get rtnetlink answers file exists on bootup

253932
filesystems	hfs+
edit3 showing that it s not an hfs+ filesystems issue but rather a filename issue

253938
folder	directory
i would like to flatten the the folder structure such that all the files reside in the parent directory with unique names such as folder1_0001.jpg folder1_0002.jpg.

253939
gnupg	gpgme
applications using gpgme should automatically pick up gnupg 2.1 when available instead of gnupg 2.0 and you can t have both through debian s package manager anyway

253942
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
of the distributions of linux i have used red hat ubuntu centos others which utilize gnome-termial you are able to set different terminal profiles via a drop down menu located in the terminal window directly above where commands are entered

253960
debian	linux
the linux debian kernel is 3.2.0-4-686-pae

254005
post	get
see what you still need to add to your kernel config y to get it running or post the output and maybe we can give you some hints

254005
gentoo	debian
if it still doesn t work my guess is the drive is grabbing dev sda in debian but something else dev sdb maybe in gentoo

254020
ubuntu	opensuse
there are software repositories for ubuntu opensuse and fedora as well as packages for os x and windows

254036
centos	linux
the machine is running centos linux release 7.2.1511 and is up to date

254067
linefeed	delimiter
your problem is that you had lines delimiter with crlf instead of just linefeed which meant that those variable content ended in cr character

254072
sudo	passwd
i need a gui passwd prompt for user for executing command with sudo in script

254072
sudo	passwd
so it is needed to ask for passwd in order to run command with sudo otherwise it fails to do a job

254079
dnf	yum
on my fedora 23 the result of dnf search yum is almost neatly ordered by length of package name + description

254092
debian	linux
i use citrix receiver on my home gnu linux debian testing desktop to remote in to my work windows machine

254093
icmp	tcp
service filtering again ask your netadmin to check if he she allowed the services you need icmp for ping tcp 80 for http tcp 443 for https etc.

254107
spaces	delimiter
then split the result 20 dbm 100.00mw on delimiter spaces and take the second field again

254115
chown	sudo
sudo chown root root googlesyncplugin.plgx

254115
chown	sudo
sudo chown root root log4net.dll

254119
nautilus	fstab
so is there any option of mount command for fstab file that will mount this only on first access by shortcut in nautilus

254123
bash	zsh
if it is not small enough to fit into memory then on a system which understands the links which is practically any unix-like system and given a shell which uses tmp files for here-documents and not pipes which is most of them to include the bourne shell bash and zsh but not yash or ash variants such as bsd sh dash or busybox sh which use pipes instead and enough free space to hold the buffer while it is being edited then the following should work

254154
folder	directory
how can i change folder and file permissions for all files and folder recursively inside current directory

254182
debian	linux
i am trying to cross compile my c code from debian linux to a windows platform

254184
ubuntu	linux
i can setup an ip connection easily between two linux ubuntu boxes running this pppd command on one side

254192
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
trying to install a linux distro centos ubuntu on asus zenbook pro ux501vw-ds71t fails so far

254195
bash	zsh
one simple solution for ksh bash zsh is to remove all control characters from the read variable

254239
filesystems	btrfs
i m struggling with a btrfs raid0 filesystems

254256
inherited	properties
i ve tried a few dark grey themes and zeal seems to inherited theme properties badly no matter what so i thought to override its styling to default mint theme

254286
ssd	sata
i have a computer with 2x 500 gb sata hdd drives and to speed it up i put in a small 30gb ssd drive for the system

254286
lvm	xfs
once system was up i quite easily exchanged the home directory for a xfs logical volume i use lvm primarily to add space easily

254286
lvm	btrfs
but the question is does it make sense to format a lvm volume with btrfs

254286
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
to me lvm is indeed better for managing space with whatever filesystems on top of it but btrfs should be used for features specific to it - mainly snapshots

254295
mouse	keyboard
i ve recently installed lxle with lxde desktop environment and i keep having problems where my mouse clicks are being triggered while typing on the keyboard

254297
folder	directory
but going into the directory i can see more files and folder than above

254318
lvm	btrfs
a subvolume in btrfs is not the same as an lvm logical volume or a zfs subvolume

254318
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
with lvm a logical volume is a block device in its own right which could for example contain any other filesystems or container like dm-crypt md raid etc. - this is not the case with btrfs

254318
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs has subvolumes does this mean i don t need a logical volume manager and i can create a big btrfs filesystems on a raw partition

254318
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs does write optimisation sequential writes across a filesystems

254318
filesystems	btrfs
creating multiple btrfs filesystems each on a different lv means that the algorithm can be ineffective although the kernel will still perform some optimization at the block device level

254319
wan	lan
you would plug the internet connection into the wan port on the router and all of the raspberry pi devices would connect to the lan port on the router

254319
wan	lan
the first is to put the raspberry pi cluster into a dmz that is separate from both the lan and the wan

254337
hfs	umount
all such temporary files may be removed when repairing an umount hfs plus volume

254366
bash	zsh
examples of this are bash zsh

254377
debian	linux
i m using debian linux stretch 64bit kernel version 4.2.6 with lxde

254388
bash	zsh
with bash and zsh you can use brace expansion

254406
disk	ram
so for years my linux laptop has allowed me to both suspend to disk and with a little effort suspend to ram with one of these two commands

254410
stdout	stderr
is one of dev stdin dev stdout or dev stderr file descriptor 0

254415
mouse	keyboard
but as my keyboard is not usb and it only blocks mouse

254415
mouse	keyboard
so i think my only hope is to remove the kernel modules for keyboard and mouse

254444
ubuntu	linux
my installed linux distribution ubuntu 12.04 elementary luna kernel 3.7.5 won t boot

254490
ubuntu	debian
it s not ubuntu- specific because for all intents and purposes ubuntu is debian and so is systemd and au aren t being very helpful

254505
cpu	processors
i have a quadcore intel processors each core has two virtual cores for a total of 8 cpu cores

254505
ubuntu	debian
incidentally this is ubuntu 15.10 functionally debian and all my packages are up to date

254515
rmdir	mkdir
remove the spurious directories rmdir media sda6 boot media sda6 var and create one that s now needed mkdir media sda8 boot

254516
stdout	stderr
upon starting the command i didn t see a file called log in the current directory but saw a file called .__afs063d which is logging the outputs on stdout and stderr

254526
sudo	passwd
usually sudo requires the user to enter their own passwd

254534
bash	zsh
thus this qualifies as brace expansion to become ls -l either as first word or argument in bash zsh is different

254572
installation	downgrade
i am currently using centos 7.2.1511 check from file etc redhat-release and trying to downgrade it to centos 7.1.1503 due to some package installation issue in centos 7.2 using the command

254593
filesystems	fat
a squashfs is usually a single file in another filesystems such as a fat fs

254593
disk	ram
this technique is called copy-on-write and creates a new file in the ram disk for every modified file in the squashfs

254593
disk	ram
alternative to saving the file in a ram disk ramfs or tmpfs a folder in a real partition fat or otherwise may be used

254620
switching	screens
i know i can exec commands in that session from a terminal on the main laptop screens but i d like to switching the keyboard to and from the remote ipad session

254691
packets	pcap
you might also consider using a pcap capture filter if you are looking for packets of some known type or with known attributes and you are not interested in capturing everything

254712
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	mint
this happens in practice with debian-based distributions debian ubuntu mint

254719
vim	emacs
with a configurable window manager like dwm openbox or many others you can run this snippet xclip -selection clipboard while pressing super + c to copy and a similar script in the editor vim emacs etc. can retrieve the selection and insert it at point

254735
switching	screens
you can check whether this is the case by switching off the splash screens

254735
ubuntu	mint
i haven t worked on either mint or ubuntu for quite a while but i remember that there were sometimes problems with missing passphrase prompts on client machines and the quickest though roughest remedy was to switch off splash altogether

254750
move	drag
for example if i drag to move a clementine window near the player controls near the bottom of the window

254751
filesystems	fat
if it didn t help make another copy var tmp videos.manual-repair.sdcard and try modifying it with a hexadecimal editor preferably one with knowledge of the fat filesystems

254772
osx	yosemite
how can i upgrade python from 2.7.10 to 2.7.11 on osx yosemite

254791
google-chrome	firefox
suddenly i cannot surf the internet anymore with any web browser google-chrome firefox etc like the internet connection was down

254800
ubuntu	debian
there s an answer to this on ask ubuntu which says that fonts in usr share fonts should be usable directly in wine but the default setup in debian doesn t support this

254813
openbsd	linux
the above situation can be observed on linux but not on openbsd

254815
ubuntu	debian
this also applies to ubuntu since it is based on debian

254817
screens	tablet
now you can effectively capture your laptop s keyboard entry by just tabbing to the almost-minimised terminal but see it on your ipad tablet thus using it as a second terminal screens

254870
postgresql	mysql
depending on which rdbms you re using you could also have it display that in the correct format like using group_concat in mysql or string_agg in postgresql

254876
tunnel	packets	tunnel	vpn
first off i wouldn t suggest iptables to solve all of this truely an ideal exit tor node would load balace traffic though a few vpn tunnel to keep isp s eyes off the packets and true destination and or utilize caching proxy to keep outbound repeat requests to popular static content to a minimum.

254876
apache	nginx
hint both nginx and apache will serve the first vhost or server block in your configurations if now url was requested

254876
apache	nginx
if using something else other than apache or nginx you ll want to consult the man pages but for me it was as simple as setting the first vhost to log to a different file and have fail2ban add any ips from that log to a temp ban list

254876
tunnel	vpn
i d lean twords running a restricted tor exit policy looks like you ve got that handled and then pushing traffic through vpn tunnel extra credit points for load balancing between multipule tunnel

254898
next	except
so the performance is as good as you would get if you manually created the case switch from the patternfile and hard-coded it in your script except for the small overhead of running awk once on a 150 line file which is negligible next to processing 10 000 lines

254912
inherited	properties
i am trying to find out how can i do by console the same that nappit when i add a user and add properties inherited in modify_set

254923
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
the above link is for debian and ubuntu but the same for all other linux systems

254924
stdout	stderr
in a linux server i run a program and log its stdout and stderr outputs to a file by

254924
stdout	stderr
all the outputs to stdout and stderr are logged except that some errors in the following are not but appear on the terminal

254946
kde	gnome
i was wondering if there is a up-to-date list with the common window managers and their status with wayland what is working what is not and how usable they are especially gnome and kde

254946
kde	gnome
i only know that there were some problems with kde and wayland in november kde 5.5 but i do not know the current status both for kde and gnome

254976
disk	ram
this works because grep loads the entire line of data in ram i learned this in a rather unfortunate way when grepping a disk image

254977
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	rhel	suse	centos	linux
so that you can run lxd on ubuntu and spin up instances of rhel centos suse debian ubuntu and just about any other linux too instantly .

254981
xfce	cinnamon
i have reproduced this issue in ubuntuâ cinnamon and on archâ xfce

254982
freebsd	linux
linux lxc vs freebsd jail

254993
udp	tcp
if a machine listens to external tcp or udp requests on port 5080 arriving from other machines then we cannot really speak about user permissions any more

255006
division	modulo
the last thing that is necessary is to copy out the modulo if any of the previous division operation

255023
sudo	passwd
it ll run sudo internally so prompts for a passwd will happen that s normal and this version expects that tor has already been installed

255024
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

255027
filesystems	ntfs
add filesystems i m using ntfs but the problem also happens with ext4

255028
rpm	yum
rpm and processes that depend on rpmlib like yum hardly ever contend for

255059
google-chrome	firefox
in your example code it doesn t look like you re doing much with networking but more than likely it will be called from another script or function and because it is obviously calling up child processes you ll want to figure out how to sanitize input and catch errors at every step look up the link that killed the google-chrome browser for why and ensure that unsanitized input is not read or inturprated by a privileged user look up how to add shell-shock to firefox s browser id for why and if there is networking involved with calling or returning output then the ports that the process is bound to should be on an un-privileged port use iptables firewall for forwarding if it s a web app kinda thing

255087
titlebar	window
i want to launch vlc without the titlebar and window decoration

255098
next	except
the way you have it the 1 at the end of the script is causing every line to print except when next is called which skips it

255155
vmware	virtualbox
i want to perform something similar to a clone on vmware fusion virtualbox a vm manager

255159
stdout	stderr
if i am running a program on the server and redirect its stdout and stderr outputs to a file temporary internet disconnection doesn t seem to stop the program from running

255189
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade from terminal as described in ultimate guide for uprading to new versioning

255194
dpkg	apt
dpkg post-invoke which is invoked after every execution of dpkg by an apt tool not manually

255194
dpkg	apt
if you want to add a hook to all dpkg invocations you should look at the post-invoke hook in etc dpkg dpkg.cfg which is equivalent to dpkg post-invoke above but is applied in all cases not just apt -based executions of dpkg

255195
versioning	upgrade
if i install debian with one big partition for all files var tmp home swap in the future will i be able to upgrade to the next versioning of debian without losing my files under home

255198
folder	directory
in my downloads folder when i run ls i see the home directory and i don t know why i want to remove it but i am afraid to remove my home folder

255198
folder	directory
can anyone tell me how i can just remove the home directory in the downloads folder and keep it in the root folder

255199
ubuntu	linuxmint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	linuxmint	debian	mint
i ve reused the same home drive for debian ubuntu and linuxmint since ubuntu and mint are derivatives of debian

255204
sysv	systemd
most not all though modern linux distributions have switched or are switching to systemd from the traditional sysv init scripts

255212
versioning	upgrade
i guess this is because the python versioning is too old 2.7.3 so i follow this discussion how to install the latest python versioning on debian separately or upgrade

255214
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my kali linux versioning 2 and now when i try to login in my desktop i got this error message oh no something has gone wrong

255215
google-chrome	firefox
a terminal will usually open just fine however as soon as i open firefox or google-chrome it will freeze for about ten minutes at a time

255216
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
here is the official answer linux mint does not support upgrading the way ubuntu does

255216
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
you appear to be trying to do an ubuntu upgrade with linux mint and that appears to be the source of the confusion

255216
versioning	upgrade
it automatically asks you to upgrade to the latest versioning

255219
freebsd	linux
similarly geom md list will get you the memory disk devices similar to some uses of loop mounts in linux which are also listed by lsblk 8 - in other words block devices created by mdconfig 8 on freebsd and losetup 8 on linux

255219
freebsd	linux
there s no direct linkage from geom 4 instances providers to mountpoint currently in freebsd cf. mountpoint 1 and findmnt 8 on linux

255231
switching	screens
with the compositor compton switched on as long as i run it after switching on enable g-sync visual indicator and as long as allow flipping is switched on i see the word normal on the screens

255232
uniq	grep
cat input.txt | tr n | grep src | uniq

255240
folder	directory
tar xzf src.3e.tar.gz this creates the unzipped folder called apue.3e under current directory by default

255244
cpu	processors
you just need a cpu that has vt-d extensions or amd-v for amd processors and your bios has to have it enabled

255292
ubuntu	debian
what i want to do is to see if larger repositories like that of ubuntu and debian can be used with it

255305
zsh	subshell	bash	zsh	bash	subshell
i need a genuine subshell rather than using source otherwise environment variables won t persist after the script has finished and it needs to be shell agnostic works with bash zsh etc.

255346
folder	directory
the home folder share looks fine but when i tried to write delete a file to the directory it says that i do not have access to it

255346
folder	directory
i can t access any folder or files except the root directory itself

255408
sudo	passwd	chown	sudo	chown	passwd
i ve also tried sudo chown foo server . file but that prompts me to enter a sudo passwd for bar which doesn t have a sudo passwd

255413
debian	linux
i m building a control device that runs debian jessie on a arm based linux sbc

255415
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
write a suitable etc sudoers entry to permit that particular command to be executed using sudo without a passwd write a line such as

255433
bash	zsh
with zsh and not with other shells such as bash ksh or dash

255444
width	height
this reduces the displayed height by 80 pixels and the displayed width by 50 pixels and recenters the desktop by adjusting the offset

255451
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd user1 -d for all three of them

255453
bluetooth	usb
as a final solution you could try bluetooth or usb based authentication

255482
bash	zsh
and zsh and bash give the same answer type is builtin too for both shells

255483
bash	zsh
in bash you re using the built-in test command and similarly in zsh

255483
bash	zsh
better still using the conditionals with in both bash and zsh

255486
bash	zsh
in both shells bash and zsh the utility is a shell builtin

255487
bash	zsh
is a shell builtin command in bash and in zsh

255487
bash	zsh
but both bash and zsh support it

255509
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
when dual booting windows 7 10 and linux mint ubuntu you may find yourself having to repair your bluetooth devices again and again

255509
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m answering my own question with the following guide which has been tested on ubuntu 14.4 and linux mint 17.2 17.3 and now linux mint 18.x

255510
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
using the instructions below we ll first pair your bluetooth devices with ubuntu linux mint and then we ll pair windows

255510
ubuntu	mint
pair w mint ubuntu - all devices

255510
ubuntu	mint
the mint ubuntu one won t need the spaces in-between

255510
ubuntu	mint
in mint 18 and ubuntu 16.04 you may have to do this

255514
sudo	passwd
on the other hand there are kdesu and gksudo which are to a first approximation sudo but with a popup window for the passwd

255556
cat	tee
my layman s conclusion is that tee saves the output of the cat cmd in file_4 and its copy normally sent to stdout is actually not sent to stdout but piped to shasum

255558
cpu	processors
it does not look quite right to me because i used to seeing cpu information present for each core something like shown in number of processors in proc cpuinfo

255565
versioning	upgrade
now however something unknown has changed a versioning upgrade

255615
cpu	processors
cpu variant indicates the variant number of the processors or major revision

255615
cpu	processors
if you want to check your processors max clock just type cat sys devices system cpu cpu0 cpufreq cpuinfo_max_freq

255615
cpu	processors
another thing that could impact the performance of your processors is the cpu governor you are using

255707
bash	zsh
i ve tested some and found that they are neither terminal i.e gnome-terminal xterm konsole specific nor shell i.e bash zsh specific they even work at tty s

255723
ubuntu	linux
i am not adequately proficient in ubuntu lubuntu and linux in general and despite learning a moderate but not sufficient amount of xmodmap xkb obkey and openbox along the way i have not been able to remap f2 as a replacement for the 2 key in lubuntu for my keyboard

255730
profiler	vtune
it d help to know which kernel you re running the contents of proc meminfo or at least the hugepages_ values. and if possible more of the vtune profiler callgraph referencing pageblock_pfn_to_page

255733
google-chrome	firefox
i want to be able to show what applications a user has open firefox skype google-chrome and so forth

255767
folder	directory
is it necessary to have a duplicate of all folder in home directory in wine

255792
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu touch and tizen look more familiar to gnu linux

255807
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
i just installed debian for the first time in a virtual-machine i have used centos rhel fedora for the last 11 years so i have some linux experience

255831
ssd	sata
for sata ssd i know that there exists an open source program named hdparm for secure erase by issuing ata command and this tool has been embedded within linux operating system

255843
bash	zsh
with bash and zsh you also can write

255874
filesystems	fat
the file efi archiso efiboot.img is a fat filesystems image file

255886
ubuntu	linux
i am running linux ubuntu via vmware

255895
freebsd	solaris
interestingly the solaris and freebsd manual pages for fmt are very similar hinting that the program has been unimproved noticeably since the mid-1980s

255897
bash	zsh
bash and zsh copied this feature later

255900
minix	linux
also the shell command date + s n gives time in nanoseconds in linux but in minix n option doesn t exist

255909
cpu	processors
you should now try looking google for intel processors list by given information on speed 1600 mhz and the models name what do you mean by asking your cpu type

255910
daemon	cron
you do not need to use cron because rsync can do backup when computer starts by running daemon

255920
debian	linux
in the manpage of less the up- and down-arrow keys aren t mentioned in the context of normal navigation yet on debian linux 8.2 they obviously work to scroll up and down

255948
mouse	keyboard
how can i remotely via ssh start lxde on my linux box which has no keyboard and mouse but only a monitor attached to it

255964
bash	subshell
what may be happening and i can reproduce it with ksh is that your version of bash makes some optimizations to avoid forking subprograms when they are the last command in a subshell

256010
fish	bash
i haven t used it much but i m not surprised fish seems to have its own interesting shell language completely different from bash or whatever

256048
filesystems	ntfs
rescue an ntfs filesystems to a sparse file image device partition

256060
folder	directory
-w- would allow a user to update a folder s content s insert a file and -wx would allow that plus the ability to cd to the folder perhaps as a starting location for the user ...but not listing the content s of the directory which requires the read bit be set on the directory perhaps we don t want them to see other user s files

256093
mpfr	mpc
unfortunately the configuring didn t work as other dependencies were missing gmp 4.2+ mpfr 2.3.1+ and mpc 0.8.0+

256093
mpfr	mpc
so it seems that gmp is ok mpfr too but mpc is giving a problem

256093
mpfr	mpc
for your information while making gmp and mpfr a lib .a file was created while during the making of mpc a src directory was created and filled but i don t have any lib .a file

256093
versioning	upgrade	centos	linux
for all information the choice for a centos 5.2 is the choice of the customer i can t upgrade the linux versioning

256123
bash	zsh
with bash dash pdksh yash zsh it s relatively easy

256131
post	get
is there any setup in the .conf which i could use maybe for pre post actions to create a delay of 60 seconds to get the exception while running bash on the client side

256141
stdout	stderr
usually in case of error the command outputs messages to stderr so for you task you can just supress stdout

256143
bash	zsh
that shouldn t be a worry for ksh mksh bash zsh or the bourne shell though - all of those do basically the same thing as i did explicitly above with exec

256232
centos	linux
these commands are what i did on centos linux release 7.2.1511 core

256267
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu .

256298
folder	directory
it has excellent search and replace functionality including folder directory search

256303
stdout	stderr
time writes to stderr so one would assume that adding to the command line should route its output to stdout

256321
disk	ram
i wanted to check if my default debian installation places tmp in ram or on the disk but now am completely confused

256324
bash	zsh
in ksh bash and zsh time is not a command builtin or not it s a reserved word in the language like for or while

256332
mtu	pppoe
ppp0 the pppoe connection mtu 1492

256334
bash	zsh
a more efficient version of patrice s solution using a shell with support for process substitution bash at t ksh zsh

256337
spaces	delimiter
since id -gn output is spaces delimiter you can t use that

256344
spaces	delimiter
i have a text file spaces as delimiter as shown below

256394
jobs	cron
very handy in cron jobs

256395
ubuntu	mint
i was using a windows10 ubuntu 14 lts dual-boot when i decided to swap out ubuntu for mint

256395
ubuntu	mint
i downloaded the .iso made a live-usb started mint from the usb pressed install and the installer told me there was ubuntu on my system already

256395
ubuntu	mint
i clicked to replace ubuntu with mint got to the next page was unsure whether i would keep my dual boot after the installation so i went back to the page were the installer told me that i have ubuntu installed already

256415
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
if you have the rename implementation with perl regexes as on debian ubuntu â or prename on arch linux you need instead of 1

256416
ubuntu	mint
mint uses ubuntu installer

256430
mtu	pppoe
without the pppoe hamachi gone in direct mode so the connection was enstablished inside my own lan making me think i had not problems because less mtu conversions

filesystems	xfs
for filesystems that represent data on an actual device such as ext4 xfs or vfat the thing to mount is the device node of the device being mounted

256493
ubuntu	linux
if all ubuntu 12.04 x86 have the same addresses it is most probably because they all ship the same linux build

256499
ubuntu	debian
i would like to check periodically if anyone but me installed any packages or even worse run updates without consulting me on my debian ubuntu servers

256504

unix	bsd
several decades ago tektronix utek bsd 4.2 based unix first on national semiconductors 32016 cpus then motorola 68020 s was providing something called dfs distributed file system under which foo bar was referring to the bar file on the foo dfs server

256538
ubuntu	mint
download something user friendly such as ubuntu mint or fedora of course more exist install the software you need and see how it works

256540
ubuntu	linux
i am now going through various linux distros to find the most suitable one - ubuntu seems to be a good starting point

256543
bash	zsh
not so quick but zsh and bash maybe

256576
filesystems	xfs
edit just found that xfs has native support for acls and xfs is the standard filesystems in centos 7 which explains everything

256586
put	get
this will put you into a subshell after changing directories which you then have to exit to get back to your original shell

256588
sudo	passwd
make sudo read passwd from stdin

256595
ubuntu	centos
i essentially need to specify a kernel the same way i specify an architecture but to my knowledge yum on centos 7 has no way to say i need a package built for x kernel. i m less familiar with apt-get ubuntu but i don t believe it has a way to do that either

256601
restrict	shared
then shared that directory with all other users through nfs from that server and restrict them to read access by using root squash

256617
redhat	fedora
is there any meaning of the centos i guess redhat and if i remember correctly fedora too boot screen progress bar layers

256622
disk	ram
i ve got a laptop with two disk - 1tb hdd and 256 ssd and 12gb ram

256645
jobs	cron
i battled this issue for a few days and found that to execute my root cron jobs simply remove the username from the crontab

256663
bash	subshell
i couldnâ t understand why bash would run backgrounded commands in a subshell but it makes sense if you also want to be able to run shell builtins such as exit or echo to be run in the background not just external commands

256663
bash	subshell
as mentioned above when you run bash forks itself to create the subshell but since sleep is an external command it calls the exec system call which immediately replaces the bash code and data in the child process with a running copy of the sleep program

256663
bash	subshell
here the bash shell 26793 forks to create a subshell 4502 in order to execute the command in the background

256670
dpkg	apt
there are logs of apt usage in var log apt and logs of dpkg usage in var log dpkg.log

256670
ubuntu	debian
etckeeper available as a package on debian and ubuntu does that very well

256673
ubuntu	debian
i wrote a guide on installing a debian ubuntu version in a chroot in another debian ubuntu version

256673
debian	linux
arch linux also has packages with schroot the tool for setting up a chroot environment and debootstrap the tool for installing debian in a directory

256686
docx	xlsx
i don t want to get rid of ubuntu and unfortunately can t get rid of windows occasionally i still have to be able to read write 100 docx and xlsx compatible files

256686
ubuntu	debian
so would it be more efficient in terms of ram and cpu workload to bootstrap a debian image within ubuntu or actually triple-boot

256720
freebsd	linux
been a bit since i ve used freebsd but if memory serves you should be able to put in the linux compatibility port and run it from that

256720
postfix	dovecot
kolab lists it s technologies off the top of my head it s postfix dovecot openldap apache2 spamassasin mysql

256720
freebsd	linux
after installing the packages ports needed you should be able to copy and paste configurations etc maybe alter some directory locations as needed sql databases var ldap databases var again and web directories srv or var www depending on which linux compat you picked right into your freebsd environment

256755
ubuntu	debian
for geeqie specifically i would wait and see when the fix makes it into your existing ubuntu distribution because i think ubuntu roll fixes like this out in a continuous manner unlike debian

256764
ubuntu	mint	cinnamon	kubuntu
i am having problems related to audio settings on my notebook with all distros since i used ubuntu and xubuntu 14 and 16 kubuntu 16 ubuntu studio 14 and 15 elementary 0.32 and mint 17.3 cinnamon and mate and all distros showed problems relating to analog audio since only hdmi works after login on systems with login sound the sound works when i login but a few moments after analog sound no longer works

256766
folder	directory
the documents are in a different working directory folder i could use a wildcard here for example a .doc

256790
terminate	timeout
but at the moment the reply doesn t arrive at the nc console and using wireshark i can see that nc only terminate the sending side of the connection when it quits because of a timeout

256803
disk	ram
this doesn t mean that there is no copy of the page in ram any more but it can still be duplicated in the swap cache a ram section which caches pages written to the disk

it used to be that if you wanted to test your sound you could simply cat any file to dev snd but that doesn t appear to work on any of the systems debian ubuntu mint arch that i ve tried

256839
ubuntu	linux
i have also tried installing ubuntu and arch linux with the same problem i do not get a fancy user interface and whenever i click install my screen goes black and sometimes the pc reboots

256849
bash	zsh
in the unix shells bash and zsh the disown builtin command is used to remove jobs from the job table or to mark jobs so that a sighup signal is not sent to them if the parent shell receives it if the user logs out

256852
put	get
the kernel actually doesn t put the top-of-stack at the same address every time to try to confuse malware that needs to know stack locations to get its own code executed

256874

it includes the last package i had gotten from glenn and dave with some minor fixes to get it to compile on some new os versions like centos 7 and ubuntu 14

256998

i decided to switch from centos to freebsd 10 after i had a really good experience installing it on a xserve g4 powerpc that s a story for another day if anyone is interested

mp3	flac
i m currently trying to write a little script to convert all the flac files to mp3 files

257020
folder	directory
however i ran into a bit of a problem when trying to set up recursion down into all my music folder - the script kept looping into the current directory .

257021
switching	screens
it would be nice if i could just use the screens command or something while git is blocked to run commands and then switching back

257030
mp3	flac
if i understand your idea correct you want to walk through the whole directory tree create there new directory convert flac to mp3 if any and copy all non-flac files to a new dir

sdl	xlib	mouse	keyboard
first of all the x protocol can t be fully understood without a server-client architecture but however most xwindow applications use xlib and xt in a way that could be encapsulated inside xlib itself just translating the framebuffer and mouse keyboard i o towards any other api like sdl for example

xlib	xcb
technically xlib is x11 although the developers of xcb have replaced parts of that with xcb see xlib and xcb

257193

doing that to address limitations in the existing xlib was the purpose of writing xcb see xcl an xlib compatibility layer for xcb

in first case any request on your wan ip the ip of your router with port 80 will be forwarded to a lan ip 192.168.2.4 in this case

257764
int	boolean
the unos option parser is superior to the gnu longopt implementation as it uses a format string that allows to auto-convert int and boolean arguments and as it allows to implement callback functions for eny option if desired

257771
postfix	dovecot
in postfix and dovecot i have configured home user maildir but in sendmail i am unable to find the exact parameter where i set the directory path

in your case since you are using dovecot with maildir folder located in each user s home directory the best choice of local delivery agent to use is probably dovecot s own lda

257812

i read through this popular ibm doc i see it referred quite often on the web explaining the function of the initial ram disk

how to have centos generate the ubuntu kernel entries

258016
ubuntu	centos
i think you are right to try and keep centos to boot if you want to move there but you could of course try and see if centos is recognised by ubuntu grub-mkconfig under ubuntu and if it does it should run grub-update on ubuntu and then grub-install dev sda

258016
lvm	btrfs
the whole problem arises by distros making changes to etc grub.d 10-linux for their own older versions copying with how they use btrfs subvolumes lvm and other distro specific peculiarities

if you compare that file from ubuntu with centos you will see that there are huge differences

i understand that the virtual size of a process is the sum of memory it is actually using memory it has mapped into itself for instance the video cardâ s ram for the x server files on disk that have been mapped into it most notably shared libraries and memory shared with other processes

is there any potentially bad effect that such processes with high virtual size but little ram little gpu memory and low disk i o may have

folder	directory
you would be going against alot of unix momentum and history renaming your the hidden folder in you home directory i wouldn t do it

258192
folder	directory
not only do the existing programs expect those folder to exist but any applications you install in the future will just place more hidden folder in your home directory

258192
folder	dir
i agree its annoying - i have almost 100 files and folder in my home dir - instead i recommend you learn how to use tools to manage listing and searching files

258220
ubuntu	linux
boot your vm with a linux livecd like ubuntu mate or something

258256
sysv	systemd
you can t use a debian package s static copy to install both the systemd and sysv files because this will duplicate services

packets	multicast
one of the network interfaces is used for receiving multicast around 300mbps received on the host s eth1 device and it has packets loss with the dropped packets visible on the host on vnet1 interface

259031
packets	multicast
i tried using virt-io e1000 and rtl8139 drivers and macvtap passtrough mode it all results in more or less packets loss which is a big problem for multicast

debian	mint	debian	linux
i am trying to connect an lg vl600 usb 4g modem from verizon on a debian based machine tried on linux mint and raspberry pi

259129
ubuntu	linux
i started hosting my game-server on ubuntu linux 14.04 i am having an issues øœ some enemies bug abusers log in 2+ characters in the same second then they spam a certain spell word that lags stops my game-server is it possible to make an iptables for tcp connections on port 7171 to kick bypass if 2+ characters logged in from the same ip at the same second time and is it possible to make other one when a number of spells words spammed per second by players on same ip they get kicked

259155
kerberos	ntlm
i never determined exactly why the error was being generated when using the default ntlm security and the variants but i did discover that using kerberos authentication worked around the problem

259159
stdout	stderr
is this another form of redirecting stdout and stderr like 2 1

259162
stdout	stderr
i don t even csh but the manpage says that it s the same thing like in bash and familyâ that is open for appending the and also redirect stderr instead of just stdout

259180
centos	linux

apache	nginx
i am trying to install nginx as a backend proxy for apache and i get this errors

259217
sudo	passwd
but after the reboot more than timestamp_timeout you were again prompted for a passwd for those commands because there was a pre-existing all all sudo rule without the nopasswd flag -- that you didn t add but were caught up in

259218
stdout	stderr
btw i get the same hang without stdout and stderr redirection of ssh

259219
ubuntu	mint
i just built a new computer and installed centos7 rhel based and i also tried mint 17.3 ubuntu based

259219
google-chrome	firefox
i can duplicate the problem by opening multiple instances of firefox google-chrome timeshift vmware workstation disks utility etc and keep toggling my 3d desktop and eventually it freezes

259232
apache	nginx
going 100 apache or nginx for that matter might be an option

259234
freebsd	linux
zfs can - i use it myself on freebsd - although it would require some setup before a linux machine could read it

259237
lzo	lz4
it uses either gzip xz lzo lz4 compression to compress both files inodes

259297
google-chrome	firefox
there are evergreen browsers like firefox google-chrome and microsoft edge that always keep themselves up to date with their latest versions

259298

my system linux mint 17 originally cinnamon but changed to xfce on a lenovo t440p with core i7vpro 250 gb ssd 12 gb ram and the worst touchpad i have ever encountered

259339
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems mounted by root cannot be accessed by normal users

259339
filesystems	fat
it s a result of the fact that fat doesn t include ownership information so all files are considered owned by the user who mounted it. 1 the chown error message is because you re trying to copy files owned by you to the fat filesystems using the -a option which preserves ownership information

259360
udp	tcp
fedora workstation recently changed their firewall default zone to fedoraworkstation which allows connections to any tcp or udp port above 1024

freebsd	linux
3 next i went to my nas created another iscsi target and formatted it to with extfat or fat32 so that it is compatible across mac windows linux freebsd

259370
stdout	stderr
you are probably seeing output for standard error stderr which is a separate stream from standard out stdout

259373
stdout	stderr
curl prints its status to stderr rather than stdout

259373
stdout	stderr
to capture stderr in the same file you need to redirect stderr to stdout by adding after your stdout redirection

259373
stdout	stderr
for a thought-provoking question that will help you understand stdout and stderr better.

259388
debian	linux
i use the version of iceweasel on debian stretch gnu linux on an x86_64 machine

259403

you can use xdotool which can fake keyboard mouse input window management and more

259411
filesystems	btrfs
double check filesystems too btrfs snaps for example

259454
ubuntu	mint
as a broader comment elementary os mint and ubuntu are all pretty similar

259454
ubuntu	mint
i m pretty sure that mint s common desktop environments are available in ubuntu and therefore in its derivatives including elementary os

259454
ubuntu	mint
i don t know if you can easily get an elementary os look and feel out of a stock ubuntu or mint though

259484
switching	screens	mouse	keyboard
a cpu can take on the task of playing a video â switching over to checking for keyboard or mouse input â draw some stuff on the screens â check to see if devices have been attached in any known port â and so on

259487
ubuntu	debian	dpkg	apt
my understanding the apt dpkg system that ubuntu and debian uses is that the apt-get update command will connect to all defined repositories and pull down a package.gz file for each repo

259490
vmware	virtualbox	google-chrome	firefox
its been running everything from virtualbox installing and running linux guest to vmware workstation running windows and linux mint guest and installing more linux guest timeshift multiple browsers google-chrome firefox with many tabs toggling 3d cube desktop running steam etc and the system hasn t frozen

bash	zsh
particularly bash behaves the worst of any of bash ksh93 dash mksh yash or zsh

259498
children	parent
the above should work not only to kill all remaining backgrounded children of a shell as soon as one returns but also to propagate the first returned child s exit code to that of the parent shell

259510
folder	directory
change the output directory setting in the c++ project to solutiondir bin configurationname so that the native dll ends up in the same folder as your managed program

259510
ubuntu	linux
i would like to know to do this in a makefile used in ubuntu linux 15.10

259521
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
in my linux mint 17.2 cinnamon the lock screen and the login screen are vastly different unlike in ubuntu unity

259528
stdout	stderr
this would redirect both stdout and stderr to the file followed next

259528
stdout	stderr
if you shell does not support use posix way to redirect both stdout and stderr

259532
dnf	yum
for example dnf or yum can install a kernel update but until the machine is rebooted which dnf or yum will not do automatically the new changes won t take effect

259546
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
that s an issue i had a lot with linux mint and ubuntu you should get the appropriate graphics driver for amd it s fglrx not updates and for nvidia it s nvidia-current

sudo	passwd
i want to set up so my sudo users are able without a passwd change the setting i plan to use the commands in the login and logout scripts for bash

259793
chown	chmod
otherwise do i need to make my own script that uses chown and chmod

259797
sudo	passwd
edit the etc passwd with sudo vipw and change home directory of the user

259826
rhel	archlinux
this does not seem to have been done in rhel and its derivatives nor in most other distributions and answers like this one on superuser and the networkmanager documentation from archlinux who generally ship their packages as they are upstream without alterations suggest that it has been like that since gnome 3 came out

259826
kde	gnome
...the last line of that .desktop file clearly shows that someone on the de or distribution level decided to not show that symbol in kde and gnome

259852
disk	ram
i have a working workaround with creating this folder and copy libmonoposixhelper.so from usr lib at startup in the ram disk

259907
ubuntu	linux
it s a box with a camera with ubuntu linux embedded and let s assume we don t want to connect a monitor to this device for configuration

259937
bonjour	avahi
the best way to do this is with avahi which implements multicast-dns this is what apple calls bonjour

259937
bonjour	avahi
next set up a service in avahi to ensure the host advertises itself via bonjour and add mdns name resolution to etc nsswitch.conf

259956
jobs	cron
use fully qualified paths in the cron jobs

259958
ubuntu	linux
since anything is possible with linux at least i hope how can i boot into ubuntu 12.10 or higher with just the old grub not grub2

259985
folder	directory
suppose i have two different directory with the same folder names

259987
bash	zsh
echo tmp | cd would work with ksh93 but not bash dash zsh sh .

259987
bash	zsh
would work with shells supporting process substitution at least ksh bash zsh but wouldn t have any significant advantage compared to

260000
freebsd	linux
i am a linux user who decided to switch to freebsd because i liked the idea of the ports system that it uses

260000
freebsd	linux
i decided to give it a try in a virtual machine on linux mint and it ran flawlessly i had to setup the gui but the process was trivial so i decided i d try a switch from linux mint to freebsd on my physical machine.

260053
stateless	stateful	disk	ram
but ram soon runs out too and it is stateless besides and so the system stores data which must survive power loss or else which isn t currently as valuable to it as somewhat else might be on some kind of stateful disk drive which is generally much slower than the system s ram banks

260054
disk	ram
swap is a good thing and its virtual memory used on the hard disk linux actually create a disk partition for swap it should be dubble of your system ram

260131
zsh	tcsh
that s basically the same as zsh except that tcsh doesn t have an info page

260132
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
i need to free up 4t on my lvm which is mainly taken by a btrfs filesystems

260134

this supports the ext filesystems as well as reiserfs and xfs

260142
filesystems	btrfs
between k 1000 and k 1024 for btrfs filesystems resize both lower

260144
sudoers	passwd
you can modify sudoers as root of course to allow this user to change the passwd for that user

260176
daemons	launchd
as you can see it is configured to launchd amule daemons with some options

260211
opensuse	debian
i have been a debian user since several years but now would like to try opensuse as well in a dual boot environment

260223
filesystems	ntfs
you can resize the partitions with resize2fs for ext-x filesystems and ntfsresize for ntfs

260228
installation	upgrade
but mainly every time you upgrade to a new kernel installation removals updates your boot grub grub.cfg will be overwritten and you will lose your changes

260247
google-chrome	firefox
i ve checked there re many tickets open in bug trackers of big name browsers like firefox and google-chrome

260273
openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
since openbsd netbsd and the x32 abi for linux already use a 64 bit time_t it seems reasonable to expect that by year 2038 a signed 64 bit will be the default counter

260276
tunnel	vpn
it should return a list of connections one of them is going to be something like tun0 which is your vpn tunnel

260308
cpu	processors
your intel core 2 duo cpu t7500 is a 64-bit processors

260331
xfs	btrfs
currently i have a setup with two hardrives one with xfs the other one with btrfs on it

260331
xfs	btrfs
the root fs is mounted on the xfs and the btrfs under data

260342
apache	nginx
how can i install a simple secure owncloud 8.2.2 installation that uses nginx and sqlite without installing apache and mysql

260347
ubuntu	linux
note while you already have another linux installed ubuntu you can skip ignore grub_installation step at the end just update-grub on ubuntu

260381
solaris	aix
most implementations of grep gnu grep modern bsds as well as aix hpux solaris provide a -w option for words however that is not in posix

260381
solaris	aix
solaris does document this while aix and hpux describe -w without mentioning the regular expression

260391
ethernet	wireless
i am trying to bridge wireless and ethernet connection either on pc and to share internet to rpi while doing ssh or to bridge connections on rpi so i could have wlan0 and eth0 active at the same time

260415
bash	zsh
similar text as could be produced by ksh bash zsh as this

260417
chmod	sudoers
then either edit your sudoers file to allow them to be run as root or use chmod +s to set them suid

260418
ubuntu	debian
i am trying to package an ubuntu package as a debian package

260425
ubuntu	linux
i would like to share my windows 7 c folder with another ubuntu linux 15.10 lenovo desktop computer

260425

when i try it i get the ubuntu linux error message

260425
ubuntu	linux
here are the ubuntu linux commands i tried

260425
ubuntu	linux
also i would like to share my windows 7 c folder with another ubuntu linux 15.10 lenovo desktop computer in the reverse direction

260425
ubuntu	linux
do i need to install and configure either the ubuntu linux samba server and client and or

260425
cifs	smb
the common internet file system cifs protocol is a dialect of smb

260425
cifs	smb
both smb and cifs are also available on vms several versions of unix and other operating systems

260425
ubuntu	linux
do the windows 7 and ubuntu linux 15.19 computers have to be on the same network

260445

i want to add swap drive to freebsd by modifying linux swap

260465
centos	linux
i am stuck in an effort to provide an maintain an up-to-date git release for a collection of centos linux servers

260514
versioning	upgrade
but i tried both sudo apt-get install git and sudo apt-get upgrade git and it is still versioning 2.5

260514
versioning	upgrade
how do i upgrade it to the latest versioning

260519
hash	md5
that will print the md5 hash which the recipient can compare with the content of the md5sum.txt file that you will have published

260520
ubuntu	linux
did not find any methods to verify the boot configuration despite several days of reading web tutorials blogs about secure boot including ubuntu and the linux foundation s preloader.efi all of which explaining how the verification of executables including kernel modules works but none of which mentions the grub.cfg and shell scripts and config files inside the initrd so it looks like i m the first one to ever ask for verification of non-binaries in the boot process

260525
hash	md5
md5 sha-1 and sha-256 are different hash functions digests

260553
folder	directory
execute this one in any directory you want have an sorted analyse for folder size then scroll down with end key

260589
readonly	temporary
so as a temporary solution i added the readonly option to the disk

260603
bash	zsh
i installed zsh because i thought i might prefer it over bash

260622
sysv	systemd
now rc.local is a sysv thing where it runs at the very end of the boot process the compatibility provided by systemd is not perfect as you can see in your screenshot

260648
disk	ram
both tmp_result.txt and result.txt reside on tmpfs-based ram disk so i would expect copying moving files to be very fast

260670
chown	sudo
run the command sudo chown -r richie coderepo assuming your username is richie

260692
strncmp	strcmp
your biggest mistake is that you should be using strcmp or strncmp to properly compare strings in c

260711
daemons	systemd
your best best is to set up a secure shell daemons on the systemd if it s not already running and use paswordless keypair authentication

260713
debian	linux
and one on the server which is linux debian in my case

260720
int	chars
a sequence expression takes the form x..y ..incr where x and y are either int or single chars and incr an optional increment is an int

260737
switching	screens
in the settings dialog of xfce4-power-manager there is a setting when laptop lid is closed which has three options separately for when on battery and when plugged in switching off display suspend and lock screens

260737
switching	screens
if i choose switching off display the screens doesn t get locked when closing the lid

260756
bash	zsh
i use bash but that doesn t matter within zsh the same

260756
post	put
sorry for linking it if i would put it directly stackexchange won t accept my post without telling me why

260759
debian	linux
for example something like locate it leaks all file names to var lib mlocate mlocate.db and is even part of a minimal debian or arch linux installation

260770
unix	solaris
solaris is a posix even unix certified system at least in some configurations however posix unix only requires a system be compliant in a given documented environment which may not be the default

260770
unix	solaris
which would work in the 1978 awk from unix v7 and solaris bin awk in the original awk you could not use any arbitrary expression as a pattern it had to be conditions using relational operators like here

260775
sudoers	visudo
i am logged in as root user and trying to add user1 to sudoers list using visudo

260779
debian	linux
second better solution can be some linux editing without kernel update i tried debian 8.3 but i have problem with jumping cursor discussion and problem is also not enough available disk space for my applications and we would have to test this solution for some month

260809
versioning	upgrade
ntp 4.2.8p2 is included if you upgrade to solaris 11.3 the currently supported versioning of solaris 11

260810
mouse	keyboard
so i have the usb stick inserted directly into the xserve and the mouse and keyboard in a hub

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
however i couldn t find any documentation on how to install the cross-compiler and toolchain for friendlyarm mini2440 on linux mint i found it for ubuntu though

260907
mouse	keyboard
i currently avoid the problem by starting suspend with the keyboard and disconnectiong the mouse immediately before.

260910
debian	linux
if there is no monitor i can access via the serial rs-232 port on debian gnu linux 8.3

260924
icmp	tcp
i expect nmap to send icmp echo ping but nmap only send classic tcp request

bash	zsh
or if your shell supports process substitution bash zsh and some kshs

260963
ubuntu	debian
haven t tried on trusty or jessie either last versions officially supported are ubuntu 12.04 debian 6.

260996
rvm	chruby
well there are a lot of ruby version managers and tools such as rvm chruby rbenv and so on

260999
ubuntu	freebsd
i have a keyboard that when plugged into any of my boxes mostly running various iterations of ubuntu all over 14.04 lts raspian osx and freebsd reports errors in the syslog

261010
ubuntu	debian
the debian ubuntu package version number for upstream non-native software always consists of two parts

261010
ubuntu	debian
the part before the dash which is the upstream number and the one after the dash which corresponding to changes made by debian ubuntu

261010
ubuntu	debian
to see those debian ubuntu specific changes look at usr share doc openssl changelog.debian.gz

261010
ubuntu	debian
if that is the case the version string has probably been modified by debian ubuntu

261027
copying	overwrite
however if you ve already removed files using regular rm or overwrite files by editing or copying them those files may still exist in the free space of the filesystem

261074
stdout	stderr
i was thinking i d just write something that would catch the error and initiate a script that would attempt to login read the password prompt from stdout stderr and send the new password back via stdin and i d be all good

261074
stdout	stderr
the problem with this approach is that the regular ssh client is using a separate tty in order to send the password prompt etc... so my normal stdout stderr catching isn t working see the answer at for an explanation

261090
debian	mint	debian	linux
it is available in debian unstable here so should be available in linux mint eventually if it is not already

261090
debian	mint	debian	linux
if it not currently available in linux mint debian edition it should be easy to backport if you want to do so

261110
sudo	passwd
first time sudo is invoked passwd is prompted for

261116
hash	md5
i didn t want to run dual hash over tbs of data my assumption is it would take considerably longer and md5 was fine

261116
hash	md5
i have a number of hash files that are single hash ie md5 as opposed to both md5 and sha1

261116
post	get
in researching downgrading packages i found this post however when i run this i only get the current version

261136
ubuntu	debian
the pcf font is available in debian and ubuntu in the tv-fonts package and is called teletext

261136
gtk	vte
update it seems that this isn t actually related to vte but to gtk and possibly x11 itself

261137
disk	ram
essentially a kernel multiplexes the hardware resources cpu ram hardrive gpu ... of a computer among the user processes that have been started on it and it does so reasonably fairly each process gets a timeslice so that all processes can progress and efficiently if a process is waiting on data from a slow source disk network the kernel won t waste cpu time by having it run on the cpu only to ask is it in yet

261152
fish	bash
can anyone tell me the correct syntax to run my old bash command in the fish shell

261161
udp	tcp
will display all the udp and tcp connections including tcp6

261189
versioning	upgrade
in short what it happened is that the upgrade from the 5.5 mysql debian jessie official package to the 5.6 mysql oracleâ s versioning raises the limit of the open files for table caching

vpn	traceroute
traceroute 8.8.8.8 when connected to vpn

261241
tunnel	vpn
the access for internal resources when having a active vpn connection is only supposed to work if you have split tunnel active

261241
wan	lan
the internet and a local lan or wan at the same time using

261241
tunnel	vpn
with split tunnel it is then a matter of the dns order server having the dns of the vpn at the top and your normal dns servers at the end

261252
subtract	add
so in the absence of memavailable you can at least add up the values given for memfree active file inactive file and sreclaimable whichever are present in proc meminfo and subtract the low watermarks from proc zoneinfo

261314
debian	centos
if your os repository doesn t have anything newer maybe changing your repository urls to an alternative site or higher os version might also do the trick i ve done that successfully with debian but i don t know whether that can be done with centos

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint 17 based on ubuntu 14.04.3

261360
icmp	udp
but when running udp port scan it fails and my debian server answers with an icmp port unreachable error

261363
udp	tcp
tcp 80 and udp 80 are two different protocols see etc protocols that just so happen to share the same port number

261363
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
tcp 80 is open and there s some other rule for udp that s generating that icmp response

261370
ubuntu	linux
i recently installed ubuntu linux 15.10 on a lenovo desktop.after a mysterious crash last night while testing point and click of an mono-.net 4.5 c# executable which dllimport s an c++ shared object the files gui manager usr bin xdg-open flickers on and off

261378
ubuntu	linux
i am using a linux os ubuntu 14.10 lts

261394
udp	tcp
albeit tcp and udp are part of tcp ip both belong to the same tcp ip or osi layers and both are a layer above ip they are different protocols

261394
udp	tcp
transmission control protocol tcp and user datagram protocol udp are

261394
udp	tcp
both tcp and udp work at the transport layer

261394
udp	tcp
some services do indeed answer to tcp and udp ports at the same time as is the case of dns and ntp services however that is not certainly the case with web servers which normally only answer by default to port 80 tcp and do not work listen at all in udp

261394
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
however if a service is not running there tcp ip defines the kernel will send an icmp message back with an port unreachable message for udp services and tcp rst messages for tcp services

261394
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
a result of a tcp udp or another icmp transmission

261394
icmp	udp
so indeed your udp scanning to port 80 udp simply receives an icmp unreachable message back because there is not a service listening to that combination or protocol port

261394
icmp	tcp
please do note that if instead of using drop in iptables you use reject rules the kernel won t ignore the scanning tcp ip negotiation tries and will answer with icmp messages of destination unreachable code 13 communication administratively prohibited administrative filtering prevents packet from being forwarded

crypt	hash	crypt	md5	hash	md5
migration of nis yppasswd hash from crypt to md5

261403
ubuntu	debian
a work around i successfully used in debian ubuntu and rhel7 is creating a short python script that s started automatically when you log into the gnome session

261414
stdout	stderr
so in this case stderr inserts directly into the beginning of tmp results overriding the output of stdout

261414
stdout	stderr
however to fix the problem you need - not to redirect stderr - to the file directly but rather to merge stderr s output into the stdout stream so you don t get a collision

261414
stdout	stderr
to me the statement itself explains exactly what is happening - stderr is being redirected at stdout itself - and only ends up in tmp results because thats where stdout is pointed almost as a side effect

261414
stdout	stderr
as opposed to what alot of guides claim which is that sends stderr to where ever stdout is pointed

261430
nas	qnap
i m trying to configure my rpi with raspbian jessie to use autofs to mount at boot a nfs share from my qnap nas

261457
ubuntu	debian
i m not sure about debian but ubuntu has a bug with that right now

261459
kde	gnome
xterm is a bit clunky to configure if you re new to linux though - it uses x resources which aren t well supported these days kde always mucks mine up - i think gnome is ok though

261465
ubuntu	centos
i wanted to know if i can masquerade my ubuntu as a rhel centos pc and download the package

261478
ubuntu	centos
so you can download desired rpm from centos repo to your ubuntu then copy to rhel and install

261507
put	get
your variables get evaluated only the first time you must put them inside the ps1 to be treated literally ffirst time and get evaluated after command execution

261509
bluetooth	usb
i have a small embedded arm box without any kvm just a serial console net and a bluetooth usb dongle

261514
mdadm	btrfs
i can t really speak for btrfs but for linux mdadm software raid it supports raid5 on two drives

261542
jobs	cron
however when running php-cli you have to declare the php54 version with either a source command for a shell or a scl enable command for things like cron or sudo jobs

261542
jobs	cron
running the cron jobs manually from the settings page works fine

261555
ubuntu	linux
i talked to a specialist in linux systems integration today and this how we solved the ubuntu unity file manager blinking problem

261571
kde	gnome
iirc neither gnome nor kde currently support dpi scaling on wayland so the answer is currently none

261599
bash	subshell
in the subshell of the command substitution when the bash interpreter interprets it expands using the value 2

261625
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu i configure it w networkmanager but arch and debian do not preinstall nm

261630
debian	linux
under debian linux you need to install wpasupplicant to support for wpa and wpa2 networks

261631
stdout	stderr
to prevent that from happening nohup normally redirects stdout and stderr to nohup.out and closes stdin

261642
postgresql	mysql
for some processes whose command line changes all the time such as with mysql and postgresql and snmpd this won t be very helpful but hopefully you can tweak the awk to help you find the culprit s

261644
disk	ram
when installing you provide the initrd initial ram disk which contains these elements so you probably don t want need to change the linux root during installation

261647
sudoers	visudo
i have added www-data as a sudoers using visudo and sudo usermod -a -g sudo www-data but it did not work

261654
ubuntu	debian
would i have a more efficient system if i installed xfce based debian or lxde based ubuntu like lubuntu

261654
ubuntu	debian
i want to know because i have had much more experience using ubuntu based distributions vs using debian based distributions

261679
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu that file is var cache nscd hosts for the hosts dns cache so you can run strings var cache nscd hosts to see the hosts in cache

261683
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
although the procedures in the link are for friendlyarm2440 + ubuntu i have tested all of them for linux mint 17 and except for this small change all seem to work fine

261703
folder	directory
i want to be in all_folders directory and then execute command so that individual folder in this directory get compressed

261736
versioning	upgrade
so i upgrade libxcb to the requested versioning but i still got the same error

261741
bash	zsh
improving bash so that like the debian package for zsh it knows how to accept keys automatically whether they use normal or application mode

261753
solaris	aix
in original vi such as aix hpux solaris pressing control g shows which line you are on but not the column

261757
put	get
the problem is that i don t know where to get the precompiled drivers package from nvidia for my architecture and where to put them

261778
freebsd	linux
my question is is there any known practical and wrong side-effect of linking dev random to dev urandom on linux systems as done by default on freebsd systems

261787
dpkg	apt
and it is easy if you have apt and dpkg

261792
binutils	glibc
the most important parts are the gcc compiler glibc c library the coreutils and binutils basic unix tools and probably the bash shell and the gnome desktop environment if you use those

261793
kde	gnome
after updating my desktop environment automatically returned back to gnome kde has been automatically uninstalled i don t know why

261821
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to convert a chef script that s used in aws opsworks for an ubuntu system to a script i can use with my aws opsworks setup for my amazon linux ami installation

mouse	trackpad
you can teach linux to recognise the magic mouse 2 and load the hid_magicmouse module as it would for the original magic mouse and trackpad by modifying the udev and modprobe configs

261853
ubuntu	debian
i have a wi-fi-enabled laptop ubuntu 14.04 lts trusty tahr and a non-wi-fi enabled workstaion debian 8 jessie with only an ethernet plug

debian	linux
but in debian linux distribution the uname -a command is working but lsb_release -a command is not working

261860
debian	linux
the linux standard base for debian on the intel x86 intel ia64

261880
ethernet	wireless
i have a laptop with a wireless card and an ethernet port

261880
ethernet	wireless
again enp9s0 is the laptop s ethernet port and wlp12s0 is the laptop s wireless device

261880
ethernet	wireless
it turns on ip routing on the laptop then does some iptables semi-magic to get packets routed from the wireless card out the ethernet and vice versa

261880
ethernet	wireless
you need to look at what ip address the laptop s wireless has and choose some other subnet for the ethernet card

261898
filesystems	btrfs
the btrfs filesystems usage command gives a much nicer overview of how much space is used and how much remains available but sadly it does not yet support raid6 mode

261900
rsa	dsa
it is not a requirement but when you start an ssh session ssh looks for a private key in home .ssh directory in the order of rsa key then dsa key as far as i know but you can tell ssh to not look for this location but some other place or tell not to look for keys at all

261913
bash	tcsh
tcsh is being run from a bash shell

261927
ubuntu	centos
my desktop was tri-booting between ubuntu 2.04 centos 6 and windows

261939
switching	screens
depending on the terminal description they may be used to switching xterm and similar terminals to from the alternate screens

261939
switching	screens
for most terminals switching back to the normal screens from the alternate screens makes it seem as if the full-screen application had been cleared from the screens

261948
gnu	uclibc
i mounted the partition from my arch system installed gnu binutils and uclibc

261983
spaces	delimiter
if you just append a newline delimiter after your matched string you can p rint only so much of pattern spaces without having to modify it overmuch

261990
gentoo	ubuntu
device itself should be fine ubuntu worked there for few weeks problem occurred after installing gentoo on other drive and using this as a storage

261990
gentoo	linux
linux distribuion gentoo

262000
uptime	reboot
because uptime in this particular case is not crucial i just reboot the machine which solved the problem

262001
bash	zsh
i am out of ideas why zsh and for the record bash aswell wont find that file does anybody have an idea

262018
folder	directory
i am new to using the shell and wanted to create a directory in where i can put all my python scripts set a path to that directory so that i can go into any folder on my mac and execute those scripts on certain files without the script having to be contained inside the same directory as the file that would serve as the input to those scripts

262018
folder	directory
from this i gathered that python is looking in that directory when i execute a python command so it should be able to run sleep_plotter.py even when i am in a different folder that doesn t contain this file

262021
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
on some workstations debian ubuntu and on a server centos i need environment variables for some scripts and jobs

262027
libc	binutils
the libc and the gnu coreutils binutils are precisely providing these apis and commands to most oses based on the linux kernel

262027
kde	gnome
tex x11 gnome kde perl python isc apache tomcat libreoffice mozilla chromium whatever as useful as they might be are not part of unix linux

262036
ubuntu	debian
i once unmounted an usb device using ubuntu or debian file manager and when the icon next to the drive that shows it is mounted disappeared i immediately pulled the usb device out

262039
interrupt	wakeup
but in the text middle of process state e.g wakeup interrupt there is term raise processor execution level

262042
folder	directory
i ve got a bunch of xml files under a directory tree which i would like to move to corresponding folder with the same name within that same directory tree

262053
bash	zsh
if you have bash or zsh you can pass basename output through printf q

262055
cpu	processors
on a modern os you can have hounded of programs services or processes if you wish running at the same time on a limited number of cpu cores so there must be a way to define which one has the highest priority over the other ones that measure is the processors execution level they range from -20 highest priority to 19 lowest priority

262056
debian	linux
i m trying to use the hping3 tool on debian gnu linux jessie and it doesn t want to play nice

i have recently bought a raspberry pi so i can learn linux and other stuff with it i loaded it with noobs and add raspbian and ubuntu mate this port from xda forums and everything works well

262091
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
you seem to be able to run ubuntu programs in linux mint just fine.

262110
unix	bsd
for logging bsd process accounting provides a small amount of information and is available on most unix variants

262111
bash	zsh
this assumes that your shell supports process substitution ksh93 bash zsh

262120
bash	zsh
the bourne shell dash bash zsh and busybox sh treat this redirection like any other redirection

262135
daemons	launchd
in the pre-up phase a wpa_supplicant daemons is launchd followed by

262135
daemons	launchd
if wpa-roam is used a wpa_cli daemons is launchd in the post-up

262141
debian	centos
in debian is www-data in rh centos is apache and in suse wwwrun

262150
jobs	cron
you need to take all the usual precautions about cron jobs they don t have much in path enviornment variable

262151
bash	zsh
is it possible to configure bash readline to behave like zsh in this way

262153
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
your alias assignment syntax is wrong for bash zsh fish your syntax is tcsh you need a between alias name and alias expansion

262158
ubuntu	debian
i d like to install debian or ubuntu on this so it is actually usable

262160
disk	ram
please note that as of openbsd 5.6 or 5.7 openbsd s buffer cache aka os disk filesystem ram cache etc. does not have a 32bit 3gb constraint anymore see this ml post and thread for more info

262162
debian-based	ubuntu
including consequently presumably ubuntu and all of the hundreds of debian-based and ubuntu-based derivatives

262167
bash	zsh
please note that the original bourne shell is quite old 1979 and that many improvements have been added to more recent shells ksh bash mksh zsh etc

262174
ubuntu	debian
i have strong doubts it is possible to install debian or ubuntu in your dvr

262174
disk	ram
i have an embedded linux at home with 128mb of ram and 16mb of disk

262174
disk	ram
yours seem to be aprox 96mb of ram + 128mb of disk

262174
ubuntu	debian
with this kind of resources there is not much leeway to install a normal debian or ubuntu distribution without significant work

262176
voip	sip
the advantage of doing the call forwarding at asterisk level is that you can also forward the call to a sip extension to a voip account anywhere

262190
sudo	passwd
however i need sudo and have to type a passwd or i get this

262201
hash	md5
i have an input file containing file paths and their md5sum separated by semicolons and sorted by md5 hash

262202
sudo	passwd
use sudo but configure it so that this command will not ask you passwd using nopasswd option

262218
debian	centos
on centos and debian i tried this

263241
bluetooth	usb
the latest ubuntu 15.10 works fine with the ethernet wifi bluetooth and usb 3.0 on the nuc

263248
daemons	systemd
if you are on a systemd with the dbus-monitor 1 tool you can start this program as a daemons so it can monitor for interface address changes

263252
freebsd	linux
it seems that the problem symptoms may affect multiple desktop environments in both linux and freebsd

263261
chown	sudo
youd need to fix up owner group sudo chown -r youruser yourgroup home ubuntu analytics

263270
ubuntu	centos
long term support like centos or ubuntu lts would also help

263281
ubuntu	debian
this is a ksh and bash feature and may not be in your shell dash default shell used in debian ubuntu

263281
bash	zsh
i checked ksh bash dash and zsh

263288
debian	centos
i have a centos vm running via kvm on my debian laptop

263310
ethernet	wireless
i know this is working because i have successfully connected to the internet with it both wireless and through the ethernet ports

263322
chown	chmod
note that if the chown fails on a given file the chmod will not be run on that file

263360
debian	centos
centos unlike debian may get that information from

263401
centos	linux
i m preparing a new centos linux server one of many

263403
bash	zsh
i ve been running sudo bash or sudo zsh as my easy way to switch to root but this has the disadvantage of not running all my zsh config i have for my regular user

263428
uniq	grep
among the smarter solutions here s a brute force one-liner that cut s out the md5sum runs it through uniq -c to get the counts uses awk to prune out the actually-unique values then passes the remaining md5sums through a for-loop to grep the matching values from the original file

263438
bash	zsh
this can be done if your shell has a precmd hook bash and zsh do

263450
arp	udp
it sounds like teamed nics should not arp like this mid-session but of course they won t be aware of any session when the traffic is all udp

263454
ubuntu	mint
after clearing ubuntu from my laptop i switched my laptop to legacy bios mode to install mint cinnamon 17.3

263454
ubuntu	mint
the same thing happened this happened with ubuntu as well the boot hung before it got to the mint splash page and once again i pressed the power button and mint booted up normally again

263461
wan	lan
this assumes that your lan gateway has the ip address of 10.41.250.1 while your wan gateway has the ip address of 192.168.42.1

263486
sudo	passwd
allegedly if you are logged in as non-root and write sudo passwd -d root root login will be disabled meaning that you have to log in as another user and use su to switch to root or just stick with sudo

263486
sudo	passwd
the book that told me to use sudo passwd -d root was written for centos 6.5

263498
filesystems	btrfs
the problem is that even with the quota applied the lxc root filesystems still reports the full size of the host btrfs filesystems

263498
filesystems	btrfs
example if my btrfs filesystems is 250gb and i create an lxc container using the -b btrfs and -s options i now have a subvolume in the btrfs filesystems representing the root of this new container

263501
bash	zsh
bash has a few extensions over standard globs borrowed from ksh88 and enabled with shopt -s extglob but is still limited compared to shells like zsh or ksh93

263504
ubuntu	debian
i can download anything to the usb key though so i was wondering - can i run a debian installer from the usb key by first booting into the ubuntu livecd

263516
sudoers	visudo
to preserve home edit the sudoers file run visudo never edit this file directly

263518
bash	zsh
ksh introduced the syntax also available now in bash and zsh

263521
daemons	systemd
edit i have already started emacs daemons by a systemd user unit

263524
versioning	upgrade
this says that at 11 06am on 15th feb i upgrade python-numpy from versioning 1 1.11.0 b2-1 to versioning 1 1.11.0 b3-1

263524
versioning	upgrade
for example if you know that the jessie-backports upgrade you installed were all done on a particular day 2016-02-15 then you can downgrade to the previous versioning with something like

263527
dnf	yum
since this for fedora it is fine to use yum or dnf to figure this out

263533
chown	chmod
then set an owner to your folder chown someuser dev-team srv beta and chmod 660 srv beta so anyone in group dev-team can read and write there

263536
chown	chmod
you can use chmod command for changing the rights or permissions for the folder chown command for changing the ownership

263556
put	get
when i put them in a script i get an error message telling me the port number is in use

263562
sudo	passwd
an alternative is to establish a very secure root passwd that is changed regularly that no one knows generating it randomly with makepasswd and keep it in an envelope for instance for emergency cases single-boot for instance or when someone mistakenly messes up the sudo configuration

263580
g++	gcc
also gcc g++ ld are all 64bits and in the opt subfolders and have successfully compiled other much complicated programs using gcc

263615
debian	linux
make the 16gb usb drive run debian linux

263652
folder	directory
changes directory to ... system or ... data and extracts the backups inside data or system folder

263652
folder	directory
why does changing directory not work as soon as the script should change to data folder

263655
ubuntu	linux
the ubuntu forum thread explaining linux install on hp stream 7

263655
screens	tablet
this os can be installed on the tablet but the kernel provided does not support touch screens

263661
kde	gnome
i have used a more limited approach as the solution is streamlined for gnome ad nautilus and i use mainly kde and dolphin

263678
tunnel	vpn
tun0 is the vpn tunnel my machine has 10.7.7.126 as address

263679
ubuntu	debian
i have the problem that the video driver i915 does not seem to work in debian jessie 8.3.0 even though it does work on l ubuntu 15.10

263679
ubuntu	debian
i am concerned about this because i d like the program xbacklight to work on debian too because i actually prefer debian over ubuntu but had to switch to lubuntu because my eyes got really strained

263679
ubuntu	debian
but i don t think the kernel that debian and ubuntu use are that different

263679
ubuntu	debian
there were some error messages regarding acpi in dmesg but unfortunately not only in debian but also in ubuntu

263692
pop-up	dialog
some pop-up dialog

263699
centos	linux
i have a multi-homed linux server - centos 6.x

263715
ubuntu	debian
now i am kind of excited that this works since it was the main reason why i could not work with debian despite everything that i dislike about ubuntu and everything i like about debian

263721
lvm	btrfs
it seems automated partitioners finally now have good support for lvm but i ve now moved on to a different scheme involving btrfs subvolumes which nothing i ve seen can use

263721
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	mint	centos	mint
i m most interested in fedora but would also like seeing input regarding other common distros such as centos mint ubuntu c

263726
bash	zsh
in ksh93 bash or zsh that last line can be simplified to

263731
filesystems	fat
fat is a family of filesystems comprising at least in chronological order

263747
dpkg	apt
essentially it is similar to dpkg pre post-invoke hooks but for apt which i m assuming is actually the important one in your usage scenario

263804
disk	ram
i m installing a centos 7 vm and i would like to create a ram disk inside the pre section of a kickstart file

263832
rpm	yum
if you do have a complete set of dependencies you can use rpm --aid to install a package and dependencies from a local directory or you can play around with yum localinstall if that functionality hasn t been deprecated

263858
bash	zsh
in bash or zsh

263869
unix	aix
i have trouble understanding a weird behavior vi seems to add a newline ascii lf as it is a unix aix system at the end of the file when i did not specifically type it

263873
put	get
you can get difficult to trace errors if you put a on the last line of shell scripts

263876
x86	64bit
can linux provide that level of hardware abstraction given that computers are based on the same architecture x86 64bit

263885
bash	subshell
when using a pipeline bash runs the commands in subshell

263897
tunnel	vpn
you will want to tunnel it in some encryption ssh port forwarding or a vpn or something along those lines and firewall away its ports in this example that s port 5901

263910
csplit	grep
picking apart that bit at the end of the csplit invocation we use the subshell grep to get the number of instances of your marker within the file and subtract one- this tells csplit just exactly how many splits it s going to be making

263919
unix	aix
in any case this behavior and the warning message have been in the legacy bill joy s vi source code since at least 1979 and afaik retained in all branches created from system v source code releases from which proprietary unix like aix were built

263924
debian	linux
i don t understand when named bind is needed on debian linux systems

263937
sysfs	umount
would adding a rule that watches the mount and umount syscalls on sys be sufficient to detect a change in sysfs

263951
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
note i tested this in freebsd but it should be the same on macosx or pretty much any posix os like linux solaris etc

263972
ubuntu	centos
more specifically it works fine on my ubuntu 14.04 but not working on fedora 23 and centos 7

263975
fish	zsh
zsh and fish are popular alternatives

263977
ati	nvidia
last i looked this was the case for both ati and nvidia proprietary drivers

263980
disk	ram
it s possible to build emacs without it to save a little bit of ram and disk spaceâ¹ but it s uncommon

debian	linux
i am trying to download virtualbox on my kalinux and i would like know which debian my kali linux is based off of

263989
debian	linux
the kali linux distribution is based on debian wheezy

263989
debian	linux
from your results of uname -a you have kali linux 2.0 with a kernel version of 4.0.0 hence your kali is based on debian jessie

263991
ubuntu	linux
we would like to know how a managed c# executable running in the mono environment can step into an unmanaged c++ shared object s code using the monodevelop debugger on a ubuntu linux 15.10 platform

263991
ubuntu	linux
however we would like to solely use the monodevelop debugger on a ubuntu linux 15.10 platform for both managed c# code and unmanaged c# code

263995
redhat	fedora
you are talking about chkconfig which a utility used on fedora redhat centos and similar distributions mostly used to configure whether a particular service will be launched during machine booting or not

264016
jobs	cron
this is very common from root s cron jobs that produce output

264039
bash	zsh
with extended globbing active for bash and zsh ksh use it by default

264063
sudo	passwd
if you donâ t want to be prompted for any passwd while running sudo then we can use the nopasswd parameter on a particular entry

264063
sudo	passwd
this parameter is the opposite of the default passwd and will no longer require any passwd for the user â œadminâ while running sudo

264063
sudo	passwd
this can be of useful while running scripts that will launch sudo in this case i would recommend to enable nopasswd only for the needed commands or just if you donâ t want to keep typing the passwd

264063
sudo	passwd
note this post doesnâ t recommend you to disable the passwd usage in sudo this is not a good idea by the way but just to show you what options are available and how you can use them

264063
sudo	passwd
knowing the security implications of disabling passwd usage in sudo use them wisely based on your particular needs

264079
debian	centos
i remember in centos i could use which php i think and that would return it but using debian it does not work

264089
ubuntu	debian
the difference to debian ubuntu is the directory for your certififcates

264095
bash	zsh
i am very zsh somewhat bash familiar with the shell s initialization sequence when the user logs in through a text interface

264095
bash	zsh
i m interested in the answers to these question for two shells zsh and bash and two operating systems linux and osx

264095
bash	zsh
1 assuming that .zshrc .bashrc are being sourced as part of the zsh bash built-in initialization sequence for interactive shells rather than being sourced explicitly by .zprofile .profile

264099
daemons	systemd
is there any any way i can convince systemd to show me some debug output or see what the settings daemons is doing or just generally make the power button turn the power off

264199
zsh	subshell
note also that zsh aggressively optimises subshell execution anyway and commonly exec s the last command or doesn t spawn the subshell at all if all the commands are safe without it

264286
sysv	systemd
eventually i figured out that networking is actually a sysv init script etc init.d networking which is converted to a systemd service at runtime run systemd generator.late networking.service so you can t just modify an existing script

264300
folder	directory
however the glob would just search for files in the folder directory relative to the current directory

264300
bash	zsh
or probably better here with shells supporting arrays like bash yash zsh ksh

264301
versioning	upgrade
i am using nvm to allow me to have different versioning of node installed and i have just upgrade the versioning and of course i no longer bind

264339
versioning	upgrade
i would like to only have ubuntu and also perhaps an upgrade versioning not necessarirly 14.04

264413
ubuntu	debian
i don t know much about debian but on my ubuntu 14.04 laptop here is the standard procedure i use when i want to disable x and boot to command prompt for troubleshooting

264419
ubuntu	debian
it does this with debian or ubuntu yes yes two sides of the same coin but does not do it in fedora

264428
tunnel	vpn
a vpn is basically an encrypted tunnel

264435
chown	chmod
to manage who can read and write from to this filesystem just use the normal chown and chmod tools

264470
dpkg	apt
after this if i try to update apt tells me to run dpkg --configure -a

264483
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems is is badly mounted who knows how to mount ntfs

264490
hash	salt
but in addition to the root hash a salt is also given

264493
hash	salt
a salt is combined with the hash when creating the digest which is stored on the device

264493
hash	salt
hash will be the same for given content so the salt is a way to make the digest different

264493
hash	salt
when dm-verity runs it compares against lists of hash so you need the salt to match the hash against the digests which were stored

264516
ubuntu	debian
under debian jessie or perhaps ubuntu

264519
folder	directory
since you re just looking at folder in one directory you can use find

264519
folder	directory
-type d -readable to compare against the directory you want to access to see if there is a folder that you do not actually have access to read

264534
zsh	tcsh
the second glob is equivalent to and is needed for some shells use the form for zsh csh and tcsh or for rc es

264537
chown	chmod
chmod and chown with -r can mess up some intentional permissions modifications on files so do exercise caution when executing such commands

264546
fish	zsh
on the down side except with zsh fish or shells based on the forsyth shell nowadays pdksh and derivatives like mksh posh or openbsd sh that will cause grep to complain about searching through the directories

264564
folder	directory
put it in a sane location in order of standards-compliance opt usr local or a folder in your home directory build and create an executable script wrapper in a location usr local bin or bin that changes to that location and executes the binary

264571
fish	zsh
with zsh t csh and fish that won t run the command if the glob s don t match any file

264577
folder	directory
solution given by angus is good but will have issues if there are directory in the folder this will fix it

264581
folder	directory
i have learn linux recently but i confused about how linux system works especially about how linux handle program files in windows all program is in one directory programfiles and some in windows but in linux when i install program automaticly apt i think its randomly place the program files not in one place not just programfiles folder

264582
sysv	systemd
we have a galera cluster operational on centos 7 with sysv and are looking into migrating to systemd

264583
debian	mint
in particular systems such as mint derived from debian do not provide relocatable packages

264587
sudo	passwd
i could ssh into the box and while on it added some groups to me account and changed my passwd i still have that session open and have root access via sudo -i

264589
openvpn	iptables
is it possible to only let the traffic of deluge through a vpn openvpn and the other traffic not with iptables

264618
gtk	vte
a lightweight terminal emulator based on gtk and vte

264642
bash	zsh
however ksh including both att ksh93 and pdksh mksh bash and zsh implement the more useful behavior where var is set only during the execution of the function it s also exported

264642
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh with as long as they are operating in native mode as opposed to compatibility mode

264643
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
whenever connected to my dynadock my notebook linux mint running ubuntu 14.04.1 has crashed unexpectedly with

264659
versioning	upgrade
upgrade tmux to 2.0 versioning

264677
cpu	affinity
i am quite sure irqbalance is not needed in vms with cpu affinity and in single core vms

264677
cpu	affinity
the two servers where we have cpu affinity manually configured have indeed special needs as in general cases the literature says irqbalance is supposed to do a better job

264678
bash	subshell
this differs from under certain circumstances such as subshell that do not require bash to be re-initialized

264721
stdout	stderr
it will write to stdout alledgedly though i wouldn t be surprised to see stderr

264721
daemons	systemd
once you have the daemons set up how you want you may be interested in more customized systemd for capturing logs like the other answers

264724
versioning	upgrade
i know about the versioning pinning but i do want the package to be upgrade if appliciable i just do not want the package to be removed to have another package upgrade

264768
versioning	upgrade
that is they ll probably require you to upgrade your bios to the latest versioning before doing any investigation

264803
ubuntu	mint
my experience with mint and ubuntu is that if you burn the .iso image correctly the install goes flawlessly

264809
ubuntu	mint
i have had excellent results using brasero which comes installed on ubuntu and mint

264811
chgrp	chmod
...where the chgrp and chmod commands were intended to make the ownership and permissions of var log boot.log match those of all the other log files under var log

264833
ubuntu	linux
in a linux distro let s say ubuntu 14.04 how can one find the time and date when this particular linux kernel was compiled built

264880
rmdir	mkdir
for example mkdir and rmdir worked by editing some filesystem data structures directly

264882
gentoo	linux
a recipe which automates compilation and installation of packages on gentoo linux

264916
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu any other linux distribution and many other unix-based systems you can use uname to find this information

264935
installation	upgrade
the installation command sudo apt-get install --install-recommends pipelight-multi was for only one package but it entailed downloading and installing about 180 dependency packages about 40 of which were upgrade to currently-installed packages

264952
ubuntu	linux
i cannot ping 192.168.10.1 the default gateway from the ubuntu linux 15.10 computer 192.168.10.22

264952
ubuntu	linux
does it have anything to do with what an expert told me that my ubuntu linux network configuration file etc network interfaces was messed up

264952
ubuntu	linux
where should i look on the windows 7 computer for the information necessary to add to the ubuntu linux etc network interfaces

264958
cpu	processors
show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual cpu or cpus while the hypervisor was servicing another virtual processors

264965
vmware	virtualbox
the hypervisor means the layer that manages a virtual environment like vmware xen or virtualbox

264970
subshell	ifs
a subshell -- such as might be created by or -- is not an invoked shell and its ifs along with most of its execution environment is identical to its parent s

264970
ifs	dash
ifs is not generally marked for export but if it were note how bash ksh93 and mksh ignore their environment s while dash and busybox honor it

264995
stdout	stderr
the issue you encounter may be because the output is on stderr not on stdout

265021
ubuntu	linux
but when i run this program with the cron in ubuntu linux i get the data i am after in netstat.log and lsof.log

265036
freebsd	linux
so is it possible to install linux or freebsd on this machine

265041
rhel	archlinux
take a look at etc gdm init default available on archlinux so not sure if in rhel syststem it is available

265063
cat	tee
so echo s stdout is now redirected to both dev null and a pipe to cat as if using tee

265072
dpkg	aptitude
i already added i386 in dpkg --architecture updated aptitude and installed java-jdk-1.6 i386 successfully

265072
g++	gcc
could install build-essential i386 replacing gcc g++ amd64 with

265072
g++	gcc
gcc g++ i386

265082
post	put
the post scriplets on the other hand is run after the package payload has been put into place so that part is fine

265092
nas	qnap
i get a modified linux installation on qnap x86 based nas

265101
wan	lan
i am trying to map any connection to port 1337 on both wan lan to my computer s port 1337

265111
sysv	systemd
but most of the service is started by systemd sysv

265129
emacs	gedit
this is supported by many editors including vi all variants emacs joe and gedit but not by kwrite

265133
folder	directory
i ve read parameter expansion and know how to store a directory but it includes the entire folder tree

265145
folder	directory
it lists all directory only directory in that folder

265225
jobs	cron
i just need to know who what when about crons so that i can choose wisely how to implement cron jobs

265243
folder	directory
i want to use a directory as a sort of drop-off point similar to the public folder in each mac os x home directory that is certain users or everyone should be able to create new files inside this directory but nothing else - no new subdirectories no modification or overwriting of existing files no reading of any kind etc

265243
cifs	smb
the system where this takes place is omnios solaris with zfs shared with the solaris cifs module as a smb share

265249
dnf	yum
yum dnf is not available due to this process however curl --insecure to well known ca-bundles etc

265255

265257
ubuntu	linux
by the way ubuntu is a good user friendly linux distribution to start with

265263
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is the most famous gnu linux distribution

265263
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is linux

265271
versioning	upgrade
installing software has been so difficult with all dependency missing versioning not upgrade os distro versioning unmatch

265279
centos	linux
you can dig deeper in the centos faq to get more insight on this and as well search for your question again on se unix linux + google

265297
folder	directory
if it s a folder location like the home directory runtime directory etc. systemd provides this through variables

265321
redhat	fedora
the process is fairly easy thanks to redhat s jakub jelinek fedora gcc builds found on koji

265321
mpfr	mpc
i usually repackage the rpm to contain a correct build tree using the gnu facility to use correctly placed and named requirements so gmp mpc mpfr isl cloog is no longer required are downloaded and untard into the correct path and the new bloated tar is rebuilt into a new src rpm with minor changes to spec file with no dependency on their packaged rpm versions

265321
rpm	yum
the simplest method for opening a src rpm is probably yum install the rpm and access everything under rpmbuild but i prefer

265341
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
on ubuntu mint 17 linux kernel 3.13.0 nfs version 1.2.8 i set up a loopback mountpoint with both sync and async options and re-ran the tests

265388
ubuntu	linux
i have a computer with ubuntu linux and i have no more room on pc so i have a flash drive that i want to install packages onto is there any way to install a package onto a flash drive

265397
ethernet	wireless
enp9s0 is the name of the ethernet port wlp0s26f7u3 is the name of a usb wireless card on the laptop

265409
sudo	passwd
you could configure sudo to allow the command cp foo home test without a passwd and then use this command

265431
freebsd	solaris
busybox sh solaris usr xpg4 bin sh and freebsd sh also behave like posix documentation

265441
putty	winscp
ssh via putty was working fine but winscp was not able to connect

265447
stdout	stderr
turns out i needed to reset the stdout and stderr file descriptors that i used before calling switch_root in the stage-1-init.sh

265484
bash	zsh
zsh also understand read -d as a nul delimiter like bash

265484
bash	zsh
that s however standard code so you don t need to rely on the zsh bash specific read -d

265485
debian	linux
linux 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u3 2016-01-17 x86_64 gnu linux

265485
mouse	keyboard
usually everything works fine when resuming from sleep hibernation suspend but sometimes after resuming from sleep i enter the password which unlock the screen i3lock desktop content appears and i can move the mouse both external usb and internal touchpad and trackpoint - but keyboard both laptop s builtin and external usb doesn t work

265492
tunnel	vlan
if you have a sufficiently secured connection for example ipsec or openvpn tunnel and a separate vlan that only exists between sender and receiver you may switch from ssh to unencrypted alternatives like mbuffer as described here or you could use ssh with weak no encryption and disabled compression which is detailed here

265516
mouse	keyboard
mind the fact that your input devices like keyboard or mouse are still active and somebody may interact with your remote machine

265516
mouse	keyboard
to disable these device please see disable keyboard mouse input on unix under x

265585
ubuntu	debian
i am runing debian 8 i have a partition sd5 100 gb is that possible to install ubuntu on sda5 from the existing iso without using cd or usb

265594
daemons	systemd
system-wide locale settings are stored in the etc locale.conf file which is read at early boot by the systemd daemons

265618
rpm	yum
that s clearly yum + rpm on your centos 6 box

265618
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
there are three major third-party package management systems for os x fink macports and homebrew

265618
versioning	upgrade
there s really only one official way to get a newer versioning of gcc for a centos 6 box upgrade to centos 7

265629
daemons	systemd
with my systemd only running some basic daemons like wpa_supplicant cron or dhcp and with an x session with only windowmaker gkrellm and xterm open linux starts eating more and more ram as time goes on until after some 8-12 hours it ends up running out of ram and throws a kernel panic

265632
dnf	yum
ensure you have ntfsprogs installed yum dnf apt-get install first

265638
spaces	delimiter
if your words are spaces delimiter then awk can be easier

265643
sudo	passwd
passwd password-auth password-auth-ac system-auth-ac system-auth sudo sudo-l are the same as those on another machine that doesn t behave in the same way

265682
disk	ram
i think when referring to cache memory you re thinking of memory used for disk caching which is ram used to store information from a hard disk to speed up future processes

265682
disk	ram
when this happens your system will start using swap memory on disk note this is not ram but space on your hard disk

265682
disk	ram
this is undesirable as disk speeds are considerably lower than ram speeds and will result in your system becoming really slow

265698
filesystems	btrfs
if you re io-limited in any way use a filesystems such as btrfs or zfs that directly supports incremental backups without having to find the differences in files such as what rsync has to do

265710
ubuntu	linux
the system is ubuntu linux

265727
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
if you are the systems administrator use su - to gain root access with the root passwd and then use visudo to grant your regular user sudo permissions

265751
dnf	yum
for dnf new version of yum you may try with repoquery wrapper command

265756
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
filesystems encrypted lvm with btrfs

265766
chgrp	chmod
as well as updating the 0600 to 0660 you ll need to chgrp your_app_server_group the client_body_temp_path directory to the group that your app belongs to and then also setgid on it chmod g+s your_app_server_group so files written into it by nginx are owned by that group

265773
ubuntu	linux
i would like to try to boot a full linux distro now ubuntu

265773
versioning	upgrade
first upgrade chromeos to the latest versioning

265776
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux linaro - which is a ubuntu based fs - open to any suggestions on debugging this issue

265790
hash	salt
i have the access to a salt hash of the root password

265797
centos	linux
i started learning linux on vmware using centos 7

265797
folder	directory
i created an image directory and several layers of files and sub-directories in that folder

265800
xfce	kde
there are several desktop environments available including kde plasma unity and xfce

265800
xfce	kde
unity can be quite heavy for chromebook hardware and xfce is way too plain for my taste so i am going to install kde plasma

265800
xfce	kde
substitute kde with xfce or unity if you want

265808
folder	directory
i have a directory let s call it movies which contains many files and folder

265818
stdout	stderr
to output both stdout and stderr from a script to the console and to a log file iâ ve found a beautiful solution with tee

265823
folder	directory
i m trying to create an alias that will check if all of the folder in one directory are also in another directory and if not tell me which ones aren t

265829
stdout	stderr
this method redirects stderr to stdout then pipes to tee

265832
folder	directory
in the same terminal create a folder in the tmp directory

265838
tunnel	vpn
this virtual machine and at the moment only this virtual machine can establish a vpn tunnel to a remote office

265843
stdout	stderr
i ve tried capturing the password prompt via stdout and stderr but it is not getting sent to either one

265876
kde	gnome
if someone were to make an accessible version of kde or gnome they might use this property

265880
children	parent
linux s process flag 1 signals processes that didn t call exec since they were forked by their parent children or grandchildren etc. of the original process of their program

265886
lvm	mdadm
i m about to set up a new nas and basically want to know if it s a bad or a good idea to have one lvm volume on multiple mirrored mdadm arrays kind of like raid 10

265888
lvm	mdadm
on the other hand a 4 disk mdadm raid10 configured to use the offset striping mode can give seqential read performance near that of a 4 disk raid0 but an lvm stripe on top of two mdadm raid1s only has the performance of two disks

265894
rpm	yum
restoring etc pam.d system-auth by running yum reinstall pam or extracting etc pam.d system-auth from the rpm is probably your safest bet

265910
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard inputs stop working

265916
ubuntu	centos
google only returned results on how to install it for mainly centos and ubuntu only

265921
int	chars
on the other hand will test whether a is comprised exclusively of int with an optional - as the first chars because is for the start of the tested string and marks end of the string

265927
dpkg	apt
it works but i get apt dpkg errors when i try to install other apps such as

265927
dpkg	apt
plex is working fine but seems like apt doesn t finish the installation process and gets stuck somewhere also commands running after the apt-get install dpkg won t run from php but will run from bash

265959
logmein	hamachi
i contacted logmein and their reply was pretty much that the hamachi for linux is a beta and i m on my own

265964
jobs	cron
due to password policy i don t think i will be able to get a non-expiring password for this account and updating the password monthly for an account only used to run cron jobs seems a bit of a waste

266001
sudo	passwd
if they don t know the root passwd but are trusted with sudo then

266001
sudo	passwd
if they don t know the root passwd and are not trusted with sudo privileges then there is a reason why they should run the executable

266053
bash	zsh
if you re using a modern shell like bash or zsh you can use something like

266054
rpm	dnf
when the update repository is in an incoherent state there s not much to be done. if you really want to dig into it if for example a serious security issue were at stake you could bypass dnf and just use rpm directly at least until the problem is in a dependency of rpm itself

266059
folder	directory
i m in a group that owns the mediawiki directory and all of its subdirectories but i can t write to the folder for some reason

266060
folder	directory
the group www-data does not have write permissions on that folder only the owner can write to that directory

266087
jobs	cron
short version is there an off-the-shelf program to avoid being pinged repeatedly be frequent cron jobs in periods when they fail

266104
kde	gnome
gnome is probably not heavier but lighter than kde and so i did -t gnome

266104
kubuntu	gnome
ubuntu flavors comparison ubuntu 15.10 vs kubuntu 15.10 vs ubuntu gnome 15.10

266105
bash	zsh
i assume you use a bourne-style shell such as sh ksh any variant bash zsh etc

266119
put	get
i could have put swap in a lv to simplify things but the raid0 gets better performance for what it s worth and i get an extra 16gb of space

266147
ssid	wlan
i have 2 wlan routers with the same ssid

266176
ethernet	wireless
capabilities usb-2.00 ethernet physical wireless

266179
freebsd	linux
i wrote a small c library for linux and freebsd and i m going to write the documentation for it

266180
freebsd	linux
start by reading the relevant sections of man man where it mentions the standard macros and compare those descriptions for freebsd and linux

266190
filesystems	xfs
i am facing a strange problem with xfs filesystems

266210
rpm	yum
all bash file was broken yum rpm sh bash ...

266233
put	get
if i put these lines and nothing else in my .zshrc i get all the completion features i expected

266233
bash	zsh
my testing shows it doesn t improve zsh s completion and it doesn t fix the zsh completion that is broken but works in bash curl

266234
tunnel	vpn
or you could go for a tunnel solution vpn to allow portable hosts to access the local network

266245
asterisk	pbx
it works as my firewall ipsec vpn dns dhcp and works as my phone voip pbx with asterisk

266245
asterisk	pbx
as for the specific software for linux you have isc dhcpd for dhcp isc bind for dns asterisk for the pbx and strongwan or openvpn for vpn

266259
installation	upgrade
i needed to upgrade the installation and also the kernel but after reboot 2.6 kernel is still used

266274
mouse	keyboard
i want to force my screen to blank and to stay blank regardless of what i do with my keyboard and mouse until it receives a command to unblank kind of like a lock

266277
mouse	keyboard
you could just disable your keyboard and mouse for the duration

266277
mouse	keyboard
first get your keyboard and mouse ids

266277
switching	screens	mouse	keyboard
now switching off your screens disable your keyboard and mouse wait 2 seconds and switching everything back on again

266283
wan	lan
spare compaq laptop running pfsense 2.2.6 with onboard realtek nic for the wan and a micro center inland usb ethernet adapter for the lan port

266325
xfce	kde
the proble is that xfce or kde doesn t have such bar and it seems that the application menu is not showing anyware

266336
ubuntu	debian
as i neither use ubuntu nor debian this might be wrong so feel free to correct me

266336
debian	linux
a linux distribution based on linux in this case debian

266336
ubuntu	debian
cat etc debian_version shows you the version of debian on which ubuntu version 14.04.3 is build upon

266350
sudo	chgrp
to solve thin run sudo chgrp mygroup var run sdp to give yourself permission

266371
debian-based	linux
i am developing a debian-based gnu linux distribution for visually hearing impaired people and for the elder

266376
bash	zsh
this requires bash or ksh or zsh it doesn t work in plain sh but the syntax has those requirements anyway

266379
ubuntu	debian
debian and therefore probably ubuntu set up exim by default

266393
dpkg	apt
my understanding of apt is a but shaky but generally isn t this the type of action which should only happen when first installing a package or when using dpkg reconfigure

266399
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux v14 i have found this method to check if after rebooting it was performed

266412
stdout	stderr
i d like to have the printout stdout and stderr of the last command run within zsh available in a variable ready to use grep etc on it

266424
debian	linux
the old nas debian is using linux ext3 file system whilst the new one freenas is based on zfs

266424
hash	md5
secondly md5 hash the first 512 bytes of each file

266424
hash	md5
lastly md5 hash entire file

266424
hash	md5
i have constructed a bash command for performing a md5 hash of a directory structure and sorting the output based on file name to ensure a deterministic order on my linux nas

266428
pull	push
now i typed command fg to bring it foreground now job wont get stepped but it will pull from background jobs queue and push into foreground jobs queue

266432
lvm	xfs
i have xfs directly on top of md raid5 of 4 disks in my desktop no lvm

266436
folder	directory
to allow write access to a specific group shared files folder can be made writeable by default for everyone in this group and the owning group can be automatically fixed to the group which owns the parent directory by setting the setgid bit on this directory

266438
filesystems	btrfs
filefrag -e works well and uses the generic and efficient fiemap ioctl so it should work on pretty much any filesystems including the often-weird btrfs even for btrfs-compressed files

266512
ubuntu	debian
i am fairly certain that the server in question is running debian or ubuntu

266515
cat	tee
there zsh does the tee internally and also invokes cat

266535
debian	linux
i updated my debian jessie installation a few days ago to the current minor version 8.3 which included a new linux kernel uname -a gives 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u3 2016-01-17 x86_64 gnu linux

266535
debian	centos
the same ethernet cable and port quickly connects to the internet using dhcp if i plug it into a macbook or even an ancient centos machine so the problem must be in the debian configuration

266567
versioning	upgrade
also i concur with mattdm here -- fc4 is very old -- it s definitely worth looking to upgrade to a more modern versioning of fedora

266643
feof	getline
digging around with strace may be necessary to see exactly what some higher-level function like getline 3 or specific application is doing under the hood but most things will probably boil down to read 2 or feof 3

266664
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout stderr file status is read write

266689
ubuntu	mint
i tested ubuntu mint fedora slackware someone tested to me and arch two days ago and none of them worked the video the screen crashs as you can see in the following photo

266693
dpkg	aptitude
in var log dpkg.log you can find a list of packages which have been installed upgraded or uninstalled by dpkg or any tools that make use of dpkg such as apt-get and aptitude

266693
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	downgrade	uninstall	upgrade
you can find some tips on how to extract that information from dpkg.log and use it to upgrade downgrade uninstall etc specific versioning of specific packages at debian jessie is installing too many backports

266738
sudo	passwd
for example in your bash they may try to redirect sudo to other things to get your passwd

266757
folder	directory
i want to go through all of them check if they contain a folder with a certain name and if that directory exists run a script let s call this script foo.sh to avoid confusion

266758
bash	zsh
case is the construct for that in shells of the bourne family bourne almquist ksh bash zsh yash...

266766
filesystems	fat
mnt data is likely a fat windows or ms-dos filesystems and fat doesn t support unix file permissions or ownership

266779
rpm	yum
i m using rhel 5 64-bit and have come across an inconsistency with rpm yum

266779
rpm	yum
however rpm and yum now both think only the 32-bit version is on the disk

266793
disk	ram
press d disk press c cpu press r ram press q to exit

266803
stdout	stderr
you can restore the stdout file descriptor to the terminal output device by redirecting it to the same device pointed to by stderr file descriptor 2

266826
filesystems	btrfs
i chose the filesystems as btrfs

266830
ubuntu	freebsd
is there anyway to run at immediately on freebsd like i am able to on ubuntu

266830
ubuntu	freebsd
at now runs immediately on ubuntu but does not on freebsd

266830
ubuntu	freebsd
i have no idea how to figure out how at is running on ubuntu but freebsd it is running on crontab scheduling causing the delay

266834
zsh	subshell
most bourne-like shells except zsh and ksh run each part of pipelines in subshell

266834
zsh	subshell
assuming you don t use zsh or ksh then in your script the last part of pipiline was run in subshell so exit quit that subshell instead of current shell

266880
stdout	stderr
note that you don t need to redirect both stderr and stdout as the nohup command will redirect the stderr of utility depending on where nohup s own output is pointing to

266916
daemon	cron
if you want to make sure that cron won t run something that will interfere with or cause problems during the upgrade then temporarily stop the cron daemon before the upgrade and start it again afterwards

266928
put	get
if you get the normal prompt rather than a menu it is because you are missing your boot grub grub.cfg to tell it what to put on the menu

266966
sudo	passwd
another quick and dirty but generally not recommended way is simply to put sudo in front of the command inside the script when the interpreter encounters the sudo it will halt script execution and ask you for your sudo passwd before continuing

266969
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you could edit the sudoers file so the backup script can sudo a specific command without entering a passwd

266973
temp	tmp
where is it trying to create this temp file and how can i redirect it to create that file in tmp which is mounted with tmpfs

267025
mouse	keyboard
and i m about to write a little program that invokes hibernation in case the battery is low and invokes suspend-hybrid whenever there was no user input via keyboard or mouse for - say - 30 minutes

267035
cpu	processors
this is an old linux server with few cpu it has san attachment so the gzip is running at its maximum using 99 of a processors

267040
portrait	landscape
i have the two screens in the first graphics card rotated to portrait mode and the screen on the second graphics card in landscape mode

267064
try-catch	exception-handling
but whenever i get an exception-handling but don t try-catch it i get an 500 server error

267094
ubuntu	centos
one of the reasons iâ m putting my shell configuration files under version control is to configure my environment on all the systems i currently log in to on a regular basis cygwin ubuntu and centos both 5 and 7 using active directory for user authentication

267104
bash	zsh
for searchable arrays i d rather use zsh than bash

267119
ubuntu	centos	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	centos
i had installed many different distributions slackware gentoo ubuntu redhat centos knoppix and puppylinux

267122
mtu	icmp
when bond0 and thus eth2 and eth3 has smaller mtu than ethernet frames containing icmp messages on wire then packet capture utilities like tcpdump or tshark see only part of the payload part of the icmp messages

267124
kde	kubuntu
i would shoot for a kde based distro like opensuse or kubuntu

267127
ansible	puppet
lately with the devops movement you also have got a whole host of new and old frameworks to automate system tasks such as ansible puppet salt

267134
udp	tcp
in any case if you want a new tcp connection to be created for each of the udp packets you should use udp-recvfrom instead of udp-listen in socat

267134
udp	tcp
then every udp packet should trigger one tcp connection that is only brought up to send the content of the packet and then closed

267162
vlan	packets
for the vlan part and a general understanding of how vlan tagging and port vlan id works and what the hypervisor does to such packets and what the sea does depending to what addl_vlan_ids short for additional vlan ids which defines a vlan trunk is configured for the sea best grab the presentation a journey into the world of vlan tagging and virtual i o

267179
ubuntu	linux
basically for ubuntu based linux s the answer is no not without compiling from source

267179
dpkg	apt
as mentioned at the top the apt dpkg tool doesn t let you relocate a package s target installation directory

267188
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
generally you don t use sh as your login shell but shells like zsh fish or bash with more advanced interactive features

267188
bash	zsh
bash and zsh when not called as sh and when their respective profile session file .bash_profile .zprofile are not posix conformant especially zsh but still read .profile

267188
bash	zsh
so it s not posix syntax you want for .profile but a syntax that is compatible with posix for sh bash and zsh if you re ever to use those shells possibly even bourne as the bourne shell also reads .profile but is not commonly found on linux-based systems

267188
bash	zsh
checkbashisms would definitely help you find out bashisms but may not point out posix syntax that is not compatible with zsh or bash

267189
kde	gnome
i have a sparc server with debian 7.9 i tried to install gnome or kde with these commands but it doesn t work

267192
kerberos	ldap
authenticate rhel 5 and 6 sssd using kerberos and ldap against active directory on windows server 2008 r2

267205
cpu	processors
which uses a slightly different approach of saving off the value of the processors field and then recalling it when the cpu mhz field is encountered

267205
cpu	processors
in this case we know the cpu mhz comes after the processors field so we know that when cpu mhz is encountered the value stored in the variable x will be correct

267264
freebsd	linux
at least with freebsd ps and procps ps which used in linux

267297
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
some of the utilities that it looks for are kdesu for kde desktops gksu for gnome xfce desktops and qsu which is a qt switch-user utility that was written just for pc-bsd

267297
sudo	passwd
sudo this is used only in scripts and or command line application initializations because it either depends upon user input into the terminal or does not require a passwd at all a couple of our utilities are setup this way like the mounttray and life-preserver

267307
ssd	sata
i have a question regarding the support for sata ssd drives in the linux kernel

267308
versioning	upgrade
that s because my system is amd64 with i386 as an added architecture and these packages have both amd64 and i386 versioning available for upgrade

267332
installation	downgrade
you can then sync to selected profiles which can do the downgrade and removal installation too

267334
ubuntu	debian
i am using the ubuntu debian split configuration for exim but cannot see where to define the system filter

267348
ubuntu	centos
works on my home machine ubuntu and my server centos but not tested beyond that so ymmv

267374
bash	zsh
the script runs under a ksh-compatible shell bash zsh and allows you to use less to view files with binary content compressed files archives and files contained in archives

267398
disk	ram
regarding the fact that i o operations caused desktop freezes it seems to be because the data from the operation was being cached on ram and the memory used by desktop applications being thrown into the swap which caused the system to read back from disk whenever i tried interacting with the desktop

267403
bash	zsh
shell is a generic word for bash ksh zsh and all

267408
ubuntu	linux
i have a triple boot of ubuntu haze os and kali linux and i would like to run an app installed on another operating system from my primary os

267424
debian	linux
0.0078125 being 2 256 for a segv of 11 you d get 0.542969 128+11 256 if a core was dumped 0.0429688 11 256 otherwise nawk being the nawk found on solaris 10 or 11 or its linux port in the heirloom toolchest bwk-awk being the awk maintained by brian kernighan himself the k in awk the basis for the awk found on some bsds here tested on debian gnu linux

267424
waitpid	pclose
but when it comes to the exit status where s is the value returned by pclose 3 waitpid 2 like for system above we see

267434
centos	linux
linux kerner version is 2.6.18-371.12.1.el5 centos 5.x

267465
folder	dir
so i do not know if where am i wrong and why this ubuntu folder is in my efi dir

267467
folder	directory
so anybody with write permissions on the directory can delete files or folder in that directory even if the permissions of the files or folder are set to have no write access

267479
arp	tcp
in fact using tcpdump on eth0 and arping from another node on the network i can see the arp requests getting to the container and i can see the container responding with its randomly-generated mac but those arp responses don t seem to get back to the other host as seen by tcp ip

267487
vim	emacs
text editors like vim and emacs make heavy use of control characters and they don t get a sigint or sigquit or whatever when you type those control characters

267532
folder	directory
i need to change the files in these directory with the name of the folder adding a number to the end of the file name

267536
stdout	stderr
i also know about the numbering for 0 1 2 stdin stdout stderr but i don t get why need to have this line

267547
stdout	stderr
will redirect stderr to wherever stdout currently points to

267547
stdout	stderr
but if you also want to discard make silent the stderr then after redirecting stdout to dev null specify to redirect stderr to the same place

267547
stdout	stderr
so if you want to discard silent stderr also then you can redirect stderr to stdout and hence both will be sent to dev null as follows

267547
stdout	stderr
alternatively you could also use with the same effectâ which first redirects stderr to dev null and then redirects stdout to point to the same place stderr is currently pointing to

267547
stdout	stderr
with the new version of bash you can also use simply like which will redirects both stdout stderr to dev null

267552
disk	ram
but if linux decides to evict a page in ram that contains cached disk data does it move that page to swap or simply deletes it

267556
tunnel	vpn
and for 5m after cannot telnet to 10.225.198.3 3900 tunnel vpn still up

267567
xfs	ntfs
make sure to add any other type xfs fuseblk for modern ntfs support as pandya pointed out etc you re interested in

267600
bash	zsh
most shells including bash zsh ksh will guess as many characters as they could on the first keystroke then display a list of matching files and directories on the second

267607
uefi	multiboot
the install using uefi bios config did work but no multiboot option was provided i.e grub worked once and as soon as i chose windows 10 from that moment always windows 10 was booted without grub options

267610
filesystems	btrfs
the problem is caused by a bug in the version of tsm that is used where the tsm client can silently skip files on btrfs filesystems and bind mounts

267610
versioning	upgrade
the solution is to upgrade to a newer versioning of the tsm client like 7.1.4.1

267614
switching	screens
when i switching with ctrl + alt + â or â from workspace a to workspace b on screens 1 my cursor switching to screens 2 if and only if i have something full-screened

267629
vmware	esx
i appear to have lost a couple of gb in an ext4 root filesystem under llvm on centos 7.1 in a vmware esx vm if that matters

267638
portrait	landscape
the exif data tells viewers whether your camera was in a landscape or portrait orientation and which way up it was so it knows which way to show the image

267638
portrait	landscape
so you don t want to stop imagemagick from rotating them it s not rotating them it s just not using the exif data to work out which way up your camera was and assuming everything is landscape or portrait

267672
ubuntu	centos
on ubuntu 14.04 or centos if i m editing the sudoers file and i make a mistake or something is there a log file that i can check to see if there are any errors

267674
sudoers	visudo
don t edit etc sudoers directly this is the job of visudo

267674
sudoers	visudo
visudo opens the sudoers file etc sudoers as etc sudoers.tmp lock file for editing

267674
sudoers	visudo
as a side note visudo will open etc sudoers by default you can pass the -f option to open another sudoers file

267680
debian	linux
after the installation it tried to boot into debian but it was stuck on a message that looked like this debian fsck from linux util something

267683
fish	bash
so i guess the painless way of doing the things would be executing the bash commands inside fish shell functions

267688
bash	zsh
answering the actual question normally you can get a statement to be executed in bash simply by redirecting the statement to a bash command s stdin by any mean notice that i m on zsh which supports here strings and that the statement prints the content of a bash-specific variable

267690
chown	chmod
or do i have to do some chown and chmod when shutting down linux

267727
bash	zsh
disable the builtin only bash and zsh

267748
rmdir	mkdir
because the link unlink operations at the c operating system interface are symmetric the linking to directories is normally done only in mkdir rmdir calls

267748
rmdir	mkdir
as noted in regarding hard link originally there were no mkdir rmdir calls

267751
stdout	stderr
but if apt-get update is run without an internet connect it produces error messages some to stdout some to stderr

267790
solaris	bsd
the reason why ufs on solaris supports hard links is that at t was interested in this feature - ufs from bsd does not support hard linked directories

267793
google-chrome	firefox
as i synchronize my bookmarks and stuff via google-chrome i am not really willed to swap back to firefox

267807
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
because vagrant by default edits the sudoers file to give itself sudo privileges without requiring a passwd

267819
ubuntu	debian
only tested on debian ubuntu based systems don t know about suse redhat etc.

267837
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu uses debian packages for many things and the latter s website makes it easier to find the packages

267837
ubuntu	debian
you can also install the linux-source package debian and ubuntu provide a few source-packages this is one of the few a quick check finds only a couple of dozen packages with -source in their names compared to tens of thousands of other packages

267855
stdout	stderr
note that in the end stderr and stdout streams remain separate.

267857
daemons	systemd
if your program is a daemons started by systemd you could consider using in the unit file then that dir will be created in run when your unit starts and removed when it stops

267862
folder	directory
how do i make sure that the folder doesn t appear in my mounting directory until all the files are at least listed

267873
bison	jison	yacc	jison	yacc	bison
if you have heard about yacc or bison or well jison that s how people might use the grammar

267882
centos	linux
which commands can i use on centos 6.7 64bit linux

267890
solaris	aix
can someone explain why on solaris and aix when i try to get variable it gets the root s directory

267912
versioning	upgrade
my goal just install newer versioning because current versioning broke after upgrade kernel

267925
bash	zsh
if you re using bash or ksh or zsh and maybe some others i can t recall right now you could use rather then which allows you to do regular expression matches in sh

267951
put	get
put it in a shell startup file that will get included on shell startup regardless of whether that s a login or not

267979
bash	zsh
in shell that support bash ksh zsh you can transform

268021
sudo	passwd
you can even do but don t do that it would save the passwd in the shell history from which there s a lot more risk of leaking. arranging for that with commands that read the passwd from the terminal rather than whatever is their standard input such as sudo or ssh is more complex

268026
bash	zsh
all shells except bash and zsh worked

268026
bash	zsh
but bash in posix mode and zsh in sh emulation do work too

268038
ubuntu	centos	centos	solaris
i have a laptop i m setting up to multi-boot between win 7 solaris 11 ubuntu 14.04 and centos 7

268043
ubuntu	centos
i m installing centos on a system that has pre-defined partitions xfs created by ubuntu 14.04 live cd

268055
bash	zsh
if you can afford to require ksh bash or zsh they have better ways

268055
bash	zsh
except in pdksh and all other descendants of the forsyth shell and zsh and bash if globignore is not empty

268073
sudo	passwd
in a system administration context â œhave superuser privilegesâ usually means a user who is allowed to access the root account for example because they are authorized via the sudo configuration or because they know the root passwd

268078
int	chars
or is it just an int representing the ascii code of the last chars in that chunk

268081
gentoo	linux
as mentioned dervish in the comments there is also a gentoo linux distribution for penetration testing similar to kali but based on gentoo

268139
installation	upgrade
i know squeeze is not officially supported anymore and i plan to upgrade sometimes in near future but i want to get the current installation to a clean and up-to-date state first

268146
versioning	upgrade
to allow easier upgrade in the future rename the firefox directory to firefox-44.0.2 and add symlinks for firefox and the jre the script i ll include below assumes respectively webex-firefox pointing to firefox-44.0.2 or whichever versioning you have and jre1.8.0 pointing to jre1.8.0_73 or whichever versioning you have

268183
daemons	launchd
i have emacs daemons launchd on startup and i have no idea where it is being launchd

268183
daemons	launchd
how can i find the script that launchd the daemons

268184
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	kde	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
in xfce there is no option for animation like what can be done in gnome kde and cinnamon

268184
mouse	keyboard
run xkill or use keyboard shortcut ctrl + alt + esc the mouse cursor will change to x icon then bring the x cursor and click on the xfce panel then xfce panel will disappear and restart automatically

268229
rpm	yum
i want to install apache using yum on centos 7 and check its shared libraries with ldd and pack the binary and files in apache s rpm and those libraries with full paths and transfer them to offline machine extract the files and run apache i m not sure what it will work do you think it is the correct approach and if not what is your suggestion

268279
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
all of these are probably already packaged for your linux distro they re certainly in debian and debian-derivatives like ubuntu

268282
debian	linux	tunnel	vpn
use a vpn to connect your remote pc to the local network which contains the dlna devices bypassing tunnel through the internet such as open vpn on debian for example or pptp also explempified by this how to for linux

268309
bash	zsh
works in bash zsh mksh pdksh lksh

268319
ubuntu	mint
i ve tried this on mint 17.3 cinnamon mint 17.3 mate and ubuntu 15

268352
ubuntu	debian
if using debian ubuntu or kali you can install the open-vm-tools with

268379
crypt	hash
as long as we used crypt i could just store the linux hash as crypt hash in ldap and it worked fine

268379
hash	salt
now the passwords are stored as salt sha512 hash

268379
hash	salt
i think hash the base64 encoded result of the sha512 digest from the concatenation of plainpw and salt but i am not sure

268379
hash	salt
i tried to base64_decode the hash append the salt base64_encode the result and store it as the _96bytestring in the above ldap format

268387
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux server running ubuntu server 14.04 to which multiple computers connect and authenticate with ssh and try to open a reverse tunnel

268389
curb	libcurl
interestingly trickle can rate limit my ruby process if i use the curb libcurl bindings gem

268392
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
the arrays of all other shells that i know zsh yash fish csh tcsh rc es... are normal arrays and with indices starting at 1 like one at least i would expect not 0

268415
jobs	cron
at uses cron to schedule jobs in the future

268415
stdout	stderr
joins stderr 2 with stdout 1 and nohup then implicitly sends the output to nohup.out

268415
stdout	stderr
and there is a short form of this - send stderr to stdout - and send stdout to nothing

268416
debian-based	linux
a way to build a custom preferably debian-based linux install cd that has

268418
ubuntu	debian
what you re looking for is called a preseed installation in debian ubuntu terminology
