1
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux ubuntu desktop which has a sata card

1
freebsd	centos
i would actually like to do the same thing for a couple centos freebsd boxes at work and it seems this would have the same solution

2
gentoo	freebsd
a long time ago i used to use freebsd with its ports system and after that gentoo for portage in order to install applications via compiling from source

12
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu have source debs as well

14
bash	zsh
call the more popular shells bash csh korn zsh what other ones do you know and use and what unique features do they have

17
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	centos	freebsd	solaris	freebsd	centos	centos	solaris
this happens on my centos 4.x system but i also see it on freebsd 7.x ubuntu 10.04 and solaris 10

61
post	get
i can post much more later must get back to work

64
udp	tcp
the -l parameter is what specifies listening connections -p specifies that you want to see the pid name and -t and -u tell netstat that you want only tcp and udp connections ipv4 and ipv6

68
bash	zsh
this is for zsh not bash fyi if you haven t used it you won t regret trying it out

73
affinity	processors
the question is all in the title how can i set the processors affinity of a process on linux

87
cpu	affinity
on a related note if you re worrying about cpu affinity of your program it may be worthwhile to pay attention to how it s doing memory allocation as well

123
daemons	systemd
i need to use nscd the name service caching daemons to decrease load on our ldap server on my sles10 systemd

128
postgresql	mysql
this is used for system users such as users for databases like mysql postgresql etc

136
sudo	passwd
a user in etc passwd with home directory of dev null and shell of sbin nologin can be used for sudo ing commands but can t actually be logged into for example

138
vim	emacs
i persisted with vim for a while it s worth knowing the vim basics as you will always find a unix box somewhere that only has that but i tried emacs and haven t looked back

139
g++	gcc
you can use netbeans c c++ package that work with g++ gcc

146
clang	icc	clang	llvm
i employ makefiles and have a number of compilers to test my code against including gcc clang llvm and icc

146
folder	directory
how to lay that out is probably a question for stack overflow but as you asked i often have a separate directory for object code not for distribution and another folder for the resultant binar y|ies

148
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	freebsd	linux	freebsd	centos	centos	linux
i use everything from macosx ubuntu linux rhel centos scientific linux and freebsd

150
vim	emacs
vim and emacs have it on by default

156
freebsd	linux
for me this works on linux macosx freebsd

171
vim	emacs
emacs vim eclipse .

171
vim	emacs
i am not familiar with eclipse i do not find it leaves enough room on my screen for code nor do i like how bloated it is vim users will say the same thing about emacs

171
vim	emacs
ctags - tags your c or many other language functions so that vim or emacs or whatever can do a little bit of hyper-text linking in your files

171
calloc	malloc
you just can t write code with malloc calloc without valgrind

172
solaris	bsd
this isn t quite an answer but dtrace is an awesome system debugging tool that exists for solaris darwin os x and bsd but not linux

174
cvs	svn
it includes support for mercurial git svn cvs etc

176
ubuntu	debian
in debian the apt-get package manager can install from source too apt howto working with source packages same goes for ubuntu linux-mint and everything else based on debian

194
ubuntu	linux
nevertheless even under this interpretation it means the zfs modules must still be shipped separately from the linux kernel which is how we see it being provided today by ubuntu

194
freebsd	linux
use a different os for your file server freebsd say and use nfs to connect it to your linux boxes

198
solaris	bsd
the cmake team builds software on many many many different ways with gcc visual studio xcode windows osx solaris bsd gnu linux whatever

207
jobs	cron
if i setup cron jobs incorrectly they appear to silently fail

210
unix	bsd
as unix was forked into different implementations bsd systemv many vendor forks and later linux and other unix-like systems it became important for developers that wanted to write portable code to write code that depended not on a particular brand of operating system but on features exposed by the operating system

211
put	get
just get put files using scp from the command line

244
ubuntu	linux
i m new in linux ubuntu world

246
installation	upgrade
aptitude is the preferred program for package management from console both for package installation and package or system upgrade in debian

249
ubuntu	linux
i started using suse 5.x conectiva that later became mandriva so it seems redhat mac os x yeah i know not linux and ubuntu running mostly as a vm in the last couple of years

255
ubuntu	opensuse
i have use opensuse for several years and have dabbled in ubuntu and other distributions

286
cvs	svn
source control tools like cvs svn etc

326
vim	emacs
of course you can also go write along using emacs or vim without any real problems

329
freebsd	linux
almost all the alternatives run on linux and freebsd

338
kerberos	ldap
you either build your own active directory-equivalent from kerberos and openldap active directory basically is kerberos and ldap anyway and use a tool like puppet or openldap itself for something resembling policies or you use freeipa as an integrated solution

342
redhat	fedora
how could this be done on a fedora 13 or generic redhat style machine

343
daemon	cron
in case 2. you should inspect the mailer daemon logs messages from the cron daemon usually appear as from root yourhost

343
daemon	cron
you can use a line in the crontab file to have cron send email to a specific address which should make it easier to grep the mailer daemon logs

345
tunnel	vpn
can i somehow automatically encapsulate all the traffic to the subnets of x and y to go through this tunnel without having to run the entire vpn solution that would send all my traffic through the server

352
tunnel	vpn
it is assumed that any machine your trying to get access to via a tunnel or vpn by definition not accessible via the internet

358
tunnel	vpn
can i somehow automatically encapsulate all the traffic to the subnets of x and y to go through this tunnel without having to run the entire vpn solution that would send all my traffic through the server

363
kde	gnome
if so is it cross-window-manager-compatible or tied to a specific window manager gnome kde etc. or distribution

364
sudoers	passwd
my current solution is to add a sudoers entry to allow all to run a given script as the user i want it run as with nopasswd to avoid the passwd prompt

372
kerberos	ldap
in the end ad is just kerberos and ldap and and to vendors those are standardized easily supportable protocols

376
kate	kdevelop
have you checked out kdevelop 4 or kate

376
vim	kate
disclaimer i don t develop mono and i haven t been able to get the vi bindings in kate to be good enough to replace vim yet

382
ubuntu	opensuse
i love opensuse but have recently settled hopefully temporarily back on ubuntu as my desktop system

382
ubuntu	opensuse
in the default setup opensuse has novell s slab their replacement for the standard gnome menu but both the standard gnome menu and the one ubuntu fedora use is available

384
kerberos	ldap
you can easily replace windows ad with a combined kerberos ldap solution

386
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu packaging tutorials are abundant out there

394
switching	screens
in tmux a terminal multiplexer you can press ctrl+a- to switching to the vi buffer mode where you can navigate around the screens scroll the buffer back and forth copy text etc

424
jobs	cron
however i can make a guess about the spikes around 6 00am on your graph it could be the ubuntu default daily cron jobs

424
jobs	cron
but you said we should ignore the time so the obvious question is do you have cron jobs

431
kermit	zmodem
the serial console program you re using on the local side almost certainly has a way to do a zmodem or kermit upload which lets you send whatever you need directly

431
pop-up	dialog
in the case of zmodem just type rz on the remote system which sends out a special string that the local serial terminal should understand causing it to pop-up a file picker dialog

442
spaces	delimiter
with tail i m able to set the limit of how far back i really want to go - good if you don t use log rotate for whatever reason second i m making use of awk - since most logs are spaces delimiter i ve left my self with the ability to pull additional information out possibly what urls they were hitting statuses browsers etc by adding the appropriate variable

449
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and or mouse

459
ubuntu	centos
i m not sure if this behavior has been changed with newer versions of ubuntu centos

480
switching	screens
ctrl + a n to switching to the next window in your screens session

480
switching	screens
ctrl + a p to switching to the previous window in your screens session

486
ubuntu	debian
in debian based distributions such as ubuntu you first have to enable their non-free package repositories through your-favorite-package-manager

492
ubuntu	debian
under debian based distributions such as ubuntu if you use a server install iso you can install the jeos by pressing f4 on the first menu screen to pick minimal installation

493
ethernet	wireless
sure it might not have as many use cases but you can get something up and running dynamically connecting via ethernet and wireless on-demand pretty simply enough

500
freebsd	linux
some of my linux freebsd systems have dozens of users

503
sudo	passwd
when i first started working as a user consultant for the university i was attending i was given limited sudo rights to help students who had lost forgotten their passwd

503
sudo	passwd
an hour after my orientation my curiosity got the better of me and i typed in sudo passwd and stared in horror at the prompt for a new passwd

531
uninstall	upgrade
provide rpm and or deb files allowing user to continue using the native package management tools they are familiar with to install upgrade uninstall

535
uninstall	upgrade
such tarballs scatter files all over the system you unpack them on and there s no option later for niceties like uninstall package verification intelligent upgrade etc

538
ubuntu	centos
i guess is ubuntu for desktop and centos and ubuntu for servers

545
flac	ogg
see the ogg vorbis format lossy or flac lossless

550
switching	screens
switching between the two is not overly complicated as much of screens functionality has also found its way into tmux though if you are a power user of either one you will likely find some frustrations when switching to the other

558
bash	tcsh
i was not able to find something like ctrl + r in bash for my ksh and tcsh

570
redhat	fedora
rpm - redhat fedora centos suse

570
ubuntu	debian
deb - debian ubuntu

593
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu and debian use ack-grep instead of ack

595
unix	aix
we are running windows clients with cygwin xserver that has a bash script application running on aix unix

612
ubuntu	linux
i am having some problems with network performance speed on a linux server running ubuntu 9.10

625
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
already available in debian ubuntu gentoo .

631
put	get
if you re interested in maintaining the source you could put it into a version control system add patches to it and get the patches you want out of it

634
opensuse	centos
for whatever reasons i ve always used rpm based distributions fedora centos and currently opensuse

644
pull	push
puppet and chef are pull systems and i ve found that a complementary push system implemented using capistrano fabric or ssh 1 in a for -loop is necessary

662
bash	zsh
for starters learn how to figure out if you re in a bash shell bourne shell csh zsh or whatever

671
opensuse	linux
if you want to build packages for multiple linux distributions and multiple architectures the way to go is to use opensuse build service obs

677
freebsd	linux
i tried to use vim on freebsd via ssh on linux xterm-compatible terminal

681
filesystems	btrfs
the roadmap for btrfs in ubuntu is to have it as the default filesystems by 12.04 lts

698
filesystems	xfs
different partitions can also have different filesystems entirely allowing your os to use ext3 for example and your database to use ext4 or your object repository to use xfs or your custom app to use.

709
rpm	zypper
the opensuse build service obs and zypper are a couple of the reasons i prefer rpm over deb from a packager and user point of view

709
opensuse	centos
obs although it can handle debs is really nice when it comes to packaging rpms for various platforms such as opensuse sle rhel centos fedora mandriva etc

713
unix	bsd
this unix was improved extensively at berkeley and became the foundation for the bsd variations of unix and incorporated several new innovations like the fast file system ufs introduced symlinks and the sockets api

713
freebsd	netbsd
internal fights within the netbsd group caused the first split and freebsd was formed out of this

713
freebsd	netbsd	unix	bsd
netbsd at the time wanted to focus on having a cross-platform bsd and freebsd wanted to focus on having a unix that did great on x86 platforms

713
openbsd	netbsd
a little bit later netbsd split again due to some other disputes and this lead to the creation of openbsd

713
unix	bsd
during the 1992-1996 and by now bsd already had an mmap system call as well as most other unix systems

713
versioning	upgrade
his team was responsible for upgrading the user land and it is not a surprise that the macos userland was upgrade to the latest versioning available on bsd

716
ubuntu	linux
how can i use my linux file server which happens to be running ubuntu karmic as a custom time capsule replacement and have my macs running 10.6 automatically back up to it using time machine

718
kde	gnome
i use backintime which is primarily targeted towards gnome kde desktops

722
elf	coff
there s a spot in the coff header for a timestamp but there s no equivalent in elf so i don t think the compile time is available either

723
redhat	fedora
i have used ubuntu fedora redhat suse but haven t used os x at all

726
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
instead just install fink macports or homebrew first thing

726
ldd	otool
for instance you ll need to update your muscle memory so you type otool -l someprogram instead of ldd someprogram to figure out what libraries someprogram is linked to

734
fink	macports
although fink and macports are the traditional means of getting unix packages on os x i d recommend checking out a newer tool called brew that has worked better for me and messed less with my system and is much easier to use

742
gentoo	linux
gentoo is a source based linux distribution that will seemingly run on anything as long as you re willing to compile it

742
ubuntu	debian
meaning that it is not derived from another distribution like ubuntu is derived from debian and debian is the upstream distribution

751
subtraction	addition
the cover user creation group membership addition and subtraction and user deletion

755
freebsd	linux
you mention linux in the last part of your question but since the title is generic i ll answer for freebsd

755
freebsd	linux
freebsd has similar commands as linux but they are commands passed to the pw utility

767
debian	linux
i know that both apt-get and aptitude are command line package management interfaces on debian derived linux with different options but i m still somewhat confused

769
dpkg	apt
i ve never used wajig but the documentation suggests that it s just a script which knows whether you re passing it a deb file when it runs dpkg or an apt package name when it runs apt-get instead

770
daemons	systemd
this does not actually translate to things sent to the systemd logs or errors output by daemons unfortunately

784
umask	sudo
you will get into trouble for the umask is inherited by the sudo session so only root will be able to access files dirs you create

784
umask	sudo
sudo can be configured to automatically set the umask the way you want this question is covered on superuser.com

821
kde	gnome
since i also like the configurability of terminal emulators from gnome and kde i wonder whether there is some kind of replacement for rxvt-unicode with more features but not as many dependencies as the gnome or kde terminals

827
dpkg	apt
the underlying system is not just apt but dpkg

827
dpkg	apt
apt handles the downloads of repositories tracking of dependencies and so on for all individual packages - which it then installs using dpkg

828
ubuntu	linux
this tutorial explains in all details how to set file permissions in linux and therefore also in ubuntu such that you can control the access

832
rpm	yum	rpm	zypper	zypper	yum	dpkg	aptitude
the real comparison is dpkg vs rpm and aptitude vs zypper yum

832
zypper	yum
or zypper yum

844
opensuse	debian
debian and opensuse provide a stable base system and for specific parts kde x11 firefox you can add additional repositories which do have rolling releases

849
freebsd	linux
i use the encfs file system this should work on both linux macos and freebsd as encfs is built on top of fuse

856
folder	directory
every program stores settings in a hidden file folder of the user home directory

867
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i m running ubuntu 10.04.1 and two versions of crunchbang linux one a derivative of ubuntu 9.04 the either of a late june snapshot of the debian squeeze repos

870
bash	zsh
anyway now i want to make the shell zsh and possibly bash respect my notation of a directory by using a slash

877
mouse	keyboard
i know that there is pwgen but as far as i know it does not support mouse keyboard entropy and it does not have any kind of front end gui s.

878
mouse	keyboard
keepass and keepassx are password safes but also allow you to generate passwords using keyboard and mouse entropy

879
mouse	keyboard
the linux kernel accumulates entropy internally it used to use mouse and keyboard movements though recent versions have discarded this in favor of better entropy sources

881
nginx	cherokee
on a new server using php-fpm i couldn t use cherokee it has a bug with php so i ve moved to nginx

897
ubuntu	debian
this module loads environment variables from the specified files or from a system default if no file is specified etc environment and etc security pam_env.conf on debian and ubuntu

936
freebsd	linux
it could be that linux + btrfs will someday take the zfs advantage away from freebsd

936
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
windows linux freebsd solaris in the driver support area

947
rpm	yum
yum - rpm

961
kde	gnome
once auto mounting authorized in kde it seems to take priority over gnome and you can handle devices from dolphin

966
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu you need to look at a2enmod and a2dismod

967
kde	gnome
is it possible to install kde and gnome on your machine using fedora in such a way that when you boot you can specify whether you want to use kde or gnome

968
kde	gnome
just install both kde and gnome using your package manager

968
switching	screens
you ll be able to switching between the desktops by logging out and then choosing the other one in the login screens

969
bash	tcsh
even the number of questions on this site tagged bash are way more five times more currently than the number of questions tagged tcsh

969
bash	tcsh
why should i stick to tcsh or why should i move over to bash

971
bash	zsh
i will admit to one reason to not use zsh over bash but unless you re constantly working at multiple new installations it doesn t really apply

971
vim	emacs
even hardcore vim users can find their way around emacs and vice-versa

973
switching	screens
you can install as many desktop environments as you want switching between them at the login screens

974
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
if you know zsh tcsh or something else better than bash and have a good reference manual for it don t hold back

975
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
zsh probably has a few more similarities to tcsh than bash does

975
bash	zsh
people often claim that zsh can do things bash can t but i have not found that to be the case

975
bash	zsh
what i have seen is that for zsh it is easier built in or turned on by default while in bash it is an addon script has to be turned on or is more difficult

975
bash	zsh
disclaimer i am a bash user that has sometimes considered switching to zsh

979
mouse	keyboard
system settings - keyboard and mouse

982
opensuse	linux
i ve been reading linux forums it seems this might a be a bug on recent opensuse releases

983
unix	bsd
people using other unix systems such as bsd seem to use other shells far more frequently

984
bash	zsh
zsh lets you edit a multi-line command see zsh line editor bash doesn t

985
bash	zsh
my experience of switching from bash to zsh as far as can remember it was years agoâ² is that i didn t miss a single thing

985
bash	zsh
the zsh feature i most miss when i occasionally use bash is autocd in zsh executing a directory means changing to it provided you turn on the autocd option.â

985
bash	zsh
both bash and zsh have a decent completion system that needs to be turned on explicitly

985
bash	zsh
â² at the time programmable completion was zsh s killer feature but bash acquired it soon after

987
vim	emacs
emacs stands out to me in being a bit closer although still does not meet to iso iec standards of usability and consistency for user interfaces and hence doesn t play as many tricks with your â œinstinctsâ about that vim does

988
rss	feed
emacs has considerably more extensions to let you do tasks that are only vaguely text-editor related like browsing the filesystem or messing with version control and extensions that are in no way text-editor related like reading rss feed

988
vim	emacs
if you want an environment instead of just a text editor emacs is going to be better than vim

988
vim	emacs
in particular i think a novice emacs user will be faster than a novice vim user

988
vim	emacs
i consider myself a fluent emacs user and i m no match for the couple people i know that have an equal knowledge of vim

988
vim	emacs
emacs users are going to be almost as fast as 99 of vim users and as i said in the emacs section beginning emacs users will probably be faster than beginning vim users

989
vim	emacs
i view emacs as a live in editor whereas i use vim for quick one-off tasks

989
vim	emacs
superficially emacs is much more bloated than vim is and so it really isn t quite so convenient to fire up as vim but i also find that the philosophies of user interface from one to the other support this paradigm

989
vim	emacs
emacs is much more built to keep you inside making things nice and comfortable so you don t have to leave whereas vim is much more unixy and sees itself as part of a greater tool-belt

989
vim	emacs
the real power that emacs has over vim is customizability and with the power of viper etc this really isn t an issue

990
icmp	tcp
i know to keep everything up to date configure iptables to only allow the holes i need which appears to just tcp ports 22 for ssh scp sftp - i ll change it from the default port for the very minor security through obscurity bonus - and 80 for http - though i am confused by some tutorials which say to block icmp since i don t why i wouldn t want to respond to ping - and to only install software i need remove software i don t need

994
vim	emacs
i m not saying don t use emacs or this is the only reason to use vim but when you want to be able to use unix systems that aren t yours.

1004
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
the best way to protect against such accidents is to use a version control system cvs bazaar darcs git mercurial subversion ...

1006
rpm	yum	rpm	zypper	zypper	yum
for example yum is a front-end to rpm and others exist smart zypper apt4rpm and so on

1010
google-chrome	firefox
right now on my machine google-chrome needs about as much ram per tab as emacs does for 100 open files and i won t even mention firefox

1010
vim	emacs
starting a remote emacs is usually slower than starting a remote vim

1010
vim	emacs
turning the tables i have observed vim taking noticeably longer to load than emacs vim -u dev null vs

1010
vim	emacs
asymptotic learning curve both vim and emacs have a lot of features and you will keep discovering new ones after years of use

1010
vim	emacs
i don t think there s anything vim can do significantly more efficiently than emacs whereas the converse is true

1010
vim	emacs
as an ide both vim and emacs have support for a lot of programming languages and other text formats

1010
vim	emacs
one domain where emacs is plain better than vim is interaction with asynchronous subprocesses

1010
vim	emacs
or when you want to interact with a read-eval-print loop â emacs really shines at this vim only has clumsy hacks to offer

1016
mouse	keyboard
applications communicate over some sort of private api to the windowserver process the windowserver process is the one that actually gets hardware events mouse keyboard and dispatches those to the client applications

1024
umask	sudo
the guys bashing sudo start a new thread for it it could take several threads of it s own and this thread is about umask

1026
traceroute	packets
if you give traceroute the -q option you can control how many packets are sent

1047
sudo	passwd
you can either give them root s passwd or you could execute sudo passwd root this assumes that sudo is set to use the users passwd or no passwd and that passwd is a command that sudo has authorized to be run by that user

1050
sudoers	visudo
maybe you can add this line to the sudoers file using visudo replacing phunehehe with the username

1062
bash	tcsh
it has to cover bash tcsh and any shell you happen to use to start itself

1069
daemons	systemd
most of the configuration you will have are about services daemons and applications running on your systemd

1076
sudoers	passwd
if you don t want to type your passwd all the time sudoedit etc sudoers but if you keep running as root one day you re probably going to run something that nukes your system and all your data

1080
debian	linux
linux debian 2.6.26-2-parisc

1088
sudo	passwd
and some testing i used sudo as i don t know the passwd for the nobody account

1113
disk	ram
i ran crux on a compaq armada with a pentium mmx 166 mhz 64 mib of ram and an around 2-3 gib hard disk

1115
kde	gnome
i think the existing desktop environments gnome kde are built on top of the x.org programming interfaces so you d have quite a bit of work to do to make them work on a different substrate

1123
kde	gnome
usual command line programs however can t see the remote files only programs that use the file access libraries of either gnome or kde can see them

1151
kde	gnome
kde gnome etc

1153
kde	gnome
as far as the desktop environment question goes you should be able to in kde or gnome and get back the right answer

1154
kde	gnome
most desktop environments like gnome or kde have an about or info menu option that will tell you what you use currently so no commandline needed there really

1155
kde	gnome
desktop managers are gnome kde and cde

1155
debian	linux
for example on debian gnu linux this is defined in the etc x11 default-display-manager config

1156
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
first of all a display manager or dm xdm gdm kdm is not the same as a desktop environment or de gnome kde xfce

1156
kde	gnome
those files have a structure defined by freedesktop.org a platform for different des to collaborate on common infrastructure so that gnome and kde know about the same programs but still can show them differently and in some cases prioritize native programs over foreign ones

1158
debian	linux
it s running debian gnu linux stable

1201
floating-point	integer
like rnorm which we used above this function returns floating-point values so we have to round them to their nearest integer values before writing them to the screen

1218
daemons	systemd
safety reasons - a daemons or script vulnerability targeting linux would have the sysadmin power over your systemd

1265
udp	tcp
these aren t like tcp or udp ports

1265
unix	bsd
the original cmu mach folks used these abstractions to emulate bsd unix processes ms-dos processes and in a fabulous fit of freakiness vms tasks

1272
redmine	trac
contributors have helped us write adaptors for rt hiveminder trac github google code and redmine

1289
bash	zsh
personally i prefer zsh over bash so i recommend trying it

1314
folder	directory
i want to set a folder such that anything created within it directory files inherit default permissions and group

1314
folder	directory
and also the folder files created within the directory should have g+rw automatically

tunnel	lan
for example is it possible to browse the web through the ssh tunnel and also browse the web through your lan connection without much effort

1321
tunnel	lan
i want a seamless transition from using tunnel to using lan

1321
tunnel	lan
are there other options aside from a tunnel to achieve the result of having some traffic user decides encrypted through another machine outside the lan and have other traffic use the normal flow through the lan and out into the internet world

1328
bash	zsh
hence the following command should restore your permissions to a reasonable state assumes bash 4 or zsh otherwise use find to traverse the directory tree

1329
mouse	keyboard
you could try with gvim but one of the biggest advantages with vi and emacs is the ability to do neat stuff while keeping your hands on the keyboard and gvim is likely to keep you using the mouse

1364
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu there is the unp package which is a perl script that acts as a frontend for many archiving utilities

1369
switching	screens
in xterm you can switching between the two screens with the â œshow alternate screenâ command at the bottom of the ctrl + mouse 2 menu

1374
bash	zsh
bin bash and bin zsh are both valid shells see etc shells for a list of valid shells on your systems

1389
ubuntu	linux
is it different depending on the linux distribution used i m using ubuntu

1394
jobs	cron
can anyone give a recommendation for a simple x-based equivalent of mail mailx for reading the mail i get from cron jobs

1404
freebsd	linux
echo is also available as a builtin but apparently my scripts use bin echo on my mac and use a bash builtin on most of my linux freebsd systems

1411
solaris	bsd
even on a pc you might see other partition types for a variety of reasons because you went out of your way to create them because you inserted a disk from some other architecture because you have another operating system that uses different partition types bsd solaris

1420
perl	tcl
however vim has had similar support for python ruby perl and tcl

1426
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
however i m not sure how to wade through all of my options - rolling releases versus not distribution x versus distribution y i personally have been looking at debian ubuntu fedora arch and opensuse but i suppose that s a personal preference and so on

1428
gentoo	linux
if you want to go into deep of system i d advice using more command-line oriented systems like arch linux gentoo linux or slackware

1428
gentoo	linux
imho especially gentoo linux is good for crash run as you will run into various problems from inexperience and you will learn to solve it

1428
debian	linux	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
however there are people who uses debian testing or unstable as desktop systems successfully or use gentoo linux on production servers

1428
freebsd	netbsd
freebsd traditionally is all around operating system while netbsd tends to run on everything

1428
freebsd	linux	gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	linux
as of my configuration â i use gentoo linux on semi-production laptop and freebsd on home server but i would considered myself an advanced user

1439
ubuntu	linux
i ve been using ubuntu on my main machine but if you want better performance you should try crunchbang linux

1445
ubuntu	debian
if there is no particular feature in a distribution that is unique to one distribution user-friendliness in ubuntu commitment to open source in debian commercial support in suse and red hat and so on that is a must-have for you then you ll just have to choose any one and stick to it for a time

1463
debian	linux
we expect debian gnu linux to remain viable for a long time despite the fact that debian is not a company doesnâ t sell anything and offers no formal on-demand support

1463
ubuntu	debian
debian itself isnâ t one of the most widely used distributions but it benefits from a committed group of contributors and from the enormous popularity of the ubuntu distribution which is based on it

1464
vim	notepad++
i am copying my code from notepad++ to vim

1477
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to migrate from mac os x to a linux distribution maybe probably ubuntu

1497
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
this particularly applies to the available desktops gnome kde xfce lxde etc

1503
mouse	keyboard
i have just bought a logitech cordless wave uk keyboard and mouse and i m trying to get the keymapping sorted but not having much luck

1503
mouse	keyboard
i have tried hidpoint but i m using vmware to run ubuntu 10.04 and it didn t recognise the keyboard or mouse

1504
openbsd	linux
though the source can be compiled and run on linux which is what i do when i m not allowed to use openbsd

1522
freebsd	linux
other than that i think it s a mach micro-kernel with the freebsd network stack and the userland is like linux

1548
bash	zsh
i had the same problem with bash but now that i m actually taking the time to customise zsh i thought i d ask.

1560
bash	zsh
in zsh or bash 4 to gather all files into somedir

1562
bash	zsh
.e.d tab will expand to .emacs.d in zsh bash will just beep

1574
bash	zsh
here s a bash ksh zsh implementation

1574
bash	zsh
here s a bash ksh zsh implementation requiring shopt -s extglob under bash and setopt ksh_glob under zsh

1574
bash	zsh
and related constructs are in posix so they work in any non-antique bourne-style shell such as ash bash ksh or zsh

1601
toolchain	binutils
while you can get away with using -o3 and other optimizations knobs on most applications and it can result in speed improvements i would hesitate to use such tweaks the kernel itself or on the toolchain required for building it compiler binutils etc.

1625
bazaar	git
anyone starting now should use a proper distributed version control tool such as bazaar darcs git mercurial .

1648
folder	directory
list -- show the files folder in the directory

1648
folder	directory
search -- find a file folder in the directory by name

1648
folder	directory
the only other entry is group com.apple.sharepoint.group.3 allow search which allows directory services to search for files by name in the library folder

1650
kerberos	ldap
red hat has a project called freeipa that is producing an integrated ldap kerberos ntp and dns server setup that s easier to setup

1654
stdout	stderr
will force the output stdout of program to dev null and redirects stderr to stdout

1655
freebsd	linux
in a way the linux compatibility layer in freebsd comes close

1655
freebsd	linux
the two are not really merged but it is a fairly painless way to run linux applications without porting them to freebsd

1680
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind failed to start tool memcheck for platform arm-linux no such file or directory

1685
ethernet	wireless
i have one wireless network one desktop that for practical reasons has no connection to the wlan and one laptop with wireless and an ethernet port

1693
ubuntu	linux
i d like to use hylafax under ubuntu but i m a little shy to spend money on hardware for linux particularly a modem given the whole winmodem issue

1697
ubuntu	linux
i have several unistd.h files in my ubuntu linux

1715
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout in case the child is going to do output prior to exec

1737
sudo	passwd
for sudo you don t have to enter the root passwd but the passwd of the user who tries to invoke a sudo command

1738
sudo	passwd
the sudo command always asks for your passwd

1746
centos	linux
just curious as to why 8 numbers are accepted as a password in linux centos if it matters and not 8 characters on a non-dictionary word

1747
inherited	properties
it is not inherited properties of linux or unix and admin can easily change it

1750
debian	linux
i m running a gnu linux debian lenny with an 2.6.26-2-686 kernel

1787
sudo	passwd
the last problem to solve is the passwd prompt of sudo

1787
sudoers	passwd
to give your user the permission to invoke pmset without any passwd edit your etc sudoers with sudoedit

1792
freebsd	debian
for example for debian for freebsd etc

1825
unix	solaris
is there any tool in solaris unix so no gnu tool available to subtract dates

1855
freebsd	centos
this works for me on a hundred different systems running everything from freebsd 4.x darwin and centos 5

1860
stdout	stderr
you can use dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr as files to force a program to read or output into the standard-io descriptors

1869
ubuntu	linux
the system is an x86 system running ubuntu linux 9.10 jaunty

1899
jobs	cron
the down side is that it is basically just a collection of command line utilities and thus requires you to write cron jobs to manage the backups

1899
jobs	cron
deja dup this is a gui-centric solution that provides a lot of the same features as rdiff-backup but without the need for self-written cron jobs

1900
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian
examples of common distributions are debian ubuntu centos fedora arch-linux linux-mint rhel and opensuse

1902
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	unix	solaris
if your question is about a particular unix variant linux freebsd solaris â or a particular application use the corresponding tag

1907
stdout	stderr
2 1 is to redirect stderr to stdout as strace writes to stderr by default

1928
copying	overwrite
you can use ddrescue on the file rather than the partition to overwrite just the one sector by copying to a temporary file and then copying back again

1930
daemons	systemd
if you have a cron daemons one of the predefined cron time hooks is reboot which naturally runs when the systemd starts

1931
jobs	cron
local mail from cron jobs is normally delivered in this way

1939
bash	zsh
what features are in zsh and missing from bash or vice versa

1941
mutt	thunderbird
mail-user-agent reading composing and organizing mail in a mail user agent mua alpine kmail mutt thunderbird â

1941
qmail	exim
mail-transport-agent sending and delivering mail with a message transfer agent mta exim mail-command mail mail or mailx postfix qmail sendmail â

1948
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	solaris	netbsd	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
the most widely supported operating systems are the free opensource unix-like systems such as linux freebsd netbsd openbsd and solaris

1950
bash	zsh
what features are in zsh and missing from bash or vice versa

1992
jobs	cron
or even cron jobs

1998
kde	gnome
modern desktop environments like kde and gnome allow you to bookmark network shares and accessing them becomes a single click or menu selection

1999
stdout	stderr
one portability issue in your script is the use of to redirect both stdout and stderr

2000
daemons	systemd
on many systemd the at daemons is configured such that the batch command will run a command when the systemd drops below a certain load

2008
freebsd	linux
if you re looking for the date of the user s last login some systems provide it directly for example on linux or on freebsd

2018
filesystems	btrfs
for a filesystems solution you can look for some fs with copy on write attribute btrfs

2024
bash	zsh
for example in ksh bash or zsh the command

2024
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu usr bin rename is a perl script that moves files to a new name generated by a perl expression

2033
vim	emacs
all of my programming needs 99 are taken care of from within vim but for all those lisp libraries and routines i write i have to fire up emacs to get anything productive done

2047
opensuse	linux	opensuse	mint
i ve tried opensuse fedora mandriva linux mint puppy linux damn small linux and arch linux and i was thinking about giving bsd a try

2049
daemons	systemd
if you have a cron daemons one of the predefined cron time hooks is reboot which naturally runs when the systemd starts

2057
sysv	systemd
fedora gives you upstart and systemd to choose from and of course sysv compatibility

2076
google-chrome	firefox
i would suggest a gentoo installation with distributed compilation x11 firefox or google-chrome and e17

2121
ubuntu	debian
obviously ubuntu inherits from debian and as far as i know this policy is unchanged there

2126
sudo	passwd
when i try to sudo with a wrong passwd i would also have to wait before the shell says sorry try again

2129
ubuntu	linux
however i m using ubuntu and i don t want to switch to windows or use palm s horrible sync application through wine. is there a linux application i can use to easily copy my pictures from my phone to my computer

2138
mp3	flac
this will let you add music to your mp3 player like it s an external storage device and has great codec support such as oggvorbis flac and many others

2139
unix	bsd
if it says it works w mac os x data transfer only you can reasonably assume linux and unix bsd s etc. will also work

2147
bash	zsh
the q format specifier is available in most but not all shells ksh bash zsh

2153
ubuntu	debian
to create the chroot filesystem i like to deploy a directory with debian or any debian derivate like ubuntu using the debootstrap utility

2159
hash	md5
this function validate file md5 hash

2166
ubuntu	linux
here is a list of supported ubuntu printers multi-function printers you could also check out open printing to find a supported linux printer

2195
parallels	bootcamp
however i also have parallels installed to allow access to the bootcamp partition from within osx

2216
disk	ram
swap space is the area on a hard disk which is part of the virtual memory of your machine which is a combination of accessible physical memory ram and the swap space

2236
ubuntu	linux
you can install linux under a chroot ed environment from your existing ubuntu

2245
spaces	delimiter
if it is not guaranteed that there are spaces between the words you have to use some other character as delimiter to replace

2255
bash	zsh
what you ve asked for in general is called executing a readline command from bash the equivalent of or in zsh

2319
daemons	systemd
just a thought on my current systemd the daemons is listed as cups but

2334
mp3	wav	mp3	flv
from flv to music to wav to mp3

2343
minix	linux	irix	linux
oses that are similar to unix without actually complying with the sus are typically called unix-like which is sometimes abbreviated as un x or nix since the oses often have -ix or -nix suffixes linux minix irix etc.

2347
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
the general community lacks a good term for the class of product which we call unix linux bsd bsd solaris etc

2347
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	centos	centos	solaris
a centos administrator can perform many tasks on a solaris or freebsd system for example

2347
freebsd	solaris	unix	solaris
also many people have never heard of solaris or freebsd but they ve heard of unix

2374
hash	md5
md5 and blowfish are common examples for used hash functions

2374
hash	salt
to minimize the risk of such lookup tables its a common practice and the default behaviour in unix linux to add a so called salt to the password hash

2374
hash	salt
you hash your password add a random salt value to the hash and hash this new string again

2374
hash	salt
you need to save the new hash and the salt to be able to check if a entered value is the correct password

2375
hash	md5
modern hash functions used to encrypt passwords include md5 sha etc

2384
bash	zsh
i thinking about writing a more or less simple bash script to check the running processes and end them if zsh has no child processes and no activity for 4 hours

2384
post	get
how i get the last activity thought about a pre and post command in zsh

2396
disk	ram
if fits into the ram of the local machine and leaves enough room for running applications the basic idea would probably be to boot a minimal linux system on the target machine and then automatically create a ramfs virtual disk copy from remote into it and chroot into this new

2396
disk	ram
if ram is not sufficient you can basically follow the same procedure but not using ramfs but a real disk partition whose content you have to clear before copying

2414
folder	directory
you have someone who can only access your server over ftp and are confined to their home directory but you realise they they need access to some other directory not in their home folder

2415
ssd	sata
it wasn t and that hadn t been any problem accessing the internal sata ssd the box s primary drive

2415
ssd	sata
the ssd showed up under the pata controller because i think the bios was doing emulation or something. switching the bios to use ahci on the sata controller didn t make any difference other than that the ssd showed up under the sata controller instead and was listed as using the ahci driver as you d expect

2415
ubuntu	linux
intel doesn t seem to have any specific linux drivers for the board ubuntu or linux aren t even categories here for instance they just list that the chipset is supported native. but as they don t call out esata specifically that could mean anything

2427
ubuntu	linux
there is a lot of info on the thinkpad t400 linux certified sells a t400 with linux pre-installed your choice of ubuntu or fedora

2427
gentoo	linux
gentoo has a wiki for thinkpads and so does arch linux

2428
mouse	keyboard
i wanted to map my psone gamepad to do some basic kde keyboard mouse functions and everything works well except one thing

2429
ati	nvidia
possible exceptions are the graphics drivers look at the nvidia or ati websites for those and in rare cases the wifi drivers

2466
ramdisk	lvm
apparently it is using an initial ramdisk to do something i guess loading the lvm things before mounting root

2466
put	get
then i tried to put the whole thing under lvm and couldn t get the machine to boot i guess it cannot deal with the lvm stuff

2480
ubuntu	linux
is there a way to join a password protected wireless network via the command line in installations of ubuntu or arch linux with no desktop environment or any gui installed

2481
ubuntu	debian
if you use it from ubuntu or other debian based distributions it s fairly easy to set up and the process is rather simple check the debian wiki for a few pointers

2485
filesystems	xfs
i would prefer xfs since i have very good experiences with this filesystems

2488
disk	ram
disable initrd from the kernel general setup initial ram filesystems and ram disk initramfs initrd support a.k.a

2512
processors	hyperthreading
if i enable hyperthreading for my netbook which has an intel atom 1.6 ghz will the kernel see two virtual 800 mhz processors

2528
gentoo	linux
either gentoo stage ii or linux from scratch.

2529
solaris	bsd
if you have linux bsd solaris or macâ osâ x locally you can probably use a fuse filesystem to make the web server space appear as a local filesystem â sshfs should work since you seem to have ssh access

2534
filesystems	xfs
i also notice that when i compile filesystems support as modules reiserfs jfs xfs etc. they also get autoloaded

2543
freebsd	solaris
on solaris and freebsd theres also elfdump available

2550
ubuntu	debian
while it was created for ubuntu server i believe that that it is also available in debian

2554
mouse	keyboard
to not only share a mouse keyboard clipboard between the computers but to share an x session

2558
cat	tee
for a single file instead of using sftp you could pipe the file over ssh using cat or pv at the sending side and using tee on the middle server to both send the data to a file there and send a copy over the another ssh link the other side of which just writes the data to a file

2566
filesystems	btrfs
you could recreate your current setup by creating a btrfs filesystems and loading it with the earliest revision that you need and taking a snapshot and then revving the repository forward to each point in time that you need a snapshot of and taking a snapshot at each step

2588
bash	zsh
if that matters i am using bash but will be switching to zsh soon

2596
vmware	virtualbox
this does require a virtualization system that can bind a disk partition inside a vm which i think vmware can do but not virtualbox

2596
ubuntu	linux
an alternative method is to clone the system partition to a virtual machine disk. added you might want to investigate andlinux which is a port of ubuntu to colinux a linux port running on top of windows

2598
bash	zsh
with zsh or bash 4 this is a lot simpler

2599
centos	linux
centos 5.5 linux 2.6.18-53.el5

2601
mouse	keyboard
the only thing that i have on usb is the keyboard and mouse

2618
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu debian

2632
ubuntu	debian
i cannot build elvis 2.2 on unbuntu maverick for different defects than you report in guix11 and the latest debian ubuntu repositories carry no gnome version of elvis only x11

2640
bash	zsh
once a friend of mine who is an experienced unix linux user told me that setting root s shell to something other than sh i.e bash or zsh might create problems because some script might assume that the shell is sh and do something weird

2640
gentoo	ubuntu
however i think ubuntu have default root shell set to bash and gentoo uses bash too

2641
bash	zsh
scripts written for the bourne shell will most of the time run against bash or zsh or foo without any problems

2655
bash	zsh
i used zsh for some time but then went back to bash

2667
disk	ram
also it is recommended that the swap space is twice the amount of physical memory ram depending upon the amount of hard disk

2672
width	height
currently i take a screenshot and measure the resulting s width height attributes

2674
vim	emacs
please don t offer vim with no gui or x emacs with ugly gui

2674
vim	emacs
there vere many good suggestions i am going to experiment with scite and try learning emacs and vim when i ll have a proper mood

2674
kate	kde	kate	gnome	kde	gnome
and a pleasant surprise there kate does not depend on tons of kde libraries as i used to suppose - in classic gnome ubuntu 10.10 apt-get install kate has only downloaded one humble less than a mib package

2676
geany	scite
i don t know about all of your requirements but two projects you should check out and try is geany and scite

2683
debian	linux
ideally the solution would work for any linux distro but i will most likely be running this on debian variants

2685
disk	ram
performance is increased because sometimes ram is better used for disk cache than to store program memory

2695
gentoo	linux
if space isn t your aim i ll suggest gentoo or arch linux they both install a base system

2710
jobs	cron
due to some bad cron jobs i now have 1600 mail messages most of them containing the same error log

2721
kde	gnome
i have installed the rdesktop rpm however no entry appears to be made in the gnome or kde menus for it

2721
kde	gnome
is it one location shared for both gnome and kde installations or are they in separate places

2726
bash	zsh
as usual handling the case where the pattern doesn t match is a bit of a pain except in bash and zsh where you can turn on the nullglob option

2727
kde	gnome
according to the freedesktop specification which both gnome and kde support the recommended filesystem locations for placing .desktop files are

2730
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading i guess that you have 4 core intel ix with hyperthreading unless you have dual processors machine

2734
debian	linux
for learning linux i would a live debian somewhere

2737
rpm	yum
whenever i tried installing any software using rpm file by double clicking file many times it stuck and when i reinvoke that from terminal it says yum is already locked and some other installation process is already running and i always have to force quit that process

2739
vim	emacs
the two most common suggestions you will hear are vim and emacs

2752
antivirus	mcafee
there is linux antivirus software from mcafee but no linux user i know uses such software

2763
anjuta	gnome
anjuta - gnome ide

2780
unix	bsd
so the real question is not can linux unix bsd contract computer viruses

2785
kde	gnome
this one works great on windows but can be applied to kde or gnome as well

2788
ubuntu	debian	debian-based	ubuntu
on debian and debian-based distributions ubuntu you can search package descriptions with apt-cache search or aptitude search on the command line or through the search facility in interactive package managers such as aptitude and synaptic

2788
redhat	fedora
on redhat and other distributions using yum centos fedora you can search package descriptions with yum search on the command line

2788
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	debian
example distributions with a large package database are debian fedora freebsd ubuntu

2790
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to set up xdmx on my macbook pro and my ubuntu 10.04 workstation so that i can share my mbp s keyboard and mouse as well as x applications running on the workstation across the laptop display a laptop attached monitor and the workstation s monitor

2792
google-chrome	firefox
it does firefox google-chrome and others so it is multiplatform and it syncs the vault automatically across the computers where you are logged in to the vault with the master password

2797
ubuntu	linux
i d like to see a list of all the linux distros by their mission like generic firewall mail server free-only enterprise virtual machines host virtual machine guest audio production etc. with basic description and analytics like first release date package management system development activity people behind the distro like core team size or for example canonical corporation for ubuntu release cycle description popularity etc.

2805
mouse	keyboard
your folders or mouse or keyboard .

2824
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout

2824
stdout	stderr
redirect both stderr and stdout to the same file

2835
google-chrome	firefox
if you can give me any help at all getting java plugins to work in either google-chrome or firefox i d be most gracious

2842
debian	linux
will the following components work fine with debian linux

2843
ubuntu	debian
that means they might not work while more up-to-date distributions like ubuntu 10.4 lts server edition or unreleased debian versions like sid may work better

2852
debian	linux
debian is a community-driven linux distribution with a very large number of packages and many supported architectures

2852
debian	linux
in addition to debian gnu linux there are projects for bsd-based versions of debian and debian gnu hurd

2852
ubuntu	debian
differences between debian and ubuntu

2852
ubuntu	debian
advantages of debian over ubuntu

2852
freebsd	debian
why should i use debian 6 with freebsd kernel

2853
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
if you are using a derivative of debian mint ubuntu kali etc then use that distributionâ s tag instead

2866
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
some package managers have a way to list all installed packages debian ubuntu have dpkg --list gentoo has etc world etc. so you can just

2877
kubuntu	gnome	kde	gnome	kde	kubuntu
i know there are all sorts of tutorials of installing gnome icons and various peicewise fixes but is there a way to find out exactly how kubuntu sets up kde so i can just duplicate that

2879
sudoers	passwd
difficult part is that the script should not ask for a passwd and i don t want to use the sudoers file

2892
daemons	systemd
the default configuration of the most systemd is a syslog daemons listening to local messages

2907
kde	gnome
that s what layout switchers such as gnome s and kde s do

2910
openbsd	netbsd
a few unix systems mainly openbsd netbsd and macâ osâ x all of which require a kernel setting to be enabled implement secure setuid shebang using an additional feature the path dev fd n refers to the file already opened on file descriptor n so opening dev fd n is roughly equivalent to dup n

2926
subtraction	addition
there are cases where command line + and - are definitely meant to indicate a subtraction or addition of something like

2941
cpu	processors
your problem has nothing to do with processors time scheduling which is about sharing cpu time between concurrent applications

2941
jobs	cron
i think it s the primary meaning of the word in the windows world â œscheduled tasksâ but it s not used as much in the unix world where â œschedulingâ out of context refers to cpu scheduling as in my first bullet point above and people tend to speak of cron jobs

2947
kde	gnome
one thing that helped a lot in synchronizing the look of gtk applications with kde was to install qtcurve a theme that works for both qt kde and gtk gnome apps

2958
sudo	passwd
## uncomment to allow any user to run sudo if they know the passwd

2968
postgresql	mysql
if you would really like to store your system logs in a relational database which can have many advantages check out rsyslog the up and coming replacement for syslog which can write system logs to a mysql postgresql or oracle database

2990
debian	linux
the first time i installed gnu linux on my desktop i installed debian no help i only installed the basic system no gui

2990
debian	linux
but then i remembered how to install packages first time in gnu linux only a output and only read some things from debian and the name of an irc client irssi and the name gnome and then i installed them.

2998
ubuntu	linux
i currently use this for time machine backups for my mac but i d also like to use it as a backup location for my linux box which is running ubuntu server

3002
cifs	smb
according to the manual the mybook supports both the cifs smb and the nfs protocols

3002
cifs	smb
cifs smb is the protocol natively used by windows for accessing network drives

3002
folder	directory
you should be able to access the mybook on a linux unix system by using the smbclient or mount.cifs to access mount the public folder on mybook on the local directory mnt you would issue from a root terminal

3015
ubuntu	linux
the only exposure i ve had to linux is just some basic dabbling with ubuntu and using knoppix as a recovery dvd for when things go wrong

3018
filesystems	hfs+
when i plugged the external hd of the mac hfs+ filesystems in ubuntu i noticed that the owner was

3022
kde	gnome
now is it possible that i remove gnome and kde altogether and use some window manager only in run level 5 x11 to play videos use browser and occasionally file manager like nautilus

3022
kde	gnome
when i rebooted i was offered one more choice at the time of login - gnome kde window maker

3032
apache	nginx
specify path to any log file apache ssh nginx mail server ...

3041
folder	directory
fdupes -r path to folder gives you a list of duplicates in the directory -r makes it recursive

3064
sudo	passwd
put sudo in front of the command and enter your passwd when prompted

3064
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
this is the preferred method on most systems including ubuntu linux mint arguably debian and others

3064
sudo	passwd
sudo requires that you type your own passwd

3064
sudoers	visudo
use sudo visudo to edit the sudoers file

3064
sudo	passwd
and enter your passwd if authorized to run sudo

3064
sudo	passwd
and enter your passwd if authorized to run sudo

3069
ubuntu	debian
at least in debian and ubuntu you can install the trash-cli package

3071
kde	gnome
the correct way is to use kdesudo in kde for running gui programs as root or gksu in gnome

3074
bash	zsh
with modern shells at least bash and zsh and copy-and-paste history expansion is not as useful as it used to be â it s still helpful but you can get by without it

3075
gentoo	ubuntu
i have gentoo and ubuntu both with grub2

3075
gentoo	ubuntu
gentoo has a dedicated boot partition while ubuntu does not

3075
gentoo	ubuntu
i have a menuentry in gentoo s etc grub.d 40_custom to boot ubuntu and ubuntu does boot ok

3075
gentoo	ubuntu
dev sda1 is boot of gentoo gentoo is in dev sda2 ubuntu is in dev sda4

3084
gentoo	ubuntu
you should boot into gentoo then chroot into the ubuntu partition

3085
zsh	tcsh
zsh runs .zprofile instead and csh and tcsh run .login

3108
ubuntu	linux
i ve 2 linux computers one redhat client and one ubuntu set up with shared internet connection as described here

3117
freebsd	linux
i m mostly a linux and freebsd user and this is the sort of thing i would expect to find after an install

3125
debian	linux
i am building a linux kernel via the debian linux-2.6 source package

3134
gedit	nano
and gedit log.txt or a terminal editor like nano

3140
kde	gnome
i would love a way an easy way to make sure gnome only shows gnome related icons and kde only shows kde related icons

3140
kde	gnome
of course you can manually hide all the kde icons from the gnome menu but that sucks so i d rather not go that way

3141
kde	gnome
there you can specify if the icon shall be only shown in gnome only in kde or in both with a onlyshowin kde line

3141
kde	gnome
to hide gnome-apps in kde echo â œonlyshowin gnomeâ into the gnome .desktop-files

3149
installation	upgrade
since then i decided not to use pre-upgrade or upgrade an existing installation option

3151
disk	ram
since ram is the fastest storage device available it is a waste to let unused pages be inactive so the kernel recycles unused pages to cache data that has been fetched from the disk and could be needed again shortly

3151
disk	ram
in addition to speed up i o operations part of the ram will be used to buffer data that is being written to the disk you might have noticed that when you copy a large file to a slow disk an usb stick the cp command finishes before the data is fully written to the device this happens precisely because the kernel is holding some data in free memory to speed up the slow write operation

3153
versioning	upgrade
with the latest versioning and the newer upgrade processes with dnf and the system-upgrade plugin this isn t as much of an issue really

3161
mouse	keyboard
this fade out is very slow and can t be cancelled by mouse movements keyboard presses etc

3167
disk	ram
it has to be equal to the ram size so that you can use suspend to disk features and then + 10 for good measure

3184
kde	gnome
and i couldn t do that due to some missing gnome dependency i run kde

3202
unix	bsd
thus in the early 1980s the berkeley software distribution or bsd became a free variant of unix

3202
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian	slackware	suse
these distributions slackware debian red hat suse gentoo ubuntu etc. are what people generally refer to when they say â œlinuxâ

3202
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	aix	netbsd	aix	solaris	bsd	solaris	netbsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	aix
other currently existing unices include the various forks of bsd you get a choice of freebsd netbsd and openbsd all being free open and developed through the net as well as a disminishing number of commercial variants targeted towards servers and aix hp-ux solaris and a few very minor contenders

3217
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
there is an environment variable shlvl which all major interactive shells bash tcsh zsh increment by 1 when they start

3249
versioning	upgrade
while ubuntu for many packages only releases new versioning upgrade with its half-yearly major update fedora more often adds new versioning as updates to the current distribution incarnation

3258
freebsd	linux
unix and linux - stack exchange is for users of linux freebsd and other un x-like operating systems

3261
ubuntu	linux
i m new to ubuntu but have been using linux on servers for a few years

3261
mouse	keyboard
the only things that i have in usb are a keyboard and mouse

3266
bash	zsh
you can use bash with iterm instead of terminal and you can use zsh instead of bash inside a terminal window

3266
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
you might look at macports homebrew or fink for ways to install recent versions of bash and other shells on mac os x

3273
notepad++	scite
notepad++ a windows scite scintilla based text-editor allowed me to create a custom language and now in linux i want to reproduce the same thing

3273
notepad++	scite
i assume this is a feature of scite scintilla and not of notepad++

3280
ubuntu	linux
this useful tool can be viewed as a more generalized wubi taking you from what you have running now to anything from damn small linux to ubuntu

3287
ubuntu	debian
if you have the perl rename because you re on debian or ubuntu it is the simplest way of skinning this particular cat as in an individual cat â there are plenty of tools for mass renaming and searching the archives of this site and super user should find all the major ones

3288
bash	zsh
if you have a bash completion function for doctrine you might be able to get zsh to read it by including autoload bashcompinit

3288
bash	zsh
see switching from bash on the zsh wiki

3288
punctuation	words
for example include bindkey x _bash_complete-word in your .zshrc and press ctrl + x to complete a file name in any context you might need to temporarily insert a space before the file name if the file name is preceded by punctuation that is not a words separator in the shell

3293
switching	screens
to do it locally you need to switching ttys for each of the two sets of commands or use something like screens

3305
cpu	processors
the processors is intel centrino core 2 duo cpu t6500 2.10 ghz

3321
bash	tcsh
there are two basic flavors of shell sh bash and csh tcsh

3326
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	ash	tcsh
the two main branches of shells are the bourne shell derivatives sh bash ksh ash yash and zsh and the csh derivatives tcsh and...uhm...tcsh

3350
bsd	xnu
darwin directs negative syscall numbers at the mach microkernel and positive syscall numbers at the bsd monolithic kernel â â see xnu osfmk mach syscall_sw.h and xnu bsd kern syscalls.master

3350
freebsd	linux	eglibc	uclibc	bionic	glibc	bionic	libc
darwin mostly inherits freebsd s libc while linux typically uses glibc but there are alternatives like eglibc and dietlibc and uclibc and bionic

3375
x86	64bit
from wikipedia â œin 2004 the initial 32-bit x86 instruction set of the pentium 4 microprocessors was extended by the 64bit x86-64 set.â

3376
debian	centos
i m porting a debian init.d script to centos

3385
unix	bsd
at t wasn t really in the unix business so at this time the very basic os was adopted somewhat by berkelely and they made some changes into bsd unix

3385
bash	zsh
if i were to pick a shell i d pick bash or zsh

3385
bash	zsh
bash is possibly in a few more places than zsh

3385
bash	zsh
zsh is more powerful but bash has been fine for me

3385
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
bourne shell style sh ksh bash zsh to or from csh style csh tcsh will be hard

3385
bash	zsh
going from old to newer bin sh bash bin ksh zsh will be easier than the other way

3388
bash	zsh
using bash 4 or zsh

3390
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
for interactive use there are two main contenders bash and zsh plus the straggler tcsh and the newcomer fish

3390
bash	zsh
zsh has almost every feature of bash and many more useful

3390
bash	zsh
what features are in zsh and missing from bash or vice versa

3390
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
zsh caught up with tcsh and fairly quickly improved further and bash caught up with programmable completion in the early 2000s while tcsh has barely made any progress in the past 15 years

3390
fish	zsh
the fish community is a lot smaller than even zsh s making the effects even more acute

3390
fish	zsh
see also what are the differences between fish and zsh

3390
bash	zsh
zsh has most of ksh93 and bash s useful features

3397
sudoers	visudo
make the following addition to the sudoers file using visudo

3397
folder	directory
this should allow anybody in the cdrom group to mount a file ending in .iso as type iso9660 on a directory inside the media folder and also unmount anything in the media folder

3412
ubuntu	linux
you should try starting with friendly linux distributions like ubuntu or pclinuxos

3426
vmware	virtualbox
and once you re somewhat starting to get familiar with the gui a bit of the commandline and you want to learn about linux unix servers you can run them in a virtual machine kvm qemu virtualbox vmware ... and ssh to them

3436
daemons	systemd
chroot has a limited scope of use and i don t think it would be much of use in a desktop environment it can be used to separate daemons from access of whole systemd - like dns daemons

3445
bash	zsh
this gives you the opportunity to share common settings and still use bash respectively zsh specific settings and syntax in etc profile respectively zprofile

3449
bash	zsh
zsh has an sh compatibility mode which will let it execute posix sh code and some bash extensions

3449
bash	zsh
as long as you don t use bash features that zsh doesn t have with the same syntax you can have the same file sourced by both shells

3450
put	get
you can put at the end of .profile so that you get your favorite interactive shell in console or ssh sessions but make sure that you don t do it from shells that are not interactive for example some linux distributions have x session scripts that start with #

3452
bash	zsh
some distributions ship a statically linked version of bash or zsh or sash a shell with many standard utilities built-in

3456
bash	zsh
bin bash because they use bashisms and other behavior that won t work on zsh or dash

3474
ubuntu	linux
if you want to learn linux which i encourage install a user-friendly distribution ubuntu maybe

3488
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
2 virtualization vmware or vmware workstation parallels desktop oracle virtualbox

3511
ubuntu	centos
redhat centos and ubuntu both provide packages to verify the contents of a package

3514
stdout	stderr
but what if we do not want to redirect stderr to stdout

3515
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i ve been using linux ubuntu for a couple of months now and i want to try debian to see how different it is

3516
ubuntu	debian
just installing cd-1 will limit what software you can install during the installation process but after installing with the first cd other software can be downloaded from the debian repositories just as with ubuntu

3521
stdout	stderr
however i believe that this is purely a syntax shortcut you are still redirecting stderr to stdout

3524
ubuntu	debian
first keep in mind that distributions like debian ubuntu etc. use cryptographically signed packages starting with a trusted install medium the public key crypto assures that the packages from the official repositories are not modified on the way to your computer

3532
vim	emacs
but there s actually a very basic difference in vim commands vs emacs commands

3532
bash	zsh
so emacs has an advantage that a lot of other things bash gnuplot zsh ksh some others i can t think of off the top of my head all end up implementing emacs-style line editing

3536
stdout	stderr
normally stdout and stderr are both printed to your screen

3536
stdout	stderr
to hide stdout but still print stderr do this

3536
hide	show	stdout	stderr
the following bash syntax will hide output to stdout but will still show stderr

3536
stdout	stderr
first we pipe stdout to dev null then we convert stderr to stdout because unix pipes will only operate on stdout

3536
stdout	stderr
this prints one line to stdout and one line to stderr

3540
stdout	stderr
so you can temporarily divert stdout to fd 3 and stderr to stdout and later put fd 3 back onto stdout

3540
stdout	stderr
if stuff produces some output on stdout and some output on stderr and you want to apply filter on the error output leaving the standard output untouched you can use

3541
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu uses etc init.d to store sysvinit scripts because ubuntu is based on debian and that s what debian uses

3590
bash	zsh
bash runs before displaying a prompt and zsh executes the precmd function

3602
redhat	fedora
i m a little confused about rpm s in redhat and or fedora and or other distros

3603
ubuntu	debian
the problem is less bad if both distributions are related or even based upon one another ubuntu for example is based on debian and therefore shares many of the naming conventions and packages so you can othen transfer a package build for debian to a ubuntu box

3604
redhat	fedora
obviously though a fedora package is unlikely to work on redhat because the library versions are so different and the linking would be off

3616
debhelper	aptitude
install the build dependencies here debhelper and php5-dev with apt-get or aptitude

3617
daemons	systemd
if i run the daemons manually when the systemd is running everything works fine

3628
gentoo	linux
i have gentoo linux the awesome window manager and an open-source ati driver

3639
filesystems	ntfs
while linux and grub don t care about partition types except for â œcontainerâ partitions such as extended partitions it is unusual to have a linux filesystems on a partition with type 7 which fdisk describes as hpfs ntfs

3639
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
grub1 supports the filesystems commonly used by linux ext2 and later versions reiserfs xfs jfs but unless you have a recent patch btrfs

3647
bash	zsh
i ve found that the following works in the four shells i have installed on my system bash dash zsh csh

3647
bash	zsh
the following works on zsh bash and dash but not on csh

3656
bash	zsh
you can make your bash prompt look different so that it s easily spotted or use zsh and make your prompt look something like this

3658
stdout	stderr
appart from 1 and 2 which are stdout and stderr what is the meaning and general use of those other numbers

3667
freebsd	linux
i also recommend an alternative system like freebsd you ll get a different perspective and have access to some neat features not available for linux dtrace zfs

3687
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
it s what ubuntu and linux mint are based on and those 2 are the most popular unix-like systems out there

3689
installation	upgrade
you seem to have had the bad luck that the power loss in the middle of the upgrade made your linux installation unusable or at least not easily usable but that doesn t mean it s not recoverable

3689
ubuntu	linux
the easiest way to recover would be to boot from a live cd or usb disk preferably from ubuntu 10.04 though any recent enough linux should work

3695
folder	directory
i understand that the boot img systemname folder will store the image for a specific system which may use various or the same versions of linux kernels stored in the boot kernel directory at least that s how i d like to set it up

3695
subtract	add
to add or subtract oses i would like only to have to copy the appropriate files to a boot img systemname and a boot kernel folder as appropriate and then edit the menu.lst file

3696
ubuntu	linux
the goal of the ubuntu project is to provide a free computer environment centered on a linux distribution and complemented by online services

3696
kde	kubuntu
the supported core also includes other desktop environments such as kde although their integration is managed by side projects such as kubuntu

3696
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu offers a large amount of packages directly taken from debian s unstable distribution in the form of the universe repository

3696
kde	kubuntu
kubuntu managing the integration of kde into ubuntu

3696
ubuntu	debian
differences between debian and ubuntu

3696
ubuntu	debian
advantages of debian over ubuntu

3696
ubuntu	centos
what makes centos enterprisey compared to generic distributions like ubuntu

3696
ubuntu	debian
migrating from ubuntu to debian

3697
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is a linux distribution with an emphasis on ease of use and installation

3717
freebsd	linux
with some versions of find on recent enough linux freebsd or macâ osâ x you can easily look for symbolic links whose target is target

3718
ubuntu	linux	kde	gnome
common sound frameworks include oss older linux kernel interface alsa newer linux kernel interface pulseaudio the default on ubuntu supported by more and more programs arts mostly used by older versions of kde esound esd older versions of gnome and many older programs jack supported directly only by a few high-end applications and more

3718
ubuntu	openbsd
your operating system ubuntu 10.04 openbsd 4.7 â

3726
stdout	stderr
the following cronjob will send stdout to dev null and will then handle stderr via the pipeline

3729
fish	zsh
i ve never heard of such a feature with typical shells zsh fish or otherwise in typical terminal emulators

3730
redhat	fedora
i follow various bugs on redhat bugzilla and i just received a notification from the fedora update system that a new package was available for testing that supposedly fixes a bug i was interested in

3750
installation	upgrade
integration with the package manager run automatically before and after installation handle upgrade intelligently

3753
postgresql	mysql
for production use you should use either the postgresql or mysql version

3753
ubuntu	debian
configuring a basic setup of bacula is fairly simple using the files installed by the debian ubuntu packaging

3755
filesystems	ntfs
a ntfs driver will not help in your situation as you will not be mounting the raw filesystems in linux

3765
versioning	upgrade
with apt as far as i know i can only say apt-get upgrade and if apt fails to find the new versioning or fails to resolve the dependencies for the new versioning it will silently decide not to install it

3766
filesystems	xfs
i solved it by using xfs as the filesystems

3769
kde	gnome
see also juri linkov jurta s no blinking page for how to turn off blinking in lesstif tk gtk gnome qt kde firefox and more

3799
kate	kde
that works with kate 2.5.10 using kde 3.5.10 on debian

3811
bash	zsh
for bourne-type shells bash zsh ksh etc. you write see this page for more information

3814
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i ve been trying to install a few windows games with wine on linux mint 10 based on ubuntu 10.10 but i am finding that my cd-rom mount points aren t standard

3822
chmod	mkdir
the bin directory is supposed to be reserved for programs which are required for running the system things like chmod mkdir etc

3830
ubuntu	linux
linux current ubuntu

3832
freebsd	netbsd
freebsd and netbsd have at least partial native implementations of zfs

3834

if it s an x86 machine why not just use apt dpkg

3889
ubuntu	debian
i m running debian as host and i fail to get debian ubuntu and fedora guests to be fullscreen

3890
ubuntu	debian
specifically on the debian ubuntu guest run the following as root

3895
debian	linux
debian gnu linux device driver check page tells you what hardware on your system is supported by the kernel and by which versions

3910
ubuntu	debian
can any one of the major distributions like fedora debian ubuntu be stripped down so much

3939
stdout	stderr
the connection to the terminal is that the standard streams stdin stdout and stderr of the application are connected to the terminal

3939
stdout	stderr
typical gui applications don t use stdin or stdout but they might emit error messages to stderr

3958
ftp	smb
krusader offers a choice of ftp smb fish and sftp connection protocols and both fish and sftp work with an ssh server

3966
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu

3969
ubuntu	debian
for debian and derivatives such as ubuntu run this as root

3985
gentoo	ubuntu
the upstart equivalent would to change exec sbin getty -8 38400 tty1 to exec sbin mingetty tty1 in etc init tty1.conf these are ubuntu paths you may need some adjustments for gentoo

3986
centos	linux
such as centos and scientific linux

3987
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian have minimal installs if you want to go that route

3994
mouse	keyboard
i ve tried xmacrorec and xmacroplay but after running them my mouse and keyboard does not respond properly the left mouse button gets stuck in a clicked state and i have to restart x

4009
uptime	reboot
after 2-3 days uptime the space ends and i must reboot

4009
google-chrome	firefox
mostly i use firefox google-chrome gedit rhythmbox and in background httpd mysqld conky

4024
bash	zsh
ksh and zsh but i think not bash have a form of function autoloading

4033
jobs	cron
similarly chkconfig to files in etc init.d cron jobs in etc cron.d

4067
post	get
if you post an example of what you re getting and manually edit together an example of what you d like as a result we might be able to get a little closer to that

4071
ati	nvidia
download the latest driver for you video card from the vendor s site if it s nvidia or ati amd otherwise look for supported opengl extensions in your current drivers

4073
sudo	passwd
contrariwise sudo does the right thing by asking your passwd by opening dev tty directly

4085
solaris	bsd
it requires an os that supports fuse but most unices linux macâ osâ x bsd solaris â do these days

4091
unix	bsd	unix	aix	bsd	aix
so there are lots of different versions of unix out there hp-ux aix bsd etc

4097
solaris	aix
various companies sold and still sell code derived from this original system for example aix hp-ux solaris

4097
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
there are many bsd-based or bsd-derived operating systems freebsd netbsd openbsd macâ osâ x etc

4097
minix	linux
other examples include osf 1 now discontinued it was a commercial unix-like non-unix-based system minix originally a toy unix-like operating system used as a teaching tool now a production embedded unix-like system and most famously linux

4113
ubuntu	debian
my switch from debian to ubuntu started the day i tried to delete some files and directories meaning to type

4118
switching	screens
use named tabs in screens i can give each tab in screens a name allowing me to instantly know where to switching to

4121
vim	emacs
if the job is only going to happen once you might consider using a macro in vim or emacs

4123
next	except
here s an awk script that duplicates all class â end blocks no balancing supported each class matches the next end except that foo lines are omitted from the second copy

4129
xfce	gnome
did you directly install xfce or did you start with something like ubuntu which installed gnome by default then switch over to it

4131
bash	tcsh
last but not the least a shell is a special program that interacts with a user through a controlling tty and offers to the user the way of launching other programs bash csh tcsh

4132
mouse	keyboard
for example an x terminal is a kind of thin client a special-purpose computer whose only purpose is to drive a keyboard display mouse and occasionally other human interaction peripherals with the actual applications running on another more powerful computer

4132
freebsd	linux
on some systems such as linux and freebsd the console appears as several ttys special key combinations switch between these ttys

4132
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
popular shells for interactive use include bash the default on most linux installations zsh which emphasizes power and customizability and fish which emphasizes simplicity

4134
disk	ram
first consider that some of the ram is used for disk caches

4144
filesystems	ntfs
the usb disk has vfat or ntfs filesystems

4145
filesystems	ntfs
vfat and ntfs filesystems don t contain any information to represent your unix file permissions

4145
umask	mount
this is called umask and supported by the mount command

4168
opensolaris	bsd
for example gnu linux and zfs or ntfs-3g on many oses like opensolaris and bsd

4174
vmware	virtualbox
there are several virtualization technologies that allow running openbsd amd64 and openbsd i386 on the same machine xen vmware and virtualbox should support openbsd amd64 guests with a 64-bit hypervisor or host os

4175
redhat	fedora
back when redhat was a distribution before the days of rhel fedora and fedora core people would sometimes find themselves in rpm hell or dependency hell

4189
unix	bsd
this has morphed since the early implementations of unix to linux and bsd but the convention has stayed

4195
stdout	stderr
if i wanted to redirect both stdout and stderr to that file then i d do

4195
stdout	stderr
but what if you want the output to go to the file and yet still go to stdout stderr

4226
debian	centos
i had to write my own centos init.d script for celery because it only ships with one for debian

4236
kde	gnome
gnome and kde show a menu constructed from entries in and following the freedesktop menu specification

4257
gentoo	centos
there s a yum plugin to handle this kind of thing for centos and gentoo currently has a security mailing list portage is currently being modified to support security-only updates

4257
freebsd	netbsd
freebsd and netbsd both provide ways to do security audits of installed ports packages which integrate well with the built-in update mechanisms

4257
ubuntu	debian
all told debian s approach and probably ubuntu s since they re so closely related is one of the slicker solutions to this problem

4261
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
some example websites are - ovi s sign in page although share.ovi.com loads fine and nokia.com loads fine live mail works on google-chrome ium and opera but not on firefox both 3.6 and 4 mozilla addons website and other random websites

4268
qt-creator	kdevelop
qt-creator is great kdevelop netbeans

4286
g++	gcc
i have a rhel 6 machine which came with gcc but without g++

4293
versioning	upgrade
your system is not up-to-date with 10.04 which was released with versioning 2.11.1-0ubuntu7 of the libc-bin package now superseded by 2.11.1-0ubuntu7.5 due to a security upgrade and and versioning 2.11+git20100304-3 of the locales package

4293
versioning	upgrade
installing the postfix package required an upgrade of locales but the new versioning of locales is incompatible with the versioning of libc-bin you now have

4295
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
see for example the gnu accounting utilities manual the entry in the freebsd handbook or the linux howto or the solaris guide

4295
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	solaris	netbsd
on solaris freebsd netbsd and macâ osâ x there is dtrace there s a linux port in progress but i don t know if it s reached a usable stage

4303
ethernet	wireless
you don t make it clear whether you are trying to extend an existing wireless network to include devices on your ethernet device or whether you are trying to create a new subnet and use nat to hide this from the wireless router

4319
mtu	pppoe
furthermore pppoe is the number one bringer of mtu problem for home users

4319
ubuntu	debian
permanently debian and derivatives such as ubuntu if not using network manager

4319
ubuntu	debian
permanently debian and derivatives such as ubuntu with or without network manager

4326
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loop to loops over the files you want to modify

4329
ubuntu	debian
under ubuntu or debian it is simply

4332
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
no kde and xfce apps in menu during ubuntu gnome session

4332
xfce	kde
similarly in kde and xfce sessions.

4332
kde	gnome
i googled and found this and other solutions in forums but these address only the kde on gnome scenario

4333
bash	zsh
double parentheses also work in bash and zsh

4334
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
unfortunately as far as i know the way xfce stores it s .desktop files is the same as the gnome stores them whereas kde stores them in a separate folder within usr share applications

4334
kde	gnome
this is why the separation of kde gnome as described in the post you link to is much easier to do en-mass

4334
xfce	gnome
there is no simple way to separate xfce apps from gnome especially since it s often a matter of opinion what you want to see

4334
kde	gnome
this also goes for kde since as long as you have the kde libraries dolphin or konqueror will run in gnome

4337
sudo	passwd
and sudo tee etc passwd will overwrite etc passwd you d need for that noclobber setting to also be applied to the sh started by sudo

4363
bash	zsh
all use syntax specific to bash ksh and zsh

4385
bash	zsh
with zsh or with bash â 4 if you put shopt -s globstar in your .bashrc you can use to recurse into subdirectories

4386
rar	zip
it is a very good script that use zip unzip tar rar etc

4390
sudo	passwd
here are some instructions on how to disable your sudo passwd

4390
sudo	passwd
if you disable the sudo passwd for your account you will seriously compromise the security of your computer

4392
sudo	passwd
i think that passwd for sudo could protect you only from two things

4406
sudoers	visudo
the command visudo as root will give you access to edit the sudoers file often etc sudoers

4407
filesystems	fat
linux can also mount several filesystems with which there is no notion of superblock and or inode the most common being fat

4409
sudoers	visudo
adding in the sudoers file will cause visudo to use the specified editor for changes

4440
filesystems	fat
the filesystems is fat here s the mtab entry

4458
sudoers	visudo
if you are using fedora 14 or earlier use visudo to edit the sudoers file removing the # from this line

4469
mouse	keyboard
i am an avid keyboard user but i still need the mouse every now and then

4469
mouse	keyboard
to minimize the hand travel i have the mouse located below my keyboard

4475
pop-up	dialog
in fact my previous install would pop-up an x11 dialog asking for my ssh private key password if i needed to unlock it

4477
mouse	keyboard
in this example we will be disabling mouse by keyboard shortcut and enable it by pressing left + right mouse button

4477
mouse	keyboard
in this part most interesting for use are names and handlers of keyboard and mouse devices

4477
mouse	keyboard
first we handle turning off mouse by keyboard shortcut so we need to discover key ids

4493
ubuntu	linux
prior to using arch linux i used to use ubuntu as the linux distro on the laptop and that had the same results as windows

4495
freebsd	linux
i use bash on freebsd linux os x and cygwin on windows

4510
versioning	upgrade
but the most important take home in my opinion is that to use pg_upgrade you have to have 2 versioning of postgres installed side by side as such i filed a bug with arch to build it into the package upgrade process

4511
x86	64bit
my target is x86 64bit processor

4524
x86	64bit
all amd64 64bit x64 processors can run 32-bit x86 binaries

4524
x86	64bit
as an example ubuntu 10.04 on x86 comes with a â œmultilibâ version of gcc and an amd64 backend plus a small set of 64bit development packages libc6-dev-amd64 install libc6-dev-amd64 and depending and dependent packages

4525
ubuntu	debian
this has already been reported as debian bug #564327 debian bug #565279 ubuntu bug #524774 and freedesktop bug 20145

4572
kde	gnome
i have been a gnome user for years 8 years and i m looking for recommendations and comparisons of linux distributions that offers good kde integration experience

4576
prepare	execute
this is a more general version of stefan s answer but i m using awk in the middle to prepare the exact string that i would like xargs to execute

4580
gentoo	opensuse
i ve primarily used opensuse gentoo and arch and all of them have worked quite well with kde

4580
gentoo	opensuse
however aside from the fact that gentoo and arch are rather more hardcore than opensuse i believe that both of them use a vanilla version of kde whereas opensuse adds more of their own stuff including a really nice kpart for viewing system information which probably should be added to kde proper and increased integration for some non-kde programs such as firefox

4580
kde	kubuntu
the one thing that i can say beyond that is that i frequently hear people say not to use kubuntu and that it s a poor kde distro with relatively poor stability

4580
kde	kubuntu
it is about the main consistent thing that i ve heard about kde distros though many folks say not to use kubuntu

4581
kde	kubuntu
kubuntu is by far the best kde distro

4585
bash	zsh
ksh zsh and bash all offer another perhaps clearer syntax

4593
toolchain	binutils
when my board boots up it will mount my root file system rfs which has the toolchain and the binutils present within it

4613
disk	ram
page cache sometimes referred to as disk cache is a transparent ram buffer for access to and from on-disk files

4615
bash	zsh
i m using zsh btw so if i can do it there but not bash that s fine

4623
gentoo	linux
in gentoo documentation there is article gentoo linux localization guide

4624
mouse	joystick
i would like to use a joystick as a mouse with fedora 12

4625
mouse	joystick
if you don t have one generate it with xorg -configure . the critical line is the sendcoreevents option which makes the joystick events move the mouse pointer

4636
ubuntu	linux
i own a legal windows xp copy but prefer to use gnu linux and run wine 1.3.8 on ubuntu 10.10

4648
ubuntu	debian
i found the file mount-archive.desktop at ubuntu-branches ubuntu natty nautilus natty annotate head debian mount-archive.desktop

4650
bash	tcsh
i m mainly concerned with bash though i have some coworkers who use tcsh

4655
xfce	kde
xfce 4.6.2 kde 4.5.1 but 4.5.3 can be found in the synergy

4662
disk	ram
instead of just fetching a kernel put a boot-and-root filesystem in flash memory or load a root filesystem to a ram disk

4671
fink	macports
you can install rpm through darwin ports or fink or macports or even a darwin port rpm4darwin

4678
bash	zsh
for normal users this is typically set to bin sh or other shell bash zsh

4701
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	centos	freebsd	centos
here s what i use on ubuntu 10.04 centos 5.5 freebsd and mac os x

4715
kde	gnome
is is possible to use kde as well as gnome on a machine

4731
bash	zsh
note that the final in folder remote and the placement of after the include rules are important. in shells that support brace expansion bash ksh zsh

4764
openbsd	freebsd
openbsd no port but there s one for freebsd . to search inside various formatted text document types including pdf

4774
bash	zsh
i will assume that your shells are bourne compatible sh ash dash ksh bash zsh etc.

4803
kerberos	ldap	gentoo	ubuntu
i don t know about details for suse but we ve been doing this on gentoo and ubuntu with a combination of kerberos ldap and nss

4806
stdout	stderr
an added requirement is that both stderr and stdout should be printed

4808
stdout	stderr
redirecting stdout and stderr can be done once with exec

4810
ubuntu	centos	solaris	bsd	centos	solaris
please note it does not have to be ubuntu i was setting up a brand new vm for this purpose so i am open to any unix-like os be it fedora centos a bsd flavor or even open solaris or similar

4811
bash	zsh
bash ksh zsh dash version untested

4855
ubuntu	mint
there are two videos on youtube showing it being used with mint and ubuntu

4858
debian	linux
i ve been working with debian gnu linux for a long time and am very proficient with it

4871
ubuntu	linux
i want to be able to mount our file server s file share on a mac os x server shared via afp and windows file sharing on my ubuntu 10.10 linux laptop

4874
bash	tcsh
i m on a unix-like system os 390 and depend on several scripts that work in sh bourne shell not bash but not in other shells tcsh for example so i can t switch shells

4876
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
if you have or can install a better interactive shell than the bourne shell zsh bash tcsh go for it

4891
kde	gnome
i m planning on writing an app that i would like to be able to run on any linux installation without having to rewrite any of the code in doing so except maybe the interface gnome vs kde etc

4892
kde	gnome
also you can easily run gnome apps in kde and vice-versa so you can choose one that fits best you your userbase and you re done

4908
bionic	glibc
note that what i wrote above is not true if you want your application to work on embedded systems here meaning anything that s not a server desktop or laptop which even when they run a linux kernel often don t have the usual libraries starting with glibc being eschewed in favor of âµclibc dietlibc bionic etc

4911
versioning	upgrade
versioning it will not be upgrade in place

4951
filesystems	ntfs
the winodws nt ntfs filesystems has something immediately analogous to an inode entries in the master file table

4951
filesystems	fat
i m not at all expert with other windows dos filesystems fat fat32 etc etc but the records in the file allocation table seem like analogs of a combined directory entry and inode to me

4951
filesystems	fat
i imagine that combining naming and hierarcy along with disk block data is what makes fat filesystems so fragile

4953
bash	zsh
there is another avenue which depends on your login shell being bash or zsh

4988
ubuntu	centos
i d rather use the path as some of these need to work on arch ubuntu and centos

4991
bash	zsh
ksh bash and zsh also have type -p to look up only executables in

4991
ubuntu	debian
for instance debian s ash which is bin sh on ubuntu doesn t have it

5000
switching	screens
once top starts press f to switching to the sort field screens

5005
kde	gnome
i use some gnome apps and some kde apps so some of them use g-keyring and some kwallet.

5005
kde	gnome
or is there maybe a way to force gnome apps to use kwallet or kde apps to use g-keyring

5008
freebsd	linux
i have setup a nfs server on freebsd 8.1 which will be serving one linux client

5008
freebsd	linux
i suppose that my question is since both freebsd and linux support 802.3ad is the following the right way to configure this when not using a switch

5008
freebsd	linux
freebsd em2 - eth2 linux

5008
freebsd	linux
edit i ve found that on the freebsd box the mac addresses of em2 and em3 are the same where-as on the linux box the mac addresses of eth2 and eth3 are different

5012
mouse	keyboard
when using my laptop at home i usually use an external monitor keyboard and mouse with my laptop s screen as a second monitor

5014
put	get
i want to put regex matches to buffer but cannot get even simpler example y .put mynewbuffer return msg working ie how to put something to buffer

5016
kde	gnome
every web browser may have its own password store and anyone using both kde and gnome applications will likely have to open both kwallet and gnome keyring in every desktop session

5016
kde	gnome
michael leupold presented a collaboration between kde and gnome to develop a unified standard for storing secrets

5016
kde	gnome
the aim is that kde and gnome applications will both be able to share a common secrets architecture but still have separate graphical interfaces

5016
kde	gnome
a kde user will be presented with a kde interface if they need to unlock an account in empathy the gnome instant messaging application while a gnome user will see a gnome interface for password management even if they prefer to chat using kde s kopete

5016
kde	gnome
after having hinted at it now and then i can finally gladly announced that we gnome keyring + kde wallet managed to kick off a joint freedesktop.org project with the goal of creating a common infrastructure or more technically protocol for managing passwords and other secret values

5017
ubuntu	linux
now i am thinking about setting up a headless server that runs linux not necessarily ubuntu but i am worried that since the server is headless i won t be able to decrypt it during startup

5069
put	get
dr get a usb pci card and put one camera on there

5076
ubuntu	linux	solaris	aix
from the user perspective all nix like systems linux ubuntu red hat sun solaris aix are essentially the same

5076
rmdir	mkdir
by this i mean that the commands a user uses most vi cat more cd mkdir rmdir rm cp mv man are available and have mostly the same options

5111
subshell	tcsh
i think the correct operator for executing subshell command in tcsh is the backtick but when i attempt to do a diff on the results of two commands i get an error

5112
bash	zsh
in ksh bash or zsh you can do it this way

5113
ubuntu	linux
i was running low in disk space on my linux box ubuntu 10.10 desktop specifically on my home partition so i added another disk to it and i am trying to move the home partition into it

5131
bash	tcsh
after learning bash i find that tcsh is a bit of a step backwards

5131
bash	tcsh
for instance what i could easily do in bash i m finding it difficult to do in tcsh

5131
bash	tcsh
the internet support and documentation is also much better for bash and very limited for tcsh

5131
bash	tcsh
the number of o reilly books on bash are great but i have found nothing similar for tcsh

5140
centos	linux
i know how to do it with centos that simply type linux dd when prompt boot and i will be able to load drivers from a usb flashdisk

5153
fish	bash
you could use fish instead of bash

5154
udp	tcp
i m looking for an image which will boot quickly i assume it ll be linux and have lan drivers- for sending tcp udp packets to another system in the same network

5160
backgrounding	multitasking
since modern os-x now supported multitasking so much better than the classic mac os had it suddenly made sense that a user might want to have all sorts of things running in the backgrounding such as some video conversion software that cranks away in the backgrounding a screen recorder voip software internet radio a web server something that speaks in response to a spoken command etc

5161
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
you should switch to a posix compliant shell like one of bash ksh dash but not zsh and certainly not tcsh

5163
kde	gnome
the main difference is that kde is c++ with qt while gnome is c based on top of gtk

5172
debian-based	live-cd
grml this is a debian-based live-cd intended for system administrators

5176
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
i have two linux distributions opensuse ubuntu installed on two different partitions

5176
ubuntu	opensuse
the third time i restart again opensuse may get booted while fourth time i restart ubuntu may load up and so on

5177
ubuntu	opensuse
so have ubuntu write a version of menu.lst that loads opensuse and have opensuse write a version that loads ubuntu

5185
disk	ram
if supported build a table in ram describing the hard disk available

5209
folder	directory
when i use kdialog --getsavefilename path to specific folder it opens folder s parent directory not folder itself

5215
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux unstable stable

5218
ubuntu	linux
my kernels is an ubuntu stock kernel from natty linux xbmc 2.6.37-11-generic #25-ubuntu smp tue dec 21 23 42 56 utc 2010 x86_64 gnu linux

5229
bash	zsh
in zsh as well as bash you can use some history word expansions to denote arguments from previous commands

5244
gentoo	ubuntu
my rationale is ntfs doesn t have any idea about file permissions so i won t have any trouble using them in a multi-boot system currently i have gentoo and ubuntu and the data partition is auto-mounted on both

5253
kde	gnome
also since i ve installed kde gnome is all messed up - but one thing at a time and if i like kde enough i ll uninstall gnome anyway

5255
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
the ubuntu wiki gentoo wiki debian wiki and arch wiki all have articles related to multi-seat x

5259
ubuntu	linux
note that for hesitant or discreet installations an alternative in some use cases is to run linux in a virtual machine either colinux a virtualized linux running on windows for example with andlinux ubuntu on colinux

5259
vmware	virtualbox
or a more general vm technology such as virtualbox or vmware

5262
ubuntu	debian
i am using debian which is similar to ubuntu

5269
spaces	delimiter
the -d option to xargs just specifies that the delimiter between arguments is a newline which avoids potentially catastrophic problems with filenames which contain spaces for example deadly file

5279
udp	tcp
if you want a lightweight tcp or udp client you can drive simply from the shell use netcat

5281
ubuntu	linux
i ve used linux mint-gnome for the last year and previously ubuntu and i m about to switch to a rolling kde4 distro with e17 as my 2nd de so i m in pretty much the same boat as you and would definitely still call my self a newbie

5283
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
c shells used to have more interactive features than bourne-style shells but bash and zsh have now overtaken tcsh

5283
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
these are features commonly found in shells with good interaction support bash tcsh zsh fish

5283
bash	zsh
features present in both and in zsh include local variables in function array variables the double bracket syntax for conditionals and requiring an option to be set in bash and zsh additional globbing patterns such as â

5284
bash	zsh
use this tag for questions applying to bin sh and most compatible shells ash bash ksh zsh â

5287
ftp	telnet
it was designed in the mid 1990s as a secure replacement for protocols such as telnet and ftp which exchange data including authentication tokens in plain text

5287
client-side	server-side
openssh developed by the openbsd project is by far the most common implementation of ssh both server-side and client-side in the unix world

5299
kde	gnome
it uses kdialog so it s for kde users gnome users should modify it to use zenity.

5320
freebsd	linux
this crucial point later affected separate parties such as freebsd linux and mimix -formation to their current form

5328
vmware	virtualbox
with most virtualization solutions xen virtualbox vmware and the likes you certainly have multiple kernels running at the same time on a single machine

5343
ubuntu	linux
this is the behaviour i m currently seeing running ubuntu linux 10.10

5353
debian	linux
i am sorry for not directly answering this one - i ve got that module up and running with apache but unfortunately on debian linux so the packages are different and perhaps you need to find correct packages for you as well maybe download the files manually and then install them from files via rpm -i filename

5373
bash	zsh
i ve seen this is possible in bash apparently but i couldn t find anything about doing it in zsh

5377
ubuntu	linux
is it possible to create a single-user usb installation with persistence of ubuntu linux such that the entire usb stick is encrypted and requires a passphrase at boot time

5378
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu the place to configure networking without network manager is etc network interfaces

5379
stdout	stdio	stdout	stderr
since the child process constitutes an exact copy of the parent process the child process still has whatever the parent had in stdout or stderr the buffers from stdio

5382
gentoo	linux
i have been working with linux for a few years now and currently i m running gentoo with gdm openbox stand alone gnome aware and xcompmgr

5384
opensuse	debian	gentoo	opensuse	gentoo	debian
all linux-distributions i have used so far gentoo debian slackware fedora opensuse had an environment-variable called pager which set the pager default as said less

5391
bash	zsh
this works for bash zsh ksh maybe others too

5400
ubuntu	debian
also make sure you have the acl utilities installed acl package on debian or ubuntu

5401
stdout	stderr
you can put console output in the global configuration file etc init.conf so that every job has its stdout and stderr connected to the console by default they re connected to dev null

5404
ubuntu	debian
having a command named pager is specific to debian and derivatives including ubuntu

5419
ubuntu	debian
here i use the perl rename script that debian and ubuntu ship as usr bin prename typically available as rename as well

5419
bash	zsh
recursively with bash â 4 or zsh

5438
debian	linux
i am on kubuntu 10.4 but at least one of these setups will be on debian linux

5438
debian	linux
a gnu linux generic method would be best but debian linux specific with udev

5475
bash	zsh
in bash cd zsh -ci cd foo bar

5475
bash	zsh
which can be shortened to zsh -ci cd foo bar under shopt -s autocd in bash â 4

5475
bash	zsh
in bash you could write a wrapper around the cd builtin that emulates the zsh behavior

5488
chgrp	chmod
for example things managed by the chmod chgrp usermod groupadd etc

5496
tunnel	vpn
at least one of the vpn systems are probably set up to full tunnel rather than split tunnel

5496
tunnel	vpn
full tunnel means route 0.0.0.0 0 everything via the vpn tunnel and split tunnel means route only the organization s specific ip addresses

5512
folder	directory
i m asking this because i m planning to copy all files but not the root directory to another folder svn working copy

5526
stdout	stderr
is it possible to configure bash so that stderr can be a different color than stdout

5529
daemons	systemd
you can make it a daemons fork it twice or have it started by the systemd s init daemons or for temporary stuff use screen

5531
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	solaris	bsd
different systems have different command line tools strace on linux ktrace on bsd truss on solaris dtrace on freebsd and macâ osâ x â

5541
daemons	systemd
this process might take some time and i encourage you to experiment and whenever you encounter a daemons you don t recognize check it s man page or google it to ensure that you won t be screwing your systemd up

5545
udp	tcp
in particular if the purpose is to have a different application listening on a udp or tcp port you could redirect traffic to a different port at the level of the network layer iptables under linux pfctl under bsd â

5547
switching	screens
-x can send any command to a byobu screens session and also works with the -p switching

5564
disk	ram
what md won t protect you against is data corruption due to a byzantine failure silent flipping of one or more bits in ram cpu motherboard or disk

5572
bash	zsh
on the remotehost bash is the default shell and the version of zsh is older 4.2 vs 4.3 on that

5591
bash	zsh
in ksh bash and zsh but not in other shells such as dash you can define a function with

5595
apache	cherokee
at my workplace we have cherokee instead of apache

5595
nginx	lighttpd
i also heard about nginx and lighttpd

5615
unix	bsd	bsd	minix
linus torvalds then a student wrote his own kernel in the summer of 1991 because he was unhappy with the available unix kernels unix itself with the bell labs code was extremely expensive even pc unices such as xenix there was andrew tanenbaum s minix but it was only available to purchasers of tanenbaum s book and torvalds was unaware of the effort led by berkeley university to produce a free unix bsd and bsd didn t run on pcs yet at the time

5621
ubuntu	debian
am using debian and i could reproduce with an ubuntu machine

5637
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs
but there s a good chance you ll never be able to reach that far it s common to have a 32-bit nlink_t but only 16 bits in many filesystems a quick grep in the linux source shows that ext 234 ntfs ufs and xfs use 16-bit link counts in the kernel data structures

5639
disk	ram
when such a virtual memory page is accessed while paged out it generates a page fault and is moved back from the disk to ram

5639
disk	ram
page faults are a disaster for performance because disk latency is measured in milliseconds while ram latency is measured in nanoseconds

5650
bash	zsh
with bash â 4 or zsh and gnu tar

5665
folder	directory
what does the etc folder in the root directory stand for

5667
folder	directory
i personally use such a folder too on my home directory as well not called etc but oars something else

5688
rpm	yum
the system is now ready to fetch rpm packages from adobe using yum

5688
versioning	upgrade
if you have upgrade from a previous versioning of fedora make sure that nspluginwrapper is installed and the latest versioning

5696
mouse	keyboard
it looks like it can handle the keyboard video mouse mappings in its config file

5719
next	except
-- so i try next to compile and link libmagic.so with a linker script which hides all symbols except 3 which are defined in libmagic.so and are exported by it

5734
solaris	bsd
there was also a misunderstanding of the standard by os implementors notably microsoft and linux which erroneously map file systems with primary partitions instead of subdividing their own partition in slices like bsd and solaris which was the original intended goal

5735
xfce	gnome
also you can try switching to xfce instead of gnome as your desktop environment

5735
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
xfce is lot lighter than gnome kde

5746
virtualbox	esx	vmware	esx	vmware	virtualbox
vmware workstation works like virtualbox while vmware esx is a hypervisor similar to xen

5749
ubuntu	linux
gnome+compiz on puppy linux will be just as slow as on ubuntu if you manage to install it

5750
processors	hyperthreading
if you have two cores with two cpus each through hyperthreading that s a total of four processors as far as the os is concerned

5753
vmware	esx
examples xen vmware esx

5758
daemons	systemd
the udev daemons started with the systemd will search in etc udev rules.d and lib udev rules.d and will run matching rules for kernel events

5797
ubuntu	debian
by default in debian ubuntu and other distributions configuration files are left behind in case you reinstall again

5805
bash	zsh
here is a bash equivalent of gilles zsh solution

5813
processors	hyperthreading
a single physical hyperthreading processors will appear as two logical processors

5813
processors	hyperthreading
thus your dual core processors in which each core is hyperthreading will appear as four logical processors to things like top cpuinfo prstat activity monitor etc

5841
ubuntu	debian
im a debian fan so check out debian wiki or the ubuntu community docs

5842
mouse	keyboard
if i understood your needs you have to bind one screen keyboard and one mouse to one serverlayout and the others to the second one

5846
ubuntu	debian
the moreutils package from ubuntu and also debian has a program called sponge which sort-of also solves your problem

5872
toolchain	binutils
i m specifically interested in distro-maintained packages because i ve tried a couple of others buildroot crosstool and it seems that and any time the distribution touches gcc or binutils it invariably breaks at least the building of the toolchain if not the building of the project itself

5885
bash	zsh
there s a lightweight way of saving the output of a command that works in ksh and zsh but not in bash it requires the output side of a pipeline to be executed in the parent shell

5885
solaris	bsd
you can do it by running inside script a bsd utility but available on most unices including linux and solaris which saves all output of your session through a file there s still a bit of effort needed to reliably detect the last prompt in the typescript

5886
cpu	irq
the cpu checks after each instruction if there s a irq from the a pic

5890
bash	zsh
in general if you wanted to make all directories readable without affecting the files you could either use find with -type d or if you re using zsh or bash 4 with shopt -s globstar the glob both without passing the -r flag to chmod

5894
subnet	packets
use tcpdump to capture packets that are leaving your local lan subnet

5894
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
the reason i suggest this rather than running some sort of ping traceroute based monitoring software is that many network operators treat icmp traffic and generation of icmp unreachables which traceroute relies on differently to actual udp tcp traffic

5895
freebsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
long story short have one laptop need to multiboot freebsd openbsd as well as a number of linux distros

5896
ubuntu	freebsd
i gave up on freebsd because of driver problems but i was able to dual boot it with ubuntu and you should be able to do so as well

5896
ubuntu	opensuse
the opensuse live cd should have a gui partitioning tool as well but i m not sure i m more familiar with ubuntu

5933
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
on debian ubuntu i use etckeeper which i think has been packaged for centos too

5935
solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
linux aix solaris bsd etc

5940
debian	linux
build operating system linux debian xorg-server 2 1.4.2-10.lenny2

5954
debian	linux
damn small linux will make debian look huge

5962
ppp	dhcp
if it wasn t a dhcp client may not be running or the ppp daemon may not have added it ndash

5962
ppp	dhcp
one can be added manually but depending on the network may not work by the following command replacing with an ip address appropriate for the network which may be unknown if the network supplies ip addresses via dhcp or ppp and replacing with the interface name

5979
ubuntu	debian
it used to be based on ubuntu but now it s based on debian

5982
exif	xmp
what tools can i use to delete all the exif iptc xmp etc metadata from graphics files

5990
ubuntu	debian
if you want to reclaim the space used by some of those other locales you can try the localepurge package in debian or ubuntu

5994
freebsd	debian
i can t connect this desktop celeron to the router distance and cable concerns so i was wondering how to make the debian laptop share its internet access with the freebsd desktop with a little cable

5994
freebsd	debian
i ve read about network bridging and think i can do that on the debian side but i still wonder how to proceed on the freebsd celeron desktop

5999
xfce	gnome
i m trying to start an application within ubuntu xfce or gnome and via the

6001
width	height
replace window name with a name or reg ex appearing in the window title you can also search by window class and a variety of other things and the two numbers appearing after windowsize are the width and height respectively

6009
debian	linux
being new to linux i chose debian for my linode because it seemed stable and secure

6018
nntp	telnet	ftp	telnet
http 1.1 https ftp mailto news nntp telnet and local file links support

6018
ftp	telnet
username password authorization for http and ftp and telnet

6018
freebsd	debian
it s also in debian lenny aptitude install linkchecker and in the freebsd ports usr ports www linkchecker

6029
ubuntu	debian
run gnome-system-monitor package is the same name in debian ubuntu and fedora and click on the system tab

6029
ubuntu	debian
also running printenv desktop_session on my debian system just outputs default but it works well on ubuntu and fedora

6038
kde	gnome
i m not sure scintilla has been ported to gnome or kde has it

6042
ubuntu	debian
i created an upstart script in ubuntu thinking it would be the same for debian

6042
ubuntu	debian
but debian doesn t have a etc init folder that ubuntu has

6042
ubuntu	debian
so how do i make my ubuntu script work on debian

6046
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	redhat	fedora
for all intents and purposes a typical modern linux distribution ubuntu debian redhat fedora slackware etc is a unix but strictly speaking no system can claim to be unix without being certified so instead people say they are unix-like

6083
ubuntu	debian
it s not directly about debian vs ubuntu it s about sysvinit vs upstart

6087
xfce	gnome
xfce terminal emulator konsole and gnome terminal are good terminal emulators and all are going to have tabs and keyboard shortcuts

6087
xfce	gnome
gnome terminal served as the basis for xfce terminal so the preferences look the similar to xfce terminal

6093
bash	subshell
under other shells such as bash each pipeline element is executed in its own subshell and the original shell just waits for them all to end

6093
bash	zsh
if you need to capture the output from different commands into different variables i think there is no direct way even in â œadvancedâ shells such as bash ksh or zsh

6110
openbsd	freebsd
also i want to run this on either freebsd or openbsd

6132
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
bind ended up taking a long time for non-cached requests and periodically firefox google-chrome safari would decide to time out

6141
bash	zsh
this works in bash and zsh

6141
bash	zsh
bash ksh and zsh write to the history file when they exit zsh can do it more often depending on configuration

6141
bash	zsh
alternatively you can get bash or zsh to ignore lines matching certain patterns this is already covered by other answers

6145
openbsd	freebsd
both freebsd and openbsd ship with bind as the preinstalled name server

6145
openbsd	freebsd
it is available as a port on freebsd and openbsd

6147
hdd	floppy
if your bios supports boot from usb as an option in the boot loader cd hdd net floppy etc

6147
opensuse	debian
i ve done so with debian but here is a howto for opensuse i pulled from a search result that should apply to you

6169
mouse	keyboard
now one of your keyboard mouse combinations will only be directed to that vm.

6169
mouse	keyboard
i set up a vm with my usb keyboard mouse combo and maximized that to one monitor you need vmware tools to do this

6169
put	get
to get around that i put my second vm in exculsive mode thus caputuring my host input

6169
mouse	keyboard
i could also have had a second keyboard mouse combo

6184
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux - sys-apps busybox

6189
sysv	systemd
the h online as ever is a great source for linux technology and is where i found my place to start researching systemd as sysv init and upstart alternative

6189
sysv	systemd
which gives some crucial points of what s wrong with sysv initd and what new systemd need to do

6189
daemons	systemd
the big disadvantage of systemd is that some daemons will have to be modified in order to take full advantage of it

6190
sysv	systemd
both upstart and systemd are attempts to solve some of the problems with the limitations of the traditional sysv init systemd

6190
daemons	systemd
one disadvantage i know of is that to take advantage of systemd s socket fh preallocation many daemons will have to be patched to have the fh passed to them by systemd

6193
disk	ram
this is by design and inherently makes synchronous writes much slower due to the high latency times involved with a spinning metal disk on disk ram cache doesn t count

6193
disk	ram
asynchronous writes are usually written to ram and the os deals with committing it to disk later later usually being mere seconds or less i believe zfs is 5x second or every 5 seconds

6193
disk	ram
disk seek times are measured in ms while ram seek times are measured in ns

6197
sysv	systemd
is the v in systemd v and sysv and sysvinit etc pronounced vee or five

6198
sysv	systemd
unix systemd v commonly abbreviated sysv and usually pronouncedâ though rarely writtenâ as systemd five .

6217
zypper	yum
either on the command-line with zypper yast if available yum or over the graphical frontend yast

6246
xmonad	xmobar
i m setting up an xmonad window manager and i came across following problem - when i try to configure xmobar and run it it shows

6259
rss	feed
in addition to allowing me to send messages it must also be able to read multiple rss feed and aggregate them to the networks i set up

6264
redhat	fedora
on redhat fedora see yum

6266
centos	linux
yum for rhel fedora centos scientific linux

6272
rss	feed
as far as i know it has the ability to receive content from all of the listed services but i m not sure if there is a way to receive arbitrary rss feed

6274
kde	gnome
right now i have xmonad in there but sometimes i want to run a gnome session and sometimes a kde session

6284
ubuntu	debian
how do i check the version before installing using apt-get or aptitude on debian or ubuntu

6286
versioning	upgrade
substituting with upgrade will show the versioning from all upgradeable packages

6288
xfce	gnome
i had great success with a custom debian install running xfce instead of gnome on a pentium3 500mhz with 512mb ram

6297
ubuntu	debian
the debian installer is text-based and is included in the ubuntu distriubtion as the alternate cd

6297
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
more mainstream distributions such as debian ubuntu linux mint and fedora have lightweight spins available which include either xfce lxde or fluxbox

6297
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
coincidentally i was testing out lubuntu today an unofficial ubuntu variant which uses lxde and linux mint fluxbox

6298
opensuse	linux
if you look at my previous question you will find this one as same as that but as i couldn t solve my problem yet i want to ask again i did tried all your good suggestions but there were no mercurial package in opensuse 10.2 my linux please give me another sollution which doesn t need packages i m completely confused and i just installed opensuse 11.1 but it had the same problems also i m not familiar with this version and even couldn t find yum

6314
ubuntu	debian
apt-file provides the feature of searching for a package providing a binary like debian or ubuntu it is not installed by default but in the repositories

6322
kde	gnome
now that it s running halfway and i want to switch to another de for example from gnome to kde can i do that without interrupting the download

6336
centos	linux
there s the rocks linux distro which is made for clustering and is based on centos rhel

6345
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
i m working on a simple bash script that should be able to run on ubuntu and centos distributions support for debian and fedora rhel would be a plus and i need to know the name and version of the distribution the script is running in order to trigger specific actions for instance the creation of repositories

6345
ubuntu	centos
this seems to work returning ubuntu or centos i haven t tried others as the release name

6359
versioning	upgrade	disk	ram
it s possible that a static copy of libgcrypt has been incorporated into the initial ram disk to decrypt early disk for example and it is still the versioning prior to the package upgrade

6362
sudoers	passwd
after installing debian 6.0 rc1 i can t do anything as administrator because i cannot login as root but i did setup the passwd during installation and user is not a sudoers either

6363
sudoers	visudo
if su works but you still want sudo then you can just run su -c visudo then add your useraccount to the sudoers file

6374
kde	gnome
i know gnome works with these and assume kde does too

6393
folder	directory
for example if i have a folder foo with the files .hidden and nothidden inside how do i move both files to a directory named bar

6397
bash	zsh
here s more detail about controlling whether dot files are matched in bash ksh93 and zsh

6400
versioning	upgrade
for example firefox will happily upgrade your profile to a newer versioning but might not let you load that profile again in an earlier versioning

6405
unix	solaris
i usually end up installing the complete version of vim in home even on unix stations like solaris stations that only have the old vi at first

6408
ubuntu	opensuse
ubuntu and fedora both run gnome 2.30 opensuse has kde4 and archlinux lxde

6430
stdout	stderr
also stderr needs to be redirected to err.log and stdout needs to be redirected to stdout.log

6431
stdout	stderr
is how you swap stderr and stdout because tee can only accept stdout

6454
bash	zsh
in shells that implement the syntax bash ksh and zsh it can be used to match a string against a pattern

6454
openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
if you have the netbsd openbsd or gnu linux readlink you can use readlink -f to strip symbolic links from a path

6456
gif	png
i m looking to develop a web-application that translates request parameters into a png gif chart

6464
ubuntu	debian
this uses the perl rename command available on debian and ubuntu

6515
gentoo	ubuntu
for example on my gentoo there are modules.d and vhosts.d while on my ubuntu there are conf.d mods-available mods-enabled sites-available and sites-enabled

6522
ubuntu	debian
on debian squeeze ubuntu 10.10 and ubuntu 11.04 these are nicely split

6526
ubuntu	debian
so why has the underscore been considered a bad character for user names in debian and possibly other distributions while it has been removed from adduser s name_regex in ubuntu

6540
cvs	svn
the directory it s backing up is a svn archive it used to be cvs back in the day

6548
bash	zsh
in ksh bash or zsh use an array variable

6556
google-chrome	firefox
i ve seen it in google-chrome although not the url bar firefox and in eclipse text editors

6556
google-chrome	firefox
i ve seen the behavior in open office writer google-chrome firefox eclipse thunderbird

6569
put	get
i can get etc hosts to redirect to me to different domains but it seems to ignore it if i put https into it

6593
daemons	launchd	disk	ram
as a possible solution we just thought of launchd a daemons that runs rsync every 10 seconds or so to sync the disk drive with a ram drive

6597
tar	gunzip
if not you can just use tar cvf followed by gzip again if available for compression and gunzip followed by tar xvf

6599
tar	gunzip
the corresponding gunzip and bunzip2 commands can be used to uncompress said archive or you can just use flags on the tar command to perform the uncompression

6627
redhat	fedora
in redhat s set of administration tools there s system-config-lvm which is optionally installable in other distributions like fedora and debian

6646
bash	zsh
then learn to use them - bash and zsh have tab-completion

6646
mouse	keyboard
taking your hands off the keyboard touching the mouse and them moving them back is slow

6665
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
all major linux vendors today ship lsb compliant operating systems that includes redhat debian ubuntu and novell - so i don t believe there is much contention about it

6669
debian	linux
the first 8 entries are all different puppy linux installation on hd0 2 the 3rd partition on the 1st hardisk then there is a minimal debian installation in a small extra partition and also the original windows-xp

6669
folder	directory
q i understand that the boot img systemname folder will store the image for a specific system which may use various or the same versions of linux kernels stored in the boot kernel directory at least that s how i d like to set it up

6679
width	height
it specifically looks for lines like dvi-0 connected 1600x1200+3200+0 â which gives the position 3200 pixels from the left 0 pixels from the top size width 1600 height 1200 and name dvi-0 of a monitor

6679
bash	zsh
the shell has to be ksh it can be pdksh or att ksh because other shells at least bash and zsh don t behave well enough in the presence of multiple jobs specifically their wait built-in isn t interrupted by a sigchld

6684
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu replace rename with rename.ul

6702
sudo	passwd
if i understand correctly what you are trying to do are you putting that sudo command into the script and expecting the script to prompt for your passwd when it runs there

6731
atomic	compare-and-swap
all platforms intended for multitasking provide at least one atomic primitive for synchronization such as compare-and-swap test-and-set load-link+store-conditional etc

6737
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
while i d like this to be fairly generic i ll be using ubuntu server 10.04 although i have the choice between centos and debian or windows as alternatives

6742
ubuntu	debian
just tailor it to the specific distro as the link i gave is for debian ubuntu

6749
disk	ram
there is a boot option which will make it run totally in ram so eventually you can also repartition the disk to give it its own linux filesystem or install another distro

6761
bash	zsh
something like this should also work for you with recent versions of bash and zsh

6794
daemon	cron
the cron daemon starts a subshell

6794
daemon	cron
the cron daemon supplies a default

6794
daemon	cron
so cron daemon doesn t know where php is and you should specify the full php path by hand for example i don t know your real php path

6798
versioning	upgrade
i need to upgrade my versioning of subversion however simply running yum update subversion tells me

6807
overwrite	preserve
the environment is preserve not overwrite by the dot files and the ps1 environment variable is set before entering the shell

6817
bash	zsh
note that requires bash or zsh

6822
daemons	systemd
the cron daemons usually executes your command in a shell where the path environment variable is restricted to some systemd default usr bin bin

6822
stdout	stderr
0 or produces output to stdout stderr after the job is finished

6828
temp	tmp
i am relying on the system cleaning up tmp after a reboot but it would be possible to enhance this make it delete the temp dir after exiting the shell

6831
rpm	yum
under a fedora 14 system i ve looked a bit around with yum search boost and rpm -qr and indeed like with other distributions the boost library is split into several packages

6841
centos	linux
see here howto add a new yum repository to install software under centos redhat linux

6850
ubuntu	debian
the debian ubuntu package search pages are very useful to look up what version of a program is available in what distribution series how programs are split along multiple packages etc

6850
g++	gcc
this yields results and it seems that there is only one big gcc package which includes g++

6850
ubuntu	debian
thus my question what is the fedora equivalent to the debian ubuntu package search pages

6868
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
for linux or at least the debian family of distributions e.g ubuntu there are the vim-gnome and vim-gtk packages

6870
centos	linux
i m running centos with a 64 bit version of a linux 2.6 build

6881
stdout	stderr
in unix stdin 0 stdout 1 and stderr 2

6887
google-chrome	firefox
i have access to firefox and google-chrome so if there s a plugin that could facilitate it

6922
ubuntu	linux
i d probably still be using it even now that i ve shifted fully across to linux ubuntu but it doesn t behave 100 in wine .

6922
notepad++	scite
in october last year i asked here about scite scintilla specifically notepad++ is based on scintilla but as per one answer it is too painful .

6929
udp	tcp
use to figure out which file descriptors are tcp udp sockets and add up the counts per fd

6945
ubuntu	centos
what makes centos enterprisey compared to generic distributions like ubuntu

6945
ubuntu	centos
just a general question because i was thinking of hosting a web application on my computer which runs ubuntu and came upon a page that said that centos had 30 market share for servers

6947
centos	linux
centos is a free derivative of red hat enterprise linux which is targeted at the enterprise market so it is specifically design for deployment on a variety of platforms such as servers etc

6949
centos	linux
one of the things that rhel centos and other enterprise linux products provides that other distros don t provide is api abi stability

6949
gentoo	ubuntu
this is a frustration to a lot of people who are new to rhel because all they see is that the versions available are all older than the latest releases found in the latest release of ubuntu fedora gentoo whatever

6950
daemons	systemd
the ibus daemons is running and there is an ibus icon in the systemd tray however there does not appear to be any way of switching imes

6960
wordpress	joomla
so your next priority is to stay current on updates to software such as wordpress drupal joomla and other third party applications

6961
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu has a sever and even lts long term support version that in a lot of ways is just as good as rhel centos

6961
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	centos	freebsd	centos	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	centos
generally using fedora or ubuntu for desktops use freebsd gentoo and such for appliances and for servers i stick mainly to centos but manage a lot of ubuntu servers as well

6961
ubuntu	centos
both offer paid support and really centos is just rhel rebuilt to be free so we re really comparing rhel to ubuntu

6977
kate	kde
for example kate the kde text editor doesn t work with ibus or at least not by default you ll have to look more if you want that

6977
kate	kde
i believe other kde apps are like kate as well though i m not sure

6997
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu debian land we implement hard soft dependencies by having actual depends but also recommends

7008
ubuntu	debian
it s in the putty-tools package under debian and most likely ubuntu

7012
bash	zsh
with zsh and ksh93 not bash you can change it to for newline not to be treated specially however note that all trailing newline characters so that includes trailing empty lines will always be removed by the command substitution

7026
freebsd	netbsd
my question is more about the base system is openntpd the default ntpd in the base system in netbsd or freebsd

7026
gentoo	linux
for that matter what about linux distros some of which gentoo or arch for example are more bsdish

7053
jobs	cron
my sysadmin has set up a bunch of cron jobs on my machine

7060
ubuntu	debian	jobs	cron
with most crons vixie-cron - debian ubuntu default cronie - fedora default solaris cron ... you get the list of scheduled cron jobs for the current user via

7060
jobs	cron
with cronie default on fedora centos there is a .d style config directory for system cron jobs as well

7073
sudo	passwd
1st ex employee having forgotten that he d just sudo ed something else so it didn t ask for his passwd again oh f k

7080
stdout	stderr
ffmpeg s stderr is set to whatever its stdout is currently the pipe

7115
ubuntu	linux
boot from live linux distro you can use ubuntu install disk and use gparted

7166
centos	linux
i need to open port 21 on a linux centos 5 virtual machine i have

7256
folder	directory
it s also probably not what you see over imap while the imap server could be configured to serve this file as a mail folder called trash it s likely that it s showing a directory called trash near other directory that you see over imap

7261
ubuntu	debian
i believe debian ubuntu has legacy packages for it too but they re not installed by default

7298
openbsd	netbsd
the network works fine with netbsd 5.1 amd64 or openbsd 4.8 i386 using re

7303
folder	dir
i d be really annoyed to have enforced folder in my home dir

7308
bash	zsh
this is supported by at least bash zsh and ksh

7346
centos	linux
working on linux centos

7360
ubuntu	debian
on debian and derivatives including ubuntu once adduser has created the user it calls usr local sbin adduser.local if it exists

7363
kde	gnome
i was wondering what commands utilities can be used in terminal to know the types of windowing system such as x window system window manager such as metacity kwin window maker and desktop environment such as kde gnome of a linux or other unix-like operating systems

7367
ubuntu	linux
really a lot of the windows voodoo regarding drivers the registry and being sensitive to motherboard changes is less severe on linux if you are using a generic kernel with all drivers as modules which is the usual situation for ubuntu

7368
x86	64bit
assuming that your two machines are x86 architecture the only problem i can think of that can happen is if your installation is 64bit and your new machine isn t

7372
disk	ram
linux by default use the ram as disk cache

7382
bash	zsh
given ctrl + a a is only changing it until the next command it s probably being set by all shells or debug trap bash only or precmd preexec zsh only

7383
ubuntu	linux
however in linux say ubuntu i have found no other way than some piped command involving find xargs and grep an example is at this page how can i recursively grep through sub-directories

7392
inittab	fstab
any file in etc ending in tab is also super important such as fstab mtab inittab

7395
disk	ram
building the object and intermediate files into ram rather than disk

7401
debconf	aptitude
on apt-based distributions you can use the aptitude-create-state-bundle command part of the aptitude package to create an archive containing the list of installed packages and their debconf configuration and aptitude-run-state-bundle on the new machine

7408
solaris	sunos
what is the minimum version of solaris sunos that supports liblgrp

7410
debian	linux
this is linux debian sorry i missed this detail initially...

7411
bash	zsh
if the command appears as the window title while the command is running this is done by the preexec function in zsh or an emulation thereof under bash

this also has the advantage of giving you an rpm you can easily install upgrade and uninstall which uses the suse recommended build options

8333
folder	dir
for example if my source file is some dir source.c and it needs to be compiled in some dir library my makefile first copies the file to the library folder and then executes another makefile

well yum is rpm based -

8388
folder	directory
we keep a work directory in our tmp folder and from time to time an administrator will come along and purge the tmp folder with roughly

8388

i know the best solution is to move this folder elsewhere the tmp folder is called temp for a reason after all

8404
versioning	upgrade	gtk	gdk
you ll have to upgrade major parts of the os just to get the more recent firefox to compile because it depends on apis from more recent versioning of gtk gdk libstdc++ etc

8424
ubuntu	linux
i copied my .emacs file from ubuntu linux

8431
fontconfig	freetype
support for truetype fonts such as your consolas font â more generally support for client-rendered fonts â requires emacs to be compiled against the freetype and fontconfig libraries

8434
stdout	stderr
it seems like your makefile stdout stderr output triggers the default quickfix mode of your vim

8436
fontconfig	freetype
as gilles said to use a truetype font like consolas in emacs 23 you must link it with the freetype and fontconfig libraries

8447
sudoers	passwd
according to this post there are still some problems even after changing entries in etc passwd etc shadow and etc sudoers

converting this binary value to octal gives us 020061 which is what od printed

8525
bash	zsh
but i can only see zsh not bash expanding it like you say

8528
sudo	passwd
the second invocation of sudo does not request a passwd because even though i have logged out again i am still within some time limit meaning that i do not need to be prompted for my passwd again

8529
sudo	passwd
sudo is run a passwd will be

8549
sudo	passwd
if your system supports it if you logout then login sudo will request your passwd again

8554
csv	tsv
however of late the data is not in the traditional historical formats csv tsv record-based or some other delimiter-based it used to be before

8588
sudo	passwd
sudo doesn t protect against that very well at all â if they have your passwd after all no need to try tricking you for later.

8588
sudo	passwd
with the root passwd situation described it s hard to track down who did what â something sudo with remote logging deals with pretty well

8588
daemons	systemd
using passwords at all for ssh is dangerous since password-sniffing trojaned ssh daemons are put into place in something like 90 of the real-world systemd compromises i ve seen

8591
rpm	yum
yum is rpm based and is completely written in python

8591
rpm	yum
yum or rpm maintains a database berkley db usually in var lib rpm

8596
sudo	passwd
between su and sudo when you consider a single user su is a little more secure in that an attacker who has found your passwd can t gain root privileges immediately

8596
sudo	passwd
for example if a system is configured with remote tamper-proof logs you can always find out who last ran sudo or whose account was compromised but you don t know who typed the root passwd on the console

8633
opensuse	linux
i don t know if this is the right forum to ask i have started to use linux opensuse

8636
rpm	zypper
if zypper then tells you that it needs to install other packages as dependencies and it will fail because there is no internet connection you will have to look for the rpm files it need download and put them in my dir with rpms btw that s a fake path change it to whatever path you store the files

8654
openbsd	debian
the csh implementations i have at hand openbsd 4.7 bsd csh on debian tcsh all expand to foo but leave alone

8655
ubuntu	linux
i have posted a script over in the ubuntu forums and linux questions forums that addresses this problem at least in my case that uses imagemagick to resize 2 background images and stitch them together and then change the background on a timer

8658

assuming your computer is usually stable check for hardware problems especially with the ram install memtest86+ and choose memtest at the boot prompt but also with disk disk errors sometimes crash the filesystem code

8672
icmp	tcp
on most tcp ip implementations you can disallow icmp at the client end

8683
temp	tmp
it is very common have a temporary variable named tmp rather than temp for the same reason you use i i for the index in a for-loop instead of index or counter

8692
centos	linux
on centos and i expec other modern linux halt calls shutdown providing you re not at runlevel 0 or 6 so your system will be shutdown cleanly

8694
freebsd	linux
as such the shutdown command has to be used like this to halt switch off the computer immediately on linux and freebsd at least

8698
xfce	kde
i m not using any composition in kde or xfce

8718
ethernet	wireless
wireless works fine on windows 7 but neither wireless nor ethernet works on ubuntu

keep this in mind if you ever find yourself on a solaris or other commercial unix system.

8762
debian	mint	debian	linux
it fails win my distro arch linux however i ve installed it on virtual machine with mint debian and the printer works there

8765
sudo	passwd
if the concern is that a compromised user account can be used to sniff the passwd used for sudo or su then use a one-time passcode for sudo and su

8772
freebsd	solaris
if you re contributing to gnome what distribution or even os as long as it supports gnome freebsd and solaris being examples you use is irrelevant

8773
redhat	fedora
that means redhat enterprise linux or else fedora

8781
ubuntu	linux
slackware and arch linux have similar methods of stopping starting processes at boot different than the ubuntu and redhat-style examples given above

for fedora or other redhat based distributions you d simply download the kernel source rpm yum-downloadonly --source kernel unpack that modify the config to meet your needs and rebuild under mock with the appropriate parameters for the target system

8860
bash	subshell
note that it s actually better to put this in .bash_profile so you can override it for subshell but i m not sure that bash is necessarily run as a login shell as part of setting up the gnome environment

8865
switching	screens
when you switching user the screens is locked with the screensaver and gdm is started on the next virtual terminal

8866
redhat	fedora
fedora is the free version of redhat which in turn is more servers oriented

8875
sudoers	passwd
the few exceptions are files like etc shadow user passwd etc sudoers users having special permissions etc ppp chap-secrets ppp passwd or etc ssl private directory containing private ssl certificates and they normally come out-of-the-box with proper permissions

8876
gnome-terminal	stty
i would start by doing cat utf-8-file cat and bash will pass this file unchanged to the terminal well actually to stty stty will convert newline to carrage return newline etc. if this displays the file properly then gnome-terminal is setup

8876
ubuntu	debian
it was already set up in ubuntu 10.10 and debian 6 for me

8891
sudo	passwd
the second line sets the root passwd to never expire so that this doesn t happen and so that you can still use sudo su for example

8911
ssl	https	ssl	ocsp
ocsp is a way for programs that use x.509 certificates such as anything using ssl like web browsers for https urls to check whether a certificate has been revoked because it was compromised

8911
ssl	https
you re not seeing them when using https directly because you would need a packet tracer that can decrypt ssl and the ssl certificate used for encryption â â which in most cases you won t have

8956
mp3	flac
ideally i want to convert from mp3 to flac and back

8958
kde	gnome
i m not quite sure why that push died out but the package is still part of fedora and you can install it with yum install beagle-gnome if you are a gnome user or yum install kerry for the kde front-end

8960
ubuntu	debian
if you re running debian support for writing mp3 in sox is broken in lenny and squeeze and as far as i know the same problem affects ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10

8963
ubuntu	linux
i ve recently installed arch linux onto my primary ubuntu computer and it is working really well for me

it could be modified to only capture the output from the previous command using preexec and precmd hooks in zsh or an emulation of them in bash but that s more complicated to describe here

9039
inherited	properties
posix acls you can set in a directory properties users groups permissions modes to inherited setting the default mode for user and group will have the effect that you want

9048
debian	linux
i discovered this by completely installing debian again and carefully looking through the operations during that update well and the help of someone who knows much more about linux than i do

9060
disk	ram
disk access is much slower than ram access so every time the computer has to swap the program that caused it will have to pause while the data is transferred

9060
disk	ram
the computer spends all its time swapping data between disk and ram and little time actually accomplishing any work

9070
kde	gnome
xdg-mime is just a shell script that queries your desktop environment gnome kde or other and runs the appropriate command to get the mime type from that de s internal configuration

9072
ubuntu	debian
i m using debian 6 and ubuntu 10.04 10.10 currently so existing packages would be preferred but i ll also go for any other solutions if they are clearly superior

9077
saas	iaas
the provider is the iaas infrastructure as a service kind not saas software as a service

9077
freebsd	linux
other mta on linux freebsd

9078
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	rhel	suse	centos	linux
if you want to use linux try one of the long-term support options from ubuntu debian centos rhel or suse

9116
redhat	fedora
the greatest of these is likely redhat fedora and others i ve seen include canonical ubuntu novell suse a bunch of start-ups or even the gnome foundation

9120
punctuation	words
each words can be an arbitrary string a shell words can contain spaces and punctuation characters

9130
ubuntu	debian
it s available in recent debian ubuntu versions in package silversearcher-ag

9136
width	height
probably the width height colums rows of the original terminal form which you launched te tmux session is lower than that of the terminal you re attacching from

9149
centos	linux
when i need to create a new server i ve always chosen centos mainly for it s compatibility with red hat which i consider the standard de-facto for the general purpose linux server

9149
centos	linux
stay whit the old centos 5.5 or switch to the recently released scientific linux 6.0

9160
filesystems	xfs
that sets dev sda3 to partition type 83 which says it contains one of several linux-compatible filesystems xfs reiserfs.

9161
centos	linux
in my impression scientific linux is a lot more likely to accept get it working hacks and centos a bit more careful even if it means delay â as in the case of the centos 6 release

9161
centos	linux
it s pricey but not that pricey all considered and by their nature centos and scientific linux always have some latency in getting security updates out the door

9162
mouse	keyboard
i have somehow managed to get my keyboard only to work and be able to select with the mouse cursor only when the shift and control keys are held

9176
gentoo	ubuntu
on ubuntu i found the lib firmware directory as it is indicated in that page but i cannot find that directory on gentoo

9243
chgrp	chmod
if that s not an option you can change the group of the script using chgrp groupname path then make it executable for the group by chmod g+x path

9279
minix	linux	unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd	solaris	minix	bsd	minix
with that in mind every unix system v and direct descendants like bsd solaris mac os x etc.. or unix based operating system far descendants or alikes linux minix has its own implementations of the utilities described in the unix specification

9279
freebsd	linux
take a look at freebsd s and linux gnu coreutils

9304
disk	ram
optionally if you want to be extra cautious move the disk to another machine before continuing just in case of bad ram controller etc

9310
ubuntu	debian
debian lenny and ubuntu 8.04 used the old assignment

9310
ubuntu	debian
debian squeeze and ubuntu 10.04 used the new assignment

9313
folder	directory
if your new directory was the only file in the folder a quick double tab would give you the new directory without re-entering it

9315
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu have lib lsb init-functions

9317
redhat	fedora
on fedora and other redhat related distros that s provided by the redhat-lsb package which is optional

9323
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	ash	tcsh
it is one in c shell csh tcsh but not in bourne-style shells sh ash bash ksh zsh â . this is a call to the set built-in which sets the positional parameters etc

9325
vim	emacs
sorry about the vim emacs juxtaposition but i don t care which tool you use use the most convenient xargs emacs vi m just examples

9330
ucos	threadx
i have been working in embedded os like ucos threadx

9331
folder	directory
this results in only the creator of the file directory having write permissions on and the other member of the group i set up for sharing this folder only having read access

9348
cpu	processors
it uses a pentium ii processors which means it s cpu is between 233 mhz and 450 mhz i can t seem to find the exact number from within windows and 256 mb ram

9374
debian	linux
my personal flavor for linux kernel development is debian

9374
ubuntu	debian
as you probably guessed ubuntu doesn t bring nothing new to kernel ease kernel development afaik apart from what s already available in debian

9374
debian	linux
here are some links to get you started on common linux kernel development tasks in debian

9374
debian	linux
chapter 4 - common kernel-related tasks of debian linux kernel handbook

9374
debian	linux
chapter 10 - debian and the kernel of the debian gnu linux faq

9375
debian	linux
how can i configure my linux debian x so that i can easily and fastly output an euro symbol without messing my setup

9380
unix	solaris
the awk man page has -- in that context so maybe only old heirloom unix or solaris commands use - as a arguments - file names separator

9417
kde	gnome
and it will give you a good hands-on understanding of what you really need underneath the shiny kde or gnome hood to make the system actually work

9438
google-chrome	firefox
the system is able to resolve names say www.google.com when using a graphical browser like google-chrome or firefox

9456
sudo	passwd
i can sudo but i don t have the root passwd so i can t su root

9456
sudo	passwd
using sudo can i change the root passwd

9458
sudo	passwd
so you want to run something like sudo passwd root

9462
ubuntu	debian
the most visible one to me is that ubuntu treats sudo with greater regard than debian

9462
ubuntu	debian
during debian installation the default option is to set up root password as opposed to ubuntu installation

9463
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
but maybe you don t like ubuntu nor debian then try opensuse learn yast

9463
debian	linux
but if you re a relatively advanced linux user try debian

9464
ubuntu	debian
fortunately debian releases have been more frequent of late but there is still more delay and uncertainty than with ubuntu s steady 6-month release cycle

9464
ubuntu	debian
i would guess that ubuntu falls somewhere between debian stable and unstable in terms of security and stability

9469
daemon	cron
if you have root access you can stop the cron daemon and start it in debug mode

9472
ubuntu	debian
i know little about ubuntu so i ll mostly write about debian

9472
debian	linux
if i had to point to downsides it is obviously that packages in debian stable can get a little dated but as the linux kernel and its ecosystem moves towards maturity it is less of a big deal that it used to be

9472
ubuntu	debian
another thing is that the expected technical level in debian is perhaps a bit higher so the os holds your hand a bit less than ubuntu does

9473
sudoers	passwd
you can change all these options in sudoers file even make no passwd if you want i would not recommend this though

9476
ubuntu	debian
if you read changelogs you will see a lot of collaboration between debian and ubuntu

9476
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu reviewing of debian packages from debian to ubuntu

9476
ubuntu	debian
utnubu from ubuntu to debian

9476
ubuntu	debian
in my point of view debian testing is even more stable than an biannual ubuntu not lts

9481
stdout	stderr
the following will only log to stdout not stderr

9485
stdout	stderr
pd is an extension provided by some shells including bash to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same destination but it s not portable you should use dev null 2 1 instead

9492
debian	linux
the test machine is a pc running debian gnu linux with kernel 2.6.32 and coreutils 8.5

9499
bash	zsh
if you are using sh or dash instead of ksh93 bash or zsh you need to write like this instead

9499
bash	zsh
a more portable way of writing this that doesn t require bash or zsh or remembering all the above rules about null bytes again thanks to gilles

9517
google-chrome	firefox
if i want to have gnome applications as well as firefox and google-chrome access the network through a proxy i need only use gnome-network-properties a nice and simple gui i must say

9527
openbsd	linux
is there a preferred method to set up full-disk encryption under openbsd similar to dm-crypt under linux

9536
ubuntu	openbsd
in some nix distributions tested on openbsd and ubuntu the man page for the file system hierarchy can be useful

9536
put	get
in general different linux distributions are free to put things wherever they want to so it can get confusing quickly

9536
folder	directory
your my documents folder is somewhat parallel to your home directory on linux home user with the nice addition that most user specific configurations for programs like firefox thunderbird etc live here making moving to a new system fairly painless

9539
dia	visio
i used dia and umbrello both fine but not like visio

9543
stdout	stderr
take a look at retty which finds the stdin stdout and stderr of a process and attaches to them

9556
freebsd	solaris
they even release driver versions for freebsd and solaris

9567
profiling	benchmarking
and as a my college project i have to do profiling or benchmarking of a kernel modules based on various parameters

9589
ssl	https
many proxies are configured to allow connect only to port 443 https and they may check that the traffic they re relaying is actually ssl

9609
kde	gnome
you probably won t be able to run modern desktop environments like gnome or kde though especially given the memory limitations

9611
freebsd	linux
1 linux freebsd documentation for pam_lastlog

9611
freebsd	linux
2 linux freebsd lastlog 8 man pages

9612
centos	linux
i have a linux centos server the os+packages used around 5gb

9613
opera	firefox
however i ve seen xfce running with xubuntu 8.04 and 256 mb with 800 mhz - and i would recommend using lean software with it opera instead of firefox thunderbird abiword instead of openoffice no monitors disk net activity whether plugin ticker here ticker there gaijm+xchat+skype+...

9640
opera	firefox
firefox 2.0.x and opera 10.11

9640
versioning	upgrade
since i am not permitted to upgrade the os which would result in loss of important data i only want the earlier versioning of flash player rpm or tarball for linux fedora core 3

9646
stdout	stderr
but i want both stdout and stderr to be written to a file

9646
stdout	stderr
i want both stdout and stderr to end up in the same file

9649
spaces	delimiter
if your file is delimiter by commas followed by spaces then

9649
spaces	delimiter
if its delimiter by commas without spaces then

9651
stdout	stderr
when you use the construction both stderr and stdout get redirected to the file because the stdout redirection is set up before the stderr redirection

9651
stdout	stderr
if you invert order you can get stdout redirected to a file and then copy stderr to stdout so you can pipe it to tee

9652
freebsd	debian
debian 6 will also be available with the freebsd kernel

9659
debian	linux
this is a debian squeeze machine but it is probably similar for other linux distributions

9667
debian	linux
if you just want a usable system stick with debian linux for now

9667
openbsd	linux
once it graduates from technical preview status you may want to reexamine it if you have needs that are better fulfilled by bsd than linux such as zfs and the openbsd packet filter pf

9673
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	solaris	netbsd	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
frederik deweerdt has given a solution that works on gnu tar used on linux cygwin freebsd osx possibly others but not on other systems such as netbsd openbsd or solaris

9678
debian	linux
debian gnu linux is just one variant the most popular and advanced

9678
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude	debconf	dpkg	debconf	apt	debconf	aptitude
porting debian to non-linux kernels is useful for people users system administrators system developers etc who are using developing a non-linux kernel but would like to take advantage of the debian dpkg apt aptitude debconf the policy and gnu coreutils autotools bash gcc gdb etc tools

9685
ubuntu	centos
the --all or -a flag will show you all matches in your path and aliases at least on fedora ubuntu and centos

9685
solaris	aix
on aix and solaris this will get you close

9699
pop-up	dialog
on computer b it can find a but when it pop-up a dialog and ask me to enter the pin code on a i cannot see anywhere on a that i can enter the code

9714
chown	chmod
this is done by setting ld_preload to libfakeroot.so which provides wrappers around getuid chown chmod mknod stat ... thereby creating a fake root environment

9724
ubuntu	linux
runs on modern linux distributions fedora ubuntu etc.

9737
put	get
so you get the problem is there any way to put a regexp or something to en de

9748
gentoo	debian
however many other mainstream distributions such as debian gentoo etc

9749
sudo	passwd
it s not recommended since you can execute commands with administrative privileges using sudo and your user passwd

9759
unix	bsd
for example at t unix s eagain means the same thing as bsd s ewouldblock so they have the same value on systems that define both

9760
ubuntu	linux
i can t speak for all the linux distributions and i am not familiar with osx but ubuntu uses cryptsetup and lvm by default on the alternate install cd

9760
disk	ram
suspend to ram prevents the keys from hitting the disk but there are ways one can get past the screensaver password

9775
spaces	delimiter
accept_keywords spaces delimiter list of keywords

9793
ati	nvidia
amd ati have great hardware but their drivers are a notch below both intel s and nvidia s either open or closed source

9809
jobs	cron
we have several hundred queues used by unattended scripts and cron jobs running under system accounts that are not intended to recieve mail

9816
ubuntu	centos
i was looking at ubuntu server i was gonna do centos but im a little bit iffy as their latest release is taking a longgg time

9823
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
under linux using rename from the linux utilities rename.ul under debian and ubuntu

9823
ubuntu	debian
with the rename perl script that debian and ubuntu install as prename or rename

9826
vmware	virtualbox
you have many free implementations to choose from user mode linux virtualbox vmware kvm openvz vserver â and the disk space used by an extra system installation is minimal and you might need it for chroot anyway

9831
bash	zsh
note that in some shells ash bash pdksh but not ksh or zsh the right-hand side of a pipeline runs in a separate process so any variable you set in the loop is lost

9844
vmware	virtualbox
you could run your code in a virtual machine user mode linux vserver openvz virtualbox vmware kvm â that you provide with only a host-only network interface no routing from the vm to anywhere but the host machine

9848
bash	zsh
many programming features in bash and zsh mimic ksh s

9854
daemons	systemd
since the operating systemd already has this security feature daemons writers tend not to attempt to reimplement it

9856
kde	gnome
this problem only happens on my own linux os which does not use gnome or kde as its desktop

9858
bash	zsh
in bourne-derived shells sh ash bash dash zsh ... the exit code of the last-run program is in the variable

9865
filesystems	hfs+
this creates a â œfull fidelityâ archive for use on mac os x systems by preserving and later extracting all the information that the hfs+ filesystems can store

9896
mouse	keyboard
mouse keyboard keyboard-backlight

9926
stdout	stderr
it s also a direct duplicate of a stackoverflow question redirect stderr stdout of a process after it s been started using command line

9930
mouse	keyboard
my arch machine sometimes hangs suddenly not responding in any way to the mouse or the keyboard

9930
mouse	keyboard
at one temperature the mouse and keyboard stop working sometimes becoming functional after several minutes of cooling off

9933
kde	gnome
there are many choices how to do it -- for example you can use character map app present in gnome and kde for sure to get any character you want

9968
ubuntu	debian
this search was done on debian 6 but should be the same on ubuntu

9970
mp3	wav
command line tool that extracts the mp3 data to wav for example

9970
mp3	wav
program that encodes wav to mp3 data for example lame

9973
kde	gnome
ideally i would love something that i can add to session start for both gnome and kde

9977
ubuntu	debian
on debian or ubuntu and their derivatives see var log installer syslog for the definitive answer if it exists it is part of the log of the instillation

9994
bash	subshell
in most shells including bash each side of a pipeline runs in a subshell so any change in the shell s internal state such as setting variables remains confined to that segment of a pipeline

10013
kde	gnome
when i log out gdm kicks in and i can select other desktop than gnome -- among window managers there is kde4 as kde but no kde3

10034
mp3	wav
decoding from mp3 to wav lame

10034
mp3	wav
encoding from wav to mp3 lame

10054
freebsd	linux
btw maybe you want a linux system but if you don t care you could try freebsd it ill be nice for you

10056
stdout	stderr
most likely this is the result of tying stdout fd 1 and stderr fd 2 together so they both go to the same destination

10057
bash	zsh
there s no reason why you would change your .cshrc but you may want to change your .login so that text mode logins drop you into bash or even zsh if it s available

10058
gentoo	debian
i ve used debian gentoo and arch for a couple of years each

10070
ubuntu	linux
i have been using linux and ubuntu only since the last two months on my 2006 sony vaio vgn a617s laptop which is going pretty well on ubuntu 10.10

10078
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
check in var log kern.log on debian ubuntu other distributions might send kernel logs to a different file but usually under var log under linux

10108
kate	kde
as of kate 3.4.3 present in kde 4.4.3 you can not replace in multiple files at once but just in the one you re currently viewing calling edit- replace or with the ctrl+r shortcut

10126
ubuntu	debian
finding the location of the x authority file is harder because with gdm as set up under debian squeeze or ubuntu 10.04 it s in a file with a randomly generated name

10176
pow	sqrt
but i am pretty sure that i already used some math function like sqrt pow or log without having to specify the use of this shared library

10192
spaces	delimiter
and the path it prints is the same that gives except spaces delimiter rather than colon

10209
versioning	upgrade
is it possible to use yum to upgrade the os entirely to the latest versioning

10216
versioning	upgrade
this will download the correct versioning of all the rpms required and set everything up so that the system can upgrade itself when it reboots

10256
ubuntu	debian
on debian and therefore probably ubuntu running apt-get install python installs python-minimal and python which results in all core modules being installed which i assume is what you mean by the entire standard library

10258
gentoo	linux
arch linux doesn t have separate packages for -dev and it s binary unlike gentoo

10277
subtraction	addition
assume it s too late for that -- the tree already has commits that toggle the line endings of files so git diff shows the subtraction of the old file followed by the addition of a new file with the same content

10279
ubuntu	debian
i have not experienced anything like what you are describing with the default binding in .screenrc in aix fedora debian or ubuntu

10288
ubuntu	debian
works on debian and i guess ubuntu but i m not sure about the rest

10289
gentoo	linux
as a supplement to phunehehe s answer see the gentoo linux keychain guide for a guide to keychain

10292
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu should have a etc lsb-release which contains release info also and will show up with the previous command

10299
ubuntu	debian
i also found a bit more elegant way at least for debian ubuntu systems

10300
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian	slackware	suse
cover most cases afaik debian ubuntu slackware suse redhat gentoo bsd and perhaps others

10314
sudoers	passwd
set yourself up as a sudoers and disable the root passwd if you like

10338
versioning	upgrade
a new minor versioning can be installed and once completed the link to the old minor versioning is bumped to point to the new minor versioning immediately upgrading all new executions to use the upgrade library

10348
ubuntu	linux
some possible log files to explore found a ubuntu system but i would hope that they re present on most linux unix systems

10394
ubuntu	linux
is there a way to clear up what is displayed on the shell console in ubuntu linux in just a single key or two

10399
ubuntu	debian
debian secureapt ubuntu secureapt fedora

10404
ubuntu	debian
for example on debian ubuntu and derived distributions run dpkg -s to see what package libgio.so belongs to then apt-get source to get the source code of that package

10410
vim	emacs
is there a way i can see spaces and tabs wonderfully visualized in vim like i can in emacs by toggling whitespace-mode

10415
unsigned	short
this field on my system is an unsigned short which is 2 bytes and 16 bits

10419
octal	binary
for example read only access typically written r-- is stored as binary 100 or octal 4

10419
octal	binary
they are all stored together in the same variable rw-r----- meaning read-write for the owner read-only for the group and no access for others is stored as 110100000 binary 640 octal

10432
sudo	passwd
also if the machine reboots the mount command and the script have to be run again with sudo so you need to know the passwd

10439
folder	directory
there are only several files and folder in the root directory on windows

10441
sudoers	visudo
make sure you have something like that in etc sudoers use visudo to edit the file if you need to

10447
versioning	upgrade
what this error actually says is that the versioning of package-query that s installed depends on a lower versioning of pacman than the one you re trying to upgrade to

10460
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu linux

10475
freebsd	netbsd
some modern implementations gnu freebsd netbsd osx have tail -f which detects if a new file with the same name is moved into place and starts reading from the new file

10505
kde	gnome
you might find better performance by turning off some of the visual features or using a desktop environment that is lighter weight but 64 is enough to make even the heavyweights such as gnome and kde run

10515
cvs	svn
a second option is to use a version control system such as cvs svn git etc

10516
arp	icmp
have sudo tcpdump -ni ethx running on a terminal during all the testings and watch for dns traffic icmp messages or arp packets

10517
putty	winscp
i can use winscp putty mingw and other apps

10529
bash	zsh
if it s a shell built-in as it is in zsh but apparently not bash it is more likely to use the shell s environment and do the right thing.

10530
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
first off i d recommend just trying a distro you re interested fedora debian ubuntu or opensuse seem to be good choices for beginners and see if it s usable with the default settings

10541
ssl	https
squid has no real control and cannot participate in any kind of caching or modification of a ssl tls connection such as https outside of controlling which hosts and ports it can connect to

10549
gentoo	linux
i m running gentoo linux where the packages are distributes as source code if available so i started rebuilding each and every package on my system emerge -av --emptytree world still the same error

10553
ubuntu	debian
i used the 64 bit installer of debian live 6.0.1 and ubuntu 10.10

10558
ubuntu	debian
to a little extend you can try checkbashisms in debian ubuntu s devscripts package

10561
ubuntu	linux
some projects are just easier to run on linux like node.js. i only need the commandline so i run ubuntu in seamless mode

10575
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m using linux mint debian

10592
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried both firefox 4 and google-chrome 9 with no success however the page loaded fine on google-chrome in windows 7

10663
xfce	gnome
i ve found xfce s run dialog far superior to that of gnome

10664
debian	linux
so my question is how do i recall the file transfer history or whatever history i need on a debian linux system

10670
ubuntu	linux
i ve tried ubuntu 10.4 linux 9 same difference jolicloud pre-beta 1.0

10679
disk	ram
i put tmp on a tmpfs so the contents are stored in ram instead of on disk

10686
kde	gnome
you can still browse archives easily with gnome or kde virtual filesystems or with any program through avfs

10701
solaris	sunos
if you are not restricted by system gpl try dtrace on solaris sunos if not try systemtap eclipse + linuxtools or gprof if you have source code

10705
ubuntu	linux
in fact without -h or -p or -r shutdown is not supposed to turn the computer off it s supposed to drop into single user mode at least with the traditional linux sysvinit i don t know how compatible ubuntu s upstart is

10729
daemons	launchd
on mac os x thereâ s a handy daemons called launchd which amongst other things allows you to have scripts run when files or directories change via the watchpaths and queuedirectories plist file options

10729
debian	linux
is there a preferably debian linux program package that includes this functionality

10748
jobs	cron
the thing is when i run these jobs from bash everything works perfectly - cron just doesn t seem to be working

10753
cifs	smb
any incoming smbwritex call on a non-signed smb cifs connection greater than this value will not be processed in the normal way but will be passed to any underlying kernel recvfile or splice system call if there is no such call samba will emulate in user space

10753
cifs	smb
to enable posix large write support smb cifs writes up to 16mb this option must be nonzero

10760
chmod	mkdir
mkdir and chmod only need to be done once but the socket file will need to be recreated with ln on each x session

10783
bash	tcsh
at least according to my man page for both tcsh and bash touch is not mentioned

10783
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	freebsd	linux
however at first glance the -t argument seems to be identical on both my ubuntu linux machine and my freebsd machine

10783
ubuntu	linux
here is the format according to the man page for touch on ubuntu linux 8.04

10784
bash	zsh
this works in zsh but not in ksh or bash

10784
bash	zsh
the construct doesn t exist in all shells it s specific to bash ksh and zsh

post	get
you may get more specific advice if you post the exact legacy variants and versions you need to support.

10790
daemons	systemd
many systemd daemons behave oddly if they are invoked with a non-posix locale

10798
profiling	benchmarking
i did not find any specific driver for which i can do profiling and benchmarking

10810
fat	btrfs
the exact numbers depend on whether you are using ext2 ext3 ext4 fat ntfs btrfs etc and what settings were used when formatting the partition

10820
installation	downgrade
if that cause the downgrade to break use to force the installation of any required package or apt-get -f install when needed and restart the dist-upgrade process

10821
vmware	virtualbox
however virtualbox vms donâ t by default make the virtual machine accessible on the network whereas vmware seems to do so

10821
vmware	virtualbox
i havenâ t figured out how to turn on nat port forwarding for incoming connections to the virtualbox vm in the same way that vmware is set up

10846
redhat	fedora
fedora community distro supported by redhat which is so bleeding edge that it sometimes receives updates before module tarballs are available is a first-class gnome distro as a result

10863
bash	zsh
a somewhat faster version of alex s ctrl + a ctrl + k which moves to the front of the line and then cuts everything forward is to just use ctrl + u which cuts backward on bash and the entire line regardless of your current position on zsh

10864
bash	zsh
or if you are using vi bindings you can type # from command mode in both bash and zsh

10901
freebsd	debian
i have a debian backup server running the freebsd kernel and a zfs filesystem on which i store backups using zfs s snapshot and compression technologies

10901
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	debian
i was using nfs before when the backup server was open solaris but it seems debian doesn t support nfs when using the freebsd kernel.

10910
ubuntu	freebsd
i ve got mostly ubuntu servers but have a need for 2 freebsd boxes

10912
debian	linux
build operating system linux 2.6.32.29-dsa-ia32 i686 debian

10929
solaris	bsd
on most current unices either project1 file1 will already belong to lab1 like the directory it contains bsd or you can force this behavior linux solaris â

10943
ubuntu	debian
use it with caution though since ubuntu isn t 100 compatible with debian but for most cases there shouldn t be any issues

10985
ubuntu	linux
i m just moved to linux world in ubuntu 10.10

11002
ubuntu	debian
it s common debian practice to be in constant touch with their upstreams so each patch you find is because it s pending upstream inclusion or it needs to be kept separate debian specific and i expect these to minimal at least as compared to ubuntu

11039
kde	gnome
or x or kde or gnome abort

11046
bash	zsh
bash as well as ksh zsh and even ash track directory changes so that always takes you to foo even if bar is a symlink

11046
bash	zsh
if you really dislike the directory tracking feature you can turn it off with set -p in bash set -o no_chase_link in zsh

11059
777	tmp
chmod 777 tmp

11062
ubuntu	debian
you can install any like debian or ubuntu .

11075
ubuntu	linux
i have a ubuntu virtual machine on a 4gb usb memory stick with enough space for a copy of vmware player so i can have a full linux x eclipse development machine any time i need one

11084
move	drag
i can add remove and move around panels on the main screen but they ll never drag to the secondary screen

11086
filesystems	ntfs
if you have limited space on your backup device or a not compatible filesystems ntfs or it is a cifs mounted share you can create a compressed tar archive

11124
ubuntu	debian
gilles was really close just ever-so-slightly off the mark for ubuntu 10.10 i don t have any reason to doubt he s right for debian squeeze and possibly others

11124
folder	directory
by mounting my read-write snapshots directory under a folder that other users cannot access var smb hidden snapshots where var smb hidden has permissions 770 and is owned by root root i can protect the read-write mount from other users

11176
google-chrome	firefox
how to resolve it for google-chrome this seems to be a resolution for firefox

11176
ubuntu	linux
the reason i posted here is that this only happens to me on my linux ubuntu - not on windows

11186
switching	screens
if you find that you divide your screens between unobscured windows often you may want to switching to a tiling window manager

11206
ubuntu	debian
what would be a better choice for a web server debian or ubuntu

11206
postgresql	mysql
i mainly use python postgresql with nginx and sometimes php mysql

11223
ubuntu	debian
in case it matters i am running the terminal on ubuntu and connecting to a debian server via ssh

11255
ubuntu	linux
what is the best bsd distro for desktop usage some thing like ubuntu linux which is easy to use and good gui management instead of command line system management

11260
debian	linux
debian 6 has multiple linux kernel packages and i m interested in two of them

11267
debian	mint	debian	linux
i have been using linux mint debian with debian unstable and noticed that when i press restart instead of going all the way back to the bios then grub then booting up i seem to be shutting down then loading back up without going back to the bios or grub

11281
chown	chmod
assuming you re using apache you could chown the files to apache apache or www-data www-data depending on your distro and then chmod them to ug+wr and o-wrx

11285
ubuntu	mint
since distros like ubuntu and mint make it easy by essentially giving the main user easy access to root via a password i m not really sure what its intended use is

11287
sudo	passwd
for basic operation â running commands as root â the most visible difference between sudo and su is that sudo requires the user s passwd and su requires root s passwd

11287
sudo	passwd
this is possible because sudo doesn t require any authentication other than perhaps confirming that you are you by typing your passwd â but that s subtly different from authenticating your user for a task

11288
sudo	passwd
the biggest difference is that with sudo you don t need the root passwd to run a command as root as you would for su

11288
sudoers	passwd
you do need the root passwd to add someone to the sudoers file but thereafter that person can run all or some if you ve restricted it as root without requiring a further passwd

11288
sudoers	visudo
you should edit etc sudoers with the command visudo

11310
gentoo	debian
but i am looking for an alternative to distributions like gentoo arch debian etc

11313
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux lets you build exactly what you want

11317
gentoo	linux
several other linux distros like archlinux and gentoo specialize in being either lightweight or tailored to your needs

11325
switching	screens
is there a way to set tmux so that it automatically adjusts window width when i switching to the pane so that it will be wide axactly as the longest visible on screens line in the file i have open

11330
unix	solaris
some people will just say linux is unix or say linux solaris something else and other unix-like oses

11333
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu all you need is apt-get install fail2ban iirc not able to check now default settings block an ip for half an hour after 4 attempts

11346
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i m pretty much ready to convert over to linux mint my main decision is between the ubuntu based version or the debian one

11346
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
my main question is if i can install ubuntu packages and packages from launchpad on lmde linux mint debian edition

11346
ubuntu	debian
is it possible to essentially use debian like ubuntu except keep it rolling

11351
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu are pretty good at upgrades as long as you don t do anything to make them fail like tweak things in usr

11351
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu use the same package format and they often use the same package names so it s sometimes possible to use a package intended for one system on the other

11386
filesystems	hfs+
the ubuntu filesystems is ext4 and the external drive is hfs+ mac os extended journaled

11397
debian	linux
i m connecting to my linux boxes primarily debian squeeze using putty for windows

11401
bash	zsh
if your shell is bash or zsh you can obtain the terminal width from the columns shell variable and pass it to aptitude

11415
width	height
get the screen width and height to make the window as large as possible to display almost all files found if they fit the screensize

11430
put	get
to get you going quickly with autofs i put the following line in etc auto.master

11451
debian	mint
i m using debian mint and my internet has worked everywhere on earth home mcdonalds other peoples homes except at school where i really need it

11453
sysv	systemd
the most common are systemd sysv lsb and upstart but there are others

11456
bash	zsh
here are the lists for bash s builtins they are also listed in the bash man page and zsh s builtins

11460
bash	zsh
advanced shells such as bash ksh and zsh typically have more built-ins often to implement non-standard features usually for interaction

11460
bash	zsh
note that posix allows time to be an external utility with ordinary parsing or a keyword that applies to a whole pipeline which it is in ksh bash in zsh

11479
freebsd	linux
in particular are there any major differences between installing and setting up freebsd and a linux distro

11481
chown	chgrp
an name consisting solely of digits is a bad idea â chown and chgrp are supposed to treat a digit sequence as a name if it s in the user group database but other applications may treat any number as a numerical id

11521
ubuntu	linux
you run it on your ubuntu machine to generate a â œsignature fileâ then run it under either linux or windows to download packages as directed by the â œsignature fileâ and finally run it on ubuntu again to install the downloaded packages

11521
ubuntu	debian
two other packages that might help are apt-zip install apt-zip somewhat similar to apt-offline and aptoncd install aptoncd designed to make custom debian ubuntu package cds

11528
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
since these mechanisms work differently in shells you should usually use this tag together with the tag corresponding to your shell bash ksh tcsh zsh â

11528
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
some shells have a different feature known as history expansion bash history substitution tcsh or history expansion zsh sequences beginning with

11530
folder	directory
i m trying to add to the path the bin folder inside wherever the makefile directory is

11533
qmail	exim
i know there s software like exim qmail or others to do this but i do not want to install big software that eats performance in the host

11536
installation	upgrade
i upgrade my suse 10.3 installation to 11.4 using the update option from a network installation disk

11606
zsh	tcsh	tcsh	dash
if you re using a different login shell such as tcsh or dash or zsh you ll need to check its manpage to see what files it reads and executes on startup and add the command there

11609
ubuntu	debian
it might be in ubuntu debian but i don t know about that

11620
ubuntu	debian
i wondered about some missing space on my ext3 partition and after some googling found that debian based ubuntu reserves 5 of the size for root

11648
vim	emacs
if there is metadata html xml tex inputenc emacs â in the file advanced editors like emacs or vim are often able to parse that metadata

11649
solaris	bsd
should compile as is under solaris and bsd

11660
ubuntu	linux
note that in general the linux philosophy and especially the ubuntu philosophy is that common maintenance tasks should happen automatically without your needing to intervene

11668
mouse	keyboard
i can run windows in a vmware session or via rdp fullscreen on one display and treat the other display as though it were a totally separate ubuntu computer except that they share the keyboard and mouse

11679
kde	kubuntu
check out kubuntu which basically is ubuntu using kde

11681
kde	gnome
you could run gnome on one and kde on the other or twm on one and awesome on another

11717
kde	gnome
right now i m using the kde desktop on fedora but i want to switch to gnome

11718
kde	gnome
you can probably kill the gnome panel and start kde s version of it but switching the whole desktop is complicated by the session manager

11730
kde	gnome
back before session managers and desktop environments like gnome and kde it was possible to swap out the running window manager

11730
kde	gnome
you could get one going and login to gnome on console 7 and have another full blown x server on console 8 with kde and switch back and forth on a wim with ctrl + alt + f7

11733
put	get
ok this work when i enter this manually at shell prompt but when i put exactly the same line in shell script and then run the script i get error

11757
chown	chmod	filesystems	ntfs
what i need is to be able to save a linux file with its chown and chmod settings to a ntfs filesystems and be able to retrieve this information back

11757
chown	chmod
why have chmod and chown no effect

11757
chown	chmod
i don t know how to install and run the driver ntfs-3g to allow chown chmod and anything else that is needed to make that possible

11769
puts	gets
everything gets installed into the right place for the packager but the sed call puts the path of my local packaging directory into the script which then gets placed verbatim in the package

11771
bash	zsh
i ve changed my login shell to zsh from bash on an installation of debian squeeze with xfce

11811
kde	gnome
both gnome and kde have the option to automatically mount removable volumes when they re connected

11817
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu came along and said we take debian unstable make it more stable add all the latest gadgets drivers etc and release it

11817
ubuntu	debian
note that i gladly use ubuntu on the desktop but i stick to debian stable for servers

11818
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is a derivative of debian it uses debian as a base and adds it s own software look

11818
debian	linux
debian is also meant for more advanced users it s not meant to be anyones first operating system or an easy just open and browse the web os it s meant to be a powerful linux machine

11837
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
i ve setup a pure openbox system with no specific desktop environment like gnome kde or xfce etc.

11846
ubuntu	debian
kde apps are written using qt so you need to use a qt configuration tool package qt4-qtconfig in debian ubuntu

11850
kde	gnome
yes there is openoffice.org impress libreoffice impress which are pretty much the same thing and there is kpresenter as a part of koffice.org suite mainly for kde although it works in gnome

11852
debian	linux
if you have the bsd utility column debian ships it i don t know about other linux distributions you can easily format things in columns with column -t -s

11872
temp	tmp
save to a temporary file in tmp or wherever close the editor then dump the contents of temp file into the file you were editing

11886
ppm	pbm
i used pdf2xml and it pulls out the images in jpeg ppm pbm and vec formats

11886
ppm	pbm
i see the regular images being extracted for the most part as jpeg ppm pbm but i don t see the graphs being there - and so i am guessing that pdf2xml is storing them as .vec files

11902
debian	linux	installation	upgrade
i ve upgrade my linux installation to kernel 2.6.38-2 debian testing

11906
folder	directory
the problem is that bash s built-in tab completion seems to be centered around the current directory so if i m in a folder that isn t n then my tab completion fails -- or worse completes to the wrong thing since perhaps i have a file named footastic in snafu meaning i type and instead of seeing i look at my input and see

11930
hash	md5
afaik it supports better hash mechanisms like md5 or sha1

11930
crypt	hash
not sure but there may be a problem with the in your crypt hash

11951
pull	push
there are no version control systems on the cluster so i can t just pull a repository from my own machine and work on the assignment then push it and remove what s on the cluster each time i work

11954
bsd	xnu
mac os x for example uses a capacity of 16384 bytes by default but can switch to 65336 byte capacities if large write are made to the pipe or will switch to a capacity of a single system page if too much kernel memory is already being used by pipe buffers see xnu bsd sys pipe.h and xnu bsd kern sys_pipe.c

11986
freebsd	linux
this is why it is much easier to port an application from say freebsd to linux than it is to port it from freebsd to windows though windows ostensibly supports a subset of posix.

11993
bash	zsh
in bash â 4 or zsh you don t need the external find command for a simple name match you can use

11996
unix	bsd
this has caused a good part of the bsd code to be included with various commercial unix forks

11996
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
freebsd netbsd openbsd are all forks of 4.3bsd that are a complete operating system and have none of the original at t source code

11996
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
the socket api used on unix was developed on bsd and the unix fast filesystem code was borrowed and used on various unix operating systems like solaris with their own enhancements

11996
unix	bsd
linux was developed in 1991 but was developed from scratch unlike bsd and uses the existing gnu project which is a clean-room implementation of much of the unix user-space

12005
hid	keyboard
i was able to unbind the keyboard from hid

12013
bash	zsh
if you don t have bash or zsh you just have ksh or you want a way that works in all modern shells this is how i do it

12022
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu it should be apt-get install libpam-krb5

12022
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu that requires installing libpam-ssh

12028
ubuntu	linux
there are 2 linux distros on my pc an ubuntu 10.04 and a fedora 14

12035
bash	zsh
is there a way to get zsh to do the equivalent of bash s show-all-if-ambiguous without the cycling

12047
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
if your unix variant supports fuse linux bsd osx solaris all do mount avfs to access archives transparently

12068
stdout	stderr
i do not want to throw away the output of the executed command but it will not really matter whether it ends up on stdout or stderr

12070
stdout	stderr
with time the command output comes out on stdout and the time comes out on stderr

12086
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
a filesystems files organized as a directory tree and stored in a format such as ext2 ext3 ffs fat ntfs â

12086
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
disk-backed filesystems such as ext2 ext3 ffs fat ntfs â

12086
unix	solaris
the proc filesystem over which some unix variants such as solaris and linux expose information about processes is mounted on proc so that proc 42 environ designates the file 42 environ on the proc filesystem which on linux at least contains a read-only view of the environment of process number 42

12087
bash	zsh
tested with dash 0.5.5.1 pdksh 5.2.14 bash 3.2.39 bash 4.1.5 ksh 93s+ zsh 4.3.10

12091
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
this uses special platform-specific code so only certain oses are supported at this time darwin os x freebsd linux openbsd and solaris

12115
put	get
if you put up an old version of some cms and don t patch it it will get scanned and exploited

12126
ubuntu	centos
i m not 100 sure if ubuntu does this but centos does

12151
ubuntu	debian
by default in recent releases of debian and ubuntu including yours etc motd is a symbolic link to var run motd which is regenerated at each login by the update-motd framework

12152
openbsd	freebsd
on openbsd there is hw.uuid but that s not available on freebsd

12159
versioning	upgrade
the simple answer is to either upgrade libatk or find an older versioning of mysql workbench

12161
irssi	mirc
i m not too sure about weechat but it s possible in mirc and irssi using my patch

12170
kde	gnome
i tested this on redhat enterprise linux 6 with kde but i would like to know how to do it in gnome as well

12184
bash	zsh
that one works in bash and zsh

12200
ubuntu	debian
for example on debian ubuntu

12248
ubuntu	debian
it is also available in debian and so presumably ubuntu with

12255
bash	zsh
is a ksh extension to the bourne syntax that was picked up by bash and zsh but not by posix

12264
move	drag
middle chord + alt + control + shift resize drag pointer to side or corner and move that side or corner

12265
des	rsa	des	aes	rsa	aes
this is one of the reasons rsa is used in combination with a symmetric key cipher like des or aes

12265
rsa	aes
you can generate a random 256 bit key for aes and encrypt that key with a 1024 bit rsa public key

12265
des	aes
furthermore des and aes are block ciphers

12265
des	aes	128bit	64bit
des uses 64bit blocks and aes uses 128bit blocks

12265
put	get
an attacker can easily guess that an ssl connection to port 443 is probably a webpage request starting with get and he could flip bit changing it to put without interfering with the rest of the encryption

12272
ubuntu	linux
the ubuntu unity search bar is definitely the closest thing on linux to spotlight though.

12273
bash	zsh
i ve heard that zsh has echo -e u0965 but i use bash 4.1

12273
bash	zsh
is there something as simple as the zsh method for bash

12275
ubuntu	linux
i m not sure if that hardware will work under linux ubuntu suse fedora arch etc.

12297
jobs	cron
while ssh-agent is running all your processes including your cron jobs shouldn t need a password

12311
bash	zsh
i m interested in solutions for both zsh and bash

12341
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade to the latest versioning of dokuwiki and i m finding that the easiest way to do this is to install the upgrade plugin and just click a few buttons

12358
ubuntu	debian
support for bash completion is provided in debian and ubuntu by the bash completion package

12360
vim	emacs
some just use this fire vim or emacs and get a distraction-free writing environment so that they can concentrate on their work on the text itself or on the code

12360
ubuntu	linux
my point is that you can customize every layer to work and appear as you like and that you must understand the behaviour you had on ubuntu or any other linux distribution is the result of all these layers

12370
apache	lighttpd
this web server can be apache lighttpd ngingx and maybe another one

12370
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian use www-data as i said

12390
debian	linux
i have a linux server running under debian lenny with 4go of ram

12395
chown	sudo
sudo chown root root usr local bin md5

12407
freebsd	linux
regarding the os unless you have an existing support team with linux or freebsd experience your choice should be a pragmatic one based on that which you have most experience and the ease with which you can obtain support or help if you have problems

12407
debian	linux
if you will be the sole supporter and have little experience with both i would recommend the latest stable debian linux because it is well-documented and is straightforward to get advice for common configurations of os mail server imap server and firewall

12417
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
the settings should apply to all desktop environement xfce kde gnome and terminals

12425
gentoo	linux
gentoo is a computer operating system built on top of the linux kernel and based on the portage package management system

12426
gentoo	linux
gentoo is a source-based linux distribution designed to be automatically optimized and customized according to the user s need

12434
versioning	upgrade
if you want to stick with portupgrade portupgrade --all will upgrade all ports that have newer versioning available

12437
ubuntu	debian	dpkg	apt
apt apt the debian debian high-level package management suite over dpkg and ported to other low-level packagers also used by other distributions such as ubuntu ubuntu

12437
ubuntu	debian
dpkg the debian debian low-level package manager also used by other distributions such as ubuntu ubuntu

12437
redhat	fedora	rhel	suse	centos	linux
rpm a low-level package manager originally developped by redhat now used by many distributions including rhel redhat enterprise linux centos centos fedora fedora suse suse â

12437
rpm	yum	redhat	fedora	centos	linux
yum a high-level package manager over rpm originally from yellowdog linux used by many rpm-based distributions including rhel redhat enterprise linux centos centos and fedora fedora

12439
stdout	stderr
i want to set my terminal up so stderr is printed in a different color than stdout

12439
stdout	stderr
note this question was merged with another that asked for stderr stdout and the user input echo to be output in 3 different colours

12440
stdout	stderr
this is a harder version of show only stderr on screen but write both stdout and stderr to file

12440
stdout	stderr
the applications have two output ports stdout and stderr but they re both connected to the same channel

12440
stdout	stderr
this means that if some output destined to stdout arrives just as some output for stderr is being displayed the output will be miscolored

12440
stdout	stderr
in practice if that s applicable i suggest redirecting stderr to stdout and piping into a pattern-based colorizer such as colortail or multitail or special-purpose colorizers such as colorgcc or colormake

12450
ubuntu	linux
the default permissions on my ubuntu linux computer allows for anyone to run wall and it will send messages to anyone who hasn t opted out with mesg n

12451
chgrp	chmod
if you and everyone you want to talk to happen to be a member of a group that the h4x0r is not in it s possible you could chgrp mygroup dev myterminal to set the file s group then chmod 620 dev myterminal to set the permissions

12451
chgrp	chmod
finally for more info just in case you don t know already try the man command -- man chmod man chgrp etc

12455
switching	screens
i m working with emacs on the terminal and i use screens to switching between terminals

12462
kate	kde	kate	gnome	kde	gnome
for syntax highlighting etc for kate which is originally for kde running on gnome 3

12463
mtu	pppoe
i calculated the -s parameter assuming your pppoe ip mtu is 1300 bytes

12469
ubuntu	debian
what are the main advantages of using debian instead of ubuntu

12474
post	get
generally they will just use the drivers to set different sensitivities on the capture chip and do post processing to get a reasonably lighted picture

12487
ubuntu	debian
you d have to further distinguish between debian stable and testing unstable and between following all ubuntu releases or only lts releases

12487
ubuntu	debian
debian stable and ubuntu lts release only every couple of years

12487
ubuntu	debian
i prefer to go with debian stable on my machines but recommend ubuntu to others and tend to use ubuntu on newer hardware especially laptops

12492
ubuntu	linux
try alt+f2 and type gksudo gedit etc environment if running linux gtk this is what you have if using ubuntu

12493
versioning	upgrade
this provides a great deal of flexibility in how you decide to upgrade or stay with a certain versioning of a package or an entire release

12495
ubuntu	debian
these logs would be on var log kern.log at least on debian and ubuntu

12510
ubuntu	debian
answer to this question should be the list of applications and paths to those configuration files i m especially interested in ubuntu debian based system but you can describe some other system but ubuntu is preferred

12515
stdout	stderr
you probably need to redirect stdout as well as stderr to your file

12518
hid	keyboard
there are more layers if you count the kernel which has to map at keyboard scancodes to a xt-style keycode or a usb keyboard hid code to a keycode

12518
integer	unsigned
a keycode is simply an 8-bit unsigned integer which the kernel of an operating system passes to the x11 server

12518
freebsd	linux
most operating systems including dos windows linux freebsd and the bios all map scancodes into much simpler xt-style scancodes

12528
bash	zsh
if you only want to perform the replacement in a set of files such as c files you can restrict the matches that works in either bash â 4 or zsh

12538
freebsd	netbsd
current gnu coreutils read the exact count with head -c but freebsd and netbsd use stdio.

12551
filesystems	hfs+
the filesystems are ext4 or hfs+

12566
ubuntu	debian
as the path of least friction i recommend installing an older version of debian or ubuntu in a chroot

12566
ubuntu	debian
debian or ubuntu comes with a package to assist with installing another system in a chroot schroot successor of dchroot

12566
ubuntu	debian
in how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

12573
puts	gets
ncftp comes with two tools ncftpget and ncftpput for simple batches of gets or puts

12578
ubuntu	debian
i need to do this on debian ubuntu

12579
dpkg	apt
in general dpkg and apt don t seem to track the installation date going by the lack of any such field in the dpkg-query man page

12582
installation	upgrade
as long as it hasn t rotated away it keeps track of all apt installation upgrade and removals with an annotation for packages marked as automatically installed

12590
solaris	aix
had to reset my password on a couple of client servers today and despite following the rules i get the message your password failed to meet minimum of 2 non-alphabetic characters back from the aix server the solaris box doesn t give error messages so just keeps prompting for new password

12591
solaris	aix
i will do some hunting around to see if this is applicable to all aix and solaris versions but i hadn t managed to find an answer when googling through the ibm manuals available

12599
put	get
i installed lame from rpmfusion to get mp3 support in dolphin but the cd i put in comes up with the wrong information

12611
ubuntu	debian
look for something geared towards a desktop ubuntu or debian or fedora perhaps

12622
debian	mint	debian	linux
and maybe you can have a look a linux mint the one that is based on debian that is

12631
debian	linux
for a gnu linux system i usually recommend debian because it s stable and the installer is straightforward to use

12634
bash	zsh
if you also want to match files in subdirectories in zsh or bash â 4 you can use

12645
min	max
it detects driveable fans and temperature sensors and asks you min max temps for cpu and min max fan speed you want

12665
xfce	gnome
have tried many windows managers including twm xfce and gnome but my mouse pointer is gone

12669
vmware	virtualbox
another approach i use when testing software deployments or custom installation disks is to use a virtual machine like virtualbox or vmware workstation

12677
cvs	svn
also for the web developers they should be developing in some sort of version control cvs svn git etc. on a different machine than the production web server then checking it out on the server

12687
folder	directory
to be more exactly than that extracting directory structures except for the top one you will need to know the name of the folder inside the zip that you want to skip creating and specifically ask unzip to extract the contents of that folder

12704
gentoo	ubuntu
now i imagine gentoo and ubuntu might have different ways of organizing their manfiles but i think it is worth a shot for you to check if you got some man-page related package not installed on your host

12714
jobs	cron
all the implementations of cron that i know of re-read etc crontab every minute as often as they execute jobs

12714
jobs	cron
so the â œreal-actualâ cron jobs are the ones in the crontab file

12714
jobs	cron
there are or were a few buggy implementations of cron that check for jobs to execute first and only then check the crontabs

12715
google-chrome	firefox
...how can i ensure that there will not be incidents like just theory a firefox package comes out in the google-chrome repo and because just theory again it has a newer version then the one that s in the original repos it gets installed when updating

12742
solaris	sunos
it was meant to ease people migrating from sunos 4 to solaris 2 a couple of decades ago but doesn t make much sense these days

12748
post	get
so the issue as described in caleb s post was that alexander deleted or possibly modified etc init.d apache2 and wanted to get it back

12748
ubuntu	debian
linking to ubuntu s dpkg 1.16 page because i could not find the debian squeeze man pages online

12748
dpkg	apt
if we are invoking dpkg via apt we need to pass these options to apt

12753
centos	linux
i am installing a new version of java on a centos rhel linux distro for a single developer to develop java

12762
bash	zsh
bash and zsh and other suggestions won t help here

12773
fat	xfs	fat	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs	xfs	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+
for supported filesystems extx reiserfs reiser4 xfs jfs fat ntfs hfs+ and bsd s ufs it will only clone or image the used blocks which can save you quite a bit of time

12780
fink	macports
it turned out that if you use the original dvd that comes with your machine and reinstall your os all your applications home directory custom modifications macports and fink installations preferences network mounts network locations developer tools all are preserved

12797
zsh	tcsh
i just switched to zsh from tcsh and have only run into one serious frustration there are multiple completions for push â pushd and pushln

12800
ubuntu	linux
i am using wine to run u-center a gps visualizer and i have a linux computer running ubuntu

12805
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu ships dchroot from the debian buildd project which makes running a chrooted system easy

12816
daemons	systemd
these files are often used by daemons that should only be run once on a systemd

12835
centos	linux
centos is a close of red had enterprise linux which does not include applications like rtorrent

12835
redhat	fedora
my personal suggestion is to use fedora which is still based on the redhat architecture but includes a much wider range of packages including rtorrent

12845
chgrp	chmod
note that you have to do the chgrp chmod for every subdirectory

12845
children	parent
also note that umask is a process attribute and applies to all files created by that process and its children which inherit the umask in effect in their parent at fork time

12850
debian	linux
if it matters my linux version is debian gnu linux 5.0

12876
switching	screens
looks like the screens size is getting reset previously set to 28 rows before switching

12894
folder	directory
once acl is set up all files and directory in the folder will have group permissions rw and so raul from one installation and ricardo from the other installation will both be able to read and write to that folder

12907
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian

12907
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu debian select your font from usr share consolefonts and then edit etc default console-setup and add an entry like

12932
udp	tcp
the ports on which the lan machines are listening or communicating both tcp and udp

12934
freebsd	solaris
solaris xnu mac freebsd and dragonfly are notable

12934
darcs	fossil	bazaar	fossil
mercurial fossil bazaar darcs is a good idea mostly for code and small important files

12940
disk	ram
ldd used to at least have exercises where you wrote virtual drivers ram disk and virtual network devices

12946
daemons	systemd
i have created a process and it is running in the background as a daemons it.now i want that only root should be able to view the output of that process.my process is something like top which accumulate data from the systemd and show systemd statistics when asked for and i want is that systemd statistics should be shown only to the root

12956
ubuntu	debian
x86_64 debian or ubuntu installation

12957
ubuntu	debian
since ubuntu 11.04 and debian wheezy 7.0 debian and ubuntu have multiarch support you can mix x86_32 i386 and x86_64 amd64 packages on the same system in a straightforward way

12957
ubuntu	debian
in older releases debian and ubuntu ship with a number of 32-bit libraries on amd64

12957
ubuntu	debian
it is worded in terms of installing a 32-bit ubuntu inside a 64-bit ubuntu but should apply with minor modifications to other situations such as installing debian unstable inside debian stable or vice versa

12957
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu ship schroot a utility that wraps around this feature to create a more usable sub-environment

12957
ubuntu	debian
a similar setup should work with other releases of debian and ubuntu

12957
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu services start automatically on installation

12969
put	get
one problem with this approach is that it doesn t create any subdirectories so all files get put in otherdir and files that are named the same but in different parts of the mydir tree don t get copied

12973
bash	zsh
i your shell is bash â 4 or zsh

12980
debian	linux
the issue is that i am a very strict user of debian gnu linux

13005
debian	linux
the keyboard could be blocked with nohup cat dev tty0 on some linux distributions but it s not working on debian

13027
gentoo	linux
i just upgraded my gentoo linux computer where i m running xvnc from tigervnc 1.0.90 1.1 beta 1 compiled myself against xorg-server 1.9.5 and i m no longer getting any bell sounds just silence

13031
ubuntu	debian
if you re using debian ubuntu or another distribution based on apt you can execute apt-get --reinstall install

13046
centos	linux
pasted below this question is a sample of a etc hosts file from a linux centos and a windows machine

13059
google-chrome	firefox
you can also load google-chrome into a running process firefox -chrome file â

13082
overwrite	preserve
-pp preserve permissions and -k says not to overwrite existing files

13093
pull	push
basically i have an archive which contains a file at data data com.myapp.backup . files settings.txt and i d like to pull that file from the archive already done and push it back into the archive once the edit has been done

13110
chown	chgrp
you can change the ower and group to an existing owner and group with the commands chown and chgrp respectively

13137
integer	unsigned
each 8-byte word is to be interpreted as a 64-bit little-endian unsigned integer

13144
ubuntu	linux
i am inheriting about 20 linux servers running different versions of ubuntu 7 and above

13145
ubuntu	linux
and is there a better package manager like ubuntu s for linux

13154
daemons	systemd
however it will only do this if the systemd is ready for shutdown - all daemons and user processes should be stopped file systemd unmounted etc

13170
bazaar	git
specifically use distributed revision control software such as bazaar git or mercurial

13171
cpu	processors
almost all desktop laptop and server computers have an x86 processors made by intel or amd as their cpu

13171
x86	64bit	ia-32	x86
x86-64 also known as amd64 a 64bit architecture found in most recent x86 processors which retains ia-32 as a subset

13218
sudoers	passwd
so what i m trying to create is a script that creates an account adds a passwd and adds the users under etc sudoers

13236
centos	linux
how do i set the same ip properties on a linux machine i use centos using terminal

13252
exif	xmp
there is a lot of option for exif xmp iptc

13294
children	parent
however when a process dies its children are adopted by init so you will see a lot of processes whose parent is 1 on a typical system

13302
openbsd	linux	openbsd	aix
i ve used this tactic successfully on everything from aix to caldera linux to openbsd

13316
wan	lan
i own an asus wl-520gu 4 lan 1 wan wifi 1 usb 4mb flash rom 16mb ram

13331
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
this works in bash and in tcsh and when i do run ls from zsh

13334
debian	linux
i have a selfmade init.d script on a linux box that worked fine with debian 4 and debian 5 but with debian 6 fresh install it gets only executed at system boot but not before rebooting

13344
centos	linux
i want to use a red hat enterprise linux rpm software package on centos 5.6 but i don t know which version of rhel works with centos 5.6

13345
filesystems	ntfs
i only have read-only access to my external hard-drive which is using ntfs filesystems

13346
filesystems	ntfs
you need to install the ntfs-3g filesystems driver and mount your drive using that instead of your current ntfs driver

13372
freebsd	linux
i ve just recently set up a freebsd 8.2 server after mostly working with linux and i had the exact same frustration with vi

13372
freebsd	linux
the problem is that freebsd comes with very different defaults for vi than most linux distros

13375
smarthost	exim
install a local mta such as exim and configure it to use a smarthost in this case either your isp s mail server or google s the latter possibly better if you are concerned about the smtp reputation of your home ip

13397
filesystems	ntfs
both are formatted with ntfs filesystems

13400
filesystems	ntfs
i ve found it to be an excellent piece of software and it allows write access to ntfs filesystems too

13409
bash	zsh
bash and zsh give a message â œbad interpreterâ instead of â œcommand not foundâ in this case.

13462
ubuntu	linux
for example on ubuntu and most other linux distributions this is provided by the acct package install acct

13463
bash	zsh
in zsh or bash â 4

13471
put	get
i ve tried the following put a line in my .cshrc file using what they say is the default format but i get an error every time i source

13480
debian	linux
i have a debian linux lenny lamp server w plesk panel 10.2

13481
postfix	dovecot
i am trying to set up postfix with dovecot

13482
min	max
a window manager s task is to do window placement layout tiling overlapping resizing ... add decorations min max close buttons window menu pretty title bar ... deal with input focus policies focus follow mouse for instance and that s about it

13521
ubuntu	linux
this page gives some ubuntu 10.04.2 lts focused insight into the workings of pam but it appears to be aimed at the more experienced linux user

13528
stdout	stderr
for starters the stdout from the application will be line-buffered to tty or buffered to a pipeline but stderr is unbuffered so relationships between the order of output are broken as far as a reader is concerned

13528
stdout	stderr
ordering of output across stdout stderr is a well-known - classic perhaps - problem

13533
stateless	stateful
with grep sed and awk my general rule is that for matching and simple extraction use grep for stateless re-writing use sed and for stateful modifications use awk

13534
ubuntu	linux
is there some kind of clever diff tool that i can run on an installation of linux ubuntu to give me a heads-up on how that machine has veered from the default installation

13535
filesystems	ntfs
first in order to work with ntfs a proprietary filesystems you need to install ntfs-3g

13539
ubuntu	linux
i use linux ubuntu

13549
filesystems	ntfs
you can create a file in the ntfs filesystems and then check if this file exists

13550
ubuntu	debian
in the words of the debian policy manual which defines the packaging format introduced by debian and also used by ubuntu

13552
filesystems	ntfs
you should not compare ext4 and ntfs in this way without a very big but specifying all the design and structural differences between filesystems and also specifics of each implementation how each driver reports free space to the vfs layer

13552
filesystems	ntfs
there are many copies of critical data spread through the partition while some other filesystems i can t say for ntfs may render all your data unreadable if a failure happens on the right spot

13552
filesystems	ntfs
also ext4 reserves a lot of space for your data right at filesystems creation stage while ntfs grows with your data

13554
filesystems	ntfs
how does this differ from the organization of permissions in the ntfs filesystems on windows

13555
ubuntu	linux
if it makes a difference i m looking at ubuntu but if there s an equivalent for other systems mac other linux variants like fedora etc. then knowing any of those would be useful too

13561
solaris	bsd
strace is specific to linux but other systems have a similar tool truss on solaris ktrace or dtrace under bsd etc

13568
kubuntu	gnome
i am having difficulty using kubuntu or gnome for work because text readability is quite poor read headache inducing compared to windows vista 7 and os x

13569
kde	gnome
as for non-system fonts try also tweaking the settings in kde gnome

13569
kde	gnome
this link shows some old for opensuse but it contains screenshots for both kde and gnome and the settings haven t really changed

13576
unix	bsd
in bsd and later versions of unix this had more or less converged to single-character flags marked with - but this began to present a couple of problems

13590
debian-based	linux
i am used to using debian-based linux distros so sticking with them is desirable but by no means critical

13594
internationalization	translation
this eschews the whole issue of internationalization in other languages you would need to translation expected responses

13595
installation	upgrade
is there a way to upgrade from ubuntu 11.04 to crunchbang without a full installation

13624
gtk	ncurses
you can also try wicd it s a great connectivity tool and it can work with ncurses interface or gtk not gnome frontend

13650
debian	linux
both machines are linux debian based

13667
icmp	dhcp
a dhcp client needs to bind an icmp socket and that requires root permissionsâ¹

13669
bash	zsh
the first line enables the recursive globbing in bash not necessary in zsh

13731
median	minimum
how can i get the minimum maximum median and average values

13731
floating-point	integer
although my immediate situation is for integers a solution for floating-point numbers would be useful down the line but a simple integer method is fine

13738
min	max
min max and average are pretty easy to get with awk

13779
median	minimum
i actually keep a little awk program around to give the sum data count minimum datum maximum datum mean and median of a single column of numeric data

13799
min	max	min	median	median	max
it reads one number per line on standard input and writes four numbers min max average median separated by spaces to standard output

13836
kde	gnome
start a vnc session via xvnc or the builtin gnome kde vnc tools

13851
switching	screens
it s much more convenient to switching between screens using keyboard shortcuts than to use the job control features

13867
vmware	esx
the same is true for vmware esx etc

13873
sudo	passwd
and to make it clear my account has sudo access so i don t want to lock the passwd

13875
hide	show
there are options to show the pid s show or hide the command lines etc.

13879
ubuntu	debian
1 multibooting debian ubuntu windows xp desktop

13890
ubuntu	debian
on your debian ubuntu clients edit etc cups client.conf this file should contain replace server with the ip of your server port should be 631 by default

13922
mouse	keyboard
neither the built-in keyboard mouse nor the external ones connected via usb wake the laptop up

13922
mouse	keyboard
checking the bootlog to find out the dev paths of the usb mouse keyboard then

13934
bash	zsh
under ksh bash or zsh

13949
redhat	fedora
the old days of redhat and the current lineup of fedora and redhat enterprise linux are very different

13949
redhat	fedora
redhat enterprise linux is basically a professionally rehashed version of fedora with a support contract

13949
ubuntu	mint
mint relies on ubuntu s development process and just layers on their own changes

13951
vmware	virtualbox
or is it virtualbox kvm vmware or else

13958
gentoo	freebsd
like gentoo freebsd

13959
bluetooth	usb
on my work dell e6510 the bluetooth shows up as an internal usb device visible with lspci and i have no problems with it

13982
switching	screens
right now it appears on whatever screens the app i m switching from is located

13983
daemons	systemd
that means that daemons like systemd and udev which are started very early in the boot process - and perhaps before var run is available mounted - have with run a standardized file systemd location available where they can store runtime information

13986
installation	upgrade
i just upgrade from f13 to f15 using the installation dvd and it looked all went fine

14012
debian	linux
this is under a debian linux system armv5tel architecture

14013
switching	screens
here now the updated routines how to get automatic screens switching with your laptop to work

14025
sudo	passwd
but in other cases pam_tcb gives more flexibility and security first you ought not to trust sudo and passwd in that they won t let the user exploit the privileges in an unwanted way

14039
smarthost	exim
i have all my mail handed off to exim and then exim sends it to a smarthost which seems the preferred thing to do for hosts that don t have a static ip address at least

14043
switching	screens
if i switching to another tty then i can see the log in screens terminal and i can log in too

14066
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	minix	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	aix	netbsd	minix	netbsd	aix	minix	linux	minix	aix	unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	minix	solaris	netbsd	solaris	aix	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	aix
the official reference is your unix variant s device driver manual pages typically section 4 aix freebsd linux macâ osâ x section 4 minix netbsd openbsd solaris 11 unix 6th ed

14085
mouse	keyboard
x also needs mouse or keyboard or any other kind of input is this part of x server s functions too

14087
solaris	bsd
note that on other platforms bsd solaris x is still quite monolithic

14095
bash	zsh
the syntax to match files in the current directory and its subdirectories recursively requires zsh or bash â 4 after doing shopt -s globstar

14105
kde	gnome
back in the kde days when it was unclear what was going to happen with the qt licensing options some distros went with gnome

14108
kde	gnome
there was a lot of uncertainty regarding licensing of the qt library on which kde is built back when most distros were choosing between kde and gnome

14109
ubuntu	linux
when linux was finally starting to come into wider acceptance and distros like ubuntu came around machines weren t all that powerful

14109
kde	gnome
so with only detractors from kde who whouldn t be using gnome anyway ubuntu went with gnome

14112
ubuntu	debian
so even today debian and ubuntu default to gnome

14112
kde	gnome
and suse is more closely identified with kde and red hat is more closely identified with gnome even today

14118
disk	ram
in a pinch the system could run without buffers and cache reserving ram for applications and systematically performing disk reads and writes without any caching

14137
udp	tcp
for tcp and udp ports see tcp udp or ip or just use some other relevant tag such as firewall

14139
bash	zsh
under bash ksh or zsh there s a convenient way to filter the file list before passing it to rsync

14141
vmware	virtualbox
by this logic it might be that microsoft virtual pc is more lightweight than virtualbox vmware etc

14142
switching	screens
i ve started splitting window in gnu screens into different regions - rather than switching between windows

14147
vmware	virtualbox
for most other accelerated technologies you will need kernel modules loaded this includes virtualbox and vmware

14159
width	height
the x and y figures it gives are for the top left of the window decorations while the height and width are for just the content area

14159
width	height
this means that if the window decorations add 20px of height and 2px of width wmctrl will report a window as being 640x480 even if it takes up 660x482 on screen

14175
folder	directory
in order for a user to do ls a b c d e folder successfully he must have execute permission on every directory in the path and read permission on folder

14199
folder	directory
using the linux command line i use the scp command to copy up all the files and folder from a certain directory

14222
prng	random
openbsd has four generators dev random is a hardware generator dev srandom is a secure random data generator using md5 on the entropy pool disk and network device interrupts and such dev urandom is similar but falls back to a prng when the entropy pool is empty

14233
mouse	keyboard
no keyboard combination works anymore and i see nothing but a non-moving mouse arrow on the external screen

14263
centos	linux
we have a centos linux machine running a production application

14264
versioning	upgrade
if these libraries were in usr lib and disappeared in a system upgrade you ll have to either restore the required versioning or recompile the d tools for the new versioning of the libraries

14276
bash	zsh
run the above in bash or zsh and you ll get the same results

14300
switching	screens
i m coming from screens where i can switching to the pane and then switching windows until i get to the one i want

14303
folder	directory
to only find you re still a few directory from your root httpdocs folder so i m trying to make a script that follows this pseudo-code

14312
ubuntu	linux
my linux servers are ubuntu 11.04 and openwrt

14317
google-chrome	firefox
virtualbox google-chrome firefox vlc pdf djvu reader mp3 player wine pidgin transmission libreoffice

14326
wan	vlan
my router has an atm0 interface and a vlan atm0.1 interface atm0.1 has the wan ip address

14326
wan	lan
when using tcpdump -i atm0 the packets captured are only outgoing packet lan to wan

14330
folder	dir
dir behaves same as ls doesn t show the folder

14335
folder	directory
i want to examine a directory and execute a command for each matching folder

14338
unix	bsd
other than that the bsd family is indeed the best-known â œmainstreamâ unix other than linux

14338
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
there are a few distributions in the linux sense that repackage software from other providers debian gnu kfreebsd which ships a freebsd kernel gnu utilities and the software otherwise provided in debian gnu linux but they re rather marginal

14346
unix	solaris
it may be generalizable to other unix variants with a sufficiently similar proc solaris has a similar proc 1 root i think but not mountinfo

14358
sudoers	passwd
i think you can add yourself in sudoers file which will allow you to specify a set of commands as command alias which you would be able to execute without passwd

14378
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
distributions of linux such as debian ubuntu fedora opensuse

14378
ubuntu	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux

14380
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
some of the distributions debian gentoo fedora and others are used as a starting point for other distributions ubuntu is derived from debian for instance

that means that the creators of for instance sabayon linux used a gentoo distribution to start their development effort and keep track of gentoo s evolution to some extent

14384
ubuntu	linux
how can i find out that my cpu supports 64bit operating systems under linux ubuntu fedora

14387
ubuntu	linux
routeros is based on linux but are there layer 2 telnet solutions - open-source projects or in the repositories under ubuntu fedora

14398
chown	chmod
next i ve changed chmod and chown like in this tutorial or others very similar

14402
ssd	sata
from my sata 2 ssd it s instant

14411
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems used in particular by ms-dos and early versions of windows has a similarly simple space allocation

14428
solaris	netbsd
modified versions of linux netbsd and solaris can be used as the dom0

14436
ubuntu	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux
maybe you like to dive in deeply and go via gentoo to lfs linux from scratch to your own distro and then in the end back to ubuntu again

14441
vmware	virtualbox
i have some experience using xen virtualbox linux containers vmware and linux-vserver

14441
vmware	virtualbox
of the ones i mentioned above xen virtualbox and vmware are hypervisors linux containers and linux-vserver are containers

14442
vmware	virtualbox
the more professional tools virtualbox aka xvm and vmware support multiple snapshots and thin cloning

14442
vmware	virtualbox
in my experience performance in the various virtualization tools has been about the same everywhere with a slight edge to virtualbox and vmware in comparison to the kvm

14462
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
one thing i would advice you though is to just use linux mint 10 this is not the latest and greatest release but linux mint 11 seems to have some upstream issues as it s based on ubuntu and ubuntu is trowing everything around

14468
vmware	virtualbox
you could look into vmware virtualbox xen or kvm which can all run windows under linux

14489
freebsd	linux
why would someone choose freebsd over linux

14489
freebsd	linux
what are the advantages of freebsd compared to linux

14511
freebsd	linux
for a long time freebsd s ports collection which means the software available for it through its package manager was bigger and better than what was in the linux repositories

14524
hide	show
v as it show all packages available for installation i still need to know the filter for packages with dependencies marked unavailable so if i can hide them it s easier to find packages that i haven t tried out

14544
lvm	mdadm
i have no real experience with this sort of tools however i understand that both lvm and mdadm require real block devices which therefore must be cleared of any existing data

14551
gentoo	debian
i have a debian host on which i want to setup a private gentoo repository for my college

14554
filesystems	btrfs
this is a feature that is eventually planned for the btrfs filesystems but for now you are stuck with the cron sync or similar method

14571
xfs	btrfs
the most popular linux files systems are ext2 3 4 xfs reiserfs and the upcoming btrfs

14599
sudoers	visudo
the first user on an ubuntu desktop system does for example you might add the following line to etc sudoers using the visudo utility for safety

14675

take a look at the example screenshots especially the tcp udp statistical breakdown

14677
filesystems	ntfs
i m pretty sure that the filesystems type is either vfat or ntfs

14685
rpm	yum
usually this was solved by installing the kernel headers from yum but here i am using a new kernel with no rpm available

14703
vim	textmate
you can easily do this in vim or textmate or probably any decent editor using block selection

14712
folder	directory
it s not like joe user actually knows what is in his window s system folder or his mac os libraries directory

14727
unix	bsd
but originate from at t unix and bsd

14732
stdout	stderr
the strace tool allows you to get a copy of the output going to a particular file descriptor in this case stdout and stderr

14742
bash	zsh
for bash run shopt -s extglob and for zsh use setopt ksh_glob

14749
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i don t know about fedora but a good alternative is linux mint - this is basically ubuntu with the restricted bits added

14750
jobs	cron
i have configured my webservers cron jobs to trigger some php script every 15min but sometimes the script takes more than 15 min to complete execution by the time another process of the same script starts

14755
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
many gnu linux distributions do not contain libdvdcss for example debian fedora suse linux and ubuntu due to fears of running afoul of dmca-style laws however they may provide the tools to let the user install it themselves

14757
ubuntu	linux
which ubuntu or any other gnu linux based os could i use for stable operation

14764
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
definitly keep off kde and gnome maybe xfce and lxde are choices but i guess a very simple vm de like icewm would be the way to go

14767
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
the base distributive uses kde but it has variants with enlightenment lxde xfce and gnome

14767
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
kde gnome and enlightenment would be too heavy for your laptop but both lxde and xfce will work great

14772
perl	tcl
platypus plays nicely with shell scripts python php ruby and tcl just as easily as perl

14777
centos	linux
i have a copy of rip linux on a bootable usb so i am able to access the centos install files

14794

14869
folder	directory
so that i can use â cdâ command or something like that maybe ls to navigate through the folder or see the files in the windows share directory

14872
kde	gnome
i think that 128mbs is enough for it you can t use gnome or kde with only 128mb

14880
wav	flac
i do understand that i could rip the cd to wav files or even flac files but is there a way to just duplicate the disc to one file so i could extract wavs or flacs from it later on

14903
sysv	systemd
this unix team became at t s unix systemd laboratories usl and produced unix systemd v roman numeral for five or sysv for short

14903
unix	bsd	sysv	systemd
the university of california at berkeley ucb also licenced unix for academic use their computer systemd research group csrg later made many important changes and additions notably tcp ip in their berkeley software distribution bsd which were later incorporated into many descendants of unix leading to the bsd vs sysv split

14903
unix	bsd
ultimately a lot of the bsd changes were back-ported into sysv which we can consider the main ancestral unix code base

14903
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	irix	solaris	aix
along the way many different businesses have licenced this code-base at various stages in it s development and used it as the basis of their proprietary unix operating systems - aix hpux irix solaris ultrix and dozens of others

14915
folder	directory	mp3	flac
folder are named artist - album flac i need to create matching directory named artist - album mp3 but only for certain folders.

14917

unless someone knows how to make use of bash s string functions on a literal string instead of a variable or set and use a variable in one command you will need ssapkota s syntax to launch a subshell

14925
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
is there an easy way given an iso image for linux mint to install it to an empty hard drive from within my existing ubuntu installation

14944
folder	directory
i then set a few things in that temporary home directory like a symlink .fonts to the folder for the font files to use

14947
bash	zsh
if you want to act recursively in subdirectories as well under zsh or under bash â 4 you can use

14952
folder	directory
i ve mounted the music folder of the nas in the local music folder of my home directory on my desktop computer

14958
bash	zsh
shell wildcards for file names also called glob patterns are a different less powerful syntax though ksh bash and zsh have more powerful extensions

14958
bash	zsh
bash ksh93 and zsh s operator offer regex matching

14990
folder	directory
so far all attempts at automatic synchronization have failed - even using winscp in watch folder mode where it monitors a local folder and attempts to upload any changes up to the remote directory error out because it always tries to set the date timestamp

14995
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
session in this case refers to any desktop gnome kde xfce ...

15022
rpm	yum
i don t know about yum but the upper level rpm package manger i use is able to do a target install like this and take care of the dependencies behind the scenes

15022
rpm	yum
you might look for an instll-dist or root type argument to yum and use that instead of rpm directly

15050
mpmath	sympy
sympy doesn t work without mpmath there is no alternative

15050
mpmath	sympy
it should also be noted that the developer of mpmath used to be involved in sympy development

unix	bsd	unix	aix	bsd	aix
in the aix unix or even bsd worlds much more of the system software is developed together as part of the main distro project

15183
daemons	systemd
you might also have to exclude parts of the install that do things like marking daemons to be run on systemd startup since your user won t be able to do that

15212
fish	zsh	fish	bash	bash	zsh
apart from the very small number of people who don t use a bourne-style shell as their login shell .profile does work for everyone whether they use bash or zsh or csh or fish interactively

15224
daemons	systemd
it s not a daemons and the systemd doesn t have it behave like one

stdout	stderr
if you also make sure to connect stdout and stderr when you run your command you should get a better idea is what is going on

15278
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
you can setup sudo to such that your http user can execute your program as username without a passwd but not be able to do anything else by running visudo or whatever you use to edit your sudoers file and adding this line

make sure your flash drive is not in ntfs filesystems as it is not supported

15283
bluetooth	usb
i m looking to install a bluetooth card to my laptop as it currently doesn t have bluetooth support and i d like to get away from having to use an external usb dongle

15285
bash	zsh
but if you use bash or zsh to cd there then the shell remembers the original path and uses it in future relative cd commands

15286
gentoo	ubuntu
you can create a menu entry in the gentoo grub2 configuration file that loads the ubuntu configuration file

15286
gentoo	ubuntu
if you go this route there is a command called normal_exit that you could add as a custom item in your ubuntu configuration which would allow you to return to your gentoo configuration

15315
ubuntu	linux
if you are running this computer purely as a server then i would reccomend either ubuntu server or arch linux as far as the distribution goes

15315
ubuntu	linux
if you are planning on running a gui then you may want to go with ubuntu or if you are comfortable with linux arch

15317
centos	linux
centos - according to distrowatch the most popular linux distro for servers these days probably due to it being just a free clone of red hat enterpise linux

15413
range	max	range	min	min	max
you can configure the min max ports for passive mode ftp in vsftp via the pasv_min_port and pasv_max_port options in vsftpd.conf could you narrow the range down to a small number of ports perhaps one port and open them in the firewall

15419
put	get
ftp get put gbk-encoding-named files between windows ftp server and linux client

15419
filesystems	ntfs
is it possible to config linux filesystems use fixed character encoding like ntfs use utf-16 internally to store file names regardless of lang lc_all environment

centos uses the rpm package manager and ubuntu uses debian apt

15480
centos	linux
centos is 100 binary compatible with its commercial counterpart redhat enterprise linux

15480
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
the differences between distros particularly rpm based distros like centos and debian based ones like ubuntu can be legion and a given package will not be portable between them

15483
lvm	xfs	filesystems	xfs
if your problem is backup it might be good to use a tool that is made to create snapshots of filesystems either through rsnap or a snapshoting filesystems like xfs or using any filesystems with lvm

15483
folder	directory
whatever scripts you have can be run right from the dropbox folder in your home directory and any aliases and such you want synced can go in a file inside dropbox that gets sourced by your shell

15485
ubuntu	centos
centos has pretty old library versions so ubuntu s versions may be too recent

15485
ubuntu	centos
centos and ubuntu use different packaging systems rpm vs

15493
gentoo	linux
arch linux and gentoo are the two most popular rolling release distributions

15493
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs as the default filesystems next cycle

15513
udp	tcp
in tcp udp the only way to reserve a port is to actually bind a socket to it

15520
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
if it is ntfs or fat filesystems you have a good chance to recover them

15527
mouse	keyboard
my mouse and keyboard are working in grub but when the login screen appears they don t so i can t do anything

15538
bash	zsh
the c family has fallen into disuse its features have now mostly been imitated and improved in bash and zsh

15557
put	get
how can i get debuild to put the script in the right place

15560
sudo	passwd
what about the idea that two users must enter the passwd in sudo style to open a root shell

15570
post	get
however input forms only have content in the fields when some person or process fills it in locally before submitting it via a post or less likely a get request

15598
kate	kde
kate kde advanced text editor is a text editor that is part of the kde project

15604
ubuntu	linux
althought chrome os and ubuntu are both based on linux kernels you re unlikely to be able to copy kernel modules from one to the other

15609
filesystems	xfs
that means mkfsing a ext 34 filesystems is up to 54 times slower than mkfsing a xfs one

15617
sudoers	passwd
the etc sudoers file includes 2 examples one that will challenge people with their passwd and one that won t

15617
sudoers	visudo

15668
freebsd	centos
is there any centos freebsd way to block all the usb ports and vga output

15684
freebsd	linux
the answer why the freebsd s kernel is the most used along with the linux kernel is the richness of that kernel

15706
versioning	upgrade
on my debian server i upgrade the sqlite package to versioning 3.7.7 but discovered that it contains a critical bug that breaks several things including my subversion repository

15708
dpkg	apt
if you have a suitable version of the package there you can install it with dpkg -i var cache apt archives sqlite3-version.deb

15708
dpkg	apt
since this is a punctual need it ll be easiest to download the package manually and install with dpkg but you can also define a particular snapshot date as an apt source as explained on the snapshot.d.o home page

15708
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
you can find out what version used to be installed by looking through the dpkg logs in var log dpkg.log or the apt logs in var log apt or the aptitude logs in var log aptitude

ubuntu	debian
i use debian 6 and ubuntu 10.04 also windows 7 64 bit vista and macos snow leopard

15769
freebsd	linux
practically it probably has no impact on me but i prefer it on principle and was one of the reasons i chose to use freebsd over linux

15786
ubuntu	linux
i ve got a computer intel core i5 with 32bit linux installed ubuntu 11.04 and i would like to install a 64bit linux virtual machine on it so i can test 64bit command-line applications on it

15788
vmware	virtualbox
gilles points out that i was mistaken about virtualbox and vmware supporting 64-bit guests on 32-bit hosts

15797
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	sunos	solaris	sunos
for linux solaris sunos freebsd and hp-ux

15813
vmware	virtualbox
both vmware and virtualbox can run a 64-bit virtual machine on a 32-bit host system if you have a 64-bit processor

15813
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu doesn t provide a 64-bit kernel in its i386 distribution debian does

15814
ubuntu	linux
how can i copy+paste text between my linux desktop gnome ubuntu 11.04 and the open vmplayer window running an ubuntu 64bit server terminal

15837
bash	zsh
replace bash by zsh or whatever your favorite shell is.

15909
ubuntu	linux
i recently got rid of a nasty trojan on windows and want to migrate to linux ubuntu

15917
put	get
even if a download got put on the faster wire if the dns request got sent over the latent network it would take that much longer to get started

15926
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade firefox to versioning 5.0 so that clicking the same icon should launch the new versioning

15929
mktime	strftime
gnu awk offers mktime and strftime as an extension

15930
rpm	yum
centos uses rpm packages and the yum tool to download and install or upgrade software

15930
redhat	fedora
if you find an rpm somewhere for centos or redhat or maybe even fedora you can try installing it with something like this

15938
portrait	landscape
when printing slides for libre office impress with landscape orientation they are printed with portrait orientation as a result right part of the slides are missed

15947
ubuntu	debian
i have debian squeeze and want to create usb flash drive for install ubuntu 11.04

15947
ubuntu	debian
could you explain the right way to create ubuntu usb-installer from debian

15948
debian	centos
i may be missing something but unlike debian and others where the make command is readily available this program does not exist in centos out of the box

15953
bash	zsh
bash ksh and zsh have a negation pattern to match all files except those matching

15953
bash	zsh
in bash this feature needs to be turned on with shopt -s extglob and in zsh it needs to be turned on with setopt ksh_glob

15980
ubuntu	debian
why is there a difference between some debian installations on the one hand and other debian installations and ubuntu on the other

15984
cpu	processors
however there are both a variety of variations on this operation that some processors will be better at than others and it s affected by a lot of other factors in a system besides the cpu so it s not an easy thing to measure

16004
arp	tcp
im going to assume your both connected to the same network either by wifi or cable i d suggest ettercap use the arp poisoning man in the middle attack that will basically send all network traffic to you including wireless and then on to the intended recipient in ettercap you can see actuall tcp stream on screen it has many plugins and you can create your own i reckon it s not to difficult to then right a rule to change a packets payload however the stream it self may be encrypted and at that point you may be stuck as it will just look like nonsense you say it s in plain text so i m guessing you must of already sniffed the packets

16009
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
my laptop a hp probook 4510s refuses to boot fedora or arch linux cd s but will boot and install debian based stuff ie debian ubuntu

16010
kde	gnome
the same goes for library families especially the ones associated with major desktop environments like gnome and kde

16011
hdd	floppy
i can only select a boot option in the beginning such as hdd removeable cd floppy etc

16020
bash	zsh
globbing is known by various names accross shell documentations filename generation pathname expansion pattern matching wildcard matchingâ advanced shells such as bash ksh and zsh implement additions to the basic glob patterns

16023
freebsd	netbsd
is a relatively recent addition to posix but it s been in gnu and freebsd netbsd osx for a while now

16027
bash	zsh
if you re willing to write this script in zsh instead of bash there s a much easier way to catch the newest file because zsh has glob qualifiers that permit wildcard matches not only on names but also on file metadata

16036
asterisk	pbx
the open source solutions are built around the asterisk pbx voip server

16037
installation	upgrade
i ran into this when i upgrade from the stock 2.6 that came with my ubuntu installation to the 3.2 python with setting the default alternative to 3.2 rather than 2.6

16051
ubuntu	linux
i have to program a realtime application on linux but don t know whether the standard installation of ubuntu has config_high_res_timers enabled

16061
bash	zsh
but availability of operator is shell dependent - as far i know it is in zsh and bash 4 only

16062
vim	gedit
i know they always had a text editor with copy paste but everything i do on linux is copy from web browser and paste from the clipboard into vim or gedit or gnome terminal

16064
vim	emacs
loading a man page into vim or emacs and copy-pasting from it is routine for vim emacs users

16078
bash	zsh
but modern shells ksh bash zsh maybe others play games with the working directory

16119
int	chars
assuming contains the number int positive in decimal notation with no leading zero look for preceded by either the beginning of the line or a non-digit chars and likewise after

16127
filesystems	xfs
i have a 7.9 tb logical volume formatted with xfs filesystems

16128
filesystems	xfs
however this is moot since you have an xfs filesystems and xfs does not support shrinking

16134
rpm	yum
while rpm is used to work with the actual packages rhel and friends now use yum to make it less tedious

16134
rpm	yum
yum lets you install software through repositories local or remote collections of rpm packages and index files and handles dependency resolution and the actual fetching install of the files for you

16134
rpm	yum
regardless if you re grabbing rpm files from somewhere on the internet they re probably going to also have a yum repo set up in which case it would be far more prudent to actually install their repo package first

16134
rpm	yum
i would not recommend simply grabbing the rpm from that page and installing it but using yum to install it from the atrpms repo. the official vlc rhel download page recommends rpmforge instead though they re shipping an older version there

16134
ubuntu	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux
on the other hand if you re seriously looking at linux on the desktop consider a distribution that keeps itself up to date with modern software like fedora itself or even something debian-based like ubuntu

16141
folder	directory
anyone simply using a linux computer through a modern gui is unlikely to need to know about anything other than these familiarly named folder in their home directory

16175
ubuntu	linux
i have matlab on windows 7 and i need to use it in my ubuntu system installed on virtualbox because i am working on files only compatible in linux

ubuntu	linux
once you have file sharing worked out so your ubuntu guest can write files to a folder where your windows matlab can access you can use linux tools to easily convert files between unix and windows formats

16186
ubuntu	debian
for example in ubuntu debian it is

16231
ubuntu	linux
anyway i would like to point out that linux usually comes with the drivers you need already and ubuntu especially so except some closed source drivers that it will ask you to install if need be

16245
bash	zsh
it is possible in zsh a more powerful shell than bash available on most unices including ubuntu but often not installed by default

16282
bash	zsh
it s sure not for me in bash or zsh try running type tr to see for yourself

16292
ubuntu	debian
the instructions here are for debian rather than ubuntu but they should at least point you in the right direction

16294
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
looking around freebsd netbsd and openbsd use etc localtime

16294
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu have a file called etc timezone which contains the name of the timezone

16294
ubuntu	debian
on debian or ubuntu the official method to change the timezone is dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

16306
single-quotes	double-quotes
since your example assignment does not have any variables in it the double-quotes could have appeared as single-quotes

16316
kde	gnome
i would say this is more of a good thing than an issue personally it means you can strip out unnecessary parts of gnome or kde that would come pre-installed otherwise

16330
bluetooth	usb
that menu should show list of available networks wired wireless bluetooth usb or otherwise

16339
bash	zsh
to use a string as standard input is a ksh extension also supported by bash and zsh

16349
centos	linux
i am running centos 5.6 with linux kernel 2.6.18-238.el5

16354
solaris	bsd
for example on linux bsd and solaris pkill myprogram kills all the processes whose name contains myprogram use for an exact match

16367
stdout	stderr
means to redirect stderr 2 to the current destination of stdout the terminal

16367
stdout	stderr
so stderr goes to the terminal and stdout goes to a file

16367
stdout	stderr
means to redirect stdout to somefile and then to redirect stderr to the same destination as stdout the file

16367
stdout	stderr
so both stderr and stdout go to somefile

16370
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i used ubuntu linux before and i installed debian os on my labtop using dvds that i burned

16377
stdout	stderr
while - is a convention that has to be implemented by each program wanting to support it dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr are when supported by the os at least solaris linux and bsds do independent of the application and then will work as you intend

16392
versioning	upgrade
because of this trying to upgrade or install a parallel versioning of python to satisfy the dependencies is likely to cause a lot of other problems and still may not solve all of your rpm compatibility problems

16396
wan	lan
this is of limited applicability only if your server machine is the node doing the lan wan filtering

16397
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade from versioning 3 to versioning 4 install versioning 4 then run stow -d program_name-3

16401
stdout	stderr
print information lines only to stdout and error messages only to stderr

16411
chown	chmod
i ve chmod ed and chown ed all files and subdirectories of those to rwxrwxr-x markdsievers staff

16456
ubuntu	freebsd
i m rather new to ubuntu coming from freebsd where i never encountered an issue like this so i m hoping that someone else here has and can point me in the right direction

16465
debian	linux
my column man page indicates -n is a debian gnu linux extension. my fedora system does not exhibit the empty cell problem it appears to be derived from bsd and the man page says version 2.23 changed the -s option to be non-greedy

16466
ubuntu	linux
what i know is that i can t open it because my linux ubuntu does not give any hint how to open it

16471
bash	zsh
under bash ksh zsh you can use instead and in any shell you can use .

16473
kde	gnome
it is also my understanding that the kde screensaver supports the same dbus interface as the gnome screensaver

16480
freebsd	linux
this would run on freebsd linux and other un xes

16518
ubuntu	linux
i have an nvidia 66xx series linux version ubuntu 11.04 i have nvidia proprietary drivers instaled but they do not suport hardware acceleration and video decoding for old harware just 8xxx series and above so the decoding is done in software

16531
config	ini
i suggest using an actual config format like ini or apache style config general in perl

16547
debian	linux
i m using debian gnu linux 6.0 squeeze vps

16564
ftp	telnet
most major network services http ftp ssh telnet https pop smtp etc are in this range so possible answers i thought of

16570
folder	directory
this will delete all files only regular ones no pipes special devices directory symbolic links in the given folder and all subdirectories recursively where the last access time is longer than 7 days ago.

16590
ubuntu	linuxmint	ubuntu	debian	debian	linuxmint	linuxmint	gentoo	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
my keyboard is very slow in gentoo debian ubuntu arch pclinuxos and linuxmint

16610
bash	zsh
shells like bash dash zsh of course

16628
folder	directory
bindfs can t make folder to protect read-only but it can create a read-only view of that directory read only view

16633
put	get
date when your cursor is on a blank line and the output of the date command will get put into the blank line

16647
chown	sudo
edit i used -r in my sudo chown command

16655
put	get
you can put double quotes around that expansion but then you get -p arg1 as a single argument not two arguments

16669
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
so when i m trying to copy it to an ntfs fat filesystems it asks me about whether i want it to replace the file or skip it

16692
solaris	aix
i m afraid no linux distribution resemble hp-ux or aix solaris for that matter enough to be helpful in your case

16693
bash	zsh
to take just one possible example suppose i have to detect from a script whether bash and zsh are available on a machine and then run a command with zsh if it is present and with bash if zsh is not and bash is of a sufficient version to not have a particular bug

16693
bash	zsh
most of the rest of the script could be bourne shell or ruby or anything else but this one particular thing must be done afaik with either zsh or a recent version of bash

16695
bash	zsh
in the 21st century especially if you re targeting machines that are likely to have bash or zsh you can count on type being available

16744
daemons	systemd
this is a list of all of the daemons that will start on systemd boot

16754
pppoe	dhcp
question how i need to configure the server to make this work permanently i mean no manual interaction is required after the server reboots the dhcp server starts automatically internet forwarding is ok openvpn is started wifi is working pppoe connection to the isp is up dns server is working

16758
ubuntu	linux	mouse	keyboard
my cpu is 64 bit i have a ps 2 keyboard and a ps 2 mouse and i have tried live cds of ubuntu kubuntu fedora arch linux wubi installations 32 and 64 bit my cpu is 64 bit and puppy linux

16758
mouse	keyboard
i am able to navigate between the menu options when there is one but when i boot the keyboard and mouse stop responding

16758
mouse	keyboard
puppy linux booted completely but the keyboard and mouse didn t respond

16758
mouse	keyboard
my keyboard and mouse work flawlessly in puppy linux 3.01 but don t in 4.x

16758
ubuntu	linux	mouse	keyboard
important i can confirm that keyboard and mouse work in ubuntu 8.04.4 lts with linux 2.6.22-14-generic but don t with 2.6.24-29-generic

16766
opensuse	centos
i downloaded the 32 bit .rpm for fedora opensuse to my centos machine

16771
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 6.0.2 squeeze

16771
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 5.0.8 lenny

16781
debian	linux
in the case of the linux kernel debian 6 shipped with 2.6.32 and the backported kernel is 2.6.38 why is there even a backport

16782
width	height
i ve got a few tens of thousands of images all of 2000 pixel width and i would like to pile them up in one big image of summed up height and 2000 pixel width

16791
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux has a very nice home router guide in it s gentoo linux documentation

16792
openbsd	freebsd
has anyone had any success getting dropbox installed with dropboxd running properly on openbsd freebsd would work for me too..

16792
openbsd	linux
i continued to plug away at this and eventually ran into a show stopper there s no linux emulation on amd64 for openbsd

16841
filesystems	fat
of course you have to use a filesystems on your luks partition that both os understand to actually make use of this cross-platform capability either use ext2fs drivers for windows or use fat drivers for linux

16843
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade ffmpeg to versioning 0.6 on debian-based operating system

16855
versioning	upgrade
similarly 0.5.1 is the newest versioning of the package for lucid which is a long-time support release of ubuntu no package upgrade unless absolutely necessary

16872
folder	dir
then i read a forum thread where the guy was told that because the folder was root owned he d have to scp the files into his home dir on the remote host then sudo cp them to the apache folder

16880
vpn	lan
sat jul 9 13 14 21 2011 warning potential route subnet conflict between local lan 192.168.80.0 255.255.255.0 and remote vpn 192.168.80.1 255.255.255.255

16880
vpn	lan
your vpn is selecting addresses from the 192.168.80.x address space and your local lan is selecting addresses from the 192.168.80.x address space

16891
freebsd	linux
all you need is to install the freebsd bootloader on its own slice what bsd calls a slice is what linux and windows call a partition

16901
ubuntu	debian
if you re running debian ubuntu or a derivative install the resolvconf package

16901
ubuntu	debian
if you re using resolvconf on debian or ubuntu the etc resolv.conf may be suboptimal if you installed the resolvconf package with the network up and running

16911
ubuntu	debian
well etc default is a debian ubuntu thing so you re unlikely to find it in fedora

16915
ubuntu	debian
on debian or ubuntu installing the avahi-daemon package should be enough to get going

16923
spaces	delimiter
the delimiter is any number of spaces and or a single comma eg

16925
switching	screens
now when i try switching my system on it shows the chameleon and then it just shows a small cursor at the top left of the screens and stays there forever

16928
bash	zsh
though i don t know about getting this functionality to work with bash zsh comes with set up with exactly what you want by default

16928
bash	zsh
zsh has most of the features of bash with some added functionality out of the box like the ability to navigate with only tab and enter

16935
sudo	passwd
it s probably asking for your passwd to use sudo to grant you privileges not for root s passwd

16945
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
which is way different than installing lxde on top of either linux mint or ubuntu

16984
hash	salt
note that if anyone obtains the shadow file they ll know immediately that the two users have the same password because the two hash will be using the same salt

16986
octal	decimal
033 is the esc character character number 033 octal 27 decimal sometimes written e or

16999
chown	sudo
given that sudo is usr bin sudo normally you won t be able to use it after you run that chown command the sudo binary owner will be yourself so you won t get root permissions when running it next time

17001
bash	zsh
if your shell is ksh bash or zsh you can make the shell deal with the business of allocating some file descriptor

17005
bash	zsh
in shells with array support bash ksh zsh you can directly assign the file list to an array variable

17011
disk	ram
in order to hibernate the system has to have somewhere on the disk to write the data that is in ram to save it from extermination when the power goes out

17018
width	height
when you said terminal window width did you mean terminal window height

17023
folder	directory
coming from the windows world i have found the majority of the folder directory names to be quite intuitive

17023
x86	64bit
program files x86 contains files used by 32-bit programs on 64bit oses

17030
umask	chmod
you can change the permissions of files that will be written by setting the umask in your ftp preferences or use a shell later to chmod them

17033
vim	gedit
i don t now about gedit but in vim arithmetic operations in regex are easy

17047
bazaar	git
choose your favorite version control system amongst bazaar darcs git and mercury

17047
bazaar	git
now every time you modify a configuration file run sudo bazaar commit from etc or sudo git commit or whatever

17047
versioning	upgrade
also every time you install upgrade or remove a package changes in etc will be automatically committed to versioning control with a generic message so it s best to commit manually with a meaningful message

17082
openbsd	linux
adobe does not provide a native openbsd plugin but there is a linux plugin which you can use under linux emulation

17082
openbsd	linux
before continuing it is a good idea to read about linux emulation in the compat_linux 8 manual page and also faq 9 - running linux binaries on openbsd

17087
filesystems	ntfs
it is funny that there is a ntfs tool for this ntfsclone but no such tool exists for the native filesystems of linux ext2-4

17104
bluetooth	usb
i have a usb bluetooth dongle

17109
daemons	systemd
convenience routines such as daemons 3 exist in some unix systemd for that purpose

17114
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m a user of linux mint debian linux distro which is based on debian testing

17115
mouse	keyboard
i would like to know how one can disable the keyboard mouse temporarily in os x

17142
freebsd	linux
if you have a recent version of gnu find on linux or cygwin or freebsd or osx you can directly compare the date of a file with that of another file

17146
disk	ram
so most kernels need a filesystem containing drivers available to it at boot time and that is what an initrd initial ram disk or initramfs is for

17146
debian	linux
if you are looking for a barebones linux install that has little to no additional programs installed with it my favorite choice has always been installing the debian netinst image

17147
opensuse	debian
to my surprise the latest version of opensuse works flawlessly and runs about as fast as debian

17147
debian-based	opensuse
unfortunately many packages that are standard in debian-based systems are not even installed by default in opensuse

17149
ubuntu	debian
i ve written a schroot and debootstrap guide for another purpose but once you have a debootstrap binary on your suse installation and the schroot package installed similar instructions should get you a running debian or ubuntu chroot

17150
ubuntu	opensuse
i think this is the first impression that someone has when coming from ubuntu land to the fedora or opensuse wow repositories are smaller

17153
debian	linux
i have a machine running debian linux stable but i d also like a debian unstable box to use as a sandbox to test and develop

17157
sudo	passwd
i would say that using sudo works in command-line as it allows one to type a passwd on the command-line but will probably not work in a graphical environment

17170
mouse	keyboard
how can one programmatically freeze the keyboard mouse temporarily so that no one could mess with the system

17174
disk	ram
1 all changes to the filesystem are written to the ram disk with an overlaid filesystem

17174
xfce	gnome
i am looking for a more modern distro which offers a decent desktop environment xfce or even better a full blown gnome would be perfect but more important is to have standard programs users are familiar with firefox openoffice pidgin etc

17181
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
if you are using a desktop environment or login manager gnome kde xfce lxde almost all of them have a lock screen function where you have to type in your password to get back to your programs

17190
kde	gnome
this isn t a gnome 3.0 or a kde 4

17202
rar	zip
the second technique would be to store the files in an archive tar zip rar which i mount rw to some directory

17222
vim	emacs
alternatively both emacs gnu and xemacs and vim open pdf files seamlessly

17235
pull	push
keep a repository on each machine commit whenever you ve changed a file and don t forget to push pull changes whenever possible

17237
stdout	stderr
however you also want to redirect stdout and stderr to appropriate files so the shell isn t interspersing output of the command with your shell

17237
stdout	stderr
if you just want to capture all output to a file whether from stdout or stderr this will work

17261
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
sudo reads sudoers file to determine if you are allowed to execute selected command as root and if you should be prompted for your passwd

17261
sudo	passwd
if you are allowed to run the command and the passwd is correct if needed since sudo has root privileges all of its children yum and install scripts maybe also gain those privileges

17271
sudo	passwd
what sudo allows you to do is to run other things with escalated privileges from normal user accounts using the normal user passwd not root s

17296
vmware	virtualbox
for full virtualization virtualbox and vmware should work but you may need to use older versions if their kernel module no longer supports such an old kernel

17299
debian	linux
this page describes how you can use the debootstrap utility to install a base debian unstable sid system on an existing linux machine

17303
freebsd	linux
when there are security concerns there are better tools nowadays in particular freebsd jails and linux cgroups and lxc

17308
bash	zsh
for instance i just tried this solution on a solaris box running bash and another running ksh and my local mac os x machine running zsh

17316
jobs	cron
i use django framework on webfaction and have 5 different cron jobs

17320
freebsd	linux
hd is a synonym for hexdump -c on freebsd and on some linux distributions

17320
octal	binary	octal	decimal
these commands do very similar things display a textual representation of a binary file using octal decimal or hexadecimal notation

17344
stdout	stderr
the only problem is that the kernel itself will output a whole bunch of stack trace garbage directly to the console device once the process segfaults so there s no way to prevent it from being output that i know of but that doesn t matter as it doesn t affect stdout or stderr

17350
kde	gnome
on the other hand gnome and kde and other wms generally also let copy selected text into a hard buffer where it stays until you explicitly copy something else into it

17371
folder	dir	folder	directory
it s very simple only moving a directory inside the folder to the location that this windows program expects it on the wine dir - but that is not the problem

17378
folder	directory
i want to recursively find and remove svn files within the child directory of a given folder

17388
ubuntu	debian
i want to install debian with lxde on partition that already have ubuntu 11.04 installed

17388
debian	linux
i know that debian installer will propt that on this partition is already linux installed but will it remove all from my home folder if i type the same username in setup

17390
ubuntu	linux
boot from a linux live cd or live usb such as the ubuntu live cd or the gparted live cd

17401
mouse	keyboard	mouse	trackpad
if the screen and input devices keyboard and mouse or trackpad froze the first place to start by looking would be in var log xorg.0.log assuming that xorg is running on the first display server

17427
sysv	systemd
on a systemd that uses sysv init run levels such as centos 5 when the os is booting does it go straight to the run level defined in etc inittab

17436
ubuntu	centos
i ve launched a centos install in hyperv and assigned a nic the same way i ve done on an ubuntu vm however the device simply isn t picked up

17440
fish	tcsh
the rules in csh tcsh and in fish are different

17463
mouse	keyboard
this prevents a lot of keyboard and mouse shortcuts from working

17473
centos	linux
the os is linux centos 5.3

17476
sudo	passwd
for example if you forget the root passwd you can use sudo to get to root by using your passwd boot into single-user mode to reset the passwd or boot from live media or a rescue environment.

17485
kde	gnome
if you are logging in as root to a graphical system kde or gnome all i can say is just don t

17489
ubuntu	debian
with grub if your distribution ships with update-grub debian or ubuntu run it

17492
ubuntu	debian
debian squeeze and ubuntu 10.10 ship with 1.x superblock support

17505
ubuntu	debian
well the quick answer is that the .deb package you re trying to install is designed for ubuntu not debian

17505
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu has a python-appindicator package and debian doesn t

17509
ubuntu	debian
this is a canonical project which is packaged for ubuntu but not for debian yet

17516
versioning	upgrade
based on the error messages it looks like your upgrade is trying to upgrade your 5.3.6 versioning of php to an older versioning 5.2.17 and it s running into conflicts

17521
copying	overwrite
pretty much the same thing could be accomplished by copying the file yourself then using sed to filter the backup and overwrite the original

17554
hex	binary
direct editing of a binary file in a hex editor such as hexer is sometimes called manual patching

17554
hex	binary
i m not familiar with xxd but it looks like from preliminary searching that xxd can generate a dump or hex listing of binary data and can also convert such a listing back into straight binary

17572
ubuntu	centos
i have tested this with rsync 3 in ubuntu with ext3 and centos with ext4

17633
mouse	keyboard
i d like to wakeup my system via keyboard or mouse

17633
mouse	keyboard
my question is how can i find out which usb device belongs to my mouse keyboard

17643
mouse	keyboard
so thanks to the meaningful naming of device symlinks by udev you can tell which usb device is the keyboard mouse etc

17659
google-chrome	firefox
how i would go about opening multiple urls from a text file as different tabs in firefox google-chrome

17663
ubuntu	linux
my environment is linux ubuntu 10.10

17684
ubuntu	debian
with ubuntu and it s cousin debian being two of the largest distros it is unlikely that program authors would ignore them

17684
redhat	fedora
in general you are more likely to find software packaged for ubuntu and not fedora redhat than you are the other way around but that is a generalization and there is some software found in each that isn t in the others

17703
post	get
and when you feed these file names without a directory name to file file cannot find these files and you get the no such file or directory error messages as a side note if you get error messages please don t just say i got errors but post the error messages

17708
gentoo	debian
i was confused by the small differences between debian and gentoo

17708
gentoo	debian
in gentoo the config file is etc autofs auto.misc whereas debian uses etc auto.misc and so on

17728
bash	zsh
declare is a builtin function and it s not available with bin sh only with bash or zsh and maybe other shells

17741
daemons	systemd
imho the optimal solution is to run that proxy as systemd daemons

17769
bash	zsh
declare is a bash and zsh extension

17769
bash	zsh
on your system bin sh is neither bash nor zsh it s probably ash so declare isn t available

17778
width	height
if there is more than one monitor attached each monitor will get its native resolution and the virtual console will be constrained to the minimum width and height of both monitors

17794
debian	linux
debian has this ability and would be a better choice in your situation than the other obvious minimal contender arch linux

17800
gentoo	debian
there is no reason debian fedora or gentoo would not work for this

17804
centos	linux
second if you are familiar with kickstart on fedora and rhel or centos or scientific linux you can use the fedora tools to make your own spin of any of those distributions

17819
bash	zsh
edit apparently this is only true for bash and zsh

17826
waitpid	fork
to draw a parallel comparison to process programming if i am correct functions fork exec waitpid and pipe are offered natively by linux while mpi is not

17854
openmpi	mpich
there are several implementations of mpi for linux including mpich and openmpi

17865
ubuntu	debian
for example on debian or ubuntu which package has the sbin shutdown command in it

17872
folder	directory
you seem to have copied the home directory without properly preserving the ownerships of files folder

17904
julian	difference
eventually other countries followed the reform for the sake of consistency but by the time the last adherents of the julian calendar in eastern europe russia and greece changed to the gregorian system in the 20th century they had to drop 13 days from their calendars due to the additional accumulated difference between the two calendars since 1582

17923
minix	linux
thus a driver that crashes in minix 3 is unlikely to bring down the whole system while this is not unusual in linux

17927
ubuntu	debian
the perl rename program shipped by debian and ubuntu can create the target directory when needed if you write the necessary bit of perl

17927
bash	zsh
in shells other than bash and zsh you need to use find for recursive traversals see examples below

17935
ubuntu	centos
it sounds like drivers for hyperv virtualized nics are missing from the centos kernel version you are using and are present in the ubuntu version you successfully installed

17972
clang	llvm
is there a linux distro compiled with clang llvm

17985
clang	llvm
whilst the end-user binaries are not built with clang llvm most of the debian archive has been built and rebuilt with clang llvm and binutils-gold and other bits and pieces by people who want to expose portability bugs in the software suite and the compilers themselves

18007
bash	zsh
the following snippet works in all of ksh93 bash and zsh

18009
bash	zsh
try searching for a previous assignment ctrl + r in bash or zsh

18023
cpu	irq
based on the irq the cpu will dispatch the request to the appropriate hardware driver

18027
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
in recent versions of popular linux distributions ubuntu fedora mint debian i always have to put into the kernel parameter list before i want to boot the computer

18027
gentoo	mint
if you want also have a look at my gentoo kernel config working and mint s bundled kernel config not working

18027
gentoo	mint
update 3 i used the kernel config of mint to compile a kernel for gentoo and got the same error which is a good sign that the problem is with the kernel config

18040
mp3	ogg
you could try using mp3splt which can split mp3 and ogg files and has the advantage that it does not re-encode the file thereby avoiding quality loss

18044
solaris	bsd
skill was a linux-specific and is now outdated and pkill is more portable linux solaris bsd

18044
solaris	procfs
i think any utility used to find process in linux solaris style proc procfs will use full list of processes doing some readdir of proc

18055
ramdisk	umount
it then mounted the real root fs in initrd then executed the pivot_root system call to have the kernel swap and initrd then exec sbin init on the real root which would then umount initrd and free the ramdisk

18065
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
i don t think i can migrate my users to kde 4 or gnome 3 but xfce still has some functional drawbacks.

18074
installation	upgrade
this allows me to spot any local modifications and installation and plan for them instead of the customer telling me after an upgrade that their software does not work any more

18076
bash	zsh
if you don t have the permission to change your login shell you can tell bash i assume bash is your login shell to replace itself with zsh

18080
bash	zsh
note that since bash 4 or in zsh you don t need find at all here

18082
redhat	fedora
i like opensuse a little bit better between the two because it seems to have more up to date packages although the free version of redhat - fedora - may differ

18082
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
at home i run linux mint which is a variant of ubuntu

18082
opensuse	mint
i like it better than opensuse because mint is much faster to install and update between the two

18082
opera	google-chrome
i also like how mint has all the software you need in the software center including google-chrome opera skype

18082
kde	gnome
i know nothing of ubuntu s unity i m just familiar with gnome and kde

18082
kde	gnome
after running kde for 5 years i switched to gnome

18085
chgrp	chmod
chgrp -v new_group file chmod -v 770 file

18086
sudo	passwd
if your version of chsh requires a passwd mine does you will need to setup sudo with special permissions

18107
filesystems	ntfs
i ve just tested it on an ntfs filesystems mounted using ntfs-3g and it seemed to work without problems no errors the verbose output looks typical

18118
tar	gunzip
i tried something like gunzip file.tar.gz | tar -tv but that only gives

18121
folder	directory
if you ran my find with no arguments at all all files and directory starting from the current folder would be returned

18124
tar	gunzip
update 2 finally found what looks to be a decent site for solaris man pages so i present to you man gunzip and man tar

18129
stdout	stderr
i am trying to debug a server that throws a lot of logs on stdout stderr

18132
ubuntu	linux
â i set it up months ago when linux ubuntu was very new to me but i don t know how i added it.

18135
disk	ram
so cmd1 | cmd2 is more efficient than this might not be true if tmpfile is backed on a ram disk or other memory device as named pipe

18168
filesystems	ntfs
edit the ntfs drives aren t in proc mounts either furthermore there is no mention of any ntfs filesystems in etc filesystems and proc filesystems

18168
filesystems	ntfs
why is there no mention of a mounted ntfs filesystems in mtab even though they re mounted on my system and browsable

18208
centos	linux
i run vi under linux centos 5.3

18209
solaris	minix
solaris minix and other nix

18214
rar	zip
if you are like me you have tons of archives lying around in different formats zip tar rar tgz tar.bz2 etc

18226
solaris	minix
epoc zaurus pda morphos tru64 osf minix solaris and dos

18241
gentoo	mint
one simple trick you might use is to just run your mint on the gentoo kernel

18241
gentoo	mint
the command uname -r run from the working gentoo system will indicate the appropriate files directories you will have to copy to your mint partition

18241
gentoo	mint
you cannot just use the kernel configuration from your working gentoo kernel with the sources from mint i m referring to the configs you ve pasted - because they refer to different kernel sources

18241
gentoo	mint
if you really want the gentoo configuration with mint kernel you can try to use the gentoo config file with the same or newer version of kernel sources from mint

18241
gentoo	mint
then you should copy the gentoo config tou your mint sources directory naming it .config and first of all run make oldconfig before doing any manual configuration

18268
stdout	stderr
there are not only file descriptors - stdin stdout and stderr are also descriptors you can write and read from them using absolutely the same functions as with files except you can t for example seek

18275
versioning	upgrade
63047.811382 ath9k_htc 2-1.2 1.0 ath9k_htc please upgrade to fw versioning 1.3

18286
unix	bsd
there are two traditional printing interfaces in the unix world lp the system v interface and lpr the bsd interface

18286
solaris	bsd
it s the default or only system under mac osâ x and most linux distributions as well as recent versions of solaris and it s available as a package on all major bsd distributions

18294
width	height
i was wondering how to change width and height of each page of a pdf

18294
width	height
i would like to shrink the width and height to smaller ones which are normally seen in pdf files

18296
folder	directory
i m able to write changes in the home directory but when it comes to the var www html folder it s not allowing me to make any changes or create new files or folder

18347
kde	gnome
the most common toolkits on linux are gtk originally developed for the gimp and now used in most gnome stuff the qt tookit most famous for being used in kde and wxwidgets

18382
bash	zsh
the printf built-in command in ksh bash and zsh all understand the q format specifier

18388
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs has begun to gain some momentum in replacing ext4 as the default filesystems of choice for a few distributions such as fedora core 16

18388
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
it is experimentally available in a number of other distributions from wikipedia opensuse 11.3 sles 11 sp1 ubuntu 10.10 sabayon linux rhel6 meego debian 6.0 and slackware 13.37

18388
filesystems	btrfs
outside of enterprise storage why should i bother switching to btrfs from the tried and true ext filesystems

18390
filesystems	btrfs
but why would you be so hasty as to think of btrfs as a filesystems ready to replace any of your current ones

18407
vmware	virtualbox
the last solution is to run a vm in virtualbox or vmware workstation

18413
uptime	reboot
i reboot the system yesterday so i know the contents that uptime is showing me is correct

18424
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs inode limits is in a whole different league whereas ext4 s inodes are allocated at filesystems creation time and cannot be resized after creation typically at 1-2 million with a hard limit of 4 billion btrfs s inodes are dynamically allocated as needed and the hard limit is 2 64 around 18.4 quintillion which is around 4.6 billion times the hard limit of ext4

18475
debian-based	ubuntu
on debian-based systems like ubuntu there are tools and so on

18486
folder	directory
i have noticed that kmail shows folder which were absent in backed up version soe it has to scan mail directory for mail folder

18495
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu family of linux operating

18496
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning

18502
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
it looks like you ve installed x but haven t installed any desktop environments gnome kde xfce lxde etc so you re getting the minimal bundled window manager

18504
daemons	systemd
the acpi daemons runs as root so it has permission to shutdown the systemd

18512
filesystems	xfs
most native linux filesystems use partition type 83 for example all of the variants reiserfs xfs and others

18545
bluetooth	usb
you can control it with standard usb bluetooth input devices or over the lan respectively internet

18550
google-chrome	firefox
i m using firefox and google-chrome under ubuntu 10.04 and get these warnings

18558
kde	gnome
you might try the forums mailing lists of desktop environment projects like gnome main development discussion list or kde mailing lists

18563
versioning	upgrade
for me an upgrade is when the major versioning is incremented and an update when it s the minor versioning

18568
kde	gnome
if you have the same errors try the gnome or kde livecd in your usb stick

18576
vlan	packets
i m working with vlans on briges and have found that if i add a non-vlan interface to any bridge it breaks all the vlan interfaces - packets leave just fine but the return packets which are appropriately vlan tagged are getting dropped somewhere

18582
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have a linux mint 11 instalation until some months ago i had ubuntu 11.04 and since yesterday i have different problems

18599
vlan	packets
in your particular example br0 is consuming the packets from eth0 and the vlan code is not getting them

18599
vlan	packets
it removes the conflict between whether vlan or bridge consumes packets from eth0 and makes the layering clear

18601
solaris	sunos
im on a solaris sparc ultra 2 sunos 5.7

18612
sysv	systemd
sysv messages queues are small by default on my systemd ipcs -l displays

18631
pypdf	pdftk
if you have an older version of pdftk you can use this python script with the pypdf library

18634
single-quotes	double-quotes
i ve tried escaping it with backslashes single-quotes double-quotes parentheses and backticks but cat always complains that w is an unknown option

18637
processors	hyperthreading
i use a i5-2410m processors which is setup to do hyperthreading by default on my laptop

18643
unix	bsd
you didn t mention what linux distro bsd or unix you re using but the current log file the one sendmail currently appends to is probably named var log maillog if var log maillog doesn t exist you could try stopping and starting sendmail and seeing if a var log maillog or other file gets created

18645
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading means that the cpu starts processing a second thread wether two threads from a multi-threaded application or two single threaded applications before the first thread finishes whatever it was doing

18645
processors	hyperthreading
in fact because of the overhead associated with managing the two logical processors of hyperthreading it s even possible to see some performance degradation when running only a single-threaded app

18651
post	get
i found this old mailing list post that describes how to get the local time to display in the status bar at the bottom of the screen but this still doesn t fix the time in the date header at the top of the screen

18656
versioning	upgrade
upgrade or even downgrades installed packages to versioning found in repositories removes packages that are no longer in the repositories and pose a dependency problem for the upgrade handles package splits and renames etc

18661
stdout	fflush
note fflush in the comments means send the pattern-space to sed s internal stdout handling

18662
freebsd	linux
if you specifically want to exclude .git but include everything else under linux or freebsd or osx or cygwin tar has a simple option to exclude a directory

18709
disk	ram
i ve got a computer with 512 mb of ram and a 50 gb hard disk

18711
bash	zsh
tested with zsh bash and dash

18726
stdout	stderr
i am specifically looking on the return variables of running ping on my ubuntu server the variables i am looking for is error status output on stdout output on stderr

18727
stdout	stderr
error stdout stderr are not variables but types of output that a unix binary can return

18727
stdout	stderr
stderr - this is text that is outputted to the error stream an second output that is not caputred by any redirection of the stdout stream

18733
versioning	upgrade
machine2 should not be able to upgrade package1 even if a new versioning is available in the repository

18747
bash	zsh
yet another implementation that does not rely on external programs in bash zsh yash and some implementations versions of ksh

18764
unix	bsd
commands like ps come with a lot of parameters especially because they give the use an option to choose between unix and bsd style flags

18764
unix	bsd
i know that unix style is quite obvious but bsd commands for some reason include more readable information column titles for example cpu column etc

18767
unix	bsd
pretty much all linuxes use gnu versions of the original core unix commands like ps which as you ve noted supports both bsd and at t style options

18767
unix	bsd
which derives indirectly from bsd unix and in general behaves most similarly to bsd unix still mdash

18767
solaris	bsd
solaris openindiana behaves this way too though this is less surprising because it has a mixed bsd and at t history

18767
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
freebsd openbsd and netbsd still hew to the bsd style exclusively

18767
unix	bsd
bsd unix is still unix reg

18767
unix	bsd
bsd unix shares a direct development history with the original at t branch

18777
disk	ram
the bits would be like packages in a sense except instead of being installed they would be mounted as part of the filesystem in ram and are read directly from the read-only disk vs

18780
folder	directory
in order to match a dot-file in a subdirectory or any directory other than the current working directory of rsync you need to place your include rule to include folder first then your match to include dot-files

18810
ubuntu	linux
there are several ping utilities available on linux even on ubuntu

18810
stdout	stderr
the utility uses stderr for fatal errors and some warnings and stdout for various status reports and informational messages

18830
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
i need to run something as sudo without a passwd so i used visudo and added this to my sudoers file

18833
sudo	passwd
having done that sudo will prompt for a passwd normally for all commands except path to my program which it will always let you run without asking for your passwd

18836
debian	linux
it is possible to run a more traditional linux distro such as a stripped down debian on the nexus-one and many other handsets that were made for android

18845
versioning	upgrade
both the host node and the container itself are running debian squeeze with packages upgrade to the latest versioning

18870
hash	md5
since the md5 hash has fixed length 32 characters you can use the option -c 1-32 to keep only the first 32 characters from the input line

18871
spaces	delimiter
here -d chooses spaces as delimiter and -f1 asks for the first field before a delimiter

18888
pecl	pear
having now installed pear i have also installed pecl and should now be able to install the php_http extension

18897
unix	aix
note i am using unix aix os

18904
stdout	stderr
it swaps stdout with stderr

18918
cpu	processors
st - they say it s the time in involuntary wait by virtual cpu while hypervisor is servicing another processors or time stolen from a virtual machine

18927
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
now the -t option is the filesystems type means ntfs fat ext

18948
udp	tcp
i read that samba needs ports 137-139 and 445 open on both tcp and udp

18962
cvs	rcs
for your intended use the ancient but serviceable rcs or cvs systems may already exist on both aix and red hat and are perfectly acceptable for a single user

18962
put	get
cvs allows you to put a repository in an arbitrary directory which might get you backups of the repository for free eliminating that headeache

18965
filesystems	xfs
this varies from filesystems to filesystems ext4 jfs xfs etc. but these lists of blocks can usually address file sizes of anywhere from 2gb to several tb

18967
sudo	passwd
my problem is that i wrote a python script to reset the device and it works but i have to run it as root or sudo program name enter passwd

18969
post	get
the rest of it is a little large to post here so anyone who s interested can just get it at the repo

18971
vim	gedit
now if it s something significantly more important like say a database rather than just some text file or document in your home directory then it s much more likely that file locking will be used which also is not to say that vim or gedit don t use locks

18977
sudoers	visudo
add this line to the sudoers file use the visudo program never edit the sudoers file directly where bob is the name of the user who must be allowed to run the script

19022
folder	directory
say i have folder foo residing the home directory

19033
folder	directory
files are typically arranged in a set of folder or directory to separate them by purpose

19040
ubuntu	linux
i want to try to setting up a headless terminal-only ubuntu linux server and am trying to find resources to get started

19040
ubuntu	linux
i ve been a gui linux windows user for a while now and have run through a tutorial to setup a server on an ubuntu desktop with the gui but the biggest hurtle i found was when i tried to only use the terminal

19040
postgresql	mysql
on the server i d also like to setup a database postgresql mysql i wouldn t shy away from some experience with samba as well

19045
postgresql	mysql
for the specific case of seeing if your server is running look at sudo etc init.d service_name command where service is mysql apache2 nginx postgresql ssh ufw

19045
postgresql	mysql
it s much simpler to set up and use then a full fledged database suite like postgresql mysql oracle

19067
apache	nginx
it affected both apache and nginx

19077
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to run a linaro beagleboard image under qemu and i have trouble with the keyboard and mouse

19077
mouse	keyboard
basically neither the keyboard nor the mouse work once the boot process completes

19086
kde	gnome
by default kde and gnome have the panels at bottom but you can change the position

19090
bash	zsh
replacing the spaces with underscores is easy in bash ksh and zsh with the construct

19090
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu and derivatives you can use the perl rename other distributions ship a different program as rename and that program isn t helpful here

19100
ubuntu	mint
mint based on ubuntu should already have apport

19101
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
can a linux mint user report a bug using apport-bug like in ubuntu linux

19119
pthreads	fork
the behavior of shells when fork fails is not specified by pthreads

19119
bash	tcsh	ash	tcsh
in practice they tend to return different error statuses 1 in pdksh 2 in ash 254 in bash 258 in ksh93 1 in tcsh

19123
kde	gnome
how to do this depends on your desktop but i m sure it s fairly easy if you are using something like gnome or kde

19140
versioning	upgrade
for a machine like this choose a stable distribution debian rhel sles and definitely upgrade only after a suitably long period new versioning stabilized for at least 6 months

19141
ubuntu	debian	debian-based	ubuntu
but first i find that aufs is supported for the debian kernel but not for ubuntu - so provided that your distro is proper debian-based we can proceed to install some basic tools thusly

19180
ftp	telnet
similar examples might be mysql telnet ftp etc

19188
sysv	systemd
you should be looking for a hosting provider who will provider serial-over-ssh access and configure your linux installation to use the relevant serial port as the the console how you do this depends on whether the systemd uses upstart or sysv type initialization

19198
gcj	javac
g++ and javac gcj can be installed via yum after or you can modify the kickstart file to include them in the install

19200
centos	linux
a better long-term plan is to learn enough about centos and linux in general that you can move off plesk onto a generic unmanaged vps

19206
slackware	archlinux
distros like archlinux gentoo or slackware would get you where you want but you ll probably need to get your hands dirty a bit

19214
centos	linux
on another linux server i am running an old centos release with the openssl version required and it runs without issue

19219
centos	linux
i m running centos in linux text mode

19224
ubuntu	linux
how do i finish installing ubuntu so i can boot up and start my first venture into linux

19225
ubuntu	linux
i migrated to unix linux ubuntu and i m trying to understand the organisation of files and directories

19277
folder	directory
which will operate on all the files and folder in the directory some path

19282
kde	gnome
for example you could install a new windows manager gnome kde whichever on linux and a user currently logged in to the system might never be aware

19286
bash	zsh
if you re using a shell that has arrays bash ksh or zsh store the elements in an array

19295
gentoo	linux
i m running funtoo linux a gentoo derivative

19299
sudo	passwd
is there a way in linux to make sudo command to remember the passwd the user entered for in the first of the lines

19299
sudo	passwd
for example for a list of commands that the user has to enter the some of then requiring a sudo prefix how can one make sure that if the user copy+pastes the instructions into a terminal all in one go is only asked the passwd once

19303
sudo	passwd
user may then use sudo without a passwd for a short period of time

19330
bash	zsh
i called zsh from bash for the first time in my machine after installing it

19340
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m running linux mint 11 ubuntu 11.04 64bit

19344
folder	directory
i have a directory that is unpacked but is in a folder

19349
mouse	keyboard
you won t be able to use the same keyboard and mouse for both displays though

19350
sudo	passwd
sudo -s will start a shell as root possibly prompting you for your passwd

19362
bash	zsh
in bash ksh or zsh you can explicitly specify base 10 with

19373
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	solaris	bsd
when porting a network stack from solaris bsd linux and windows to osx the only main point that garners attention is that much like freebsd the entire tool chain is pretty old

19374
websphere	ibm
we migrated it to ibm websphere on aix and the application ran substantially faster on rhel jboss

19375
opensuse	centos	rhel	suse
if you use an rpm based distribution centos rhel suse opensuse you can use rpm -ql

19398
unix	aix
actually i d recommend aix on pseries any day due to the mature logical volume management best in the unix world in my view and the exceptionaly versatile virtualisation again in my view best of breed in the enterprise unix arena

19407
pop-up	dialog
when i invoke the binary an error dialog saying failed loading skin pop-up and the following is written to the terminal

19416
solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
this answer is something of a guess given that you didn t say on what kind of system you see this solaris hp-ux aix a bsd linux what distro

19416
solaris	sunos
a lot of older sunos and solaris systems would have etc profile do this

19416
solaris	sunos
sometimes a sigwinch in sunos and solaris at least would get used to set the rows and columns variables

19419
ubuntu	linux
i am doing a build on a linux machine with ubuntu 10.04 on it

19426
bash	zsh
i just moved to zsh and would like to keep the same keyboard bindings i have in bash

19429
bash	zsh
almost everything you can do in bash has a zsh equivalent but you have to handle the translation on a case-by-case basis

19448
ssd	sata
random example samsung s 6gbps sata 2 ssd

19459
mouse	keyboard
i m using a ps 2 keyboard and usb mouse

19466
jobs	cron
it s like cron in some ways but it is setup more like a queue for one time jobs than for repeat jobs

19508
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu with linux 2.6.38-10-generic

19514
debian	linux
i ve just installed crunchbang linux based on debian on some really old hardware we re talking single cores and ddr memory here for a simple home server

19515
dpkg	apt
since both apt and dpkg handle dependencies i d think removing these packages should remove all the related x packages and you should be good

19530
bash	zsh
the script below works in bash but not in zsh

19534
gentoo	debian
this is contained in a separate package - on gentoo it is xf86-input-keyboard on debian according to gilles comment below the name should be xserver-xorg-input-kbd

19539
debian	linux
i was at uni a few days ago when i attempted to cut and paste a 500mb file a 3gp video recording into my h drive on one of the uni network s linux debian kde 3.5 computers

19550
bluetooth	usb
looking at the output from lspci and lsusb here s the relevant line from lsusb so it s a usb wifi and bluetooth device

19551
ethernet	wireless
use a wifi bridge to extend the wireless signal onto ethernet supported by most access point devices and possible with most wireless routers

19565
ubuntu	linux
judging from window management on linux at least on ubuntu using gnome with compiz windows are organised in a stack

19569
bash	zsh
if you only need your script to work in ksh bash and zsh make it an array

19588
ubuntu	linux
i am on ubuntu linux

19620
ubuntu	freebsd
i also want to access this freebsd box from a ubuntu machine that i have

19626
kde	kubuntu
on my kde 4.4.5 - kubuntu lucid panel i click on the cashew at the end

19640
freebsd	linux
freenas is based-off freebsd and openfiler is based off linux

19673
centos	linux
centos ties to be an exact copy of rhel red-hat enterprise linux

19674
post	get
the action is the url to submit to and the action lets you know if its a post or a get request

19674
submit	submission
build up your command line with those options and execute it keeping in mind the url you re submission to is not the resource you were originally trying to get - you need to submit to the url pointed to by the attribute

19690
hfs+	ntfs	xfs	ntfs
what is the safest hard drive format ntfs hfs+ xfs zfs ... for archiving or and storing media data

19697
filesystems	ntfs
while other formats such as zfs certainly have their advantages few filesystems other than ntfs have as broad os support as ext3 4

19718
mp3	ogg
searching for a command line tagging tool for mp3 and ogg that supports pictures

19719
hide	show
i don t think openbox can do exactly that at least not yet but would a quake-like drop-down style terminal that you can show hide with a hotkey be an acceptable subsitute

19742
gentoo	debian
i m a debian user pretty much new to gentoo

19791
lan	localhost
for instance i have a box running scientific linux 6.1 a rhel based distro and i want its ssh server to only accept connections from localhost or lan

19799
lan	localhost
this says that all lan addresses are allowed to talk to tcp port 22 that localhost gets the same consideration yes 127

19801
lan	localhost
assuming your local lan network is 192.168.100.0 24 you can deny access to sshd to all clients except those on the localhost or on the local lan by putting the following into your etc hosts.deny file

19810
ubuntu	debian
that s the perl-based rename found on debian ubuntu and derivatives judging by the syntax

19811
centos	linux
i have a brand new scientific linux 6 system but this same question should apply to centos 6 rhel6 or any rhel6-derivative

19823
ethernet	wireless
but easier to diagnose just set the mtu on your ethernet or wireless interface to something really small and see what happens

19828
debian	linux
however since i am an absolute linux beginner i am not committed to any distribution in particular yet i use debian at the moment

19829
octal	hex
first thing one notices is that the character code can t be hex or octal so i ve googled it and only found this

19868
debian	linux
i run the tiger automatic auditor on my debian linux system and recently got emailed the following

19878
tunnel	vpn
and are there any iptables rules i should set up to limit forwarding to my vpn tunnel

19902
x86	64bit
this combines linux headers for both 32- and 64bit intel x86 cpu variants

19959
ubuntu	linux
i m not very good with linux my previous experience has been with ubuntu and fedora so please be gentle

19964
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux system ubuntu running in a vm but now i want to disable the graphical shell

19971
switching	screens
i can switching to another terminal via ctrl + alt + f2 but the screens remains black and won t wake up

19991
daemons	systemd
this however does not guarantee that no systemd daemons will notice the fact that wget was run - the network activity can be independently monitored by other tools

20042
bash	zsh
in ksh bash and zsh you can use the quoted form to expand backslash escapes inside the quotes

20049
ubuntu	debian
disclaimer actually using debian here not ubuntu but i am knowledgeable enough to find the right packages and compile my own if needed

20058
put	get
this program works as i intended but i feel like i used some clumsy methods to get the out put i desired especially with my use of print commands and variable declarations

20062
ubuntu	linux
i ve just downloaded bodhi linux which is built on ubuntu 10.04 lts

20063
ubuntu	linux
from the website for bodhi linux their distribution which was just released a few days ago is based upon ubuntu lts

20093
mtu	icmp
but in some cases a firewall in the path may be blocking all icmp packets and therefore breaking the path mtu detection causing apparent freezes

20098
ubuntu	debian
also none of the source-based distributions have the kind of mindshare backing that ubuntu debian have

20099
for-loop	loops
to avoid this situation you could replace while loops by for-loop 0 to 5 for example with 5 seconds sleep with it

20109
debian	linux
also i read somewhere about setting up a chroot on android to run full-fledged linux distros such as debian

20112
sudo	passwd
what specific vulnerabilities am i creating by disabling the sudo passwd

20112
sudo	passwd
i m involved yet again in the old argument on whether sudo without passwd is secure enough or not

20112
sudo	passwd
i m on the side of those who doesn t mind typing a passwd every time i use sudo even if it s less convenient because it means that not just any script that runs on the server can include sudo install-rootkit without me knowing it

20113
sudo	passwd
sudo without a passwd is less secure than with a passwd

20113
sudo	passwd
like anything else in life you trade off security for convenience when you use sudo without a passwd

20114
sudo	passwd
if you are using sudo to track commands it will be logged whether you enter the passwd or not

20114
sudo	passwd
other than that prompting for passwd for every invocation of sudo may be at worse a minor inconvenience when managing small sites

20114
sudo	passwd
in such instances a person will use scripts or applications at the client side to store the passwd temporarily when executing sudo

20124
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
you might want to try linux installer feature search_result which lets you install debian or ubuntu

20131
postfix	dovecot
the accounts are being used by dovecot sasl to provide authentication for postfix services and other applications

20164
ubuntu	debian
see how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

20166
jobs	cron
i ve verified that cron is running and the other jobs here run but the last one does not

20183
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
it has been packaged at least in debian ubuntu fedora gentoo etcâ

20184
tunnel	vpn
as long as a vpn tunnel is open you then can connect to the remote machine via ssh as if it is in your home network

20197
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
the big ones are dpkg apt apt-get aptitude and synaptic

20201
rpm	yum
when using fedora i usually use yum localinstall as a way to install a rpm obtained outside the distribution repositories

20228
debian	linux
i have debian linux

20230
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
all in all most major linux distributions ubuntu debian arch linux including aur opensuse fedora mandriva have a similar amount of software

20232
ubuntu	debian
here i use the perl rename script that debian and ubuntu ship as usr bin prename typically available as rename as well

20232
bash	zsh
with bash â 4 or zsh

20256
unix	solaris
note that i would like to do this using standard unix commands available on solaris 10

20263
vim	emacs
if you are looking to use 256 colours in a specific application like vim or emacs there are separate guides for how to achieve that

20270
hash	md5
oldlist - this contains a list of files and a md5 hash for each file

20270
hash	md5
newlist - this also contains a list of files and a md5 hash for each file

20270
hash	md5
however some files have been changed their md5 hash is different and some new files have been added

20270
hash	md5
i only want to compare the md5 hash for each old file so that i can see if any files have changed within the last year

20280
freebsd	netbsd
note the dev null trick to cause grep to show the file name even if it happens to be called on a single file gnu grep and freebsd netbsd osx grep have a -h option to achieve the same effect

20297
sudo	passwd
then execute it as this could ask for your user passwd depending on how is sudo configured

20307
daemon	cron
whether any of them are multi-threaded or not is not really a question that i think is relevant unless you re trying to write your own implementation of the cron daemon

20347
centos	linux
this is in regards to scientific linux 6.1 system but should also apply to centos 6.1 rhel 6.1

20376
ubuntu	debian
debian should also apply to ubuntu

20376
redhat	fedora
redhat should also apply to fedora

20388
daemon	cron
the cron daemon does not wait for the child to finish executing although iirc it may handle certain signals sent by the child

20399
stdout	stderr
throughout the application i output to stdout and stderr

20416
opensuse	linux
i just took the linux distribution chooser quiz and its recommendations are opensuse and fedora

20418
kde	gnome
of course this sort of jump from gnome or kde is not for everyone

20427
ubuntu	debian
it uses tools from poppler package poppler-utils on debian or ubuntu

20428
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
a desktop environment such as xfce kde gnome etc

20441
sage	maxima
axiom cadabra cocoa docon eigenmath fricas gap ginac macaulay2 mathomatic maxima openaxiom pari gp reduce sage singular sympy xcas

20451
debian	linux
i run logcheck on my debian linux system to get alerted to unusual lines in my log files and recently i saw the following in var log messages

20471
stdout	stderr
the old stdout will be saved copied in stderr and then stdout will be redirected to file

20471
stdout	stderr
so stdout will go to file and stderr will go to console

20471
stdout	stderr
this will redirect both stdout and stderr to the file

20472
cat	tee
it then pipes that through the tee program which will send its standard input to its standard output like cat and also to the file

20472
stdout	stderr
the bottom line is that the first sends stderr stdout to the file while the second sends it to both the file and standard output which is probably the terminal unless you re inside another construct which has redirected standard output

20474
stdout	stderr
the reason for is to be able to capture both stdout and stderr to a log file and to see it on the screen at the same time

20479
opensolaris	smartos
if you are interested with zfs and other solaris features instead of xen which used to support being a dom0 on opensolaris but has being phased out i would recommend either virtualbox or the recent port of kvm on top of illumos smartos although i have no experience with the latter

20481
versioning	upgrade
there is any easy way to upgrade the default curl 7.15 to the 7.20 or 7.21 versioning

20490
rhel	suse
if yes where would this be for rhel suse and ubuntu

20518
rmdir	mkdir
a benefit is that you can watch in a gui-filemanager what effect your mkdir touch rmdir .

20526
debian	linux
permissions on my debian linux system are

20528
postgresql	mysql
database server base console-internet core debugging directory-client hardware-monitoring java-platform large-systems network-file-system-client performance perl-runtime server-platform mysql-client mysql postgresql-client postgresql system-admin-tools

20534
daemons	systemd	pull	push
puppet has to be set up on each client systemd but then can run as a daemons and pull in changes or you can push changes to it from the puppet server

20539
solaris	bsd
so if you wanted your script to run on solaris bsd and gnu then you would have to write it in say the bourne shell

20539
freebsd	solaris	unix	solaris
however most unix commands have different syntaxes under different implementations -- look at ps under solaris freebsd and gnu -- so depending on what tools you use your script may not be portable anyway

20557
kde	gnome
alternatively you should be able to do that from a gui of you use gnome kde or any other modern desktops

20592
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux

20593
debian	linux
there is an interesting part of debian gnu linux faq devoted to this question

20595
mouse	keyboard
it s also possible that your mouse sends a keyboard event when you press these buttons

20599
bash	zsh
in ksh bash zsh you can use the construct instead of the command

20646
chown	chmod
on gnu linux chown and chmod have a --reference option

20647
ubuntu	linux
is it related specifically to linux ubuntu

20650
chown	chmod
if you are not using a system with gnu s chmod chown which support the --reference option you could try to parse the output of ls -l

20661
chown	chmod
on any unix with gnu utilities such as non-embedded linux or cygwin you can use chmod --reference and chown --reference

20675
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
homebrew is basically fink macports done.

20684
bash	zsh
in a bash shell this works without a hitch but when i run it in zsh i get the following error

20690
solaris	aix
i tried the -p option used in aix but it s not useful in solaris

20714
vxworks	rtos	vxworks	qnx	rtos	qnx
common rtos in scada applications are centos rtlinux there are a few flavors out there vxworks for scada devices qnx very popular and pikeos used in things like nuke safety stuff

20721
bash	zsh
the snippet works great in bash but not in zsh and i can t tell why

20736
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian

20736
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
mint is based on ubuntu except for linux mint debian edition which is based on debian.

20741
disk	ram
if a chunk of memory that s mapped in a process is backed up by a file the copy in ram is considered part of the disk cache and will be freed under memory pressure just like a disk cache entry created by read ing from a file

20744
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
mint aside from the debian edition relies heavily on the ubuntu infrastructure

20744
ubuntu	mint
it not only is based on ubuntu in that mint is essentially ubuntu with in-house modifications but it also relies on ubuntu s package repositories too

20744
ubuntu	mint
also the philosophy of the mint project is compatible with proprietary software they put percieved user-friendliness above libre software whereas ubuntu discourages it

20744
ubuntu	mint
as an example mint comes with adobe flash preinstalled whereas ubuntu does not -- this extends to many other components

20744
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian in that not only did it start off building from debian s codebase it also utilises a number of tools that were originally designed for debian aptitude is a notable example

20744
ubuntu	debian
the ethos too is radically different debian s core ethos emphasises stability and predictability whereas ubuntu s poses ease-of-use

20752
jobs	cron
it allows your shells and cron jobs to share a single ssh-agent process

20753
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
i would trace your perl script with a system call trace tool strace linux dtruss os x ktrace freebsd truss solaris etc

20763
ubuntu	linux
if you are working on a recent linux disto like ubuntu you should already have ssh-agent compatible key-manager running on your system

20764
mouse	keyboard
i have only one cable now and usb mouse and keyboard it they could help and i d like to test if the cable is damaged

20779
daemons	systemd
-- depending on what nix flavor your systemd is and the systemd daemons configuration

20783
daemons	systemd
the indicates that the variables are set in the environment used by the systemd daemons at startup

20785
ubuntu	opensuse
as a note other distributions have host is different packages ubuntu bind9-host opensuse bind-utils frugalware bind .

20797
sudoers	visudo
i use sudo visudo to modify sudoers file and add the following line

20810
single-quotes	double-quotes
single-quotes and double-quotes

20820
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
extra packages for enterprise linux or epel is a fedora special interest group that creates maintains and manages a high quality set of additional packages for enterprise linux including but not limited to redhat enterprise linux rhel centos and scientific linux sl

20825
ubuntu	debian
i m a long term ubuntu user who is considering migrating from ubuntu to debian mainly because of unity and the fact that my school has a debian mirror

20825
ubuntu	debian
how much functionality can i expect from ubuntu tweak on debian

20829
rpm	yum
i found this information about yum and rpm handling as well

20832
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu tweak is all stuff that debian folks generally prefer to do manually

20859
doc	rtf
sometimes i use it to convert a rtf file into html but it s also able to convert doc docx odt and other formats

20872
folder	directory
what i want to do is recursively go through the homework folder and as i drop down into each student folder add a comment to the top of each file in that folder using the student directory name to know what to put into the comment

20917
openbsd	centos
i m searching for a virtualization solutions for an openbsd host and a centos guest

20961
uninstall	upgrade
the problem i can foresee is that at a later date you may want to uninstall or upgrade the program

20963
folder	directory
i tried copying in the . disk folder into the directory for the install but it still fails

20972
kde	gnome
both versions of gnome doesn t fit into our company so we have chosen to give kde a try

20981
ubuntu	debian
aptitude-based distributions ubuntu debian etc dpkg -l

20981
openbsd	freebsd
pkg -based distributions openbsd freebsd etc pkg_info

20982
bash	tcsh
unfortunately it doesn t work with the atmospheric science department computers as they use tcsh rather than bash

21002
openbsd	linux
third there is no host-based virtualization platform included in openbsd that i am aware of well there s the linux binary compatibility layer - but that s a fancy kernel land api trick nor do i ever expect this functionality to be added to openbsd

21008
bash	zsh
i often find myself switching between bash and zsh and using the history search functionality to recover a command

21008
bash	zsh
however since bash and zsh have different history files i often find that the command i m searching for has been executed in the other shell

21019
comm	grep
some complicated mess with comm grep and cut would be possible but hopefully there s a simpler way

21028
switching	screens
for me it doesn t matter whether the secondary monitor is primary or not and even if i switching off the smaller screens using xrandr and only use the large monitor the issue remains

21029
unix	solaris
on other unix systems the ones i have my hands on are mac os x and solaris the port is separated by

21039
bash	zsh
if you are using the defaults for bash and zsh

21046
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu there is the package usbmount that should do exactly what you ask

21050
folder	directory
you can copy the .gconf folder from between users home directory

21052
xfce	kde
xdg-utils works with kde xfce fluxbox etc

21059
ubuntu	debian
how much functionality can i expect from ubuntu tweak on debian

21065
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
running linux ubuntu or debian

21069
sudo	passwd
log in as an ordinary user then become root by running sudo and typing your own passwd

21074
sudo	passwd
it s not asking even for a sudo ed user s passwd

21089
ubuntu	linux
how can i do the following in fedora 15 ubuntu linux

21090
ubuntu	debian
it s in the alsa-utils package on ubuntu debian

21118
spoofing	traffic
the actual reason that the application isn t seeing the return traffic is because of the kernel s built in ip spoofing protection

21153
sudo	passwd
is there some method to minimize the usage of sudo and or a way to use it that s faster than typing my passwd but which is still secure

21163
folder	directory
i am trying to copy a lot of folder to another directory

21234
filesystems	xfs
and luks is designed for block devices like xfs is a filesystems for block devices

21270
redhat	fedora
if you happen to be running redhat or possibly fedora i ran into a problem with pam_fprintd not being installed

21298
daemon	cron
i killed the cron daemon accidentally

21298
daemon	cron
i wanted to stop a cron task didn t know how to do it ended up killing the cron daemon itself

21300
jobs	cron
see how do i list all cron jobs for all users for some ways to list everything as root

21306
emacs	kate
they are working in some programs xev emacs kate konqueror and not others firefox openoffice gnome-text-editor

21317
kde	gnome
if you re a complete graphical environment on your box x and some desktop environment like gnome or kde it ll undoubtedly a process of your desktop environment

21322
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu you could see that there is an entry user-dirs-update-gtk.desktop in etc xdg autostart

21329
kde	gnome
that potentially includes all gnome or kde applications

21331
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is still an experimental filesystems expected to have bugs

21333
stdout	stderr
every process will start with references to about three or five entries into the in-memory inode table the inodes of stdin stdout stderr - these are often a device file tty - and then references to the current directory and the root directory

21338
daemons	systemd
it sounds like some daemons reacting by rebooting a systemd

21340
vxworks	rtos
vxworks rtos

21340
freebsd	linux
the device is designed in such a way that its state is saved somewhere periodically like juniper routers that run freebsd android phones and dvrs that run linux

21359
ubuntu	debian
mixing binary packages from debian and ubuntu repositories is a very bad idea

21370
traceroute	packets
to see where your packets go through to reach a host use traceroute or a variant such as traceroute6 tracepath or tcptraceroute depending on which protocol you re interested in

21372
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
install one stable distribution such as debian stable or ubuntu lts or red hat enterprise linux

21372
debian	linux
and install one rolling release distribution such as debian unstable or fedora or arch linux

21372
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
there are three main bsd distributions freebsd is the most â œmainstreamâ one openbsd focuses on security and netbsd focuses on portability

21372
gentoo	linux
amongst the linux distributions you may want to give gentoo a try sticking to its stable branch for core system package and risking the testing branch for others

21375
put	get
on first running cygwin with a fresh home directory default versions of .bash_profile and such get put there but again there is no conflict with things that already get put there

21376
des	aes
i rely on stream cipher rc4 right now openssl rc4 but as with des and aes i d like to switch to something more secure and more modern

21420
openssl	libcrypto
from digging around i see the sshd is not compiled against openssl but it is compiled against libcrypto which is part of the openssl package

21430
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
is there a way i can setup ubuntu or linux mint preferred to allow run a similar wizard on next reboot

21431
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i barely know anything about linux mint anymore as they seem to have been diverting from ubuntu for some time

21459
versioning	upgrade
in order to investigate the problem i tried to reinstall older versioning of package libasound2 i have upgrade it recently

21465
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
the linux kernel itself is under gpl as is the core userland of most distros in any case gnu is gpl so unlimited reuse is probably out of the question you could try freebsd or netbsd if you need that

21465
put	get
if you want to build your own linux distro linux from scratch lfs is the way to go but you ll have to put in quite some effort to get it to work and keep it up to date

21475
ubuntu	opensuse
both the ubuntu and opensuse boxes are 64-bit installs and file returns the same information on both machines

21476
ubuntu	opensuse
both on the opensuse and ubuntu system

21479
ubuntu	centos
you won t find this with centos ubuntu fedora etc.

21479
versioning	upgrade
and if you don t like the versioning that comes with the stock slackware you can easily upgrade using the original source tar balls

21506
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu related

21512
apache	nginx
i want to install nagios but instead of using apache i would like to use nginx

21544
bash	subshell
in bash 4 it is possible to use a subshell instead

21610
dpkg	apt
this also seems like a good introduction presentation on apt and dpkg

21610
dpkg	aptitude
aptitude or the advanced packaging tool provides a layer of abstraction above the dpkg system which allows for more advanced and useful functionality such as dependency and recommends resolution

21610
dpkg	apt
so by using apt you are far less likely to shoot yourself and or your system in the foot and you will almost never need to muck with dpkg

21621
ubuntu	opensuse
is there a way to disable the root account completely on opensuse so you can administer your system like the way you would do in ubuntu

21629
traceroute	packets
by the time traceroute sends out and receives packets from 192.168.235.41 your dns server has responded so traceroute can give a hostname for it

21650
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux 10.04

21666
filesystems	fat
recent versions of linux have the flush option for fat filesystems which is somewhere between sync and async it causes all delayed writes to be flushed as soon as the disk becomes inactive

21666
ubuntu	debian
the flush option is on by default in ubuntu 10.04 but not in debian wheezy

21679
vim	emacs
you might get vi as an editor or even the smaller ed but not emacs or vim

21686
stdout	stderr
this link has a good overview of the things a daemon process needs to do on startup for example closing stdin stdout and stderr detaching itself from the parent and getting a new process group and setting up signal handlers

21692
versioning	upgrade
does it mean that if i install it once we never need to re-install again because of a versioning upgrade

21702
kde	gnome
i was using kile for editing latex documents but after latest package upgrade i am running debian testing all kde applications are running reeeeaaaallllly slow - so i am looking for a temporary gnome based gtk substitute

21716
salt	md5
you take the salt from the shadow file if that wasn t obvious. for example with md5 passwords

21720
post	get
you might be able to get away with strace lxpanelctl restart also run it in gdb start gdb and type run lxpanelctl restart when you hit the bug save the ouput and post it to their bug tracker

21729
bash	zsh
i m having problems running a bash script on zsh

21729
bash	zsh
however my shell is by default on zsh so to run the above script what i do is type bin bash on my zsh prompt and then i run

21729
bash	zsh
if i am in bash why do i get an error reported by zsh

21732
bash	zsh
i m guessing that because you had bash automatically started in some circumstances but you prefer zsh you ve set up bash to automatically switch over to zsh â maybe with exec zsh in your .bashrc

21732
bash	zsh
here the difference between bash and zsh only comes into play when no file matches the supplied pattern bash silently runs the command with the unsubstituted pattern whereas zsh signals an error by default

21788
bash	zsh
is there a shortcut in bash and zsh to delete one component of a path

21789
bash	zsh
by default bash and i m guessing zsh will be in emacs-mode

21799
cifs	smb
specifically i need to determine if my cwd is in an sshfs nfs cifs smb or local block store mount

21816
bash	zsh
if you re using bash â 4 or zsh or ksh93 â o+ 1 you can make the shell do recursive globbing the wildcard matches directories at any depth

21816
fish	tcsh
1 among non-bourne shells fish and tcsh also have the feature

21860
switching	screens
the 7th is usually the one used by the login screens so you can switching back using ctrl - alt - f7 or whatever is the relevant one

21864
debian	linux
the easiest way to get it is to obtain the source packages on your linux distribution apt-get source coreutils if your distribution uses debian packaging utilities

21879
bash	zsh
if that works you can just put a bash --login in your .tcshrc and then use bash or zsh if you are feeling advantageous

21882
next	except
it works fine except for the latex-syntax for next row the double backslash

21897
hash	md5
generally md5 is supposed to always return the same hash so why does grub s version return something different each time

21898
hash	salt
that password hash is salt

21898
hash	salt
the salt is randomly generated and stored with the hash

21898
hash	salt
the field delimiter between the salt and hash is the dollar sign

21899
salt	md5
it produces strings of the form where the aaaaaaaa sequence is a random salt and bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb is the result of the mixing of the password and the salt up 1000 times in a particular way and taking a modified base64-encoding of the md5 result

21905
xmonad	xmobar
i have installed xmobar xmonad on ubuntu 11.04

21944
bash	subshell
probably the simplest way of parsing similar to dagbrown s method also pure bash but without using case and backticks subshell

21958
hash	md5
flac uses crc checksums for identifying corrupted frames when used in a streaming protocol and also has a complete md5 hash of the raw pcm audio stored in its streaminfo metadata header

21959
debian	linux
i have never had to deal much with bash setup under debian linux but this time somebody has given me a server that acts weird

21979
hash	md5
the file name is the base64 encoding of the md5 hash in binary of the url

21979
hash	md5
the name of the file is a home-grown encoding of the md5 hash and a companion file http unix.stackexchange.com um0ppbprufierf4dlfcwlhw contains the url

22007
versioning	upgrade
as gilles suggested upgrading tar is the answer but surprise surprise tar can t be upgrade in the usual way because dpkg requires versioning 1.23 or later before it ll unpack and install the latest tar deb

22026
mouse	keyboard
on occasion when i come back to the computer after a few hours the screen is in energy saving mode i touch the mouse or the keyboard and i see the screen as it was when i left it

22037
ubuntu	debian
you ll find the system default table in usr share x11 locale en_us.utf-8 compose on debian and ubuntu and in a similar location on other unices

22044
jobs	cron
in that case several cron jobs can block on line 3 and queue up

22044
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu systems does not show anything about locking

22047
jobs	cron
if you have cron jobs that do the same thing at the same time from multiple servers but you only need 1 instance to actually run the something like this might work for you

22064
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stderr to stdout for all the commands

22070
stdout	stderr
depending on the complexity of myprogram you could also try passing your make op to the myprogram wherein you read the stdout and stderr as separate stream

22070
stdout	stderr
the main advantage is being able to handle stdout and stderr independently instead of lumped together

22089
x86	64bit
you want to copy the system from one machine that is x86 only to a new one that also supports 64bit mode

22137
rss	feed
i need to watch a rss feed from our hudson ci server

22160
opensuse	linux
it s currently working on arch linux and opensuse 11.4 tumbleweed and probably all other distributions that haven t patched pm-utils too much

22176
hash	md5
for those wondering i d prefer that multiple wget s of the same file return the same md5 hash

22188
folder	directory
afaik you can just refer to any mail folder as you would a regular maildir and mutt will automatically detect if it s a file use as mbox or a directory use as a maildir

22226
dpkg	apt
you might also try using dpkg to install configure the bluez package from the apt cache

22234
post	get
however as a last resort you may have to manually edit the pre post - install remove scripts depending on where the problem is and whether you want to try to get it to install properly or just want to remove it completely

22249
ubuntu	debian
puredyne is made specifically for multimedia applications based on ubuntu and debian live that can run from a cd or dvd but it does not automatically start up jack

22250
bash	zsh
for more complex cases where you need another utility to list the files zsh or bash 4 have powerful enough patterns that you rarely need find but if you want to stay within posix shell or use fast shell like dash you will need find for anything non-trivial while read is most appropriate

22261
disk	ram
edit if the goal of your piping is to cut physical disk out of the equation for speed consider creating a ram disk to hold the intermediate file

22269
chown	chmod
it should be noted that there could be security issues with doing this but i d chown the folders back to the apache user group then use chmod o+rw on the folders to allow netbeens to read write the files

22294
folder	dir
for example if i wanted to cd to a cousin dir j2ee-apps of another domain folder from is there an easy way

22298
folder	directory
all the answers so far as well as your example in the question assume that you want to touch everything in the directory even though you said touch all folder

22298
folder	directory
if it turns out the directory contains files and folder and you only want to update the folder you can use find

22298
zsh	tcsh	fish	tcsh	fish	zsh
if there s no directory or symlink to directory it would create a file called in shells other than csh tcsh zsh fish or the thompson shell which would report an error instead

22306
jobs	cron
define cron jobs that will automate the execution of such commands at regular intervals

22336
ubuntu	debian
for debian and ubuntu there is the populartiiy contest package and result pages popcon

22336
centos	linux
and what about derivatives like rhel centos scientific linux etc

22344
filesystems	ntfs
to confirm run which should report an ntfs filesystems

22351
openbsd	linux
i am migrating from linux to openbsd and one of the things i miss from my old os is how even the consoles looked nice so nice you could actually watch movies in there under framebuffer using a simple command on the bootloader

22373
ubuntu	linux
when connected to the computer running ubuntu 11.04 2.6.38-11-generic #50-ubuntu smp mon sep 12 21 17 25 utc 2011 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux the following appears in the logs

22377
filesystems	ntfs
since you used ntfs not a good fs for large drives in my opinion but then - there is no good alternative to work with windows either the filesystems might need to undergo a consistency check

22385
udp	tcp
i know that nfs uses both tcp and udp to connect to the client along with a bunch of daemons that use random port numbers

22389
gentoo	linux
the ports system is beyond compare imnsho and has been a model for imitation by several linux distros gentoo comes immediately to mind

22389
freebsd	linux
also because freebsd isn t as prevalent on the desktop as linux pc-bsd is a fabulous my inner geek has to use it as my desktop os

22389
freebsd	linux
so far there isn t anything on windows that linux can t do and anything on linux that freebsd can t do

22397
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu doesn t care about software freedom to the somewhat extreme level debian does which is one factor behind why many consider it easier to use

22400
ubuntu	debian
one is running debian squeeze the other ubuntu 11.04 natty narwhal

22404
unix	bsd
here s something i wrote about bsd unix variants in answer to a similar question on serverfault

22404
unix	bsd
if you re a pure open-source shop and not dependent on any commercial software like oracle then a bsd unix system will give you a very stable well understood and controlled software platform more so than linux

22404
unix	bsd
if you want a traditional unix desktop then a bsd unix will give you this as well as any linux distro

22404
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux was based on a derivative of the bsd ports packaging system

22436
rpm	yum
i can see the version info for my customized package by doing rpm -qi or yum info

22439
packets	pcap
what i want to do is that first i let tshark to read from that pcap file and then use the time range to filter out all the network flows that are in that time range and then use the ip addr to filter out all the network flows from that ip addr on that already-filter-out-by-time flows and then use the tcp port number and the number of packets sent received by the ip addr to finally locate the flow i want

22469
folder	directory
i have several directory in my home folder that i would like to make available as a directory on my webserver

22475
ubuntu	linux
update the information below will be from arch linux since i no longer have ubuntu

22513
sudo	passwd
if you ask the shell to background sudo with the operator then sudo will block and wait there in the background indefinitely if it must prompt you for your passwd

22513
sudo	passwd
if it does not prompt you for your passwd then the program you specify is run and sudo is no longer running

22513
sudo	passwd
because of the potential to block the -b switch to sudo is the preferred method so it can prompt you for your passwd if needed and then it will fork into the background to run the requested program

22516
rpm	yum
instead of rolling back yum i would upgrade python manually using rpm -uvh

22522
mouse	keyboard
if the mouse is working but not the keyboard it means that x is not completely hosed

22537
put	get
it doesn t mount when i put the disk in and i get errors on startup complaining about mountall event failed

22584
kde	gnome
where the settings are stored applied depends on your environment plain x gnome kde cde etc.

22590
vim	emacs	vim	jedit	emacs	jedit
jedit supports block editing but emacs and vim seem to have some serious usability issues on the same subject

22593
kde	gnome
but maybe a nice suggestion for the kde and gnome people

22597
vim	emacs
i ll put my 0.02 worth in as i spent quite a few years using emacs and xemacs and then moved over to vim

22597
vim	emacs
disclamer - i went from using emacs to vim about 10 years ago and i habitually use vim on windows and unix linux based systems

22597
perl	tcl
the scripting facility in vim isn t as sophisticated as elisp but you can build it with support for python tcl perl and maybe some other systems

22597
vim	emacs
vim has a smaller footprint than emacs but this is not much of a big deal these days

22597
vim	emacs
emacs has quite good on-line documentation but i don t think it s as comprehensive as vim s

22598
pull	push
a modern sas raid controller can pull or push 1gb sec or more of data off a disk array particularly if formatted with a large say 256kb stripe size

22599
kermit	zmodem
many terminal emulators also support file transfer protocols such as kermit or zmodem

22617
vim	emacs
i can answer for vim but not emacs

22628
stdout	stderr
the process that is run from a terminal has its stdin stdout and stderr bound to the terminal and you cannot do anything about it without re-gaining control over that terminal.

22646
bash	zsh
this is a ksh93 construct also found in bash and zsh known as process substitution that takes the output of command and provides it in a file whose name refers to the other end of the pipe command is writing to

22649
min	max
it tells you how to set the min and max allowed cpu frequency

22649
daemons	systemd
just change to that and you need no additional systemd daemons running

22657
rsa	dsa
or if you re careful and you know whether your putty-style key is rsa or dsa you can manually convert one into the other by removing the line breaks in the key material and adding the ssh-dss or ssh-rsa tag

22673
post	get
the examples in the man page should get you going if you can t figure out what you need from the examples ask here and post the output of ls -lde users mego

22707
stdout	stderr
the latest version supports writing pidfiles using files for stdin stdout and stderr and running in the foreground

22718
portrait	landscape
portrait landscape view

22724
udp	tcp
i forced linux to mount it using udp instead of tcp and now everything seems to work fine

22729
bash	zsh
if i wanted to use zsh for instance rather than bash where would i make this change for the current user

22736
bash	zsh
this will replace the bash shell with a login zsh at login

22757
ubuntu	openbsd
i m looking for something that works in ubuntu fedora or openbsd

22775
folder	directory
this command will show you the disk usage of every file and folder in the current directory and the output will continuously be refreshed

22785
chown	sudo
so maybe a sudo chown .

22786
centos	linux
the python m2crypto library requires a slightly different installation command if the linux distribution is fedora-core based fedora rhel centos scientific linux

22803
folder	directory
only count files if the folder are leaves in the directory tree they don t have any subfolders

22809
bash	zsh
usr bin zsh or usr bin bash

22810
vmware	virtualbox
vmware tools virtualbox guest additions

22820
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
basically i need an apt aptitude equivalent of dpkg --force-confnew

22820
sudo	passwd
also i am passing the sudo passwd in a pipe to execute the command

22823
debian	linux
my operating system is debian 6 linux kernel - 3.0.0-1-amd64

22851
filesystems	btrfs
i was going to blame the btrfs filesystems driver and the underlaying md array because md1_raid1 and btrfs-transacti consumed a lot of resources

22861
folder	directory
one thing we thought of was creating somehow a networked alias folder which can sit as the local directory in coda and the public_html folder on apache on the web server

22867
bash	subshell
in bash you can export function definitions to subshell with

22876
sudo	passwd
sudo will not ask for a passwd if you negate the authenticate option for the user or add the nopasswd tag in the specific entry

22878
disk	ram
like others above have mentioned something like tmpfs or even a ram disk might be more desirable for non-root use

22886
debian	linux
i am interested to find out more about my current linux debian box

22891
folder	directory
usually i put the directory in my home folder and access them from the command line

22900
gitolite	gitosis
gitosis and gitolite both use a config file

22905
centos	linux
i never saw this in centos fedora in my 1 years linux driving experience

22910
freebsd	linux
is there any equivalent to freebsd s portupgrade -r in arch linux

22948
for-loop	arrays
also i have searched for-loop control and arrays in the zsh documentation but had little success

22979
bash	zsh
there is no output for zsh although zsh being somewhat bash compatible - i understand that

22999
unix	solaris
each unix variant has its own way but most use the same executable format elf and have similar dynamic linkers derived from solaris

23004
pppoe	dhcp
this is my setup i have a wireless router 192.168.2.1 which connects to the internet through a pppoe connection and acts as a gateway and dhcp server for the local network

23009
put	get
i put grows in quotes because the file is pre-allocated as a sparse file but as the blocks get written they fill in phantom blocks with actual data.

23044
unix	bsd
the difference between bsd and linux distributions dated back to the early days of unix

23044
ubuntu	linux
compared to linux distributions like ubuntu who never test a danged thing before releases this is a huge key to peace of mind for many sysadmins and server ops

23047
bash	zsh
ksh doesn t have the sophisticated interactive feature you may be used to if you ve used bash or zsh before

23047
bash	zsh
if you want a comfortable environment install zsh or at least bash on the solaris machine

23047
bash	zsh
if bash or zsh is already installed by the system administrator use chsh to switch to it

23054
versioning	upgrade
if you install the stable versioning of debian you can stay virtually forever with gnome 2.3 you are in no way forced to switch to a new debian versioning and no upgrade to gnome 3 will be done in a normal dist-upgrade

23056
ubuntu	debian
on a debian based distribution ubuntu i do not reproduce your problem

23067
switching	screens	mouse	keyboard
you don t need to install a window manager or desktop environment these provide services like automatic window placement ways to switching between multiple workspaces keyboard and mouse commands to manipulate windows ways to launch applications all kinds of widgets and applets little items that are more or less permanently displayed somewhere on the screens â while you can run a gui without a window manager it ll be near-unusable

23069
mouse	keyboard
you will need an x-server on your end to do provide the display keyboard and mouse

23078
disk	ram
however we need to be able to free up the ram by writing it to disk and then restart the process disk - ram or in other words hibernate a single process

23089
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	freebsd	linux
i need to install ricoh r5u87x webcam loader on freebsd because it solve not suspending in unix linux boxes on my vaio laptop as i try it in ubuntu but the loader is simply for linux i think

23093
ubuntu	linux
i am interested in a generic solution but in case it depends on the distribution i am interested in solutions for ubuntu 11.10 and for red hat enterprise linux server i have administrator priviledges in the former but not in the latter

23094
solaris	netbsd	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
on linux not busybox solaris netbsd openbsd

23099
bash	zsh
for example all of ash bash pdksh ksh93 and zsh exit without displaying foo on the following examples

23099
bash	subshell
note that as a further complication bash turns off set -e in subshell unless it s in posix mode set -o posix or have posixly_correct in the environment when bash starts

23102
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
i have used fedora ubuntu centos all of them and they are open source linux free to all users and free to do almost anything

23102
ubuntu	centos
is it legal to tell someone you can use fedora ubuntu centos if you want to make your own os simply build on it and copy it

23104
mouse	keyboard
the resolutions and screens were still messed up however i had mouse and keyboard support and could use my browser

23107
put	get
in general what you can do is create your own distribution and try to get paid for the work you did to put it together etc

23108
ubuntu	debian
some distributions put up their manual pages online this can be useful to check portability for example debian suse ubuntu â the links should be on the distribution s tag wiki on unix stack exchange if a distribution has man pages online and the link isn t in the wiki please add it

23109
affinity	processors
the affinity of a process is the set of processors on which it can run

23133
versioning	upgrade
i have a package in debian that has been manually patched not ideal i know that i must hold at its current versioning so upgrade don t overwrite the patched changes i will manually inspect and apply security updates

23173
bash	zsh
ok...i find this situation only happened in the zsh but in bash it works well..

23173
bash	zsh
so if anyone can tell me how can this work well in zsh i will appreciate or i can only do this in bash

23195
ubuntu	debian
may i also use some debian repository for my ubuntu

23207
client-side	server-side
obviously i can look at etc exports on the nfs server-side to see if no_root_squash is enabled but is there a way i can check this from the nfs client-side without actually mounting the share

23211
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	unix	sunos	sunos	irix	sunos	bsd	irix	linux	solaris	irix	solaris	bsd	solaris	sunos
i ve been working in unix since about 1987 bsd sunos solaris irix unicos linux in several places around the country usa and have almost always heard the - character called a dash

23216
udp	tcp
the at t solaris transport level interface tli way of doing tcp ip networking has special files like dev tcp or dev udp

23225
mouse	keyboard
xmacrorec can be used to record mouse and keyboard events on any x11 display

23225
mouse	keyboard
xmacroplay can be used to playback recorded events or send any other mouse keyboard events you choose

23229
bash	zsh
ksh bash and zsh have an alternate form of for which mimics the for loops of languages like pascal or c to enumerate integers

23242
ubuntu	debian
in the specific case of debian and ubuntu ubuntu is a derivative of debian and retains a lot of the package structure so repositories intended for one usually work well on the other

23248
vim	emacs	vim	jedit	emacs	jedit
emacs vim jedit etc

23254
folder	directory
for instance unix stores file metadata in data files called directory or folder in this new age of computing -

23289
bash	zsh
this is for bash zsh may be a bit different

23339
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am running linux mint 11 on my notebook which is basically a variation of ubuntu

23348
kde	gnome
if num-lock is on in the bios - why is it turned off during linux boot and or kde gnome whatever startup

23349
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu and

23360
vim	emacs
every time i try to launch vim or emacs or even top i think it s actually any command that uses ncurses in a unix terminal on a cluster computer over ssh i get a a continuous stream of name collision between x x x errors like this

23360
vim	emacs
and in fact when i am inside a gnu screen session vim and emacs work fine except some strange key mappings for instance arrow keys don t work

23378
filesystems	xfs
even on unix linux systems there is a dedicated filesystems check program for every filesystems implementation ext xfs jfs etc.

23445
kde	gnome
unices have no need to keep up since gnome kde etc

23470
ubuntu	debian
i would like to be able to test the installation of packages on a bare debian or ubuntu system

23471
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
aptitude lets you pick and choose what to install and then commits it by running dpkg and or apt with the right settings

23492
solaris	aix
when going from an aix or hp ux or solaris ... to any linux things differ even more

23492
solaris	aix
aix hp ux and solaris are the big vendors left os x if you count desktop systems in

23496
unix	bsd
bsd unix is derived from unix but has had all the original at t code removed and substituted with non-encumbered replacements

23496
unix	bsd
linux is unix-like and most software written for unix-like platforms will port between linux bsd and other unix platforms relatively easily

23496
unix	bsd
the development model is much more decentralised than bsd or sysv derived unix so it evolves more rapidly at the expense of stability

23522
kde	gnome
it also depends on wether you use kde or gnome

23525
restrict	shared
it was then i noticed that the wireless configuration page didn t ask me about the wireless security type i was running wpa2-psk - the only options were none open system open or shared key restrict so it seemed that i wasn t authenticating to my wifi ap

23529
uptime	reboot
it s my main workstation and it has 2 months of uptime i don t like reboot so i d rather not have to do it moreover it would just show that the machine ain t stable enough

23536
rpm	yum
yum is an alternative to rpm and it is used by some redhat-based versions

23543
sudo	passwd
when i use the sudo command it asks me for a passwd

23543
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
to the etc sudoers file it stops asking for the passwd and i can execute the sudo command

23544
bash	zsh
in zsh you could use its conditional construct in ps1 bash has no equivalent

23547
debian	linux
should i followed building debian packages s building a xenomai patched linux kernel package

23552
versioning	upgrade
binary distributions therefore often upgrade their own versioning to go on to new versioning of various core packages in other cases you need big updates

23565
kde	gnome
i m mostly interested in kde and gnome as well as dwm xmonad awesome - solutions for other desktop environments are welcome i would love to support as much as i can in order to provide as universal solution as possible

23565
mouse	keyboard
on the other hand workrave tracks keyboard and mouse activity but is unaware of desktop- task i work on. i d like to do something that merges those information in order to achieve more precise picture maybe incorporating association rule learning or other data mining technique of activities i have in order to achieve more precise information related with my habits in order with ant- rsi fight

23567
unix	bsd
i would like to be able to use the bsd unix utilities column join and paste in my cygwin installation

23596
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
distros will be apache but again like most distributions archlinux also supplies lighttpd and nginx so it depends on which one you picked

23596
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
this will likely be in so etc apache or etc nginx or etc lighttpd depending on 1

23596
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
homework for this step lighttpd docs nginx docs apache docs depending on which software you installed

23599
ubuntu	debian
debian derivatives including ubuntu

23607
ubuntu	linux
using a linux e.x. fedora or ubuntu for os

23681
opensuse	live-cd
now on the same machine i sometimes need to boot opensuse currently 11.2 through a liveusb live-cd

23681
ubuntu	opensuse
so basically when i mount my ubuntu drives which are owned by 1000 1000 under the live opensuse whose default user is 999 100 i fail to access them as usual

23681
opensuse	linux
so i thought i should try to change the default uid gud for linux users on the opensuse machine so i tried this

23681
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
and just having the uid changed makes me access the ubuntu drives fine - however now i cannot access the opensuse stuff previously owned by linux users

23688
ubuntu	linux
i was switching to linux in the optimal time around ubuntu 9.04 9.10

23688
ubuntu	linux
i am a programmer so i don t want to be a linux guru that s why ubuntu was perfect for me - until unity gnome3

23688
ubuntu	linux
so the question is which linux distribution is like ubuntu 9.04 9.10 which i can just install set up compiz-fusion shortcuts select panel s position add applets and it just works

23689
ubuntu	mint
since ubuntu 11.04 i have found myself and a lot of my friends getting more satisfaction from mint

23689
ubuntu	mint
basically mint is a modded version of ubuntu with mint 11 being based on ubuntu 11.04 so compatibility is an obvious bless

23689
xfce	kubuntu	xfce	kde	kde	kubuntu
you can try kde with kubuntu openbox with crunchbang xfce with mint and what-not

23738
mouse	keyboard
if on the other hand you are wanting to use the same mouse and keyboard to control a second computer with its own monitor then synergy should do exactly what you want and it works in windows linux and mac

23748
debian	mint	debian	linux
i ve installed linux mint debian edition lmde which the users could figure out after a bit of messing around and a little help from me

23748
ubuntu	mint
also i had used ubuntu before and mint seemed like ubuntu+

23748
installation	upgrade
as a side note the installation wasn t very smooth and the printer hp laserjet 1020 took a bit of work to setup but once it was done and the os upgrade it works very well

23754
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is for me the most user-friendly linux distribution the ui is almost the same as windows on the contrary of ubuntu s unity

23755
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
imho and personally i prefer kde for non-techies i d favour a gnome 3 based desktop although an icewm xfce will fit better into the available memory

23759
sudo	passwd
i was able to create a new group test but the system only allowed me to add my user to that group and not the other users in the system like the ones that appear in etc passwd i was running the add users group gui with sudo privileges

23779
switching	screens
as long as you don t switching to a terminal type that your keyboard and screens aren t compatible with you ll be fine

23789
bash	zsh
here s a bash zsh snippet to query whether color 42 is supported redirect to from the terminal if necessary

23791
bash	zsh
bash has some completion for svn zsh s is significantly better

23792
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is a standard suggestion for beginners in linux

23793
sudo	passwd
however since using sudo can have major consequences sudo requires some extra authentication you need to type your passwd again sometimes

23793
sudo	passwd
for example an application cannot silently call sudo it would need to ask you for your passwd and an unexpected passwd prompt would alert you that something bad is taking place

23793
sudo	passwd
in practice asking for a passwd each and every time you run sudo would be annoying

23796
udp	tcp
in fact ksh and bash provide such an interface for tcp and udp clients

23803
gentoo	ubuntu
so far my experiences with ubuntu arch and gentoo on this laptop have been phenomenal

23804
vim	textmate
it help me made the transition from textmate to vim

23812
vmware	virtualbox
vdi will have received the most attention in virtualbox vmdk in vmware etc

23829
unix	bsd
linux did not have a robust networking stack until the mid-1990s and bsd unix was mired in ip litigation issues then as well

23829
cifs	nis
in operation nfs nis is much simpler to implement and maintain than ad cifs

23839
xfce	kde
from my experience of looking at new untaught users their main problems are with understanding and having a grasp on what is what on the now common windows kde xfce icewm-like desktop -- they get confused by the elements of the de and afraid

23839
titlebar	window
minor the titlebar is not grasped as the control for the window not part of the application but a standard application-external control

23840
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
on a linux box i would further check the file etc issue to see its release info or for debian ubuntu etc lsb-release

23848

the first redirect makes stderr point to the stream that stdout points to at that time which is your tty essentially

stdout	stderr
it doesn t make stderr an alias of stdout

i realize that set -o posix will disable non-posix usage but that won t tell me things i want to know such as zsh indexing shell arrays starting at 1 and bash from 0 and ash not supporting arrays at all

i can switching between any or at least most of these by using the nvidia control panel and if i was using the open source drivers through the kde x screens configuration option screens and something similar for gnome

if you want something for which just about everything that is or was ever open-source is available from repositories then a debian based distro either debian or ubuntu may be a win

i have read that if folder has only x set permission to execute it actually means that you are permitted to search this directory

24279

the who manpage on my debian linux system shows there s an --ips option to display ips instead of hostnames

24285

i ve recently switched back from xfce 4 to gnome 3

freebsd â 4.3 has realpath it s also present on some linux systems and it s in busybox

bash	zsh
in bash or ksh or zsh you don t need to use set -e to execute a trap after each command that returns a nonzero status you can put a trap on err instead

queue	fifo	cat	tee
use the mkfifo command to create a fifo queue pipe the output to it use tee instead of a redirect if you want output on both and just cat it out on the other terminal

24370
octal	decimal
should this number which is a byte been printed in decimal finding which signal interrupted a process would require a little bit of calculation while in octal they can be read as they are

24370
octal	decimal
moreover the exit status might also be a bit mask and in such case octal at least when you are used to it which was more common a couple of decades ago than these days is easier to convert mentally into bits than decimal or even hexadecimal just like for example chmod still accept an octal number to represent file permissions 0750 111 101 000 rwx r-x ---

24371
ubuntu	debian
i understand that for debian and ubuntu systems rather than using chkconfig i need to use update-rc.d

24375

you should take into account that debian and ubuntu only use runlevels 0 1 2 6 and the default graphical multiuser runlevel is 2

it seems that there is possibility to specify this in zsh but i have not found a way to do this in bash readline

i need to install c c++ compiler and i heard that the best thing to do is to install gcc g++ for that purpose i think i don t have it on my machine

24432
g++	gcc
so my question is - how can i install build-essentials on my debian 6 squeeze or any work-around to install gcc g++

24432
post	get
if i write sudo apt-get install gcc i will get to the beginning of my post and ending with libc6 is already the newest version

you can get extremely fancy with your bash prompts i used to do colors and everything before i switched to zsh

24476
freebsd	centos
i am trying to install centos 5.7 and freebsd 8.2 on kvm with serial console access

24476
freebsd	centos
centos fails to provide a serial console because its bootloader loads an image which serial console cannot display and freebsd fails for some other reason

24478
bash	zsh
on the assumption that you are using bash ksh zsh or another similar shell you can background the process then run disown

24479
bash	zsh
if you use bash or zsh use the built-in disown before logging off

24486
ubuntu	debian
i use debian rather than ubuntu but while the exact package names vary the packaging software doesn t so this should work

24540
ubuntu	debian
you may get a better feel for what applications you have installed by listing the packages you have dpkg -l under debian ubuntu and derivatives

24540
redhat	fedora
rpm -ql under redhat fedora suse and derivaties

24542
xlib	xcb
great performance is due to the fact that awesome is built on top of xcb library instead of the old xlib

24579
kde	gnome
i m switching from gnome desktop to kde checking things out and it bother me that emacs look soo diferent from the rest of the desktop

24589
ubuntu	debian
there is a ufs-utils package for debian ubuntu but i could not figure out how to use it

24589
ubuntu	linux
so there any way to get read write permissions work for ufs on ubuntu linux

24591
kde	gnome
but does this also affect the default printer for gnome kde applications

24597
stdout	stderr
the output is on stderr and pipes are for stdout

24601
sudo	passwd
when do su and sudo use different passwd

24609
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i believe debian and ubuntu leave out write support for ufs when they compile their kernel because the write support in the linux ufs driver is not considered fully reliable

24622

sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if it has to go in the admin user s crontab and you have to run it with sudo for it to run properly then you one solution might be to modify your sudoers file to allow the admin user to run the python script without a passwd

24659
ubuntu	mint
i have a mint 10 based on ubuntu maverick meerkat 10.10 installed on a hp nc6120 notebook

24664

you need to have the execute bit set on a directory to allow the affected user to enter it and access files and directory inside and you ve removed it your command removes the execute bit from both the files and the folder

24680
udp	tcp
the problem is that my university campus doesn t allow connections to go outside when the port is different than tcp port 22 80 443 or udp port 123

24680

on my debian server i would like to listen to all my udp and tcp ports so i can clearly figure out which tcp and udp ports my university let through their firewall

i am trying to install voyage linux 0.8.0 a distribution based off debian on a soekris net4801

24757
bash	zsh
as an exception if there is no matching file name at all the wildcard pattern is left unchanged in bash unless you set shopt -s nullglob in which case the pattern expands to an empty list and zsh signals an error unless you set setopt nullglob or setopt no_no_match which causes the pattern to be left unchanged

24764
ubuntu	debian
debian and derived distributions including ubuntu ship a perl script whose syntax would be

24764
zsh	tcsh
if you want to recurse in subdirectories assuming that by csh you mean tcsh but really think of entering the mid-1990s and switching to zsh

24770
bash	zsh
or if you have ksh93 or zsh not bash you can use your shell s built-in arithmetic which supports floating point numbers

ubuntu	freebsd
how can i write stuff into usb drive on freebsd such that the stuff is accessible in windows yes my wife still uses that and ubuntu

daniel roseman got it right i think all major distributions have python installed by default as its used for many if not most applications for the gnome kde desktop enviroments at least

24805
mp3	flac
how to use mp3fs to mass encode flac to mp3

24805
mp3	flac
instead of using a program to convert flac files to mp3 you can use mp3fs to present them as virtual mp3 s and a program that can queue copy jobs

24805
mp3	flac
create a pair of flac and mp3 directories for each mp3fs you want to run

24805
mp3	flac	move	drag
to use the other core move flac files to flac_2 and drag the mp3 s from mp3_2 to the second ultracopier window

24808
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
redhat enterprise linux and its close relatives fedora centos scientific linux oracle linux ... will always have python installed since the installer and many core tools are written in python

openssl	libcrypto
where the libcrypto and libssl libraries are openssl 1.0.0-fips libs

so if you want to install grub2 using one of the distros package manager maybe you should read gentoo and debian documentation and see if they support manual config

you can set the name of network interfaces either through udev on any modern linux system or through etc network interfaces on debian ubuntu and other distributions using ifupdown

if you re looking for a graphical x11 option you could use conky torsmo older than conky or gkrellm

she uses gnome and wanted kde because apparently you can take advantage of some additional features in kdenlive when you are running it from kde

in this case installing kde rendered the gnome desktop non-functional though not gnome itself as in this question debian gnome 2.30 desktop does not respond anymore

i m running fedora f16 with xfce rather than gnome 3 and ever since i installed it i ve been getting errors like this one whenever i run gui software from the terminal

25666
kde	gnome
it might be easier to create a user change permissions on the rest of the drive to lock him out except necessary programs and libraries give him an autologin gnome kde session set the novtswitch option in xorg.conf and change his login script to launch the browser whatever

25667
xfce	gnome
as for the file-roller errors what version of gnome libraries are being used by xfce

25674
openbsd	freebsd
well it s in the gnu freebsd openbsd and general bsd ls implementations so i d say it s pretty likely to be anywhere

25715
mp3	wav
i recently installed lame encoder on my server to convert wav to mp3 and that worked with . configure

25726

the -r option is present on linux freebsd macâ osâ x and cygwin among others

25737
put	get
let s put a quote to our variable and see what we get

25745
ubuntu	debian
on some systems etc resolv.conf is managed by the resolvconf system this is true on my ubuntu system not sure about debian in general or crunchbang in particular - if etc resolv.conf is a symlink to etc resolvconf run resolv.conf then you should probably be editing etc network interfaces which should contain a stanza like this

25752
mouse	keyboard
i wrote this back in the 90s and all it does is eat the x server s keyboard and mouse events until you type the password

25753
sysv	systemd
fedora15 has got systemd as a drop-in replacement for sysv boot style init scripts

25759

the original machine runs gentoo this machine runs ubuntu 11.10

25761
filesystems	btrfs
linux has the filesystems btrfs it s a new still unstable filesystems inspired by zfs from solaris

25765
bash	zsh
i normally use zsh and sometimes bash

25765
bash	zsh
is there any way to either enable this or a similar behaviour using keyboard only while remaining with vi-like keybindings in a zsh or bash shell prompt

25778
xfce	gnome
xfce looks better and is less spartan than lxde i ve kept the beloved ubuntu xfce s panel is great compiz-fusion works drag-and-drop is no problem between thunar xfce s file manager and nautilus gnome s one and the desktop

25779
sudo	passwd
i got sudo rights on that server from the admin but i can t exercise them since i forgot my actual unix passwd or i was never told it

25797
innodb	myisam
in the future don t do that as unclean database server shutdown will corrupt myisam tables pretty badly and if you re lucky on innodb just cause a major rollback that wipes all unssuccessful transactions

25810
debian	linux
i have an hp thin client model t5325 which runs debian linux kernel 2.6.22.18-1-armel

25810
debian	linux
are there other way we can attempt to bind the driver or have these keyboards work properly with debian linux

25817
ethernet	wireless
i have a wireless router that also comes with ethernet ports so i could either connect to my lan via wifi or ethernet

25824
bash	tcsh
i was launching shell scripts and shell commands but outside the context of bash sh tcsh etc

25827
bash	zsh
if there aren t too many files and you re running ksh93 or bash â 4 or zsh then use the wildcard to recurse into subdirectories

25839
bash	zsh
zsh doesn t support anything but internal registers and bash doesn t support register at all as far as i know

25852
vxworks	rtos	vxworks	qnx	vxworks	lynxos	lynxos	qnx	rtos	qnx
in rtos segment there are quiet a few choices ranging for experimental to enterprise like rtlinux lynxos qnx vxworks etc.

25862
pop-up	dialog
i can add them using custom shortcuts but i don t know the command line to pop-up the run application dialog

25873
chgrp	chmod
chgrp install chmod g+w o+t

25888
switching	screens
what s more curious is that if use the history to access the long command but i don t execute it yet then use any c-a screens command like switching to another window and then back or if i click out of my current terminal window and back into it the history command is now displayed properly again

25898
g++	gcc
in case it makes a difference i am using gnu make 3.81 and g++ gcc 3.4.5 mingw-vista special r3 in an msys console running gnu bash version 2.04.0 1 -release i686-pc-msys on windows xp

25904
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that when i try to play flash games in firefox or google-chrome they flicker sporadically and flash videos play like a slide-show

25924
kde	gnome
run switchdesk to shift to kde from gnome in all your x-related files

25967
ubuntu	linux
note i have an ubuntu linux system a mac osx lion system and access to windows although i would prefer to avoid windows

ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
i need to run approx a package proxy for debian ubuntu packages on an opensuse box

25981
daemons	systemd
xinetd is a daemons that manages internet services for unix-like systemd

25991

i want to parallelize a for-loop where the number of iterations in loops can be very large such as 10 6

26005
kde	gnome
i m using opensuse and kde desktop with gnome application support

26006
sudo	passwd
the way i understand it there is also a root user which you can access via something like sudo su - root and entering the passwd of the ubuntu or the user you created which is part of the administrators group

26011
rpm	yum
i have yum and rpm and i really only know how to install packages using these commands

26011
rpm	yum
or does yum rpm have a dir they always use automagically

26013
rpm	yum
here you can download the figlet packge and install it with rpm -u or rpm -ivh package.rpm or do yum localinstall --nogpgcheck packgename

26016
ubuntu	linux
despite using ubuntu and kubuntu on other machines i still see myself as a beginner on gnu linux

26018
udp	tcp
teamviewer however does work and i thought perhaps the ssh port 22 was blocked so tried accepting ssh connections via ports 80 http 443 https and 5938 tcp udp

26044
bluetooth	usb
i guess it s related to the issue with the usb bluetooth dongle where the driver and firmware is loaded dynamically as a kernel module in later boot phase hal udev

26044
bluetooth	usb
just check the instructions for your distribution about obtaining and recompiling the kernel then check what module your usb bluetooth keyboard uses and select it in the kernel configurator

26046
freebsd	linux
so should i use freebsd or damn small linux as the distro for this project

26046
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	freebsd	linux
i am actually leaning towards freebsd since all my prior experience has been with linux ubuntu and fedora mainly and this would be an opportunity to explore freebsd

26050
freebsd	linux
on the other hand if the goal is not so unusual normal desktop terminal without changes in firewall kernel and without weird hardware that require additional drivers kernel modules there is no difference what you choose - you work with applications not with os and on freebsd and linux most of application are the same

26057
daemons	systemd
3 finger daemons an early rudimentary identification server that allowed you to query it to find out about people on the systemd giving the universal american symbol of defiance as its usefulness degraded over time and people started abusing it

26057
daemons	systemd
finger daemons also demonstrates that computers operate on a digital binary systemd

26059
bash	zsh
in bash ksh and zsh export is special syntax and both and do the right thing even

26064
bash	subshell
parentheses denote a subshell in bash

26068
minix	linux
for a history of the strained relations between linux s creator and minix s creator read about the tanenbaumâ torvalds debate

26068
daemons	systemd
the snmp daemons a systemd diagnosis tool many devices and daemons report their status and can sometimes be configured through snmp

26118
udp	tcp
i ve opened the standard ntfs samba ports like 135 139 and 445 some of them need udp and the others tcp details available on various sites

26139
chmod	sudoers
when you write chmod 0440 etc sudoers tempfl.log it changes the permissions of etc sudoers and tempfl.log to both be 0440 which is wrong

26139
chmod	sudoers
when you write chmod 0644 etc sudoers tempfl.log it changes the permissions of etc sudoers and tempfl.log to both be 0644 which is wrong

26143
jobs	cron
it s possible that one day someone will decide that cron should run jobs in parallel to take advantage of these 32-core cpus that have 31 cores running idle

26145
chown	sudo
after that one-time operation sudo chown â or sudo -u webmaster setfacl â you won t need elevated privileges for day-to-day operations

26171
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
my version is 11.10 and i m not using gnome nor kde nor xfce nor lxde only xmonad

26174
sudo	passwd
both sudo and rbac succeed in giving the non-root users some privileges that can be done with out giving the root passwd itself

26196
solaris	bsd
i don t have access to solaris or bsd machines at the moment

26214
bash	zsh
you can do that with a bash zsh one-liner

26230
centos	linux
notice in the output in the command below the skype rpm does does not list gpg anywhere whereas the signed at rpm from centos does and the signed aspell from scientific linux does

26237
chown	chmod
i tried to use chmod and chown

26249
switching	screens
for what i know screens do not create tabs but you have to switching between screens with the command you indicated or as i prefer ctrl - a 1 ctrl - a 2 etc

26256
switching	screens
in screens you switching only the content of a window with the mentioned a-kombinations

26278
installation	upgrade
this method is not very nice as it requires changes to the main installation every time you upgrade the kernel but it works

26279
cpu	affinity
afaik you can only set cpu affinity for user-space processes

26326
bash	tcsh
another strange thing is that when i do exec bash --norc and then source .bashrc everything is fine -- i get the path from tcsh and some additions from my .bashrc

26329
traceroute	packets
by default tcptraceroute runs traceroute using tcp-syn packets for port 80

26330
opensuse	linux
join.me only works on pc and mac and i m running opensuse 12.1 my boss is fine with me using linux as long as it doesn t hinder my work which it hasn t until now as webex ran fine

26358
ubuntu	linux
similarly i am planning to have an install readme file to put all the common package names that i usually install after installing a new version of linux ubuntu

26364
ubuntu	linux
the distribution is an ubuntu server running the 2.6.35-30 linux kernel

26380
jobs	cron
that may lead to contagion from one nfs server failing to the other failing from essential processes going into disk sleep or running out of resources from cron jobs spawning and not finishing etc.

26387
daemons	systemd
systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities uses socket and d-bus activation for starting services offers on-demand starting of daemons keeps track of processes using linux cgroups supports snapshotting and restoring of the systemd state maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic

26394
daemons	systemd	kde	gnome
i m looking for a calendaring application that runs as a daemons engages with the systemd eg starting applications or interacting with the desktop environment kde gnome e17 lxde etc

26408
sudo	passwd
once upon a time the sudo command didn t exist so the root account had to be configured with a passwd

26415
versioning	upgrade
don t forget to update symlink when you upgrade netbeans versioning

26417
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
when you use vi instead of visudo to edit etc sudoers on a remote system and mess up the syntax you can no longer sudo or use su as there s no root passwd set

26424
installation	upgrade
in case you can t recover backup any system files that you have changed to your like and install the fedora box again with the upgrade option at the installation stage that would install only the removed files that associate with your base system

26444
ubuntu	linux
popular linux distributions such as knoppix and ubuntu offer an option when the cd starts to run memtest immediately instead of booting linux

26457
udp	tcp
second when i port scan with nmap the udp scan takes much longer then the tcp scan

26478
debian	linux
there is package fdupes in linux for example it is present in debian repository

26479
hash	md5
both solutions use md5 hash

26513
daemons	launchd
is there some daemons that can monitor my key presses and launchd some program afterwards so that i won t have to configure anything else after moving to another desktop environment

26524
ubuntu	debian	rhel	slackware
you can install it on debian lenny debian squeeze ubuntu karmic to oneiric rhel 5-6 fedora 15 and slackware 12.2-13.1

26542
versioning	upgrade
the current versioning in ubuntus package list is 3.4.5deb1 but i want to upgrade to 3.4.8

26544
dpkg	apt
for some reason dpkg didn t install dependencies which made apt panic

26551
bash	zsh
in bash or zsh you can call disown 1 to tell the shell to forget about the job

26557
bash	zsh
if you want to execute zsh instead of bash just replace usr local bin bash by the path to the zsh executable

26562
kde	gnome
in addition to the good answers above if you happen to be using a gui based on kde or gnome then autokey can be amazingly helpful

26567
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
as it does in windows mac gnome kde xfce ...

26586
google-chrome	firefox
i often attach files when on the web using google-chrome firefox or when using email thunderbird

26593
vlan	wlan
on my openwrt system the wlan interface is identified by using a different vlan for it

26597
bash	zsh
if your shell is bash ksh93 or zsh you can use shell escaping to put a literal tab in the sed command

26604
bash	subshell
bash features used ansi c string and process substitution to avoid the while loop in a subshell problem

26604
stdout	stderr
file descriptors number 0 1 and 2 are already used for stdin stdout and stderr respectively

26605
bash	zsh
in bash ksh zsh you can write read -u 3 instead of

26620
daemons	systemd
if you want to have it behave properly like a real daemons you should place it using the init systemd - etc init.d and make appropriate runlevel links in the appropriate etc rc.x folders

26628
post	get
as an example have a look at this post on the symantec forums - the op needed to get the path right

26644
ubuntu	debian
copy the debian directory from the unpacked sources directory of the ubuntu

26646
sudo	passwd
in a gui-environment i want to be able to ask the user for the root sudo passwd and then execute an app that requires root privileges from within my app

26663
spaces	delimiter
what is specific with the shells is that they have to properly build the argument list of commands called c argc argv python sys.argv including passing arguments with embedded spaces empty arguments custom delimiter and so on

26684
centos	linux
you can choose between centos scientific linux or fedora

26684
centos	linux
centos and scientific linux is exactly redhat enterprise linux clone

26693
openbsd	freebsd
i will begin a thorough study of the openbsd and freebsd which are the most complete books

26734
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	aix	solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	aix
the mainstream ones these days are found in operating systems created either from system v source code aix hpux solaris or from bsd source code openbsd freebsd and mac os x

26734
minix	linux
all of these kernels have their particular strengths and weaknesses just like linux and other from scratch unix like kernels minix gnu hurd ...

26755
comm	grep
preferably using only standard linux utilities comm diff sed awk grep ...

26771
rpm	yum
however it is more likely that they follow a whole host of assumptions about the distribution beyond yum itself â what libraries are available what they re named where they put their files and what rpm packages those things come from

26771
centos	linux
in that case you ll be best off with red hat enterprise linux itself or with centos or scientific linux both of which are built from the source packages provided by red hat

26783
versioning	upgrade
debian wheezy has upgrade its versioning of vim to 7.3.363 and the problem seems to be solved

26792
jobs	cron
the power of mail can be understood when writing shell scripts or cron jobs for example

26830
bash	zsh
in ksh93 bash or zsh you can use

26834
sudo	passwd
i was trying sudo su mysql to make the copy then it asks for a passwd that should be the one i have but it is saying it s wrong

26865
folder	directory
i have ssh access to my home folder but in my home folder i don t have write access except for the http s docs directory

26871
debian	mint	debian	linux
so i came to install linux mint debian edition on it

26894
debian	linux
here s the deal i m trying to set up a sql server with debian linux i managed to install debian - but i can t get apt-get to work since i m behind a proxy

26955
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu put an up clause in etc network interfaces or add a script in etc network if-up.d

26980
jobs	cron
can i set an option so that cron jobs system-wide will be emailed to root instead of to the user who runs them

27007
debian	linux
the community for debian is large and has an experienced user base lots of sysadmins and server administrators for example although this is true of many linux distributions

27007
dpkg	aptitude
the default install options should give you good usability and a familiar packaging interface dpkg aptitude

27009
kde	gnome
a better approach might be a kde gnome remote desktop

27025
factors	mean
by it i mean that the act of preparing regular-expressions and in the case of sed any looping logic etc. is the key factors

27056
folder	directory
and it shouldn t it be able to see other directory except it s home folder and sub directory within it

27058
openssh	jail
first of all check please chrootuser in etc ssh sshd_config it should jail your users there is specific version of openssh needed for that

27075
solaris	aix	filesystems	xfs
log-structured or journaled filesystems such as those supplied with aix and solaris and jfs reiserfs xfs ext3 etc.

27082
daemons	systemd
the broader answer to the question requires you to consider all the daemons running in the systemd

27085
kde	gnome
the only shortcoming it has in relation to this question is that it needs a gui to run in - gnome or kde

27089
ubuntu	debian
it can be found on ubuntu-branches ubuntu oneiric openssh oneiric view head debian openssh-server.postinst

27091
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	aix	netbsd	aix	unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	netbsd	solaris	aix	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	aix
many unix variants come with the pgrep and its companion pkill solaris linux part of the standard process utilities may be absent from embedded linux systems freebsd openbsd netbsd â but only from macports on osâ x not aix and only recently in hp-ux

27091
unix	solaris
beware that killall has a different meaning on solaris and possibly other unix variants

27093
pulseaudio	mixer
i uninstalled pulseaudio and got my sound back but removing pulseaudio also removes that nice little mixer icon on the top panel of gnome-shell and messes up with the sound configuration app

27093
pulseaudio	mixer
if not is there any gnome-shell extension that will create a similar icon based on alsa and not on pulseaudio the old mixer from gnome2 would be great

27126
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	centos	freebsd	centos	freebsd	opensolaris
if i use freebsd opensolaris and stop using ubuntu fedora centos archlinux migrate my all applications to freebsd opensolaris will that reduce license problems

27126
freebsd	linux
seems like freebsd allows to sell and also allowes to make closed source where linux gpl license is most confusing when it comes to sell the product for derived works

27138
ubuntu	debian
i m curious if anyone has had success with running ubuntu or debian on the latest ultrabooks

27148
filesystems	ntfs
i have an external usb disk with an ntfs filesystems on it

27148
filesystems	ntfs
how is unlink implemented in linux s ntfs filesystems code

27159
ffmpeg	libvpx
i need a good environment to compile and run ffmpeg and libvpx

27159
debian	mint
i have used mint debian under virtual box however it has problems after kernel updates

27177
freebsd	opensuse	freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian	gentoo	opensuse	gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
dmidecode is packaged for several linux and bsd distributions debian gentoo opensuse and freebsd among others either as a single package or included in a more generic tool set

27180
bsd	aix
garfinkel spafford still has the best explanation of file ownership and permissions i ve ever read linux and bsd and frisch is comprehensive in scope even covers aix in good detail

27180
ubuntu	debian
that along with a copy of the debian policy and you ll be able to understand why ubuntu and various debian spin-offs organize things the way they do

27192
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
newbies to linux like me often find it puzzling when there are so many different distributions like debian fedora or ubuntu

27195
ubuntu	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux
i know only redhat-based fedora ubuntu and gentoo linux

27195
ubuntu	linux
if you re truly a novice say you don t know anything about shell scripting or programming languages and want to learn a linux system i would suggest ubuntu

27195
gentoo	linux
or if you are somewhat familar with the linux system and know some shell scripting i strongly suggest you learn gentoo linux which does not have binary packages so you need to compile every package you need

27195
gentoo	linux
but i don t recommend gentoo linux if you have absolutely no experience on other distribution.

27213
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
also i ve seen this happen only in centos not in debian ubuntu

27223
ubuntu	debian
bug is reported fixed in debian but the issue is still there with ubuntu 11.04 natty

27240
x86	64bit
freebsd 10 will use the bsd-licensed clang compiler instead of gcc for 32- and 64bit intel x86 systems

27271
disk	ram
for example i would like to know if the file directory is a temporary file in ram or if it s stored on disk

27276
sunos	aix
ex. sunos hp-ux aix

27304
jobs	cron
start and stop it via cron jobs

27315
xfce	kde
kde does it right but it s not as light as xfce with nautilus

27319
put	get
i am wondering how i can get the pid of the process created by at so that i can easily put the server to sleep when needed

27327
centos	linux
centos is a free operating system distribution based upon the linux kernel

27327
centos	linux
centos is the most popular linux distribution for web servers with almost 30 of all linux web servers using it

27335
bash	zsh
or using ksh93 bash or zsh you can fool diff with the command

27346
stdout	stderr
that s a bit of a convoluted example but it sends stdout to dev null while piping stderr to a sed script to extract the names of the files for which a permission denied error was displayed and then sends those results to a file

27347
udp	tcp
so in the above example you don t have to write rules for the same set of allowed udp tcp ports over and over again for the allowed networks

27362
folder	directory
i d like to compress and package everything including files and folder in current directory into a single zip file on ubuntu

27363
folder	directory
can i share a folder inside my home directory with another user

27363
daemons	systemd
i have two users on a systemd agent and daemons

27365
folder	directory
there is no permission for daemon in agent folder eventhough he has permission for agent incoming so it is hierarchy of permissions see this a question about permissions of hierarchical directory

27377
gif	png
use png instead or if impossible gif

27386
gentoo	linux
but on linux my gentoo box it shows only one device dev sdc - the internal 11g sd card

27401
octal	binary
the 3 bits for other permissions will deny all access if they are 000 in binary or 0 in octal the base entered numerically in chmod or --- as viewed in ls -l

27402
put	get
if you are using dhcp it may get put back in the next time you reboot even if you have no ipv6 in your kernel network stack

27420
ubuntu	mint
my etc apt sources.list currently has links to older versions and there are several of them some mint some ubuntu some mediubuntu etc

27431
put	get
the command that you put in your question runs id -u to get the effective user id and then changes the ownership of somedir to that user

27485
vmware	virtualbox
can i run a linux system inside virtualbox or vmware with xen kernel

27488
daemon	cron
the output is mailed by the cron daemon to you

27516
ubuntu	linux
with a linux machine ex. an ubuntu how can i search for a given word recursively in several pdfs

27524
folder	directory
so either your operation failed or the folder in some other directory

27527
debian	linux
i m using the javax.print api to print a jasper report on debian linux

27553
ubuntu	debian
some distributions are more experimental or more technical like archlinux some change a lot from version to version like ubuntu others much less like debian

27553
kde	gnome
some offer stunning default themes but are somehow heavier like kde others are lighter are require some more work to tweak like gnome 3

27572
jhbuild	pygobject	gtk	jhbuild	gtk	pygobject
i was trying to build gtk and pygobject with jhbuild on ubuntu 11.04 but it gives the following error while building gnome-doc-utils

27576
sudoers	passwd
i m assuming a sudoers can delete or change the passwd of another sudoers

27581
sudo	passwd
the command sudo -u gdm prompts you for a passwd because you don t have a specific authorization to run commands as gdm through sudo

27585
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox vmware i don t care

27595
sudoers	visudo
visudo checks the file syntax before actually overwriting the sudoers file

27602
daemons	systemd

mouse	keyboard
if i try to install as soon as it gets to the part where it writes partition to disk however the computer just freezes screen image is frozen no mouse nor keyboard response--even num-lock won t change then

27660
disk	ram
the memory on the disk can t be modified and the running os in ram can t be preserved

27685
dpkg	apt
you are aware that dpkg and apt keep logs right

27685
dpkg	apt
the apt ones are if you are using apt so can be bypassed but the dpkg ones cannot since the package system has to use dpkg

27685
dpkg	apt
they are in and apt and also dpkg

27695
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
if it runs in x it probably needs one of more of qt gnome kde xfce fltk mosaic .

27701
switching	screens
i m looking to switching from screens to tmux for my terminal multiplexing needs but there s a feature of screens that i need to replicate in tmux the -x option which allows one to run arbitrary screens commands inside an existing screens session

27703
stdout	stderr
both stdout and stderr get logged to runme.log it won t matter if your console or shell terminate sooner or if you logout su to a different account no terminal garbage from runme and thanks to disown even the parent-child pid relationship is removed

27705
vmware	esx
strictly speaking the dom0 does not start the domu - it tells the hypervisor to do so - but there have beens certs about priviledge escalation vmware esx and xen

27717
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
in any linux system i have access to a couple of archlinuxes an ubuntu a debian sid and a gentoo there are the following 4 files in etc all ending with a dash

27722
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	mint	opensuse	mint
i m on opensuse 12.1 currently but on ubuntu 10.10 11 and mint lisa i think i got worried about the notebook being too hot too

27726
daemons	systemd
it works either standalone mode puppet apply or in client-server mode puppet agent with puppet agents running on client systemd checking in with the master daemons on the server on a regular basis

27755
bluetooth	usb
the other computer is running lm11-amd64 with an asus usb bluetooth dongle.

27758
hide	show
i can only remove all elements inside or put it on show hide but i do not see a way to permanently remove this

27763
dpkg	apt
alternatively passing the dpkg option via apt should work

27787
ubuntu	linux
i have an ubuntu 10.04 linux server that i normally ssh into from my home machine using ssh key authentication

27819
jobs	cron
would someone suggest any handy command line not web tool or script which adds enables and disables cron jobs

27821
jobs	cron
so if you are looking for wrapping your configuration again over simplistic cron s crontab then perhaps you are not looking for cron but some other scheduler which will trigger your jobs

27828
sudo	passwd
i enter the passwd i normally use for sudo in terminal but it doesn t work

27834
sudo	passwd
the passwd you use for sudo is your passwd

27856
jobs	cron
you can automate cron jobs with crontab -e

27860
filesystems	btrfs
if you re looking for advanced filesystems for general-purpose computers in the linux world there are two candidates zfs and btrfs

27860
disk	ram
this is more of a security protection than a protection against failing hardware because failing hardware tends to make a file unreadable the hardware has its own checksums so reading wrong data is extremely unlikely if a disk read returns wrong data and you re sure it s not an application error blame your ram not your disk

27870
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu

27875
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	debian
the freebsd source ports are pretty current and easy as any ubuntu lts debian or arch

27876
debian	linux
also i didn t have a realistic understanding of how many many manpages there are with a debian linux distribution and so caleb s comment about selecting a best of collection appears to be the best idea

27879
xen	openvz
this isn t only for kvm some of tools supports xen openvz

27890
sudo	passwd
this way the -t allows sudo to ask for the admin passwd before outputing the content of the file

27890
sudo	passwd
the problem is i don t know how to combine those techniques into something that will ask for the sudo passwd on each server and transfer the file to its destination

27899
sudo	passwd
you can set up sudo to not ask passwd next way

27899
sudo	passwd
by the way if you ll set up sudo to ask passwd from user the string with will apear in target file

27911
freebsd	linux
the freebsd kernel might support some hardware which linux does not

27911
freebsd	debian
why would you prefer debian gnu kfreebsd to freebsd

27911
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
from the official wiki there you can find more points on why to prefer the debian gnu linux and not be totally freebsd

27921
put	get
it has to do apparently with the new changes made to the xorg.conf file so i have a back up and just put the old one back and then i can get back to the gui

27940
gentoo	linux
i ve looked at arch linux tiny core gentoo suse jeos and slitaz

27948
sudo	passwd
on each side if you have sudo set up not to ask a passwd again you can run it once to get over with the passwd requirement and another time to copy the file

27951
switching	screens
these switching from the primary to the secondary screens and back to the primary respectively

27951
switching	screens
should switching to the secondary screens and this

27953
switching	screens
if a command simply emits output to the terminal you can use terminal control sequences to switching to the secondary screens and back these commands are documented in xterm ctlseqs

27961
disk	ram
that will help you keep control of the os footprint both in terms of ram and disk

27985
opensuse	debian
my wife s netbook has two distributions installed on it opensuse 11.4 which she no longer uses much and debian testing

28019
ubuntu	debian
on distributions such as debian and ubuntu i also recommend installing the resolvconf package which takes care of maintaining etc resolv.conf when you aren t running a local dns cache or of maintaining the dns cache program s configuration when you are

28027
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
is a redirection operator in tcsh bash and zsh which redirects both the program s standard output and the program s standard error to the file name specified after the operator here log

28029
bash	zsh
bash doesn t have a way to trap divisions by 0 nor do ash ksh93 pdksh or zsh

28035
udp	tcp
once it is complete i would like to report the error status to a central loghost server which is currently running syslog-ng with udp tcp port 514 and a webserver on port 80

28036
udp	tcp
i am preparing this ubuntu box to run a server that will use some special ports in udp and tcp

28040
multiplying	add
multiplying it by 257 not 256 or add it to itself shifted left by 8 bit positions

28045
cat	tee
then i m going to cat dev urandom and pipe the output into padsp and use the tee command to send the data to dev audio

28059
post	get
a lot of my post have code snippets in them - and in markdown syntax i indent them 4 spaces so they get rendered as a pre code tag

28059
post	get
is there anyway to mimic the behavior of the wordpress.com sourcecode tag so i can get proper syntax highlighted code snippets in my blog post

28063
sudo	passwd
assuming your powertop is in usr sbin you can use sudo usr sbin powertop with no passwd

28064
versioning	upgrade
in your case since you re tracking -stable this would mean a reinstall upgrade from install media because freebsd-update only supports upgrading between released beta rc versioning of freebsd - but in my opinion unless you need a custom kernel it s worth it

28064
versioning	upgrade
edit note that once you re tracking -release you can use freebsd-update to upgrade from release to release or from -rc and -beta versioning -- another reason why i prefer it

28094
jobs	cron
a common mistake when creating cron jobs is assuming that the path is the same when the cron runs as when the user runs the file

28107
mouse	keyboard
if i try to enter recovery mode on hdd where ubuntu is installed keyboard seems to fail mouse have light though

28121
put	get
what if the program that you put in place of sleep wants to get input from the terminal

28121
bash	zsh
but as i show it can be done in bourne or ksh or bash or zsh shell too

28132
stdout	stderr
your sending all stdout to dev null so anything that prints error messages must output them to stderr

28134
clang	llvm
i would like to install the clang llvm compiler suite within slackware since i use it as my default c conpiler for my c programming assignments

28134
ubuntu	debian
i mostly installed prepackaged software in other distros before debian ubuntu and fedora

28135
stdout	stderr
cron only emails you the output streams stdout and stderr if the contain output

28175
disk	ram
i ve got an eeepc 900a it has a 8gb flash as disk and only 1gb of ram

28176
disk	ram
the natural state of things is that application data is in ram and files are on disk

28176
disk	ram
the ideal state of things performance wise is that data in frequent use is in ram and data that isn t needed at the moment is on disk

28176
disk	ram
data from files that has been used recently is kept in ram this is the disk cache for data read from disk and disk buffers for data that is about to be written to disk

28176
disk	ram
i don t know of a direct way to tell the kernel to reserve a minimum amount of ram for the disk cache

28177
bash	zsh
zsh doesn t do any whitespace normalization in the history but the completion system is a little smarter than bash s at keeping the amount of whitespace consistent whether you type a full name or hit tab which helps

28182
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
let them experience a good windowing system gnome kde xfce see how responsive it is

28196
ubuntu	mint
can i add the ubuntu messaging menu to mint 12

28214
ubuntu	debian
in debian and ubuntu often daemon have some configuration parameters set in etc default daemon-name this is etc default ntp

28227
sudoers	visudo
use visudo -f etc sudoers and grant him permission to execute the etc rc.d init.d mysql start and etc rc.d init.d mysql stop as two separate commands in the command list and in the execution part grant the user to execute both the commands as user mysql

28236
filesystems	xfs
create an xfs filesystems on the ebs volume and mount it as vol

28236
filesystems	xfs
you now have a 10 gb or whatever size you specified ebs volume mounted under vol with an xfs filesystems and it will be automatically mounted if the instance reboots

28236
filesystems	xfs
still not sure what grep -q xfs proc filesystems || sudo modprobe xfs is doing as running each of those commands does not show any results

28240
ubuntu	linux
now i m trying to optimize my ubuntu boot process and i would like to disable detection of my compro card because it s not working on linux it won t work and even if it does i don t care

28242
filesystems	xfs
so grep -q xfs proc filesystems is checking to see if your kernel knows about xfs

28242
filesystems	xfs
this creates an empty xfs filesystems on the block device dev sdh it formats the partition

28247
ppp	dhcp
if your ppp or dhcp daemon drops the addresses of your isp s providers in a file say etc ppp resolv.conf then reference that file in dnsmasq.conf

28247
ubuntu	debian
if you re running debian ubuntu or some other distribution with a resolvconf package install it

28256
put	get
how do i get just the ip address and put it in the variable

28263
redhat	fedora
further check the interface specific configuration file if you are using a redhat style distribution like fedora centos etc.

28266
jobs	cron
i have a few cron jobs and one of them is run every minute

28271
daemons	systemd
on bsd-like and other distros you will often have scripts in etc rc.d that typically manages starting restarting and stopping daemons in your systemd

28271
daemons	systemd
i highly recommend to try out this script for showing your systemd started and stopped daemons

28292
debian	linux
while installing the former makes the login work on my local machine arch linux it doesn t on the server where i want the application to run debian squeeze

28294
vlan	packets
if you want to communicate with other computer in private vlan you can do that only on l3 - route packets through a router

28306
debian	linux
lastly i m running debian testing 64 bits on linux kernel 3.2.0-rc7

28309
sudo	passwd
i have setup sudo not to ask for a passwd but when i did that i could no longer run psql as postgres user using sudo -u unless i was root

28324
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is based on ubuntu

28324
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian

28324
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
like this there are several other linux distributions that are based on ubuntu debian slackware etc

28325
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu uses the same packaging management system deb and apt and with each development cycle pulls in the latest packages from debian and then adapts them to ubuntu specifics and adds more features and patches where necessary

28325
ubuntu	debian
they also push changes back to debian and often developers are ubuntu and debian developers

28325
ubuntu	mint
mint in turn does the same with ubuntu packages update although mint does not seem to contribute back as much or at all

28327
slackware	suse
see the case for red-hat and suse for example on the graph linked by zenklys you see that suse is an early derivative from slackware but they borrowed the rpm packaging system from red-hat i guess not to reinvent the wheel

28327
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is a derivative of debian in that sense they took a working distribution and decided on a number of things default and officially supported desktop environment and theming putting emphasis on a non-root user being able to access all the restricted areas hardware setup for example etc. and also integrating tools and sometimes also developing new ones to achieve their goals

28327
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu has kept a certain level of feedback with debian making it easy to take your knowledge from one to the other to a certain degree but that doesn t need to be true for all derivative distros

28328
debian	linux
i m a linux system administrator and dealing with big iron distributions like debian and redhat for a long time

28336
folder	directory
i have a bash script that expands two archives jar files into two directory and then does a diff of the two folder

28340
put	get
you can get an idea of which functions to put trace points or break points on by looking at the call structure in the disassembly objdump -d path to executable

28393
cpu	hyperthreading
proc cpuinfo shows 12 cpus but dmidecode shows only one cpu and the other one is in the unpopulated status like it is showing that this is other cpu is because of the hyperthreading

28396
processors	hyperthreading
if i read the datasheet correctly you have one slot filled six cores which show as 12 processors because they are hyperthreading

28405
titlebar	window
the sleep lines are needed because without them chromeâ s window titlebar will show up behind the unity panel

28415
minix	linux
if you want standard compliance use pax but beware that many linux distributions don t include it in their base installation and there s no pax in minix

28417
sudo	passwd
one way to do this is to have sudo not prompt for the passwd

28421
vim	emacs	vim	geany
i normally switch between geany vim and emacs depending on my mood

28448
ubuntu	debian
basically every ubuntu cycle until debian import freeze source packages that aren t modified in ubuntu are copied from debian into ubuntu daily the 74 branch

28448
ubuntu	debian
packages that have been modified in both debian ubuntu get manually merged the patch branch usually by the developer who last touched the package in ubuntu

28448
ubuntu	debian
so ubuntu gets to maintain its own core set of packages and also get the benefit of the huge quantity of debian packages

28449
atexit	main
some of the things that the c runtime does which the kernel doesn t do it runs handlers previously registered with atexit and it arranges for the integer return value from main to be returned to the system as if with exit

28476
bash	zsh
this goes for all the ksh variants that i ve seen and for bash but there are apparently ksh versions such as on aix 4.3 that allow typeset +r which zsh also allows

28497
punctuation	words
you re looking for the words but that could match a user name or a part of a group name that contains a punctuation character or a few more exotic mismatches

28497
solaris	bsd
most modern unices at least solaris linux and bsd have a getent command to retrieve entries from system databases including the group database

28536
ppm	pgm
supported image formats are pgm ppm pam and png

28547
short	base
long story short openbsd s tcpdump from the base system is privilege separated already

28548
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
what is the state-of-the-art method for automatically executing custom scripts upon usb device plug-in under current linux distributions like debian centos fedora

28549
google-chrome	firefox
but after a few days of usage when i restarted my computer the ctrl+f shortcut stopped working in applications like firefox google-chrome or any other program i try

28558
disk	ram
this is due to the fact that sync is generally used during a shutdown or reboot procedure where it s advisable to get data written safely to disk and the real target of the operation is memory not the disk and getting that buffered data out of ram to somewhere safe

28571
wan	lan
every computer on the lan and specific computers on the wan that have access right to the proxy should be allowed to use this proxy but no traffic should be forced to go through the router

28571
opera	firefox
example i want to redirect firefox traffic through the vpn but not opera traffic

28571
opera	firefox
i setup firefox to use the local proxy it gets the dynamic ip of the distant router opera still browses with my semistatic-ip

28583
ubuntu	debian
on debian and derivatives including ubuntu this command is called rename.ul

28583
bash	zsh
if you have some control over the machines you use my recommendation is to use zsh as your shell it has other benefits over bash and put these lines in your .zshrc

28598
kubuntu	gnome	kde	gnome	kde	kubuntu
i want to delete the kubuntu vm but kde is based on qt and the other distros i have use gnome gtk+

28599
folder	directory
it doesn t have to be an absolute path just the name of the directory in the . themes folder

28603
folder	directory
i do not want to bother the whole home directory i want a specific directory with some files and folder in it

28627
udp	tcp
which tcp and udp ranges will the nat choose its alias ports from

28632
bash	zsh
in bash ksh zsh you don t need to store the intermediate files on the disk

28645
mouse	keyboard
right now i have the option of using gui clients which even if they support the keyboard are optimized for the mouse buttons and menus taking screen space actions based on navigating menus with the arrow keys etc or terminal-based clients which don t support embedded images in html messages

28649
ansible	puppet
it supports provisioning with puppet ansible or chef and allows you to control most of the exposed vbox configuration settings

28650
versioning	upgrade
versioning of fedora are retired after 13 months which means that a system must be upgrade at least once a year in order to be running a supported versioning

28651
redhat	fedora
redhat enterprise linux rhel is the server-based version offered by redhat the company behind fedora for which you can buy their support

28664
debian	mint
installing software on mint is relativity identical to most debian based distributions

28664
ubuntu	mint
i have not really used mint but i did test its ability to install ubuntu packages in the past

28664
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
from what i understand linux mint 12 is compatible with ubuntu 11.10

28679
ubuntu	linux
other systems such as the popular ubuntu linux distribution utilize

28683
bash	zsh
ksh bash and zsh also have a dedicated syntax

28685
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs or fat filesystems underlying the cifs mount may not actually support some of the system calls and that may not be actual errors

28700
ubuntu	opensuse	xfce	kde
i have tried ubuntu fedora 15 and 16 fedora 16 kde spin fedora 16 xfce spin opensuse pinguy and possibly some other distro as well

28724
cpu	processors
ordinary process usually spends some time running on a processors and then ends up waiting for an event to happen data arriving on a network connection disk i o completing lock becoming available cpu becoming available again for a runnable process after it has used up its time quantum

28726
ubuntu	debian
the script responsible for traversing is etc init.d rc on pre-upstart ubuntu and on debian

28729
ubuntu	linux
backtrack linux faq why can t i just add the backtrack repositories to my ubuntu install or the ubuntu repositories to my backtrack install

28733
disk	ram
you can put the folder in a ram disk

28733
folder	directory
keep your source and work in a folder on a hard disk and when you re going to test just rsync that directory to the ramdisk you re going to create using the page i linked to

28733
ramdisk	umount
when you umount a ramdisk everything is gone

28733
disk	ram
there is no such thing as a ram disk that provides persistent storage

28736
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	opensuse	linux	opensuse	mint
my touchpad never works in any linux distro such as ubuntu fedora opensuse linux mint knoppix puppy slitaz and lots more

28736
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this made my touchpad work on all variants of ubuntu and its derivatives like linux mint

28736
ubuntu	linux
if i knew what it does exactly i would be able to use my touchpad in all linux distros as this option only works with ubuntu

28740
stdout	stderr
is there any way to redirect stdout and stderr via variable like adding command options in script

28740
stdout	stderr
but i need some output even in non-verbose mode therefore i can t just redirect whole stdout and stderr only from some commands inside of my script

28750
stdout	stderr
the line e 2 1 6 first directs stderr to stdout which in the context of .. is the output we re capturing

28756
filesystems	btrfs
the filesystems that i tried ext4 btrfs have some problems with positioning of files on disk

28788
bash	tcsh
at the time bash was released there were no free ksh implementations tcsh was a free csh replacement but stallman had a rant against csh for shell programming

28791
ubuntu	linux
i m currently working on a bash script that installs and sets up various programs on a stock linux system currently ubuntu

28791
sudo	passwd
however i would like if possible to be able to prompt the user for their sudo passwd and elevate the script s privileges automatically if the user doesn t run the script command with sudo such as launching it from the gui file manager without the user having to restart the script

28810
mouse	keyboard
the traditional ps 2 interface only provides for one keyboard and one mouse

28813
zsh	tcsh
tcsh was the most advanced interactive shell until zsh came along but it s incompatible with sh and not so good with scripting

28816
google-chrome	firefox
if you don t want to have to edit your browser settings every time you start and stop using the proxy use a browser extension such as foxy proxy for firefox or a google-chrome equivalent and set it up to use as a proxy only for urls matching

28824
crypt	md5
if you have root access and are using md5 passwords and you just need to compare passwords then you can use the perl crypt passwdmd5 module

28824
hash	md5
take the md5 hash from etc shadow strip the 1 and then split on the remaining

28837
vim	emacs
after using vim for the past couple of years i m switching to emacs as part of my get out og your comfort zone 2012 resolution

28861
daemons	systemd
in addition to sardathrion s answer sbin directories are generally used for the binaries for various kinds of systemd management tools low-level systemd applications and often systemd daemons of various kinds

28868
bash	subshell
to run a command with limited virtual memory you can just use a bash subshell

28874
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux
if you have the rename 1 tool which you do if you have debian or a debian-based linux including ubuntu and derivatives

28883
ubuntu	debian
on debian and derivatives including ubuntu look out for a file called etc udev rules.d 70-persistent-net.rules

28889
hash	salt
instead of a long salt hash

28900
jobs	cron
a valid shell is necessary to run cron jobs

28905
unix	bsd
some systems may have extra directories which may or may not be placed on the depending on what the execution environment should be compatible with for example usr bin posix or usr xpg4 bin or usr xpg6 bin for compatibility with posix single unix or usr ucb for compatibility with legacy bsd systems

28935
jobs	cron
for one-minute resolution cron jobs will run at the specified time regardless of how long each command takes

28947
spaces	delimiter
the spaces is merely an arbitrary delimiter

28953
ubuntu	debian
one more thing if you re trying to build a kernel for another computer which boots is the same architecture as the one you re compiling on and runs a debian or debian-like os ubuntu counts you could install the kernel-package package sudo aptitude install kernel-package

28954
xming	xorg
vcxsrv windows x-server based on the xorg git sources like xming or

28985
octal	hex	octal	decimal
echo doesn t take decimal escapes so convert to hex turns out the 177 is octal

28986
chmod	mkdir
you can then use mkdir to recreate the directory and perhaps chmod to restore its permissions

28987
bash	zsh
if you use ksh93 bash zsh mksh or freebsd sh you can try to remove it by specifying its non-printable name

28994
folder	directory
putting every org files in a directory of a dropbox folder i run emacs to edit manage these files from three different local machines cygwin mac os x and debian

29003
pull	push
afterwards they just pull push new assignments submissions

29003
pull	push
and you can create the directories yourself commit push the changes and they can simply pull the changes when it s time to start the project

29008
dpkg	apt
you can get a package description with one of these commands the apt command for installable packages the dpkg command for installed packages

29012
maven	pom.xml
each branch has a maven pom.xml which contains exact information about the version

29015
openbsd	debian
or if you have a 64bit cpu install debian install virtualbox load openbsd and whenever you absolutely must look at a flash video switch to debian to view it

29024
gentoo	solaris	solaris	aix
another solution for this problem is using the gentoo prefix as the macosx users and other platform solaris aix does

29029
pop-up	dialog
when i install the software updates with update manager there is a pop-up dialog which tells me the volume boot has only 0 byte disk space remaining

29050
octal	hex
a long time ago an old friend showed me a way to use an octal or hex umask with a group i think using etc profile

29053
kde	gnome
manager awesome 3.4.11 no kde or gnome stuff

29055
unix	bsd
it is original in that it is neither based on at t source code system v nor on bsd the two major unix flavor

29059
google-chrome	firefox
modern versions of firefox and google-chrome no longer use this format but rather an sqlite database

29059
google-chrome	firefox
you are in for a world of hurt figuring out what browser to use this user has three firefox profiles and two google-chrome profiles which one should i look at

29088
filesystems	xfs
in such case i would opt to choose xfs as my filesystems for the reason that it is a 64-bit filesystems and capable of handling filesystems as large as a million terabytes

29090
post	get
post back with comments regarding your results i can get you through the rest

29094
vim	emacs
if you re not a regular emacs or vim user as featured in several other answers this might be the easiest way to go

rpm	yum
since rpm does not have provide dependency resolution it self its necessary that tools like yum have come into the picture to make it easy for rpms installation

29100
rpm	yum
incase of this i suggest to either resolve the package dependency self or better have yum configured on the host and let yum take the burden of dependency resolution and have them installed through rpm

29101
width	height
what is the best way to obtain information as bitrate framerate width height of an movie file in my case .avi from the command line

29117
lvm	btrfs
i thought of using a vcs like git lvm or btrfs snapshots or a backup program for this

29118
umask	mount
when you mount a fat or ntfs partition the permissions are determined at mount time by the umask fmask and dmask options

29120
bazaar	git
it supports git mercurial darcs and bazaar

29139
switching	screens
after that you have still a single screens window but if you do ctrl + a c you create a new screens window and switching between the windows with ctrl + a 0 ctrl + a 1

29151
rpm	yum
a yum update should not change anything without leaving a .rpmnew or .rpmold if the config-file is flagged as such in the corresponding rpm

29152
centos	linux
el6 is short for redhat enterprise linux 6 - which is the orignal os for the binary compatible clones centos 6 scientific linux 6

29160
ati	nvidia
the two biggest off-board chipsets nvidia and amd ex ati both offer well-supported multi-screen configurations for x11 on linux closed-source binary drivers may be needed to enable all features on some chipsets

29164
daemons	systemd
running a daemons under its own special user is just one security technique others include some sort of chrooting or using mandatory access control mac systemd selinux

29185
pulseaudio	mixer
i have pulseaudio alsa-plugins mplayer mixer and pavucontrol installed

29195
disk	ram
for example all the shared libraries that are used by a program are mapped in each process that uses them but for the most part only one copy is kept in ram for the whole system and that copy need not be fully loaded in memory parts that are required will be loaded from the disk file on when needed

29196
ubuntu	linux
the clients are linux machines mostly ubuntu but some others distros too and some mac -book s in between but they re not important for the question

29203
emacs	aquamacs
so i removed the link to aquamacs and instead wrote a script file named emacs consisting entirely of

29205
spaces	delimiter
the spaces is merely an arbitrary delimiter

29210
stdout	stderr
you would overcome this by redirecting stdout to the abyss dev null and redirect stderr to where stdout is redirected

29220
jobs	cron
i don t see any other cron jobs in the directories or in the users cron jobs.

29224
ubuntu	debian
the package name is ntp on debian and presumably ubuntu too

29224
daemon	cron
the ntp daemon keeps your time in sync a lot more proactively than a cron job synchronising with one or more other ntp servers and keeping your clock much more accurate

29241
ant	maven
i m also trying to convert this project over to use maven instead of ant ivy for a build tool

29250
sudo	passwd
after booting up nothing happens but when i use the command sudo mount -a i am always prompted for the passwd

29250
debian	linux
if it helps at all i am trying to connect to a home server running debian from a laptop running arch linux

29264
filesystems	xfs
having ruled out your two chosen filesystems i suggest xfs

29307
centos	linux
i mean that ex. centos and scientific-linux are the exact copies of redhat linux

29308
csv	tsv
my question is how do i format tsv most likely csv as well files to make sure that when a maximum cell length that can be set with a parameter is reached it s not just a line break but data will start in a new line with the same indentation

29323
ubuntu	debian
it s meant for debian but it works on ubuntu too of course

29328
solaris	bsd
you can adjust the tcp timeout but the method varies based on which os youre using linux solaris bsd ...

29332
bash	zsh
or in bash or zsh

29335
client-side	server-side
to distinguish between local and remote sessions there are two possible approaches client-side or server-side

29335
wan	lan
on the client side you may want to put forwardx11 settings in your .ssh config set it to yes for lan hosts and to no for wan hosts

29335
wan	lan
if x11 forwarding is on for lan connections and off for wan connections then you can set your favorite editor to take into account

29335
bash	zsh
the server-side settings would normally go into your .profile or .bash_profile if your login shell is bash and you use .bash_profile or .zprofile if your login shell is zsh

29341
sysv	systemd
in fedora 16 the approach to restart service has taken a giant flighted leap from sysv init script style to systemd approach

29347
versioning	upgrade
i might be able to direct you to a easy upgrade option need distro versioning to know

29360
ubuntu	debian
from the licensing faq entry what about putting non-free items in a separate non-free repository like debian ubuntu does

29365
redhat	fedora
i guess there are repositories like rpmfusion which distinguish the free and non-free packages for fedora redhat and centos

29373
ubuntu	linux
it looks like by default papi performance application programming interface is not supporting to measure last-level cache misses l3 on my amd machine running ubuntu linux

29379
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
i ll explain how to do this from the command line on distributions using debian packaging tools debian ubuntu mint â

29392
ubuntu	debian
usually its set in the main apache config i m guessing ubuntu debian has that file located etc apache2 apache2.conf

29392
post	get
if you get stuck or it doesn t work post the relevant lines from var log apache2 error.log

29424
snmp	dhcp
you can perhaps use snmp provided snmp is enabled allowed for dhcp service on windows server

29424
snmp	dhcp
using snmp queries one can build a statistics of the lease information from time to time remotely from the dhcp service

29426
rpm	yum
i can confirm that arguably it is easier to set things up than with ubuntu since rpm and yum works quite good with adding stuff like that

29438
hash	md5
create md5 hash for that two packages with md5sum filename

29442
g++	gcc
ccache keeps many compiling information available for gcc g++ for next one

29462
debian	linux
i installed linux on something like 3 or 4 different machines last year and in two cases i had a serious urge to vomit after noting that file indexers such as virtuoso debian testing with the latest kde and libtracker-miner were installed by default

29479
ubuntu	linux
i have been using ubuntu 10.04 for 2 years now and honestly i am somewhat bored of linux and wish to explore unix or unix like now

29479
ubuntu	linux
i don t want a dumbed down version like ubuntu anymore and want to experience unix or linux if need be in its true form

29479
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
netbsd vs freebsd vs openbsd vs other unix unixlike vs linux

29479
unix	bsd
i would really want to try a bsd unix now but then if my requirements aren t met i don t mind a linux

29479
ubuntu	debian
i have tried ubuntu debian fedora rhel but not long enough to make an informed choice

29486
opensolaris	smartos
i would suggest to use smartos -- joyent s smark fork of opensolaris solaris

29489
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu distros belongs to the package lwp-request

29491
opensolaris	smartos
if you are just looking for choice -- i would suggest get onto using smartos fork of opensolaris by joyent group and sports active development community and support

29499
debian	centos	debian	linux	solaris	aix	centos	solaris	centos	linux
so knowing about hp-unix aix solaris linux debian rh and suse i would recommend using linux centos 5.7 or newer - keep it updated via yum-cron to you

29526
portrait	landscape
i want to set up a multi-monitor configuration where two landscape oriented monitors one above the other and two portrait oriented monitors one right of the other combine into a single large screen

29535
tiff	png	gif	png
it can read and write images in a variety of formats over 100 including dpx exr gif jpeg jpeg-2000 pdf photocd png postscript svg and tiff

29583
unix	bsd
nawk â œnew awkâ an evolution of oawk the original unix implementation used on bsd and widely available on linux

29590
jobs	cron
linux distributions have a directory etc cron.hourly where you can put cron jobs to be executed every hour

29599
bash	subshell
you just quote everything to make bash repeat the whole pattern including -o -name and then break the grouping made by the quoting by returning it from a subshell

29599
put	get
note that you can t just put a backslash before the star the command substitution returns either a which will get expanded or a which will get passed as-is to find

29610
vim	textmate
why do i need it exactly - i am trying to simulate textmate project drawer using vim and splitscreen with screen and interactive tree on the left

29620
jobs	cron
another possible issue thanks to sopalajo de arrierez for pointing it out in comments is that cron jobs run with a restricted environment

29626
ubuntu	debian
bbw ppas are an ubuntu feature and do not exist for debian

29634
bash	zsh
if your shell supports arrays it s bash or ksh or zsh i recommend using them instead so you won t have to insert extra quoting

29637
debian	linux
i found the following command line to shut down a debian gnu linux system

29661
debian	mint	debian	linux
after installing linux mint debian edition my .config user-dirs.dirs looks like this

29661
xfce	gnome
for instance gnome and xfce use for the desktop files if it is defined

29679
comm	grep
until you get that running i like angus s comm solution but so many people are trying with grep and getting it wrong that i thought i d show the or at least one correct way to do it with grep

29700
ubuntu	centos
i switched from an ubuntu to the centos yesterday

29714
stdout	stderr
if your daemon program usr sbin mamouddaemon is coded in c or in c++ i suggest using openlog and syslog inside at least to get debugging messages don t output to stderr or stdout in a daemon it could go nowhere

29723
ubuntu	mint
x|k ubuntu mint and so on you can put the following in etc default keyboard

29727
sunos	bsd
do bsd and sunos have a multithreading architecture

29730
pthreads	fcntl
use fcntl pthreads locks to ensure that file locks are visible to other clients

29730
pthreads	fcntl
use the fcntl pthreads locking api

29730
solaris	bsd
this can break programs ported from other operating systems such as solaris that expect flock bsd locks to work like posix locks

29730
pthreads	fcntl
other nfs clients that use the same emulation mechanism or that use fcntl pthreads locks will then see the same locks that the linux nfs client sees

29730
pthreads	fcntl
thus due to this emulation applications running on a linux nfs server will still see files locked by nfs clients as being locked with a fcntl pthreads lock whether the application on the client is using a bsd-style or a posix-style lock

29736
solaris	sunos
the sunos family that more popularly goes by the name solaris was an att system v derivative

29736
solaris	sunos
someone put out a signal-handler-based threading package that worked well for sunos 4.1.x versions and solaris came with pthreads and some other threading package that were almost exactly the same in terms of api

29739
jobs	cron
i have seen various articles on cron-apt apticron unattended-updates apt cron jobs etc

29778
ubuntu	linux
linux server a and b ubuntu 10.10

29824
ubuntu	debian
it showed me a debian not ubuntu boot menu and i never got a working desktop environment

29828
bash	zsh
the shell you re using bash tsh zsh etc will dictate the commandline globbing that will and won t work

29835
ubuntu	linux
since this is more of a question about mozilla firefox i thought unix linux was more suitable than ubuntu mod s feel free to move if necessary

29888
minix	linux
the first linux kernels had to be bootstrapped with minix which was developed with a unix-like design in mind

29912
tunnel	lan
my main use of the tunnel is to print documents to some printers in the same lan as the server and the printers can only be accessed from within the lan

29912
tunnel	lan
i thought since i am now in the lan thanks to the tunnel my external ip should be the same as the server s

29924
bash	zsh
if you want to read all lines you can put them in an array ksh bash zsh only

29940
vim	gedit
i use nautilus as file manager and would like to use vim instead of gedit to edit my text files

29940
vim	gedit
many files log files empty files â are already opened with vim however not all of them tex files and xml files are still opened with gedit

29944
bash	zsh
a few times i have had problems in bash that other using zsh didn t have and they were gloating about how smart they are

29953
bash	zsh
in fact i have parallel configurations for bash and zsh so they behave quite similarly

29953
bash	zsh
i found zsh to be not very hard to get into coming from bash

29954
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux	debian-based	mint
default keyboard configuration file on debian-based linux ubuntu linux mint etc is in etc default keyboard

29956
bash	tcsh
while they are similar more similar than bash and tcsh for example they are different enough to force you to read documentation before doing nontrivial configuration

30009
bash	zsh
zsh uses readline and you could likely inspect the key binding for esc-h eh under an account with zsh and copy that binding into your account with bash

30011
buffering	sigpipe
it ll receive sigpipe when it s trying to flush its output buffering

30031
rpm	yum
when you install any rpm packet from the net with yum it will saved in var cache yum

30051
switching	screens
open a new window within screens start the script switching back to original screens window

30063
bash	zsh
happened only with skype so far no matter if on zsh or bash

30077
ubuntu	debian
at least on debian and ubuntu the resize command when applied to a full height region performs a horizontal resizing

30081
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu something like

30081
ubuntu	debian
of course ubuntu is not bound by debian policy in any case

30104
min	max
with find you can specify a lot of options such as directory depth min and max access modified time use regular expressions and a lot more

30107
versioning	upgrade
before the upgrade you should find that it exists a directory named as the current the old kernel versioning

30115
versioning	upgrade
if it s a major upgrade that changed the kernel package versioning you can keep both the old package and the new package around until your next reboot

30171
ubuntu	linux
what are the difficulties in importing android features to other linux distributions like ubuntu fedora and others

30186
bash	zsh
ksh bash and zsh have a conditional construct which imitates the traditional test and utilities

30209
ubuntu	debian
i ve done that with ubuntu debian based though i think the technique applies for other distros too

30227
bash	zsh
one important difference between bash and zsh is that in zsh parameter expansion is performed inside braces but in bash this is not the case

30231
jobs	cron
of course the cron jobs will affect performance in some way

30231
disk	ram
for example if you have an 8-hour job and a 5-hour job taken separately they may take more than 13 hours if you run them at the same time and they re fighting for the same resource disk i o network bandwidth ram â

30231
disk	ram
figure out what each job needs disk i o network bandwidth ram cpu â then work out a schedule so that there is no contention for resources

30238
cout	cin
i have a simple small app that suports cin cout interaction

30246
debian	mint	debian	linux
i just installed unreal tournament on my linux mint debian edition os

30254
x86	64bit
from the output above it s apparent that the former executable is built for a 64bit system while the latter is built for an x86 system

30260
ubuntu	opensuse
so the answer is probably there is a dependency missing on ubuntu that is fulfilled in opensuse

30260
ubuntu	opensuse
perhaps you can check the build-output for rts5139 on opensuse to see what is there as opposed to missing in ubuntu

30266
sudo	passwd
unfortunately if the compromised user also has sudo privileges it seems that binary planting can be used to trivially gain the sudo passwd and therefore escalate the attack to root privileges bad

30272
umask	mount
that will mount a vfat device in var www with umask 0022 owner user with id 33 and group group with id 33

30278
punctuation	words
when you write with no quotes the value of is broken up into â œwordsâ at each whitespace sequenceâ¹ the words can contain any non-whitespace character including punctuation and then each words undergoes globbing wildcard expansion

30279
mouse	keyboard
nowadays you can plug an usb keyboard or mouse and have x11 add it and recognize it no need to rely on dev mice or something like that

30280
mp3	ogg
has several options to override the title and if you have the required dependencies it may even be able to convert other formats such as ogg although you probably need to specify where the format can be among others mp3

30301
post	get
i ve heard about tiling managers which i suspect might be what i am looking for but from this post i get the impression that they are most often geared for more experienced users who are willing to spend the time to really customize their environment

30302
kde	gnome
if you re used to windows xp gnome 2 or kde might do the trick

30314
postfix	dovecot
i m running a postfix dovecot mail server and everything works quite well

30319
sysv	systemd
they are lengthy but worth a leisure reading and yet important since major linux distributions are having this crucial time to leap into next leg of improvement enhancements with systemd leaving behind some old school of thoughts sysv style operations

30356
versioning	upgrade
but unfortunately when i upgrade to the versioning 2.6.30.5 i looked through the same file i just find a declaration of the task_struct like

30401
mouse	keyboard
my keyboard and mouse are wireless connected to a usb port in a kvm which is connected by usb to the computer and it even works

30419
tunnel	vpn
an alternative that doesn t require knowing the ip address of your computer is to establish a tunnel a vpn between your computer and another computer with a known ip address

30459
ubuntu	linux
in other worlds of linux like ubuntu -- you would have upstart

30459
unix	solaris	unix	bsd	solaris	bsd
in other world of unix like solaris bsd macosx you have smf

30460
sysv	systemd
systemd is a systemd and service manager for linux compatible with sysv and lsb init scripts

30460
daemons	systemd
systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities uses socket and d-bus activation for starting services offers on-demand starting of daemons keeps track of processes using linux cgroups supports snapshotting and restoring of the systemd state maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic

30461
daemons	systemd
systemd is an alternative approach to systemv init daemons for linux

30514
multiplying	division
a dirty hack for small values and a limited precision without using bc would be to multiplying the nominator before division to get an accurate result

30532
folder	directory
it is identical to how an actual real-life directory works which is why it s called directory and not for example folder which would behave quite differently

30549
waitpid	fork
or you write some wrapper that fork the scripts and uses wait waitpid to catch dead processes

30558
sudo	passwd
is there a way to install software in gui mode when you have sudo permission but not the root passwd

30573
stdout	stderr
instead of appending both stdout and stderr to my logfile they have been getting lost altogether not even getting emailed

30573
ubuntu	linux
i use linux ubuntu 11.10 flavor which shouldn t matter

30580
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have now tried both linux mint my first choice and ubuntu and both simply give me a black screen from the moment it begins loading the live cd

30580
ubuntu	mint
i d prefer to get mint to work since i m tired of ubuntu and want to try out mint instead

30582
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	debian
i have tried ubuntu debian fedora and freebsd

30594
debian	mint	debian	linux
i tried installing linux mint 12 fedora 16 and debian squeeze all with the same results the kernel panics

30596
children	parent
the ulimit command only affects that shell and its children isolating its effects from the parent shell

30618
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
you should be able to use most debian or ubuntu guides on mysql since mint is based on ubuntu

30647
ubuntu	debian
there re debian and ubuntu packages too

30654
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
debian gnu kfreebsd is an operating system from debian but which uses the kernel of freebsd instead of the linux kernel thus the name

30654
debian	linux
some day most applications would exist both in debian gnu kfreebsd and in debian gnu linux

30655
freebsd	debian
debian gnu kfreebsd is a port that consists of gnu userland using the gnu c library on top of freebsd s kernel coupled with the regular debian package set

30658
gentoo	ubuntu
the instructions found on the gnome theme sites seemed to be ignored by my gentoo system or were made for ubuntu

30687
stdout	stderr
i have a find command with multiple -exec arguments and would like the output both stdout and stderr for one of the commands to be suppressed

30693
folder	directory
how can i find all such files and move them to a folder in my home directory on unix that may not exist yet

30708
bash	zsh
if you want to move all the files inside a directory hierarchy to a single destination directory in bash â 4 put shopt -s globstar in your .bashrc or zsh

30713
ubuntu	debian
for example sshed into a machine that has chrome chromium installed on debian ubuntu

30718
opensuse	linux
my windows partition works fine but my opensuse 12.1 linux partition is having a strange issue

30720
xfce	kde
i like krunner but nowadays i prefer to use xfce instead of kde

30729
centos	linux
different linux distributions and the lsb had different standards so both are present on centos to make it easier to run software from different versions

30741
unix	bsd
i formulated my question like this to make it clear i m not interested in a flamewar of opinions rather in an objective comparison between the different flavors of bsd unix

30742
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
about half of our current staff are developers using their own laptops with various linux distros ubuntu debian fedora with a few exceptions of windows xp

30742
debian	centos
stability will be the primary focus and after what i ve read either debian or centos seems to be the appropriate choice - after ruling rhel out for economical reasons

30742
debian	centos
is there anything that either centos or debian can offer us

30746
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
debian centos or ubuntu would be just fine- they can all be secured appropriately have active development and maintenance and are easily usable

30747
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian
there are solid distros around debian centos opensuse ubuntu fedora ... to chose from

30747
gentoo	linux
arch linux sabayon gentoo are great distributions but since they lack proper versioning it s very easy to get lost

30750
openbsd	freebsd
no for example freebsd uses csh openbsd uses ksh

30750
openbsd	netbsd
netbsd and openbsd communities are centered around development talk about new improvements etc

30750
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
due to really free licenses code can flow among the projects openbsd often patches their code following netbsd as their sources have a lot in common freebsd takes and integrates openbsd s packet filter etc

30750
freebsd	linux
use a freebsd as a desktop they support a lot of gpus you can use flash to some extent there s some compatibility with linux binaries

30750
openbsd	freebsd
the other bsds are hybrids or just slightly modified versions i find it better to stay close to the source of the software development use packet filter on openbsd configure yourself your desktop on freebsd ...

30750
unix	bsd
bsd is not about hating windows or other oss it s about liking unix

30754
wordpress	phpbb
i am running lamp with wordpress phpbb and couple other small web applications

30755
openbsd	netbsd
first of all you re right to dismiss the one-line explanations openbsd s motto is free functional and secure and the netbsd developers also strive to create a functional system

30755
freebsd	netbsd
binary compatibility you can apparently run freebsd binaries on netbsd which i ve never tried

30755
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
this is the only form of binary compat between the bsds i know of apart from netbsd s and freebsd s limited linux binary compatibility

30755
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
ports netbsd and dragonflybsd s ports use pkgsrc openbsd s are here freebsd s here

30755
minix	linux
pkgsrc stands out as it is made to be portable you can use it with minix 3 or linux too

30755
openbsd	netbsd
i don t agree with aki on the lack of support with openbsd or netbsd looking at the mailing lists both offer helpful communities -- have a look yourself -- being referred to a manpage is no offense

30755
openbsd	freebsd
undeadly.org for openbsd blogs.freebsdish.org for freebsd and planet.netbsd.se for all of them down at the moment

30767
uniq	grep
then you could show how lynx --dump --listonly gets the list of links how grep could filter for links ending in .pdf how colrm or sed could get rid of the numbers lynx writes left to each url how sort and uniq could get rid of duplicates and finally how wget -i - can be used to retrieve the files using --wait to be gentle on the server of course

30773
mp3	wav
using aplay -d plug hdmi1 soundfile.wav finally played a sound actually you should play a wav file cause aplay cannot decode mp3 or likewise

30774
chown	chmod
and it doesn t look like chown chmod have a --reference option in snow leopard

30796
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is a linux distribution closely based on ubuntu ubuntu

30797
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is a linux distribution based on ubuntu aiming to be more usable out-of-the-box

the subshell is convenient to not change ifs for the calling shell

30835
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian	opensuse	mint
to use these you need to apt-get install xclip debian ubuntu linux mint etc. or zypper in xclip opensuse other .rpm-based systems or some equivalent

solaris	bsd
for short no gnu linux solaris and bsd aren t virus-free

30839
freebsd	linux	unix	bsd
there have been rootkits targeting unix for years mac os x freebsd there s a book to learn how to write them very fun designing bsd rootkits gnu linux etc

30842

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
i know for a fact that live cd versions of distros like arch linux debian fedora gentoo linux salix ubuntu and on embedded distributions such as the openwrt and dd-wrt router firmware use squashfs

30862
ubuntu	debian
i am thinking of switching to debian squeeze from ubuntu 10.10

30869
ubuntu	debian
in theory debian will use the exact same package management system that ubuntu does

30869
ubuntu	debian
as a matter of fact most of the packaging is done by debian s developers and ubuntu will clone them often unmodified in their repository

30869
ubuntu	debian
dr debian is ubuntu s direct father

30887
hide	show
in previous versions of gnome the key combination ctrl + alt + d would hide all open windows and show the desktop

30888
folder	dir
restrict to a minimum the paths you allow apache php to write to - if there s a tmp dir the application needs to write to - allow it to write to that folder only - and for any writable locations if at all possible make sure it s outside the document root or take steps to ensure this writable path is not web-accessible

30890
rpm	yum
i could get rpm installed and tried to install yum but resolving those dependencies is a pain

30911
ubuntu	linux	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
i would say if you work on java and are new to linux get ubuntu with unity gnome or kde or even xfce

30911
ubuntu	debian
one major difference between the bsd camp debian ubuntu camp and fedora scientificlinux camp is the way packages are handled

30911
freebsd	linux	gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	linux
if you want a real system which is absolutely not dumbed down you may want arch linux gentoo or freebsd

30925
folder	directory
for instance i added a hidden folder .scripts in the home directory to my path by just adding a line to my .bashrc so anything executable in there automagically autocompletes

30934
ubuntu	debian
furthermore this program isn t available in the debian ubuntu repositories

30935
google-chrome	firefox
but even after a reboot when i use google-chrome or firefox the host name is not resolved to the ip i put in the file

30950
put	get
if you get too many functions or functions too big put them into separate files in a hidden directory and source them in your .bashrc

30969
folder	directory
this will extract the filenames from the errors warnings of exiftool and create a replica directory tree under the folder unprocessed with only those files

30975
hash	md5
while long considered obsolete for secure cryptographic hash md5 and md4 remain adequate for checking file corruption

30984
unix	bsd
but for instance on bsd linux and unix - section 3 is reserved for library functions particularly those in the standard c library

30984
unix	bsd
man page section list for bsd linux unix variants by way of wikipedia

30984
daemons	systemd
systemd administration commands and daemons

30997
debian	linux
the following is a list of exploit protection mechanisms that have been added to most of the major versions of linux debian being the notable exception

31024
ubuntu	debian
my question is if i wanted to do a minimal base command line installation of ubuntu 12.04 or debian testing currently wheezy which of these 2 is likely to be more stable over the next 5 years

31024
ubuntu	debian
5 years because ubuntu 12.04 will be supported for 5 years and debian testing is a rolling release afaik

31024
ubuntu	debian
i think ubuntu 12.04 will be more stable for various reasons even though it s based on debian testing but just wanted to find out from more knowledgeable people if ubuntu 12.04 really will be more stable compared to debian testing

31024
ubuntu	debian
so basically i want to start off with a minimal command line install of ubuntu 12.04 or debian testing and add a minimal xfce to it using -without-recommends and would like to know which of the 2 will be more stable as a desktop os not as a server os

31045
put	get
i found out that this was a quick way to get all files with a particular filename_suffix and put them in a dist folder

31063
filesystems	ntfs
afaik it works by filling a database from the ntfs journal it doesn t work with other filesystems

31064
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu releases are all stable to the same level there is an official release and you can choose to apply subsequent security updates only or major bug fixes only

31072
my.cnf	mysql.sock
both the my.cnf and php.ini read var lib mysql mysql.sock

31075
put	get
mysshkey is your private passwordless key it is not safe to put on remote servers or somewhere someone else could get a copy

31089
mouse	keyboard
i don t know about the mouse apart from unplugging of course but keyboard cleaner temporarily disables the keyboard

31129
versioning	upgrade
work with sysadmins to get some old versioning of whatever tool i m wanting installed likely never to be upgrade again

31168
debian	linux
it includes guidance on removal of weak services maintenance of security links to sans guidance etc. and while it is for general linux 90 of it will be absolutely appropriate for debian

31170
ubuntu	linux
because when i type uname -a on my linux box it shows i m running ubuntu

31175
apache	nginx
i have nginx running on port 80 and apache running on port 8080

31175
apache	nginx
i want to transfer all the traffic to both nginx and apache asynchronously i.e the performance of one server won t be dependent on the others

31175
apache	nginx
the reason being nginx will serve my website and apache will be used to run analytics on the traffic

31179
bash	zsh
there is a shell variable cdpath in bash and ksh and cdpath in zsh

31195
bash	zsh
i do not know if it works in zsh but it works in bash

31197
daemons	systemd
selinux is primarily used to confine systemd processes daemons as writing a usable yet usefully restrictive policy for programs used by users is difficult

31202
tunnel	vpn
i d recommend either using ssh with the -l option to tunnel in in a secure fashion or if you want to get fancy a vpn

31212
kde	gnome
however in gnome or kde it is possible to start yast as a normal user and then give a root password in a window to run yast as root

31221
ubuntu	debian
it is available of debian and ubuntu and included on a per-user basis in .bashrc or .zshrc by default

31252
ubuntu	linux
i am on linux ubuntu and i am would like to exclude certain directories like .hg when i am doing a

31259
jobs	cron
this will give you the number of scheduled cron jobs not the active cron jobs which could mean the jobs that are currently running

31277
opensuse	linux
i have an opensuse linux server and want to run an asp.net web project

31294
bash	subshell
considering the large amount of questions which turn out to be related to subshell in bash why doesn t my variable increment in this piped while read loop

31294
vim	jedit
bonus points if anyone implements it for jedit or vim

31305
stdout	stderr
is there any way to catch the stdout stderr of the last command with this command returning to the shell to be able to react according to its output

31331
hash	md5
i have a command that i run in a folder that outputs md5 hash and filenames on the terminal

31334
stdout	stderr
inputâ stdin â œstandard outputâ stdout and â œstandard errorâ stderr

31341
dpkg	apt
note that ubuntu starts services when you install them with dpkg or apt so if you do package installations in the chroot you should disable that

31342
bash	zsh
there are shells with better and more configurable line edition capabilities zsh and the more popular but less powerful bash

31342
bash	zsh
bindkey is a zsh command and bind is its bash equivalent

31347
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
if you are on debian based linux like ubuntu you can use consolechars from consoletools package

31370
gentoo	linux
alt + 0 works for me i m using gentoo linux

31395
mp3	ogg
most of them are mp3 or ogg each has size of 15 mb

31420
min	max
i am trying to find the difference between max and min

31443
ati	nvidia
in my case it is a nvidia geforce gtx 580 because i ve read that the drivers are better for nvida than for ati video cards

31452
udp	tcp
if you have a sufficiently â œbloatyâ netcat busybox can have one of two nc implementations one of which handles tcp only you can send a manually crafted udp packet to the broadcast address of the network segment that the device is connected to

31480
kde	gnome
i have kde and gnome

31551
debian	linux
on a linux debian box i have a nfs server wich seems to be overloaded by requests

31567
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in firefox google-chrome and even in lynx and it happens all the same

31638
chown	chgrp
or step 4 could be a normal copy and step 5 a clever find that would chown and chgrp recursively

31640
jobs	cron
cron automatically emails you the output if any of the jobs it runs

31646
chown	chgrp
i don t know any --magic_uid_options for the cp command and you don t need to be clever for doing recursive chown or chgrp

31648
sudoers	visudo
run visudo to add this line to the sudoers file

31663
translation	transliteration
tr abbreviated from translation or transliteration is a command in unix-like operating systems

31666
punctuation	words
the gnu coreutils manual gives some example applications such as collapsing multiple newlines into one tr -s n or putting each words on its own line while removing punctuation at the same time

31674
put	get
put in a stub function just to get top level flow of control correct

31705
solaris	aix
i m being considered for a new linux server engineer position but i m told by an insider that there is a little solaris and aix in-house

31705
solaris	aix
i don t get too wound up on the differences for me it s akin to the different windshield wipers and cruise control buttons in different cars but i have little experience with solaris none with aix

31705
solaris	aix
is there a solaris way or an aix way

31711
jobs	cron
personally i use esmtp a program that emulates sendmail and procmail a mail delivery agent in this way i can get messages from cron jobs

31726
folder	directory
under each of the other directory applications live in their own folder so for example you might have this kind of path

31735
wordpress	joomla
unfortunately selinux is preventing websites from accessing outbound sites such as download.wordpress.com to update wordpress or joomla installation

31747
daemon	cron
the cron daemon determines where your active crontab is stored

31761
unix	bsd
i would say that no good practices for file extensions exist strictly on a technicality unix linux bsd file systems don t support extensions per se

31762
bash	tcsh
i personnaly use the following conventions regardless of the shell used csh tcsh bash sh ...

31782
freebsd	linux
according to tests with screen on both linux and freebsd only .bashrc is sourced

31787
freebsd	linux	freebsd	centos	centos	linux
i have a server which hosts mirrors for freebsd centos and scientific linux

31800
bash	subshell
in your example the instance of bash that is running your script will fork off 2 subshell one for and another for the while read .

31804
zsh	subshell	bash	zsh	bash	subshell
the right-hand side of a pipeline runs in its own subshell in bash as well as most other shells the exceptions being att ksh and zsh

31805
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
under linux freebsd netbsd and osx you can use find s build-in -delete action and the -empty predicate equivalent to -size 0 on regular files

31812
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	mamp	wamp
xampp comes in different versions according to the platform lamp for linux wamp for windows mamp on macos ... there are also versions running on solaris samp and freebsd famp

31832
stdout	fflush
it look like the fault unfortunately lies in the daemon which does not fflush it s stdout after writing the log data

31844
tablet	galaxy
i love samsung devices i have a samsung series 9 laptop galaxy nexus phone sch-i515 and a galaxy tab 8.9 gt-p7310 tablet

31847
stdout	stderr
when the job is done the current prompt and input buffer will be removed and the entirety of the command s stdout and stderr will be printed

31870
sudoers	visudo
if you need to have a user with privileges to run stuff as root you will need to add that user to etc sudoers file via command visudo

31884
stdout	stderr
file descriptors stdout stderr stdin are unaffected

31884
bash	zsh
in some shells bash zsh you can prevent this by using the command disown which will tell the shell to not send it sighup on shell closing and the process will continue to run

31884
stdout	stderr
nohup also checks to see where stdout is going and if its going to the terminal it redirects stdout and stderr to a file

31884
stdout	stderr
setsid does not much with stdout stderr and i tend to use setsid instead of nohup

31895
dpkg	apt
as for apt-get not being able to remove it because you installed from the .bin file the install is not tracked by the package management system apt dpkg thus apt-get will not solve your problem

31902
put	get
if you cannot get anything recovered and you just want to try to put it back into a usuable state follow the dd advice from renan

31904
xfce	gnome
apparently there is no gui in xfce as there was in gnome to synchronize time with ntp if there is one please let me know the name of the application

31910
spaces	delimiter
if your file is not tab delimiter but nicely delimiter by spaces you can do

31921
daemons	launchd
i have launchd iperf in daemons mode with iperf -s -d and now i want to stop the service

31921
daemons	launchd
as it is not launchd by linux i cannot find it through service as other daemons

31952
lisp	scheme
scheme is a popular dialect of the lisp programming language

31958
freebsd	debian
on debian or freebsd if it matters any other os specific solutions are also welcome

31979
jobs	cron
this has also caused a few times one of my cron jobs to block which almost crashed the server because it had hundreds of blocked processes

31985
spaces	delimiter
in the case you ve been careful and you ve listed files one per line to avoid problems with spaces in filenames then just add a -d delimiter option

31997
centos	linux
centos is derived entirely from the red hat enterprise linux rhel distribution more here

32004
centos	linux
centos is a linux variant and therefore shares no code with at t unix system v

32015
stdout	stderr
show only stderr on screen but write both stdout and stderr to file

32015
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr and logging using the script command

32017
ubuntu	debian
i ve tested this with redhat and ubuntu at work and debian at home all with tcsh and none of them supports this imo nice behavior

32025
google-chrome	firefox
i have a mouse with forward back buttons which work correctly in firefox google-chrome etc.

32031
ubuntu	debian
for example under debian ubuntu

32038
unix	bsd
bsd is what you get when a bunch of unix hackers sit down to try to

32038
unix	bsd
written by dave tyson this article describes the history of many unix variants including of course bsd and linux

32053
stdout	stderr
script is used for applications which access the tty directly and dont use stdout stderr

32071
versioning	upgrade
there is no need to upgrade since you can install everything that the dvd versioning has

32081
ubuntu	debian
curiosity so if you think about ubuntu s repo approach it is totally wrong considering debian s

32081
ubuntu	debian
and one should consider debian s approach as ubuntu is a debian based distro

32082
putty	winscp
exclude i use winscp at to log in as it has a built-in modified notepad editor along with putty for ssh access.

32111
cpu	processors
now how come top says it s using 100 of the cpu 400 4 cores while exactly half of the processors are idle

32118
kde	gnome
i run vanilla x11 fvwm with no gnome kde etc

32129
vim	emacs	vim	geany	geany	kdevelop
there is not a default ide most people use their favorite editor vim emacs geany etc... and there are ides like eclipse or kdevelop available

32130
versioning	upgrade
how do i tell pacman to always use my custom compilation settings so i donâ t have to manually upgrade every time a new versioning is released

32144
inittab	fstab
i have a working chroot environment inittab fstab init.d rcs set up a kernel and grub2 installed

32144
inittab	fstab
i also set up inittab fstab init.d rcs and most of the other filesystem related stuff as directed in the article although i didn t do anything on the second page related to genfromfs and syslinux because i figured i wasn t making a bootable floppy

32144
post	get
to figure out how to get my chroot system to boot i found this post and i ran

32169
queue	fifo
if you actually do this it s better to setup the fifo in the monitor and pass the path to both the queue and the workers so they are not coupled and not stuck to a specific location for the fifo

32178
kde	gnome
i d tried it in 2-3 major distros with gnome 2 and changing the assigned key didn t help but when i tried with kde 4 in simplymepis and set it to use capslock it started working just fine

32193
chown	chmod
but until reboot you have to chmod chown manually

32198
processors	hyperthreading
to expand upon max s answer processors with hyperthreading report two cores to the operating system when there is really a single physical core

32206
mouse	keyboard
instead of clicking the speaker icon in the topbar the reason i want need to do this is because my keyboard does not have a volume increase decrease buttons and i find it annoying to reach for the mouse

32211
bash	zsh
it is important to note that is not supported by all posix shells however many shells do support it such as zsh and ksh in addition to bash

32223
children	parent
environmental variable changes apply to the current process and any subsequent children but not to parent processes

32227
bash	zsh
double brackets were first introduced in ksh and are only available in ksh bash and zsh

32229
sudoers	visudo
run visudo and add something like this to the sudoers file

32261
filesystems	fat
they don t work on files residing on other filesystems reiserfs fat

32286
jobs	cron
there is logrotate which cleans var log regularly by using cron jobs

32286
ubuntu	debian
it is normally installed automatically at least in debian and its derivatives like ubuntu

32287
internationalization	localization
i18n l10n quoting internationalization and localization

32309
ubuntu	opensuse
i want to migrate from ubuntu to opensuse and i need to decide between the 32bit and the 64bit versions

32309
opensuse	linux
how much of the software library of opensuse linux in general

32312
ati	nvidia
maybe if you have any hardware which requires proprietary drivers - and even then most of those drivers nvidia ati have 64-bit versions

32319
vpn	lan
i would like to create a dedicated physical server which will work as a nas fileserver inside my lan as well as through vpn

32319
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
in particular zfs seems to be a far superior filesystems than any other in the unix linux world for instance ext4 xfs as well as btrfs considering the integration of raid z and checksumming

32319
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
i never got outside my linux world so i don t have experiences with freebsd or the solaris derivatives

32319
freebsd	solaris
i asked in another post on superuser and they suggested freebsd solaris es because of zfs though we did not talk about encryption

32339
centos	linux
take a look at extra packages for enterprise linux and rpmforge also at the centos wiki entry on repositories

32353
wan	lan
computer on lan but also make sure apache isn t reachable from wan

32357
centos	linux
fedora rhel and centos are rpm-based linux distros

32360
udp	tcp
for services which are using tcp for udp services you can use

32377
ubuntu	debian
in debian and ubuntu packages the version is specified in the debian changelog file and it is designed so that all packages generated by a source package have the exact same version

32387
ubuntu	debian
when you have a pppoe connection you can do it in the etc network interfaces via debian or ubuntu way like

32396
bash	zsh
how to quote special characters in bash or zsh

32396
bash	zsh
bash and zsh have a pattern replacement feature which can be faster if the string is not very long

32396
bash	zsh
ksh s string replacement construct is more powerful than the watered-down version in bash and zsh

32411
mp4	webm
the following converted a test mp4 to webm vp8

32427
freebsd	linux
i recommend you actually test both solutions freebsd and linux and decide based on sys admin time and performance which makes sense for you

32430
unix	bsd
in the early days bsd was a distribution of changes to unix extra features and ports to new platforms

32430
unix	bsd
eventually someone decided to distribute a complete package of bsd derived from unix called 386bsd

32430
freebsd	netbsd
things happened and netbsd and freebsd were born

32430
freebsd	netbsd	unix	bsd
most but not all original unix code was removed and rewritten by the bsd folks at freebsd and netbsd

32430
unix	solaris
there are many modern unix variants derived from it including solaris sco unixware formerly microsoft xenix etc

32430
unix	aix
mac os x aix and other things some people don t consider unix are certified

32454
kde	gnome
i was wondering if it d be possible to have a web browser say google chrome run on this machine without having to insall the whole gnome or kde environment

32457
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
what it does rely on at least in case of graphical-mode browsers like google-chrome opera or firefox is the xorg server together with its libraries 1

32458
google-chrome	firefox
then from a shell you can start either google-chrome or firefox

32464
ubuntu	linux
will a standard fresh linux ubuntu 11.10 to be exact install and drive re-format full successfully trim my ssd or do i need to do something extra

32481
debian	linux
to find all installed linux kernel images in debian use

32521
ssd	sata
3 - i ve put my ssd on the first sata channel and let the hdd on the second i removed my second hdd i had enough space without it anyway

32541
debian	linux
i have a debian linux system amd64 installed on a raid-1 system encrypted device lvm on luks and will have a raid-6 of 4 disks where i ll put my data luks and maybe lvm

32576
bash	subshell
in bash you have this handy variable bashpid wich always returns the currently running subshell s pid

32577
bash	zsh
instead of forking a new shell instance for every program you want to launch modern shells bash zsh ksh ... will have the ability to manage a list of programs or jobs

32618
bash	zsh
note that is a ksh also supported by bash and zsh way to make a newline char so adjust as needed if you are using another shell

32640
ubuntu	linux
so from the perspective of installing linux most linux installers will offer you the chance to alter partitions via something like gparted i think the ubuntu fedora installers hide this under a custom option and then decide where you want to mount them - that is what folder in the vfs tree that partition will store data for

32644
umask	chmod
note that you can set the umask and run chmod from the client side with site commands

32660
freebsd	centos
i ve been tasked with installing freebsd 8 alongside centos 6 without the luxury of removable media

32714
ubuntu	linux
use ubuntu + native zfs for linux ppa

32751
ubuntu	debian
this often results in sensors being able to report various temperature and voltage readings and the fancontrol script packaged separately in debian ubuntu can be configured to manipulate the fan speed in response to the temperature readings

32761
gtk	cairo
i tried printing the djvu file to pdf using evince so it s probably a mix of djvulibre gtk and cairo but i got a way smaller result by converting the djvu pages to pdf using imagemagick s convert

32770
debian-based	ubuntu
you don t need to do that nor you should use rpm packages in a debian-based distribution like ubuntu

32779
freebsd	linux
i strongly recommend reading the linux + freebsd howto for information about bsd and linux partitions before doing anything else

32786
bash	zsh
in ksh bash or zsh

32824
switching	screens
in my ubuntu i can t switching to console through ctrl + alt + fx using my own compiled kernel and a black screens appears

32832
google-chrome	firefox
current versions of firefox and google-chrome can encrypt your password list behind a master password but pidgin does not currently have that facility -- and given that it s open source and i don t think most of its users are amenable to entering even a single master password every time they start the program it s not likely to get it in the near future

32845
centos	linux
whether this is a bug in current tar gnu tar 1.23 on a centos 6.2 linux 2.6.32 or extreme sensitivity of tar to whitespaces and other easy-to-miss typos i consider this a bug

32857
pthreads	fork	freebsd	linux
modern fork is copy-on-write for children on pthreads in general but linux and freebsd specifically and i m assuming osx by extrapolation

32857
disk	ram
solaris facts and myths about swap - states virtual memory today consists of the sum total of physical ram and swap space on disk

32869
chown	sudo
alternatively you could allow sudo chown while not allowing sudo to be used for other commands

32877
disk	ram
don t confuse the swap as a disk area and to swap as a method to move memory pages from ram to disk and reciprocally

32877
disk	ram
on systems like solaris that do not overcommit memory i.e that make sure a memory reservation is always backed by virtual memory whether in ram or on disk having a sufficient swap area is absolutely necessary otherwise a potentially significant part of the ram will be wasted

32884
kde	gnome
this is a reasonable case perhaps the user used gnome kde s switch user functionality or ran two servers using startx . an example application that might want to follow the active x server is x11vnc which is forked from the software i m developing

32899
debian	linux
one internal boots gnu linux debian

32901
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu and have downloaded linux 3.2.7 from kernel.org

i am using ubuntu and have downloaded linux 3.2.7 from kernel.org

32940
unix	bsd
everything about comparing unix variants like linux distributions bsd family and others

32946
ubuntu	linux
is there a better way i can accomplish this that is both compact and still portable on both my oses linux ubuntu 11.10 and cygwin under windows7 32bit

32975
stdout	stderr
i have a shell script that s happily doing all my backup process and writing progress to stderr and stdout with one exception â the last line doesn t get written to my terminal if i call the script manually until i hit enter

32975
stdout	stderr
caveats fwiw when this script is run from cron with stdout and stderr redirected to append to logfiles everything gets written to the logfiles quite happily with no terminal input required

32976
debian	linux
therefore i was thinking about doing the old switcheroo to a linux os probably debian

32976
ubuntu	debian
trying some stuff out in virtualbox i noticed the correct keymap for my keyboard isn t available on ubuntu or debian

32992
screens	tablet
there seems to be a problem in the products hardware architecture as the trackpoint is moving when you convert the thinkpad into tablet mode and put pressure on the screens

33030
queue	fifo
addendum some sort of fifo queue might be the answer to this as well

33047
titlebar	window
if i place the mouse over the titlebar of a window and roll the mouse-wheel the window will become shaded

33053
mouse	keyboard
can be controlled by just the keyboard mouse optional

33061
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu and derivatives if you enter man rename at a command prompt you ll get the manual page for a rename utility that allows arbitrary perl-like regular expression commands to be used in the renaming

33072
put	get
to get xargs to put the names in the middle you need to add where is what you want to be replaced with the argument in this case you d use

33089
freebsd	netbsd
ported to netbsd freebsd and mac os

33089
freebsd	netbsd
ipfilter netbsd freebsd

33106
solaris	aix
i am not sure about aix but solaris for example doesn t even use sysvinit instead it uses smf

33106
debian	centos
centos rhel typically uses etc rc.d functions to assist with common functions for init script while debian uses a binary called start-stop-daemon

33117
http-proxy	polipo
since you only want to get the domains accessed via http you could setup up a transparent http-proxy with polipo or privoxy and evaluate the log file

33125
bash	zsh
or use zsh instead of bash

33141
versioning	upgrade
that way running is going to upgrade all installed packages to their squeeze versioning

33152
cifs	smb
you will have the exact list of mounted smb filesystem that is cifs type

33152
freebsd	linux
this option is available at least on linux and freebsd

33178
disk	ram
if you had more ram then you would have a bigger disk cache and therefore less disk io

33179
mouse	trackpad
for the trackpad it recognize 1 2 and 3 fingers gestures so you can scroll with 2 finger or right click and you can simulate mouse middle-click with 3 fingers

33203
cpu	hyperthreading
the cpu in my workstation is an i7 with hyperthreading enabled and cat proc cpuinfo produces 4 cpu s

33210
bash	zsh
would work in bash zsh

33211
ready	each
an idle computer has a load number of 0 and each process using or waiting for cpu the ready queue or run queue increments the load number by 1

33226
stdout	stderr
forever generates three logfiles the server stdout stderr and the log of forever itself

33263
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu and derivatives use rename.ul instead of rename rename is a different file renaming command on those distributions

33268
debian	linux
so i know the how-to is for a different distribution of linux but it seems that i should be able to get this running in debian if they could in their crazy distro

33270
folder	directory
it s possible to be able to access a folder starting from the current directory that you can t access starting from the root directory

33325
bluetooth	usb
just when i remove the bluetooth dongle from my usb port the system returns to the normal state saying agent-released

33326
folder	directory
so this creates a bin folder in my home directory which is what i expected

33330
filesystems	fat
if i format it back to any other windows based filesystems such as fat i am able to both read and write

33337
ubuntu	linux
i had the same problem on ubuntu linux 11.10 until i updated parallels parallels desktop- check for updates and reinstalled parallel tools on the ubuntu virtual machine

33343
udp	tcp
if i run rpcinfo on it i only find two rpc servers the tcp and udp versions of rpcbind

33352
wordpress	joomla
if you are running a standard cms with php like drupal joomla wordpress then make sure it stays up to date with the latest security patches

33358
daemons	systemd
if they differ hwclock will set the systemd clock incorrectly during systemd initialization and later the ntp daemons will fix the systemd clock when it notices your systemd time is off by the number of hours your local timezone is away from utc

33358
gentoo	linux
i m not familiar with how gentoo configuration works but on some other linux distros you would edit etc sysconfig clock and set or depending on whether your hardware clock was set to utc or not

33360
bash	zsh
i just decided to give zsh a go against bash and came across some unhandy behaviour about which i couldn t find anything on the net

33360
bash	zsh
my idea to achieve the bash behaviour in zsh would have been to detect whether a ls output will be piped into grep and define something like an alias for such cases

33360
ubuntu	debian
i ve been able to reproduce that on ubuntu 11.10 with zsh 4.3.11 and gnu coreutils 8.5 as well as on a debian squeeze machine with zsh 4.3.10

33363
bash	zsh
in all of my tests using zsh version 4.3.15 on linux and zsh 4.3.11 on os x ls behaves the same way under zsh as it does under bash

33376
debian	linux
i am trying to set up a pxe boot server on a debian 6.0.3 squeeze machine that gives images of plop linux

33383
kde	gnome
when i launch an application from terminal related to the window system for example gnome or kde then usually these applications send all sorts of junk messages in my terminal

33384
stdout	stderr
you can send the stdout and stderr of the program to the dummy device dev null

33405
mouse	keyboard
daemon a runs in the chroot and detects whether i make keyboard or mouse inputs in arch

33421
fortran	ada
gnu compiler collection or formerly gnu c compiler is a suite of compiler tools for various programming languages like c c++ objective-c java ada fortran and go

33426
ubuntu	debian
your problem is that you ve tried to mix ubuntu packages on your debian system

33426
ubuntu	debian
if you don t then don t try to install ubuntu packages on debian

33427
opensuse	linux
when i try to install software in the gnome environment of linux mine is opensuse from a repository that i have not used before packagekit asks me to respond yes or cancel to a dialog software signature is required

33443
rpm	yum	dpkg	apt
when the software signature is required dialog appears always say no. then initiate installation using a command-line installation tool instead such as yum rpm apt or dpkg

33454
processors	hyperthreading
notes added on july 8 2014 as riccardo murri pointed out my answer below only shows whether the processors reports to support hyperthreading

33455
gentoo	ubuntu
i believe ubuntu now uses grub 2 so another example from the gentoo wiki is in place to show how it can be done

33456
rss	feed
i want to to download some subtitle files stored in rar files form the site provides rss feed for its new releases

33486
folder	directory
is there a way to do this how can i copy a subset of files from a directory while preserving the folder structure

33490
debian	linux
the ones debian gnu linux provides in usr share opendict dictionaries are from freedict also see here and here for tarballs

33492
ethernet	wireless
this laptop uses an ethernet connection to connect to the internet and acts as a wireless access point for my workplace s wifi devices

33492
ethernet	wireless
after installing some software and reconnecting my ethernet elsewhere my em1 device is no longer present and wireless connected devices can no longer reach the internet

33516
daemons	systemd
the real question is if the java implementation has all the systemd calls to make it into a proper daemons process for example signal processing session process group handling etc.

33519
cinnamon	gnome	gentoo	linux
if it matters i am using gnome 3 cinnamon on gentoo linux

33580
bash	zsh
or in bash or zsh

33592
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m playing around with linux mint debian edition lmde in a virtualbox instance to try it out and see if it d be good for a main operating system for me

33592
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i m pretty competent with most system administration and i d like to have something like lmde which is based on debian testing so i can have a much more living up to date operating system than ubuntu linux mint which is what i ve historically run in the past

33598
udp	tcp
i don t know if http plain tcp or udp or what is used but tend to suppose http

33601
versioning	upgrade
but if you mix versioning from different distributions a clear upgrade path is not guaranteed

33602
versioning	upgrade
after that you have only 1 versioning of this package on your system you should be able to upgrade

33627
udp	tcp
these are the application opening a tcp or udp connection

33641
bash	tcsh
if you re going to be writing a lot of scripts you should consider using sh or bash rather than csh or tcsh

33649
hash	md5
the script depends on find and md5 but the latter can be replaced with sha1 sum or any other file hashing program that accepts input on stdin and outputs a hash on stdout

33674
int	double
there are lots of ways of storing numbers - ascii which can have locale specific variants such as using to separate fractions part or as a thousands grouping binary int variable number of bits float double all of which may vary depending on endian architecture and whether software producing the file formalises the representation bcd uncompressed packed fixed point and other variants bi-quinary coded decimal .

33676
daemons	systemd
probably you just need to edit the minidlna start script it will be located at etc init.d if it is a daemons to use the systemd s var run rather than creating a run symlink

33690
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu have a package called bootcd whose description seems to answer your question though i never used it

33691
rpm	yum
if not you may need to use a different package manager like yum nowadays red hat centos etc. portage entropy rpm etc

33722
cydia	tweak
also if you are wondering why i don t just get a cydia tweak that does this i despise mobile substrate

33733
mouse	keyboard
by setting the shotcut key it is literally means the the key on your keyboard not including your mouse

33753
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	opensolaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd	opensolaris	openbsd	opensolaris	netbsd
the best known examples are opensolaris freebsd netbsd and openbsd

33754
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
commercial unix solaris aix hp-ux have usually taken the pain to go through the certification process

33756
bsd	aix
my first problem is that it should be absolutely portable between nix systems especially linux bsd later other systems say aix

33764
redhat	fedora
redhat fedora requires a package+service called gpm to be installed running. that said each highlight + middle click clipboard is local to its tty you can t highlight and paste between different virt consoles and or x

33764
mouse	keyboard
one is reachable with the keyboard the other is with the mouse

33798
ubuntu	mint
since mint is based on ubuntu and ubuntu has switched to upstart the upstart cookbook has all of the info for having a service start on boot or at any specified runlevel

33815
stdout	stderr
however when you execute them as in the below example redirecting stdout to dev null and stderr to stdout as well as putting the job in the background they re not killed when you log out

33828
debian	mint	debian	linux
i ve recently installed linux mint 12 lisa not the kde or debian version on a zotac mini-pc which has an amd video card

33828
xfce	gnome
almost immediately after this i decided to use xfce 4.8 instead of gnome so i found a build install script to grab everything it needs and install it

33828
width	height
i also occasionally see a video stutter as if the terminal is trying to stay at the height and width it was at is but is being forced to shrink

33828
xfce	gnome
i suspect it might be an issue with gtk 2.x which i believe xfce 4.8 uses and gnome 3 which uses gtk 3 but why would these processes be running at the same time if i m not currently in a gnome session

33835
perl	tcl	tcl	racket
in addition to vimscript vim can be scripted via lua perl python racket ruby and tcl

33838
cpu	processors
processors current speed max speed family manufacturer version no of cpu s

33879
daemon	cron
the cron daemon runs with a defined timezone

33880

it appears that there s no universal way to tell cron to schedule jobs in a specified per-user or per-job time zone

33889
folder	dir
i mannually installed phpmyadmin according to this doc quick install .but i keep getting the 403 error i can successfully get into other folder in the root dir how can i sovle this

but what about hash empty strings as passwords crypt

33901
debian	mint	debian	linux
etc lsb-base yields the distribution as debian linux mint xfce edition

33903
debian	mint	debian	linux
and etc lsb-base yields the distribution as debian linux mint xfce edition

33945
folder	directory
so .config is a hidden folder within your home directory

33967
munin	logrotate
how do i get logrotate to work again with munin

33982
udp	tcp
if you re trying to contact the same server as an existing client and not tack onto an existing conversation there is already a way to do that contact the server in the same way open a socket on the filesystem or to a tcp or udp port

34004
terminate	timeout
i want to terminate the client- and server-side of that connection after a certain timeout after the connection drops

34027
kde	gnome
while i don t think it s gui specific this happens both in gnome and kde

34028
rpm	yum
this tells you that the package repositories that yum knows about don t contain the required rpms rpm package manager files to install git

34041
hfs+	ntfs
fat12 fat16 fat32 hfs hfs+ iso9660 jfs minix fs nilfs2 ntfs

34060
bash	zsh
here is a draft of a bash zsh script that prints everything you want

34112
ubuntu	debian
under debian ubuntu and derivatives rename is a different file renaming program which is based on a perl expression

34125
yacc	bison
you need to build bash with a better bison yacc on your host

34125
yacc	bison
bash uses yacc grammar rules and only bison will generate the correct parsing code for the bash build

34145
ubuntu	linux
my linux box was ubuntu 6.04 with ext3 fs

34148
unix	bsd
systems such as gnu linux and bsd which look and behave like unix but are not actually certified as unix are called unix-like

34152
switching	screens
is there a way to disable the switching user option from a locked screens on fedora 15

34157
sudo	passwd
if i put sudo before command then when i run script i see permission denied i don t have a chance to write passwd

34157
sudo	passwd
if i put sudo su in the beginning of the script then after i inter passwd nothing happens

34160
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you can set a script to not require a passwd via sudo with the following in etc sudoers

openbsd and freebsd is licensed under the bsd license which says

34230
vlan	packets
when you add a vlan to a device that is already a virtual vlan interface you get a qinq interface this means that packets will eggress with dual vlan taggs or vlan stacking.this is technically possible because a vlan packets can transport another vlan packets inside

34238
pull	push
i wrote two functions push and pull to copy files to and from a directory

34266

is it possible to start applications with limited ram and swap avaliable to them without creating a separate user and not installing any special apps - having just a default debian centos server configuration and not using sudo

34336
redhat	fedora
by default at least on fedora and other redhat derivitives vim-enhanced is installed and it adds a file etc profile.d vim.sh

34340
ubuntu	debian
i have a pc with ubuntu 11.04 and a debian squeeze chroot installed in it

34359
openbsd	freebsd
it is the same process as with freebsd but you might find openbsd s documentation clearer and easier to follow

34359
openbsd	freebsd
if you re not committed to freebsd at this point you may want to just try out openbsd first

34373
disk	ram

how to edit ram disk images

34391
xfce	kde
however now dcop is obsolete and since i moved from kde 3.5.10 to xfce i thought it would be a good idea that instead converting my script from kdialog+dcop to kdialog+dbus i migrate to xfce progress dialog

34392
openbsd	linux
os openbsd linux

34398
folder	directory
vim as a command vim file doesn t trigger any correction but vim in sudo vim is an argument zsh sees that it s close to the name of a folder in the current directory and asks if you want to change to that as files and folder are more common arguments

34406
ubuntu	debian
generally though the redhat concept of runlevels isn t used on debian or derivatives including ubuntu

34426
debian	linux
crunchbang is a linux distribution based upon debian and aimed at providing speed by using lightweight applications while being stylish

34428
vmware	virtualbox
is virtualbox or vmware taking advantage of it

34428
vmware	virtualbox
how much performance increase can it bring when i use virtualbox or vmware

34430
pci	iommu
agp and certain pci express cards are not supported at the moment if they rely on gart graphics address remapping table unit programming for texture management as it does rather nontrivial operations with pages remapping interfering with iommu

34430
pci	iommu
even if your hardware doesn t have a iommu certain pci cards may work such as serial pci adapters but the guest will show a warning on boot and the vm execution will terminate if the guest driver will attempt to enable card bus mastering

34622
debian	linux
i m trying to install linux test project ltp on debian 6.0.2 kernel 2.6.33.20

34638
freebsd	debian	tcsh	dash
i have read many articles that say the official shell in freebsd is tcsh and in debian its dash

34638
freebsd	debian
however when i either freebsd or env in debian it says that the shell is csh in the first case or bash in debian

34638
freebsd	debian
i want to learn two shells one for debian and one for freebsd but i can t find which one i should learn since its not clear which one is the official shell

34638
freebsd	debian
i m using the latest debian and freebsd versions

34644
freebsd	debian
both debian and freebsd provide a number of different shells and most or all of them are available on both either preinstalled or easily installable

34644
bash	tcsh
it s not uncommon for bin csh to really be tcsh or for bin sh to be bash or ksh

34644
bash	tcsh
update a few years later i ve since abandoned tcsh and i now use bash interactively.

34644
freebsd	debian
my advice would be to pick a single shell and learn it well using it on both freebsd and debian

34644
bash	zsh
ksh is probably about as powerful as bash and zsh is even more powerful and has a lot of features i ve never taken the time to learn

34644
freebsd	debian
i suggest bash for both freebsd and debian and for any other unix-like systems you might use and for both interactive use and scripting

34654
ubuntu	linux
i want to compile a c++ program in arch linux but there s no g++ package as there is in ubuntu repositories for example

34659
g++	gcc
g++ is only a wrapper that calls gcc

34659
g++	gcc
g++ is installed with the gcc package in arch

34669
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
which linux distribution do you recommend for such a use-case considering i m not an expert at any unix-like os a week of experience with centos some experience with ubuntu

34669
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
mint - popular based on ubuntu and debian

34669
ubuntu	centos
edit i have a lot of people recommending ubuntu over centos 1 2 for serverside apps

34703
ati	nvidia
just as a side note you may spare yourself a lot of future pain by avoiding ati and nvidia altogether if possible performance-wise

34734
vim	emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate	macvim	emacs	macvim	textmate
i was just curious if there s a way to get input not from stdin but from - be it vim nano emacs or even a non-command-line-editor macvim textmate

34748
stdout	stderr
in the case you need to test if a feature is also included in busyboxâ s wget you need to know that is does not support --version and prints instead its --help to stderr not stdout as gnuâ s wget

34775
cifs	smb
samba is an implementation of smb server message block which if wikipedia is to be trusted got its name changed to cifs common internet file system back in 1996 so directly answering your question samba is an implementation cifs is a protocol but i guess you were asking about smb and cifs which seem to be the same protocol although i guess you can say cifs is a newer version of smb

34793
cifs	smb
smb was the predecessor to cifs

34793
cifs	smb
smb server message block and cifs common internet file system are protocols

34793
cifs	smb
typically you will see it referred to smb cifs

34793
cifs	smb
however cifs is the extension of the smb protocol so if someone is sharing out smb via samba to a legacy system still using netbios it will typically connect to the samba server via port 137 138 139 and cifs is strictly port 445

34793
cifs	smb
the time when you might use smb over cifs is if you are providing access to windows 2k systems or earlier or you just want to connect to port 139 instead of 445

34795
disk	ram
my understanding of how linux manages memory is that it will store disk usage in ram so that each subsequent access is quicker

34816
sudo	passwd
if a user doesn t have sudo rights to run usr bin truecrypt then truecrypt fails after prompting for the administrator user passwd

34835
disk	ram
this will make sure you are testing the disk and not cached pages of ram this will flush the cache

34852
opensuse	linux
i ran bitchx on three different linux os-es because i got this weird ï ½ question mark on two of them linux opensuse 11.4 and backtrack 5 r1 using yakuake konsole opensuse and terminator tilda bt 5 r1

put	get
now how can someone can get the effect of windows where at a certain part of hard drive a user can put his her data and when reinstalling the unix linux system reclaim that data

34859
folder	directory
linux directory or folder structure

it will search for the ability to install in a descending fashion typically defaulting to yum and falling back to rpm

34894
opensuse	linux
even today sles suse linux enterprise is free as well as opensuse

34897
sudoers	visudo
typically one edits the sudoers file using the command visudo

ftp	telnet
but for that you have to host some kind of server telnet ssh ftp or any other kind of server on windows machine and you should have the corresponding client on the linux

34937
cifs	smb
you can create shares on the windows machine and use smb cifs to connect to the share

34957
ubuntu	linux
for ubuntu linux we have the solution as

34962
g++	gcc
now the goal is to make the new compiler the default while also keeping the old one around no uninstall i want to be able to do gcc a.c or g++ a.cpp directly in the terminal window

34976
copying	overwrite
add that to the fact that i can run multiple ssh copy actions at once and copying to a local usb hard drive is left in the dust as it only copies one file at a time and overwrite the entire file every time

34992
x86	64bit
is this limit loosened by 64bit x86 linux kernels

35004
debian	mint	debian	linux
i installed firefox on linux mint debian edition with the cinnamon desktop

35004
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this eyeball icon is so visually unappealing that if i can t change it i ll uninstall firefox and use opera or google-chrome instead

35021
kde	gnome
i know that xterm inside fvwm2 running on slackware does this but neither gnome or kde does it

35029
bash	tcsh
for historic reasons all of the aliases and shortcuts i want to port from an old computer are in tcsh and i don t really feel up to learning how to do the same in bash

35055
google-chrome	firefox
but using the current version you have maybe it is worth a shot trying some instructions to replace the bundled icons here the icons are under usr lib firefox google-chrome icons default

35056
freebsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
i once ran openbsd freebsd and linux on the same disk with the same home filesystem shared between all three

35057
mouse	keyboard	mouse	trackpad
even then i suspect that moving your hand off the keyboard moving a mouse using a trackpad then moving back to the keyboard is slower than meta - b or ctrl - a

35066
kde	gnome
kde gnome based distros i try to set a 40gb root partition because there are lots of widgets and add-ons available so its good to provide some disk space overhead for those

35116
ubuntu	linux
i want to know does any other linux disto offer anything close to ubuntu software centre

35116
opensuse	linux
so has any other linux distro got it better than fedora and opensuse

35118
ubuntu	debian
this time i am hoping to obtain something that can easily evolve into something similar to a typical debian ubuntu or other full blown apt-get based distro through repository settings and a sequence of apt-get commands

35162
debian	mint
afaik mint is from debian family so likely gcc is installed in separate packages and usr bin gcc is only symlink

35162
g++	gcc
even if you don t package gcc-4.7 properly you can install it into designated path opt gcc47 and then change symlink set gcc cpp g++ to point to your installed version

35176
centos	linux
linux is centos 6.2 kernel 2.6.32-220

35190
rpm	yum	rpm	zypper	zypper	yum
rpm yum apt-get zypper +many more

35221
stdout	stderr
it means redirect file descriptor 2 stderr to whatever file descriptor 1 stdout is. because you already redirected stdout to the file stderr will end up in there as well

35264
folder	directory
you tried to check if the permissions are okay for the webserver to read the folder but what the error message is saying is not unable to read directory ... it is saying it cannot deliver a directory index as a response because that is currently not allowed under the current server configuration

35265
symlink	realpath
you can use realpath -s instead if you want to follow paths up by name foo bar will go up to foo even if bar is a symlink - however that requires installing realpath which isn t installed by default on most platforms

35307
move	drag
i can still alt + drag to move the window and see the top bar

35308
daemons	systemd
if you re running rsync as a daemons on the remote systemd instead it needs to run as root

35312
postgresql	mysql
is there a way to find all postgresql and mysql databases on my system

35338
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i know for su i need to know the root passwd and for sudo i have to be in the sudoers file but once executed what is difference

35344
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
because it takes the sudoers s passwd instead of the root passwd sudo isolates permission between multiple sudoers

35344
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
sudo allows the sudoers passwd to change independently

35344
sudoers	passwd
in a large organization with many trusted sudoers this means when one of the sysadmins leaves you don t have to change the root passwd and distribute it to those admins who remain

35344
sudo	passwd
in that mode it differs from sudo bash in that it might run a different shell than bash since it looks first in the shell environment variable and then if that is unset at your user s login shell setting typically in etc passwd

35346
unix	aix
i need to do an ftp over ssl to a filezilla server running on a windows server from an aix unix clien

35346
unix	aix
do i need to install the certificate in the unix box aix

35346
unix	aix
note ssh sftp scp is not an option and it has to be ftp over ssl tls only from aix unix to windows filezilla

35349
kde	gnome
i don t want to install kde or gnome or anything like that on the server

35369
spaces	delimiter
here is an example of using cut to break input into fields using a spaces delimiter and obtaining the second field

35369
spaces	delimiter
how can the delimiter be defined as a tab instead of a spaces

35372
bash	zsh
here without using zsh i use bash but if i try to start screen with

35389
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
the last option would work even if you were going between different linux distros or from linux to solaris or freebsd or 32-bit to 64-bit provided that all the software s dependencies were met beforehand

35394
filesystems	btrfs
with btrfs you can mount a live snapshot filesystems in which all changed files are stored

35398
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i have to specify the new account when using sudo sudo -u rojotoro vim etc passwd as an example but i didn t actually need to change anything within the sudoers file

35410
sudo	passwd
the -n option to sudo will prevent sudo from prompting for a passwd

35413
daemon	cron
one solution is to not run puppet as a daemon but invoke it from cron

35429
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu red hat

35429
debian	linux
a linux distribution debian

35455
filesystems	ntfs
by windows-d i assume this filesystems is either fat32 or ntfs

35479
matlab	freemat
i m not sure how compatible with the matlab files but you could look at freemat which is an open-source cross-platform system

35486
efi	acpi
it is not recommended to run linux an apple mac hardware because it is full of firmware obscurity and violations of specifications like acpi efi

35496
xfs	btrfs
on xfs and btrfs the extra reported usage seems negligible

35507
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
so far it seems that the only terminal programs that come close to meeting those requirements come from gnome or kde or xfce

35511
ubuntu	debian	kde	gnome
i have some older machines that cannot run new versions of debian ubuntu suse etc on kde and gnome gui they just crash

35512
kde	gnome
you will not have the full range of features that a desktop environment like kde or gnome offers however

35512
kde	gnome
as for application support it doesn t depend on the interface kde apps will run on gnome and vice-versa but rather on the libraries that an application uses gtk qt

35518
kde	gnome
gnome and kde are whats known as desktop environments

35518
kde	gnome
than gnome and kde

35518
xfce	gnome
xfce uses gtk like gnome does and maintains a lot of compatibility with gnome panel applets

35518
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
if youre looking for something that ll be similar to kde and gnome i d stick with xfce

35523
curses	readline
i can have them install smaller packages but not change the python version from 2.4 to 2.6+ so i decided to compile the current version and ran into a few problems with the dependencies wrong version of readline zlib curses bz2 .

35523
mpfr	mpc
i also need to update gcc which complaines about missing gmp mpfr and mpc

35526
x11	konsole	kde	gnome
it replaces xterm rxvt xwsh and friends on x11 systems gnome terminal kde s konsole apple s terminal.app and putty on ms windows

35549
centos	linux
my small company uses an out-of-date linux centos software stack to run a proprietary software on a small cluster

35594
exif	jfif
photorec scans a disk or disk image searching for contiguous chunks of bytes-that-look-like-known-file-formats for example it can recognize jfif exif jpeg by the segment headers

35605
arp	dhcp
the dump should contain arp dhcp etc

35612
daemon	cron
or hack something together in the form of a shell script that periodically gets fired off by cron that checks up on your daemon script using some set of pre-determined checks for whether it is running properly or not and if not cleans up after it then re-launches

35614
bluetooth	usb
combining smart-ish linux box with a real microcontroller or several and a communications interface between them async serial by usb serial adapter most easily or bluetooth serial module or even ethernet may give the best of both worlds

35632
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m running linux mint so a debian flavour

35646
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 3.0.0-12-generic #20-ubuntu x86 gnu linux

35646
libc	ldd
ldd --version outputs ldd libc 2.7

35658
daemon	cron
if you re running the daemon from your own account start it at boot time with cron

35660
freebsd	linux
â¹ linux cygwin freebsd and osx support these features

35672
freebsd	linux
but for freebsd the vnode actually is similar to the inode in linux kernel

35672
freebsd	solaris
and there is a inode concept in freebsd or solaris

35672
freebsd	solaris
solaris and freebsd call this mechanism vfs virtual file

35672
freebsd	solaris
node. every file being accessed in solaris or freebsd has a vnode

35672
freebsd	solaris
structure is similar to the vnode on solaris freebsd

35672
freebsd	solaris
is an inode structure in solaris freebsd but this is

35672
freebsd	solaris
solaris and freebsd combine these as vnode operations.

35677
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
systems the offer a virtualised file system access layer freebsd solaris linux can support different underlying file systems which may or may not utilise inodes

35678
debian	mint	debian	linux
or shall i install debian based linux mint which gets rolling updates

35690
installation	upgrade
your bootloader installation may have created a boot sector backup but if it s been upgrade or you ve repartitioned since then it won t be up-to-date

35691
debian-based	mint
otherwise the debian-based mint should be ok

35735
redhat	fedora
i m running fedora 14 and cat etc fedora-release shows redhat release 5

35737
daemons	launchd
it would be lame for me to manually launchd the remind daemons every time i boot my computer someone would have to remind me to do that

35740
stdout	stderr
my first guess to change source of this script to print messages to stdout instead stderr but when i was reading source of script i found that you can configure it to just ask you if you want to install missing package

35740
stdout	stderr
2 change stderr to stdout

35740
stdout	stderr
to do it edit file usr lib python2.7 dist-packages commandnotfound commandnotfound.py and change stderr to stdout in lines 237 and 240

35751
bash	zsh
in ksh bash or zsh you can use in a command line to specify a character by its octal code

35778
bash	zsh
the man page will help a lot man bash or man zsh

35781
put	get
and since they aren t all in there how is it decided which ones get put in there

35807
express	node.js
where is the conventionally accepted location of node.js express web apps in a linux file system

35831
kde	gnome
no kde or gnome though - only openbox

35834
hash	md5
this first summarizes all of the file contents individually in a predictable order then passes that list of file names and md5 hash to be hash itself giving a single value that should only change when the content of one of the files in the tree changes

35834
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
unfortunately find -s only works with bsd find 1 used in mac os x freebsd netbsd and openbsd

35834
hash	md5
the -k 2 bit tells it to skip over the md5 hash so it only sorts the file names which are in field 2 through end-of-line by sort s reckoning

35834
hash	md5
you might need to change the md5sum commands to md5 or some other hash function

35834
tar	md5sum
if you need to be able to detect that anything in a tree has changed not just file contents ask tar to pack the directory contents up for you then send it to md5sum

35843
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
under linux you can use the rename utility called rename.ul under debian ubuntu and derivatives to change a part of the file name which can be in the directory part

35847
put	get
deterministic means that if you put the same files at the same locations you ll get the same result

35854
daemon	cron
there are several things that are logged in var log messages including mail cron daemon kern auth etc

35933
vim	emacs
main difference between emacs and vim is ergonomic

35938
sudo	passwd
with sudo if you have sudo permissions to run passwd you can do

35938
ubuntu	debian
it doesn t work if you use debian ubuntu and some others

35962
filesystems	xfs
xfs and ext4 filesystems which one is really stable and reliable for long run with heavy disk write and read

35962
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	centos	freebsd	solaris	freebsd	centos	centos	solaris
i wanted to use solaris or freebsd but for my project i must have to use ubuntu or archlinux or fedora or centos

35985
xfs	btrfs
so in common â quite space efficient is btrfs with or even and it was mine recent choice for root fs but mine root fs is read- only mostly since i ve separate fses for say home ext4 and torrent storage which used to be xfs but now is also btrfs btw

35997
dpkt	scapy
dpkt or scapy or similiar packet crafting libraries will help you parse the raw requests

36001
bash	zsh
both bash and zsh have a feature

36005
lvm	mdadm
i want to know if it is possible to use mdadm with stripes instead of lvm

36014
lvm	mdadm
unfortunately raid0 mdadm can t add new drives without rebuilding the whole raid however lvm does

36046
kerberos	ldap
if you have root then you can run a password cracker against etc shadow assuming local passwords and not ldap or kerberos etc.

36047
hash	md5
if the passwords are hash or encrypted with an older weak algorithm 3des md5 it would be possible to work out reasonably efficiently cheaply what the password was - albeit through attacking the data rather than just reversing the transformation

36047
sudo	passwd
since you are root it is also possible to attack the user passwd at another level - replace the login binary or sudo or part of pam etc with something that will capture the passwd when it is entered

36048
sudo	passwd
if that user has sudo access then sudo passwd root dose the work

36048
sudo	passwd
if we don t have sudo access then it ll prompt for the passwd again

36067
switching	screens
i had the same exact set up in mint 11 and it all worked well today after switching to mint 12 the workspace only affect one screens not both

36067
switching	screens
that is if i switching to another workspace only one screens is showing the new workspace and the other one always stays with the same content

36089
xfce	gnome
if you set change the theme from xfce settings it should affect all gtk apps including gnome ones

36093
sudoers	visudo
already tried to add the group _denyhosts to sudoers by executing sudo visudo and inserting the line

36101
cat	tee
if it processes files it s traditional to read from standard input and write to standard output if no arguments are specified example cat tee â

36108
pppoe	dhcp
there may be some pppoe magic required or even providing your mac address so they can enable it to get a dhcp configuration

36135
freebsd	linux
as the other post mentions pfsense can be interesting to a big difference is that pfsense like moonwall is based on freebsd not on linux

36141
cpu	processors
cumulative cpu time is the amount of time the processors spent running the process actually using cpu cycles not sleeping waiting to run or waiting for i o

36156
ssl	https
https uses a combo of http and ssl see the wikipedia article here

36156
ssl	https
https isn t really its own protocol per-se but rather normal http running on an ssl tunnel

36165
ubuntu	centos
virtual box 4.1.12 and centos 6.2 and ubuntu 11.10 64 bit

36177
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
it is packaged for a number of linux distributions try the vnc4server package on debian or ubuntu

36204
stdout	stderr
execute the pilot under screen or similar tool or with stdout and stderr redirected to pipe to tool similar to apache s rotatelogs

36214
rpm	yum
as we know yum is a package management system which was built on top of rpm

36214
rpm	yum
is there any particular case when using rpm command would be more appropriate than yum

36215
rpm	yum
rpm does loads of stuff only some of which is supplanted by yum

36215
rpm	yum
compare the yum and rpm manual pages

36232
rpm	zypper
use the zypper command-line tool to install the downloaded rpm

36243
rpm	yum
yum uses rpm actually it uses an rpm python library for much of its local operations but it only can perform a limited number of the functions that the rpm command can perform only related to the installation updating and removal of software

36243
rpm	yum
yum also can talk to local and remote software repositories and generate dependency graphs to manage software packages which rpm cannot

36251
debian	linux
however in which linux debian error log should i check when debugging such rules

36269
eglibc	uclibc
it is possible and quite commmon to build a system using uclibc or eglibc

36270
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
going the other direction debian has an experimental linux userspace on a freebsd kernel i think is possible due to glibc s portability layer

36286
bash	tcsh
tcsh is of course not my shell of choice but i have a script at work that sets up numerous environment variables in tcsh that i want to get working in bash

36286
bash	tcsh
i figured the easiest way other than rewriting the tcsh shell every time is to source it print out the variables into a file and with a bit of shell magic re-source everthing back in bash

36297
folder	dir
i noticed once when i shut down my home server while my desktop was connected via nfs that i kept getting stale nfs handle warning when entering my home dir this caused issues with some programs that looked in those folder

36324
rpm	yum
in newer versions of yum the rpmdb isn t the only thing that is altered by transactions installing or removing packages so it s actively harmful to go behind yum and use rpm directly to do that .

36324
rpm	yum
the only thing that comes to mind that rpm can do and yum can t do is signing packages rpm -k .

36325
udp	tcp
these sockets can be of any address families like ipv4 udp or tcp ipv6 udp6 or tcp6 unix

36350
subnet	packets	wan	subnet
the third and fourth line are the vpn subnet route and the last line says use the current wan interface to send packets to the vpn server

36364
gentoo	linux
but starting with gentoo can be really difficult â like others already wrote here but you are going to learn a lot about linux and how much faster it is to use a command line rather than a gui

36364
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is like debian but more beginner-friendly my grandma uses ubuntu on her old vaio and likes it

36364
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
but ubuntu can be really slow linux mint or lubuntu fits better for your old laptop

36364
gentoo	debian
suse â i haven t used suse for years one of my best friends uses it switched from gentoo to debian to suse and is happy with it

36364
ubuntu	linux
and don t forget ubuntu is linux linux is not ubuntu â many people seem to forget that

36365
ldd	glibc
from the glibc sources for ldd

36369
bash	subshell
this is why subshell and re-execing would work as they would use the other bash not the default one

36388
versioning	upgrade
i m on debian 6 lenny and after upgrade updating i have gcc versioning 4.4.5-8

36403
stdout	stderr
occasionally i need to specify a path-equivalent of one of the standard io streams stdin stdout stderr

36403
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr with dev stdin dev stdout and

36404
unix	bsd
that said it should be available on most commercial unix systems one way or another sometimes it s spelled dev fd n for various integers n but most systems with that will provide symlinks as linux and bsd do

36419
ubuntu	debian
there is a debian ubuntu repository to install the desktop client

36430
gmail	hotmail
update to answer your update mail messages sent via web interfaces like gmail s hotmail s etc can have an x-originating-ip header that shows your public ip

36430
gmail	hotmail
some services add this header hotmail and some don t gmail

36445
mouse	keyboard
is there a more than a terminal desktop environment distro that can be run using only a keyboard - i have an old computer on which i cannot use a mouse - the ps 2 port is broken and it won t accept usb

36448
stdout	stderr
additionally the stdin stdout stderr file descriptor numbers are also part of posix

36448
stdout	stderr
one important thing to note though is that usage of stdin stdout and stderr is subjective to how the program was started

36448
stdout	stderr
normally without any redirection going on stdin stdout and stderr are all just open file descriptors pointing to the same tty

36449
mouse	keyboard
for mine ubuntu with gnome there is a setting under universal access in the tab pointing and clicking for mouse keys that enable you to use the keyboard

36449
mouse	keyboard
i believe kde has a setting under the mouse control panel called move pointer with keyboard using the num pad â

36461
put	get
to get the ip address of the newly installed server one simple approach might be to just put something in the kickstart post-install script that could be as simple as hitting a web server you control with a bogus request you d see the ip address in the apache logs for example or something much fancier like running ifconfig to get the ip address and emailing it to you etc

36476
ubuntu	linux
i am using tcpdump to measure latency on a linux router the delay experienced by packets as they pass through the router made of ubuntu 10

36496
rpm	yum
as ordinary user you are not allowed to use yum for installation while you can use rpm to install source-rpms into your local rpm-build-directory

36500
kde	gnome
i fixed it be reinstalling kde and removing gnome from the terminal so i ended up with kde at its original settings

36532
rpm	yum
i m trying to install rpm package using yum through perl

36540
ubuntu	centos
my ssh client is ubuntu 64 bit 11.10 desktop and my server is centos 6.2 64 bit

36566
openvas	metasploit
metasploit dradis and openvas are a few very different tools that support importing from nmap and storing in a database

36568
icmp	tcp
for all other hosts nmap uses a combination of icmp and tcp packets to attempt to solicit a response

36568
icmp	tcp
briefly an icmp echo request should produce a echo response a tcp syn should produce a tcp syn-ack or rst a tcp ack should produce a tcp rst and an icmp timestamp request should produce a timestamp response

36573
daemons	systemd
if you have some other way physical terminal virtual console etc to get access you can confirm whether the ssh daemons is running with any of these commands some may not be available on your systemd

36595
freebsd	linux
firefox runs on various operating systems including microsoft windows linux mac os x and freebsd

36637
ubuntu	debian
this should work for ubuntu as well as debian type the following

36650
sudo	passwd
as far as i know this allows user username to use sudo unless he not uses usr bin passwd

36656
interpreted-language	smalltalk	lisp	smalltalk
ruby is an open-source dynamic object-oriented interpreted-language that combines the good bits from perl smalltalk and lisp

36671
perl	tcl
seems popular here for interpreted languages i ve at least usr lib python usr lib perl and usr lib ruby with variants for the handling of version specific stuff i think that is more proper from the fhs i ve also usr share tcl with a symbolic link from usr lib tcl if there is no binary data there or at least only architecture independent binary data

36673
imperative	declarative
c# pronounced see sharp is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing imperative declarative functional generic object-oriented class-based and component-oriented programming disciplines

36674
imperative	declarative
c# is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing imperative declarative functional generic object-oriented class-based and component-oriented programming disciplines

36687
ubuntu	debian
also if selinux is set to enforcing you may need to run restorecon -r -v .ssh see ubuntu bug 965663 and debian bug report #658675

36705
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
i am already a little bit familiar with linux distros like debian or ubuntu yeah very similar but i wanted to try red hat based - centos 6.2

36710
uninstall	upgrade
so what is the correct way to upgrade it on ubuntu 10.04 so that i can gain access to the uninstall command

36714
jobs	cron
i suspect most of the outgoing traffic goes through apache but the incoming traffic may be mostly through apache or could be dominated by other scripts and cron jobs so i would prefer a tool that would monitor traffic at the interface level rather than something within apache

36721
chown	mount
if you mount a filesystem from another system or if a file belongs to a now-deleted user or if you passed a numerical user id to chown you can have a file that belongs to a user id that doesn t have a name

36722
debian	mint	debian	linux
install debian on btrfs dev sda3 dev sda1 boot ext4 dev sda2 swap reboot into live environment linux mint debian ediiton 2012-04 in my case then from a terminal

36738
centos	linux
for copyright reasons the centos team just like the unbreakable linux team at oracle has to remove certain red hat owned material logos etc. and recompile

36758
multiplying	multiplication
look much easier and straightforward way is to find all numbers appended with px some d+px -match and then multiplying it with a constant but d will fail -- match only if not prepended by a digit and then do the replacement multiplication

36770
put	get
i m trying to merge eps files into a pdf file using gs however i cannot get it to put multiple eps files without page breaks in between even if original files are small

36794
switching	screens
once the user has requested a switching typed their password and hit enter they are presented with a black screens with a flashing white cursor in the top-left

36798
folder	directory
is there an easy way to keep a folder synced with a directory listing via http

36805
openbsd	netbsd
the same thing in the gnu or netbsd openbsd busybox implementation would be

36812
kerberos	ldap
googling for this i ve seen lots of references to kerberos ldap or nis which seems like massive overkill for such a simple task and might not be possible since these systems are not centrally-managed

36824
bash	zsh
strangely with ksh 93s+ 2008-01-31 but not with pdksh mksh bash ash or zsh displays bar which means that the assignment is treated as a shell variable assignment and not as a command-local environment assignment

36827
bash	zsh
in ksh bash or zsh if you need to set ifs temporarily you can write your code in a function and make ifs local to this function

36827
openbsd	linux
this is only useful to act on multiple files at once if you need portability to ancient linux systems or current openbsd systems that have -print0 but not

36834
disk	ram
i looked through some various other forums and read somewhere that the pfsense nanobsd install is perfect for cf or ssd installs as it essentially removes disk writes with the exception of needed writes and has everything run from ram

36837
sudo	passwd
if you re worried that sudo will time out after 5 minutes and you don t want the user to have to type their passwd twice you could do

36848
ubuntu	debian
if it makes a difference i m using ubuntu debian machines

36887
integer	unsigned
zone file serial numbers are unsigned 32-bit integers and they wrap around the largest possible 32-bit unsigned integer

36891
gentoo	linux
the system is gentoo linux

36905
bash	tcsh
background i m a long-time tcsh user gradually transitioning to bash and trying to find equivalents for some useful tcsh-specific features.

36905
bash	tcsh
is there a way to simulate the effect of tcsh s bindkey -c in bash by mapping a key sequence to the execution of a specified external command

36908
bash	zsh
while bash doesn t have this exact behavior zsh can do this with

36920
versioning	upgrade	debian	linux
having spent most of my linux life using debian i m been having a look at other distros and am really surprised at extent to which they don t provide a smooth upgrade between versioning

36920
versioning	upgrade
debian is infinitely upgradeable and i ve upgrade through a few major stable versioning now

36920
versioning	upgrade
or is reinstalling from scratch on a major versioning upgrade just a better idea overall regardless of distro

36922
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux 3.2.12-gentoo

36924
ubuntu	debian
debian s package management technology is not superior to fedora or ubuntu s obviously because it s the same as ubuntu s but debian has decided culturally that having a smooth upgrade system is important

36932
rss	feed
a standardized rss feed

36934
solaris	aix
for hp-ux solaris and aix i usually get en email from supplier or patch at given intervals

36934
rss	feed
for third party software i subscribe to its rss feed in an rss aggregator

36934
rss	feed
for third party software without rss feed i use webmonx which is a little desktop program that pops up a notification when a webpage has changed

36958
versioning	upgrade
migration procedures can be especially difficult to implement if they have to take into account the fact that some people will want to upgrade from versioning c to d but others will be switching form b or from a or from some custom state in the middle

36961
switching	screens
inside a current screens session this will start your command in a new screens window and then immediately switching back to your previous screens window effectively backgrounding the new screens window

36972
macports	homebrew
is there any way of installing mutt on mac os x without using a compiler homebrew or macports

36975
bash	zsh
you can check if it is really what you want and if so you can pipe it to bash or zsh if you wish

36989
fflush	gets
if the file stores all it s own sector information then it is less important if the metadata gets fflush

36992
ubuntu	debian
i am using either ubuntu or plain debian or debian grml - this would not make much difference i guess

36999
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m using linux mint debian edition and i have set firefox as my default browser in my settings

37015
smarthost	exim
set up a local exim smtp server by following the instructions on this page but choose the mail sent by smarthost

37016
ubuntu	linux
so if you are at all technically inclined not necessarily a guru you could use a live linux cd such as the ubuntu cd run gparted and create a partition big enough for any data you may want to keep

37022
ubuntu	debian
in many distributions debian ubuntu gettext is separated into multiple packages gettext-base and gettext

37031
daemons	launchd
when a daemons switches to a user and group after launchd it typically only switches to this user and group with setgid followed by setuid and doesn t take on any other group implied by etc passwd primary group and etc group supplementary group

37032
daemons	launchd
launchd is a superduper daemons that replaces initd

37060
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
it affects ubuntu kubuntu debian and mint and probably many many more.

37064
ubuntu	debian	slackware	suse
for example if you get a debian ubuntu redhat suse arch slackware etc you will always find there commands like

37087
freebsd	netbsd
with gnu or freebsd netbsd osx find

37107
chown	chmod
so as part of the script i want to execute a chown and chmod on the tar file so that other users can manipulate it

37121
gif	png
the folders may contain jpg png or gif images and any file extensions should be preserved

37121
for-loop	loops
do i need to use a nested for-loop to iterate over the event-x and album-x subfolders then for each inner loops keep track of the number myself or is there some clever solution that iâ m missing

37154
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	opensolaris	opensolaris	netbsd
xen pv guest kernels exist for linux netbsd freebsd opensolaris and novell netware operating systems

37162
mouse	keyboard
if you would do it without a program in-between i would say the hint about using xinput set-int-prop device_id device enabled 8 0 from disable keyboard mouse input on unix under x would be better but i understand it as that it is not what you are asking for

37177
vim	emacs
advanced editors such as vim or emacs can choose between the two methods

37184
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	freebsd	linux
supportability server rhel ubuntu lts freebsd different than linux

37193
sudo	passwd
i want to execute a shell script on a remote server and the script should be run by root with no passwd required or use sudo in the script

37195
opensuse	linux
answering the question in your subject opensuse uses the traditional unix umask setting instead of the debian-inspired one adopted by some other linux distributions

37200
debian	linux
it runs linux debian without any powersavings enabled

37204
cpu	hyperthreading
when i enable hyperthreading cpu size and capacity decrease to about half the non-hyperthreaded value

37206
redhat	fedora
fedora and redhat are using selinux see in etc sysconfig selinux if selinux has a value of enforcing

37210
ubuntu	debian
i ve packaged a package for ubuntu lekensteyn +archive wacom-tablet +sourcepub 2381407 +listing-archive-extra if you re not familiar with ubuntu or debian packaging the .debian.tar.gz file contains packaging scripts

37211
tablet	galaxy
ics aka android 4.0 includes digitizer pen support and two and a half tablet come with digitizers now htc flyer lenovo thinkpad tablet and when releases galaxy note 10.1

37214
rhel	suse
one difference between rhel and open suse is that rhel follows the user private group scheme in which the primary group of each user is a private group with the same name as the username

37214
rhel	suse
this is why the default umask is different between open suse and rhel and others

37219
redhat	fedora
this method works with redhat fedora ubuntu install package chkconfig and service suse

37220
pulseaudio	mixer
alsa works just fine but i actually have to deinstall pulseaudio before i can use the mixer to set the volume after which i can reinstall it

37225
ubuntu	linux
i also tried this test on a current arch linux build and ubuntu 11.10 and saw similar behaviour so this appears to be some type of kernel issue and not just a rhel issue

37251
ubuntu	mint
excluding the more consumer-oriented distros like ubuntu and mint or are they worth considering

37251
debian	linux
i ve heard good things of arch linux and debian

37253
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i actually prefer linux mint on the desktop these days but since it s based on ubuntu you can run ubuntu on the server and still get the benefit of it being almost identical

37254
websphere	ibm
if you want to host jboss or ibm websphere application server applications your choices are limited a bit to supported operating systems like rhel or sles

37255
gentoo	linux
gentoo is brilliant for leaning linux but you ll need to be prepared to do a lot of troubleshooting and patching

37255
rhel	suse
rhel sles sled redhat and novell suse are enterprise distributions that require a support fee for receiving patches

37258
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to set up a custom toolchain where the browser firefox or preferrably google-chrome is often frequently constantly forced to refresh from the commandline

37260
bash	zsh
is it possible to change the font attributes of the output of echo in either zsh or bash

37261
gentoo	debian
the difference is gentoo arch debian will force you to do so from the beginning

37283
ubuntu	linux
whenever i try to boot ubuntu linux with an external monitor attached to my laptop it hangs after checking the battery state with the following message repeated several times

37299
sudo	passwd
when using sudo on linux it asks for root passwd but only the first time you run it

37299
sudo	passwd
if you run another sudo command it remember you already entered the passwd previously and doesn t ask for it

37299
sudo	passwd
i know sudo is a setuid program so it has root s privileges all the time but i still can t think of a good place to store an information that a user has already entered a passwd

37300
sudoers	passwd
the actual privileges granted including how long the sessions lasts before you have to enter your passwd again depends on how sudoers is setup

37300
sudo	passwd
how long a session lasts or when sudo needs to prompt for your passwd again is determined by a delta of current time and the session timestamp in this directory and how long sudo is setup to allow a session to last

37311
bazaar	git
if you don t know any start with one of the three main distributed revision control systems bazaar git or mercurial

37334
ubuntu	debian
also in debian distributions there could be some parameters in the file etc default laptop-mode but my ubuntu 12.04 does not have this file

37341
postfix	lamson
you could combine your postfix setup with some other mail server dealing with the logic like lamson a mail handling framework written configurable in python

37361
spaces	delimiter
i recently asked someone at work about how to take the output of ipcs -qa and make it spaces delimiter so i can parse it store it in the database for monitoring

37362
spaces	delimiter
will replace all two or greater sequences of spaces into one spaces therefore all words will be spaces delimiter

37377
folder	directory
the problem of course is that anything that walks the filesystem to find your current directory location is going to find host users kevin folder to home kevin instead of home kevin

37391
ubuntu	centos
the system time does seem to be higher with ubuntu 8.04 than with ubuntu 7.10 but this difference is far less distinct than what was seen with centos 5.6 vs 6.2

37391
ubuntu	centos
overall the plots for ubuntu 11.10 show the same sort of trend that was observed with centos 6.2 which indicates that this is a kernel issue in general and not just a rhel issue

37391
ubuntu	centos
the one exception is that the system time appears to be a bit higher with ubuntu 11.10 than with centos 6.2 but once again the resolution on this measurement is very course so i think that any conclusion other than it appears to be a bit higher would be stepping onto thin ice

37391
ubuntu	centos
i couldn t find an easy way to run centos 6.2 with bfs so i ran with this comparison and since the results of ubuntu 11.10 compares so well with centos 6.2 i believe that it is a fair and meaningful comparison

37398
ubuntu	debian
on debian and derivatives including ubuntu

37403
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
on non-embedded linux cygwin or other system with gnu grep on freebsd on netbsd and osx

37404
bash	zsh
in bash or in zsh or any other shell you can use the terminal escape sequences directly apart from a few exotic ones all terminals follow xterm s lead these days

37422
filesystems	xfs
it s possible that you need to use xfs_quota 8 for xfs filesystems

37424
freebsd	linux
according to and some other search hits i found it specifically recognizes the ssh command entered after the kind of prompt that is the default in many linux distributions in particular i found some hits noting that it does not work with freebsd s defaults

37426
vmware	virtualbox
i ve done this using kvm qemu in the past but i think vmware and maybe virtualbox should work also

37438
folder	directory
-t is needed to get an error if the season folder are not unique you don t have the big bang theory season 22 and season 22 in the same directory

37453
debian	centos
centos is getting very popular in my country dominican republic and i ve wondered if debian is getting behind

37453
debian	centos
can redhat debian centos or suse be used for bulk operations servers

37459
debian	centos
in terms of stability i ve found no difference between centos and debian stable

37459
debian	centos
i have machines running debian squeeze centos 5.8 centos 6.2 and slackware

37459
debian	centos
use centos if there is a specific piece of software that is unavailable for debian otherwise i would stick with debian

37461
debian	centos
also debian is waaaaay more stable than rhel or centos

37481
rss	feed
iptables -m recent is tricky because some pages have a lot of images or other data files and recent triggers on those too typically my rss aggregator loading images and feed

37496
kde	gnome	centos	linux
as for a desktop if you re looking for bleeding-edge packages gnome 3 recent versions of kde etc... you will not find them in in oracle linux or any rhel clone centos scientific linux etc...

37500
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
opensuse is nice and comes in several flavours like kde windows like with several add-ons gnome like mac... and lxde xfce lighweight distros

37500
rpm	zypper
it uses an rpm based package management system with zypper libzypp

37502
unix	bsd
unix linux bsd shells don t do variable substitution inside single-quoted string literals but they will do it inside double-quoted string literals

37510
filesystems	btrfs
you can see more details with btrfs filesystems df

37532
ubuntu	centos
i tested it on centos 5.5 and ubuntu 10.04

37532
ubuntu	centos
i tested it on centos 5.5 and ubuntu 10.04 and it works fine

37537
centos	linux
i run virtualbox in linux running centos in it and i can t switch to ttyx in the centos since i ll go to the ttyx in my linux

mouse	keyboard
jarnal is an open-source application for notetaking sketching keeping a journal making a presentation annotating a document - including pdf - or collaborating using a stylus mouse or keyboard

37547
ubuntu	debian
i know i can install daemontools from the ubuntu and also debian repository but how do i compile it myself

37549
debian	centos
i am trying to install either debian or centos on a home server fujitsu primergy tx100 s3

37559
kde	gnome
yes rhel and all of it s derivatives can be used as a desktop distribution they do contain the graphical environment and a choice of gnome and kde desktops

37568
debian	mint
last week i installed lmde mint debian xfce on a third boot partition and with some effort have almost everything working isight s still down -- hoping to make it my primary os a nice scaled-back rolling distro of debian testing along the lines of #

37586
minix	linux
the source code page has bell labs unix from version 1 through 6 32v system iii some or all of the bsds pointers to linux progenitor minix

37591
cpu	processors
an i386 virtualbox binary can run an amd64 image but only if your processors has cpu virtualization extensions intel vt-x or amd-v

37592
ubuntu	debian	dpkg	apt
on debian and derivatives including ubuntu and derivatives and any other system that uses dpkg and apt to manipulate packages you can find in which package a file is by running

37592
dpkg	aptitude
in general to find out the source package that this binary package is built from run dpkg -s coreutils or apt-cache show coreutils or aptitude show coreutils

37603
debian	mint	debian	linux
i want to set up apt repository priority ordering in linux mint debian edition 2012.04

37633
sudo	passwd
however the users should also have sudo privileges though which by default requires a passwd

37633
sudo	passwd
if i want to use the users public keys as a method of access management and allow the users sudo privileges does that mean i should also set up the users with nopasswd all in visduo or is there a way that a user can change their own passwd if they only have public key authentication

37635
ubuntu	debian
visit this page it explains how to install and use cpulimit in debian and ubuntu

37637
sudo	passwd
yes it s incredibly insecure and also allows a user to access the other users passwd but since they have sudo not much you can do

37638
filesystems	btrfs
limitations - partimage does not support ext4 or btrfs filesystems

37660
stdout	stderr
send stderr to stdout

37662
stdout	stderr
and you ve only redirected stdout not stderr

37666
sudo	passwd
sudo in its most common configuration requires the user to type his passwd

37666
sudo	passwd
in your setup the user s passwd would be used only for authentication to sudo

37666
sudo	passwd
hence a user with sudo powers can change his own passwd without entering it at the passwd prompt by running

37666
sudo	passwd
if sudo is configured to require the user s passwd then the user must have typed the passwd to sudo anyway

37667
versioning	upgrade
you have control over which versioning of php and or mysql your server will follow there are no surprise upgrade

37667
versioning	upgrade
with other repos i ve followed over the years you can get a surprise upgrade in major php versioning like from 5.3 to 5.4 when the maintainer decides to upgrade their php versioning

37667
versioning	upgrade
with ius it requires active work on your part to upgrade major php versioning

37701
wav	flac
i was decoding the flac into wav and then encoding the wav into the end product

37701
mp3	flac
could someone please supply me with some examples how to decode a flac file and encode that into mp3 using lame by piping raw data

37727
debian	linux
i have a debian linux box debian squeeze that deadlocks every few hours if i run a python script that sniffs an interface.

37744
disk	ram
the issue isn t with the type of disk spinning non-spinning it s with committing disk buffers from ram to disk

37755
mp3	ogg
this is worth renaming then as you wouldn t want this to happen when handling your mp3 ogg files

37769
chmod	sudoers
if you did not put yourself in the admin group you will need to reboot osx into single user mode and perform the command chmod 0440 etc sudoers

37790
ubuntu	linux
if it s any help i m using redhat and an ubuntu linux systems

37795
bash	zsh

a set of lightweight boot loaders for ms-dos fat ext2 ext3 ext4 btrfs filesystems network booting and booting from cd

37805
spaces	delimiter
but inconsistently because the delimiter is spaces and there might be two or more spaces in between two fields

37825
cifs	smb
one potential would be to set up an smb cifs share on the unix host

37825
cifs	smb
in a script from each windows workstation mount the smb cifs share with the net command

37825
cifs	smb
after completion of the copy or move of the file to the smb cifs share you could optionally remove the share from the windows workstation

37831
mouse	keyboard
character devices are things like audio or graphics cards or input devices like keyboard and mouse

37846
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
if you re using a desktop environment kde gnome xfce most likely it has a configuration tool to enable the video output and configure the resolution

37861
centos	linux
another idea might be using redhat centos or scientific linux

37863
ubuntu	linux
i don t have much linux or networking experience but i m trying to ssh into an ubuntu virtual machine from outside of my home network

37863
ubuntu	debian
the ubuntu virtual machine running inside virtualbox is running a debian desktop

37870
ubuntu	debian
create ubuntu usb-installer from debian

37887
bash	zsh
to complete stã phane gimenez answer i cannot comment yet one solution is to make your script portable to bash by checking if you are using zsh and then transform into an array like this

37917
pthreads	fork
the fork exec wait model of unix pthreads is one of its very oldest and most deeply embedded features

37939
qmail	exim
the most popular are sendmail exim postfix and qmail

37954
rpm	yum
first remove the actual ffmpeg installation yum remove ffmpeg ffmpeg-devel you will have to install the dag rpm repositories which contains huge amount of rpm packages

37992
kde	gnome
is there any sort of application that can give me desktop icons in the same way ms windows and kde gnome have allowing files and shortcuts on the desktop

38030
ftp	telnet
then they will be able to authenticate to the ftp server with their username and password but they won t be able to ssh or telnet in

38030
redhat	fedora
for example on a fedora or redhat system

38050
ubuntu	openbsd
i was trying to do it but with no luck - using ssh to connect to the openbsd machine from my notebook - ubuntu gnome-terminal

38056
debian	mint
for example if the file looks like this this is from debian the contents will be similar but have different names on mint

38057
bash	zsh
in ksh93 bash and zsh you can write this with less hassle using the construct

38057
ubuntu	debian
under debian ubuntu and other derivatives you can use the rename perl script

38107
ubuntu	linux
is there any linux distribution that will give me noticeable superior results in the above categories and be more lightweight than ubuntu

38109
kde	kubuntu
btw i read and still don t know what s in it for me especially on kde kubuntu

38125
bash	zsh
here s a very crude caching facility for bash ksh zsh

38126
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
there are filesystems that may have encoding constraints â usually non-native filesystems such as fat or ntfs

38134
ubuntu	linux
the core of the system is based on linux and ubuntu

38136
ubuntu	linux
i have an ubuntu linux box 12.04

38140
gentoo	linux
fwiw i use gentoo linux

38172
bash	zsh
i m looking to switch from bash to zsh but concerned about compatibility of bash scripts

38172
bash	zsh
are all bash scripts functions compatible with zsh

38172
bash	zsh
therefore if that is true is zsh just an enhancement to bash

38173
bash	zsh
bin bash they will still be run using bash even if your default shell is zsh

38173
bash	zsh
i ve found the syntax of zsh really close to the one of bash and i did not pay attention if there was really some incompatibilities

38173
bash	zsh
i switched 6 yeras ago from bash to zsh seemlessly

38183
bash	zsh
zsh has most features of bash but in many cases with a different syntax

38200
stdout	stderr
as far as i understand show only stderr on screen but write both stdout and stderr to file i cannot separate the stderr from the stdout so is there a smarter way to create dynamic text-based menus just using the stdout

38209
unix	solaris
in unix solaris is there any command that returns the hostname and domain name together

38230
ubuntu	debian
arandr is a debian ubuntu version of xrandr with a graphical interface to make it easier to use

38277
manual	rcs
keep a backup of the previous version of etc hosts in case you make a mistake i use the handy etckeeper package for this but if you prefer it ye olde way you can use a manual backup or even rcs

38304
ubuntu	linux	xfce	gnome
i moved from ubuntu to arch linux from unity gnome to xfce desktop

38306
solaris	irix
at least on solaris macos x and irix

38308
tunnel	lan
this management is done through a tunnel that is created by coovachilli and all clients from lan connect to that tunnel

38308
centos	linux
my vpn will be created between my server that runs centos and another remote server that runs linux also

38314
ubuntu	debian
reading the mailing list thread a solution is to change the notifyd to libnotify-bin debian or notify-osd ubuntu maybe one of those is available for arch

38316
sudo	passwd
you could use sudo instead of kuu that way you would not need to store passwd in clear text hellip

38329
openbsd	freebsd
or if you are on recent versions of freebsd or openbsd

38351
jobs	cron
basically it allows an unprivileged user to have cron jobs

38351
jobs	cron
and yes you will want cron jobs if you want regular things done

38352
daemons	systemd
the main cron daemons runs the per-user crontabs as well as the systemd crontab

38354
opensuse	centos
i can install either centos 6 with parallels plesk panel 10 64-bit or opensuse 11.4 with parallels plesk panel 10 64-bit on my server

38370
jobs	cron
any output or error message produced by the at job is sent by local mail exactly like for cron jobs

38394
kde	gnome
most of the modern desktop environments gnome kde unity are moving towards requiring hardware 3d acceleration support to work properly

38408
debian	linux
i m using linux debian squeeze and i already have compiz installed

38409
ubuntu	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux
using another linux machine running ubuntu i was going to install gentoo into a folder on that machine

38411
gentoo	linux
however since you do have a running linux system on the same network pxeboot is a supported and well-documented option for installing gentoo

38418
centos	linux
there are a number of projects that do just this with some rebranding notable centos scientific linux white box etc

38425
post	get
i recommend you post a sanitized version of your original deploy.sh script with sensitive personal information removed so you can get ideas from other people about alternative approaches

38434
ssl	https
the ports are https ssl 443 ssh22 and http80

38446
centos	linux
the other solution is to reinstall the host with centos scientific linux or one of the many other rhel-derivitives

38456
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu i can use to solve your problem

38459
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
if you want a redhat without licence costs use fedora scientific linux or centos

38459
redhat	fedora
fedora is from redhat whereas scientific and centos are redhat clones

38464
unix	bsd
the point of quotes in a unix linux bsd shell is to keep pieces of a string together that would otherwise get parsed as multiple strings

38507
disk	ram
or i could set such a threshold to trigger oom-killer before using all the ram so there will always be room for the file system cache and thus avoid more disk thrashing

38509
textmate	gedit
moving from os x textmate to ubuntu gedit the one feature of textmate i am missing is it s command line tool

38516
ubuntu	centos
i m configuring software on ubuntu for i2b2 and trying to find all of the relevant files on a centos image that i downloaded path below and am now running on windows vmware player free for download

38516
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
i d like to create a file of the linux file hierarchy recursively for both centos and ubuntu so i can find the relevant files for each program ie jboss java apache axis spring web framework oracle etc.. and compare configuration

38517
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
on linux both centos and ubuntu programs come in packages

38517
ubuntu	centos
if you want to have the same programs on ubuntu and centos then you should obtain a list of packages on the centos machine and install the same packages on ubuntu

38517
ubuntu	centos
the bad news is that centos and ubuntu use different package names so you can t take this list and do the installation on ubuntu

38527
centos	linux
being relatively new to centos and by extension gnu linux here are some commands i found helpful in troubleshooting hardware issues

38579
put	get
you should be able to put the custom dns addresses into your dhcp server s configuration so your clients get told to use them instead of the defaults

38580
stdout	stderr
another workaround would be to modify your scripts so they don t refer to dev stdout and dev stderr

38580
stdout	stderr
i see this on my own system ubuntu 12.04 with bash 4.2.24 -- even though the bash document info bash on my system says that dev stdout and dev stderr are treated specially when used in redirections

38580
stdout	stderr
dev fd n dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr whether or not

38580
stdout	stderr
your os like mine is not handling the ownership and permissions of dev stdout and dev stderr correctly

38580
stdout	stderr
that wouldn t matter if dev stdout and dev stderr worked correctly

38603
vim	emacs
apart from the usual suspects g vim emacs scite has pretty good support for external scripts i d say

38608
mouse	keyboard
the screen was still visible but the mouse or keyboard had not effect

38612
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
in the meantime i was able to compile and install on debian squeeze ubuntu and also centos 6.0 and it works

38612
ubuntu	debian
for debian and ubuntu apt-get install build-essential

38616
ubuntu	linux
is there something similar on ubuntu linux

38638
switching	screens
this altscreen has no history buffer and exits immediately when you quit the program switching back to the original screens which restores the previous window content history and placement

38658
cvs	rcs
works well with rcs and cvs at least so for code archeology it s useful as well

38667
cvs	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn
integration with svn cvs git mecurial bazaar

38672
ubuntu	linux
most free opensource linux distributions now include kvm ubuntu lts

38674
bash	zsh
in recent enough versions of bash ksh or zsh you can build this string with the construct

38676
versioning	upgrade
this means you end up with multiple copies of the same library versioning and there is no easy way to upgrade libraries â you end up with multiple obsolete copies of the same library

38682
openbsd	freebsd
firstly you can t use binaries or drivers for freebsd on openbsd

38682
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
openbsd netbsd and freebsd are very different os

38701
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is able to detect my lenovo mic mute button with acpi_listen but when i try it on arch linux there is no output available

38713
ubuntu	linux
the steps below work on arch linux not sure about ubuntu

38719
ubuntu	centos
in centos and many other distros you can configure syslogd using etc syslog.conf but in ubuntu there is no such file

38729
hide	show
at the very least if you cannot remove the last panel from the panel preferences then you can make it as small as possible move it to the screen s edge and select automatically hide and show panel and lock panel

38733
ubuntu	mint
no prebuilt package is available for ubuntu mint right now so you best option is to build it from the source using the previous version of mono presumably

38741
ubuntu	debian
this solution applies to the debian version of automysqlbackup as in ubuntu 12.04

38746
gentoo	linux
a less time consuming option is gentoo linux

38747
mouse	keyboard
after the boot process starts the x server and kde my keyboard and mouse do not function

38747
mouse	keyboard
keyboard input works when i use the recovery console and both the keyboard and mouse work when i boot into windows

38747
mouse	keyboard
i have also tried booting the previous 3.2.0.2 kernel but both keyboard and mouse fail to receive input and do not respond

38747
mouse	keyboard
edit 2 i tested to see if an external wired usb mouse and keyboard would work but neither worked

38747
mouse	keyboard
i m guessing it s an input problem with the x server rather than just my keyboard and mouse inside the laptop

38747
mouse	keyboard
so it looks like it just doesn t recognize both my keyboard and mouse on the laptop itself

38747
mouse	keyboard
is there a way to configure the x server to accept input from more inputs such as the keyboard and internal mouse

38784
ssl	https
connect specifies a method for creating ssl https connections through a proxy server

38788
udp	tcp
netcat is a computer networking service for reading from and writing network connections using tcp or udp

38805
kde	gnome
you can just delete your old xorg.conf and graphically configure it the way you want it with gnome or kde system tool

38819
solaris	aix
this is for example the case with solaris aix hp-ux and os x

38854
ubuntu	centos
so the big long term support distros are the red hat enterprise linux-derived centos which tends to be more server enterprise focused and ubuntu lts which happily coincides with the current ubuntu release version 12.04 codenamed precise pangolin

38854
ubuntu	centos
much as i live centos ubuntu is probably a bit friendlier to new users and has extensive community support and various forums

38857
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu on vmware to learn how to use linux

38860
dropbox	icloud
dropbox google drive ubuntu one icloud are your friends

38875
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
first of all the hassle with encrypted root and early userspace is typically already handled by your distribution as far as i know fedora debian ubuntu and opensuse support encrypted root out of the box

38894
ubuntu	openbsd	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	debian	debian	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	debian
available unix-like operating systems include linux tag debian debian ubuntu ubuntu 2 arch-linux arch linux 3 fedora fedora â freebsd freebsd 5 netbsd netbsd 6 openbsd openbsd 7 â most android and all ios devices have an arm cpu as well

38904
bash	zsh
if your local shell is bash ksh93 or zsh use this instead to quote any single quote

38926
disk	ram
the introduction of large libraries like the one used with graphic environments x11 widget toolkits and similar demonstrated embedding all the required libraries in a single executable was inefficient in both storage space large executable files at a time when disk space was sparse and in memory usage a lot of duplication of the same code at a time when ram was sparse too

38938
unix	solaris
is oracle solaris officially declared unix

38944
netbsd	vms
i need to read a large log file and send it over a local network using netbsd netcat between two vms on the same host workstation

38952
width	height
for each file print a line with the width a space the height a space and the file name

38952
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
depending on your version of identify the n to add a final newline may either be necessary imagemagick 6.6.0 or superfluous but harmless graphicsmagick 1.1.11

38952
width	height
awk on each line if the width and height match the required conditions then

38952
width	height
this strips the width and height

38957
jobs	cron
cron runs each user s scheduled jobs as that user

38961
unix	solaris
so solaris is definitely unix in a licensing sense as well as a certification sense

38963
jobs	cron
i understand that this file is for system cron jobs and other users should not have permission to modify it

38995
bash	zsh
i recently made the switch from bash to zsh

38995
bash	zsh
i discovered two minuscule issues and differences between zsh and bash

38995
bash	zsh
in zsh behave the same way as it does in bash

39033
ubuntu	linux
i am launching a social networking website on lamp stack on linux ubuntu i know that people are going to upload lots of pictures

39038
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
i have had opensuse ubuntu debian arch and fedora installed but all of them would not get the right resolution with or without proprietary drivers

39044
uniq	grep
| tr space n | grep -v s | sort | uniq -c | sort -bnr | grep fuck

39045
put	get
so to put it in your language you get 2 cpus running at 1.1 ghz when 2 cpus are needed and 1 cpu at 1.6 ghz when only one is needed

39056
centos	linux
but i do not remember what that was exactly neither how to set that on my current linux centos 5 32-bit

39073
rpm	yum
when i install a software from its binary package using rpm or yum i can later query for meta-information rpm -qi package rpm -ql package ... and can uninstall it rpm -e package

39073
rpm	yum
question is there any way to sort of register the binaries being installed which is usually during the make install step for most software packages with the rpm yum database to allow easy uninstall later and for meta-information querying

39080
xfce	gnome
there are specific instructions for ubuntu but they assume that you are running a desktop environment like gnome or xfce

39100
width	height
monitor1 x 0 y 0 width 1280 height 1024

39100
width	height
monitor2 x 1280 y 0 width 1280 height 1024

39179
unix	bsd
short answer restrictions imposed in unix linux bsd kernel namei function

39179
unix	bsd
namei is part of the unix linux bsd kernel so that s where the exceptional byte values get enforced

39183
ati	nvidia
if you use out-of-tree drivers binary blobs like nvidia ati then those drivers will obviously not be updated with the kernel

39183
versioning	upgrade
it s up to their developers to release new versioning that work with newer kernels and up to you or to your distro s repositories to upgrade them

39238
folder	directory
will move everything in path to source folder including files and directory to destination folder

39240
uniq	grep
is there any utility like grep or even uniq but for inexact search or i should write it myself

39240
uniq	grep
of course i don t know any pattern of file s content like in case with grep or uniq

39254
filesystems	fat
this only works on filesystems that support hard links though -- so any native unix-ish filesystems is fine but it won t work with fat

39256
mouse	keyboard
i downloaded a live cd of debian kde and my mouse and keyboard worked so it was a configuration that got messed up

39267
vim	emacs
i was wondering if someone can tell me how to install vim or emacs preferably emacs on solaris 8

39267
vim	emacs
i tried using vi but it s a little annoying to use after using vim and emacs i can t even get the editor to backspace correctly

39277
kde	gnome
i don t use kde i use gnome but this may help

39278
punctuation	words
so i just need it to echo these four punctuation marks if they are included as part of a words viz.

39302
bash	zsh
this way is supported by bash zsh and ash dash

39320
punctuation	words
it finds words containing one or more of your specified punctuation marks and prints out the words and the first matching punctuation mark

39322
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
ssh-keygen can create rsa keys for use by ssh protocol version 1 and dsa ecdsa or rsa keys for use by ssh protocol version 2

39325
cpu	processors
the disadvantage of it is you can only monitor either the whole cpu usage or each processors usage

39352
ubuntu	linux
this does not work with ubuntu 12.04 or android 2.3.6 or android 4.0 so i guess it s a general linux problem

39354
ubuntu	linux
within linux ubuntu it is possible to mount partitions like home etc lib from another linux machine and bind them to proc sys tmp to the host s to actually take control of the mounted non-booted linux system

39354
fink	macports
with this we could forget fink and macports and have a completely debian distro working on mac os x

39356
debian	linux	unix	bsd
no osx is bsd unix based obviously debian is linux

39356
fink	macports	fink	homebrew	macports	homebrew
there is an alternative to fink and macports it is called homebrew

39356
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
you could also run a virtual machine under virtualbox free or vmware parallels not free

39383
xfce	gnome
i want to set up a launcher for my terminal in xfce that automatically prompts for the su password in gnome my shortcut was

39388
ubuntu	debian
it is in ubuntu debian repositories probably others too

39389
pop-up	dialog
in terminal choose other and the dialog pop-up

39413
udp	tcp
for sockets you can find more information about the inode in proc net tcp proc net udp or proc net unix

39416
redhat	fedora
most distributions imho default to runlevel 5 redhat fedora sles opensuse - meaning login with runnung x11 and gui

39417
ubuntu	debian
normally you would want to edit etc resolv.conf but in debian and ubuntu this file could be overwritten

39421
ubuntu	debian
the debian distribution and hence ubuntu which is derived from it does not define any differences between runlevels 2-5 as a matter of policy

39423
filesystems	btrfs
but when i was doing the btrfs thing there was the that told the kernel to mount that subvolume as in the filesystems

39427
disk	ram
the ram part will be at rw and the disk image will be at ro but of course it will be read-only

39427
readonly	temporary
nevertheless if you have booted into a temporary system but need to make a permanent change you can re-mount the readonly file system by saying

39428
folder	directory
i am already using a local maildir directory at .mail as a separate akonadi resource so i have no need for this pre-created local folder

39438
ubuntu	debian
i m using vixie cron on debian ubuntu

39448
stdout	stderr
one option would be to write your prompts to stderr rather than stdout

39451
interpreted-language	compiled-language
if a compiled-language or a faster interpreted-language like python was used then its running time would be shorter

39452
unix	solaris	unix	sunos	sunos	irix	sysv	systemd	solaris	irix	solaris	sunos
writing a short shell script for your own systemd was much easier than the developer writing for every possible flavor of unix that was coming up again this was before even autoconf sysv ultrix irix hp-ux sunos solaris nextstep nonstop etc

39455
stdout	stderr
there is one difference between redirecting the output and not if you don t redirect the output and you exit your shell then the stdout stderr file descriptors are closed and the next time you try to write to them the write operation will fail

39479
chown	chmod
in the former case use chmod and chown as appropriate to make sure that your user has these permissions on every intermediate directory

39482
subshell	ifs
or using a subshell to make the ifs and option changes local

39483
daemons	systemd
unix systemd typically have one or more script per subsystem or daemons that needs to be initialized

39493
ubuntu	debian
if you are using debian should be the same with ubuntu you should be able to place a script in etc initramfs-tools scripts init-bottom which will be executded before init is started

39497
gentoo	linux
is there a way on gentoo arch linux to remap the caps lock key into

39510
versioning	upgrade
then you need to configure apt pin priorities to make testing versioning as additional to prevent distributive upgrade

39512
stdout	stderr
you re looking for dev stdout or dev stderr as appropriate

39519
kde	gnome
you could add xset b off to your launch programs if you are using startx or similar this will be .xinitrc otherwise for gnome kde etc use your startup programs application

39524
freebsd	linux
i like the philosophy of freebsd but if it does not work i have no qualms about moving to a linux

39547
kde	kubuntu
i m running kubuntu with kde as my main desktop environment

39561
filesystems	ntfs
fat32 and ntfs are windows filesystems

39562
ubuntu	debian
for a guide to setting up a debian-like distribution in a chroot see how do i run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit debian ubuntu

39562
ubuntu	debian
the guide is written for 32-bit ubuntu inside 64-bit ubuntu but applies equally to unstable inside stable and to debian

39564
bash	zsh
of course you can use the bash version also with zsh

39574
sudo	passwd
this would allow username to run sudo apt-get and sudo aptitude without any passwd but would not allow any other commands

39577
spaces	delimiter
the problem is that the output of the cal command uses spaces as a delimiter which creates all sorts of problems when i apply my nawk script to it

39577
spaces	delimiter
i looked the source code for cal and seems that nothing short of hacking the source code will force cal command to use delimiter other than the spaces

39590
ubuntu	linux
on linux ubuntu where ought i look for this

39601
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu and derivatives use the rename perl script

39611
ubuntu	mint
in ubuntu or mint 12.04 or later just install the zescrow-client package and run the zescrow command

39661
width	height
is pretty clear here you ll need to enlarge your terminal to at least 19 lines height and 80 columns width

39675
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
you don t say what unix your scripts are running on but strace on linux truss on solaris aix and i think tusc on hp-ux let you learn a lot about what a process is doing

39695
folder	directory
which will recursively list all folder and directory within the current directory including permissions

39696
ubuntu	linux
say i have a 4-core workstation what would linux ubuntu do if i execute

39699
freebsd	linux
even though there seems to be some historical deviation from iana s suggested range it seems awkward that windows vista windows 7 windows server 2008 freebsd 4.6+ and many others all have agreed upon this range and yet linux still stands out

39701
bash	subshell
bash at least version 4.1.5 has some quirks when it comes to taking a tz change into account the change is only reflected after the shell has started an external command it has to be an external command forking a subshell isn t enough nor is executing built-ins

39717
octal	hex
the first is that it s in hex but access modes are generally described in octal

39717
octal	hex
the raw mode in hex is described in the programmer s manual for the stat function man 2 stat noting that they are octal values

39723
mouse	keyboard
is it possible to assign mouse keys left click 1 middle click 2 right click 3 etc to keyboard keys by modifying a file in etc x11 xorg.conf.d

39725
unix	bsd	unix	aix	bsd	aix
first not all unix systems use etc shadow so there are not equal d bsd uses etc master.passwd aix uses etc security passwd .

39752
ubuntu	debian
for accessing the storage on an ios device you will need the gtkpod-aac package that is it s name in debian ubuntu other distros may use a different name

39753
mouse	keyboard
i had thought someone told me or i heard somewhere that xorg by default supports keyboard driven mouse emulation out of the box

39770
hide	show
as a workaround i ve looked into various x pseudoservers that will allow me to show hide the gui window as appropriate

39824
debian	linux
in debian and probably most linux fdisk -l tells the total size of all disks

39834
vmware	esx
if your vmware instance is an esx esxi server you can use the web services sdk to obtain this info

39844
ubuntu	linux
for what it is worth i generally use arch linux but occasionally use ubuntu so portability would be appreciated.

39846
mouse	keyboard
sometimes the system does not have any response with mouse and keyboard

39851
bash	zsh
the main difference is that your shell s interactive initialization file is sourced .bashrc for bash .zshrc for zsh

39855
mouse	keyboard
this might be happening due to an interaction between an application and a window manager or the x11 server if an application stops responding and prevents you from entering input with the keyboard or mouse to other application windows

39855
ubuntu	linux
unless you re running a mainline kernel from kernel.org kernel bugs should be reported against the package linux in ubuntu since ubuntu gives special kernel builds that integrate distro-specific patches and bug reports not confirmed against a mainline kernel will be rejected at kernel.org

39855
ubuntu	linux
search the web to see if other people have experienced similar problems with the same video card and or make and model of machine on ubuntu or other gnu linux distributions

39855
ati	nvidia
most proprietary video cards are intel amd ati or nvidia click those links to see the community documentation on installing and using proprietary drivers for these cards in ubuntu

39855
ati	nvidia
if you re currently using proprietary drivers you can try using different proprietary drivers for example directly from nvidia or amd ati or you can try using the free open source drivers instead

39856
freebsd	linux
linux uses stat -c y but freebsd and mac os use stat -f m

39866
debian	linux
i am loading linux debian lenny on virtualbox but there is apparently something wrong with the grub

39869
mouse	keyboard
not sure about rescuetime but wakoopa stops tracking software after 30 seconds without input from mouse or keyboard

39871
folder	directory
is it because bin folder is somewhat special as compared to other folder in my home directory

39881
bash	zsh
i want to change my shell from bash to zsh

39886
nas	qnap
my system is a linux based qnap nas so things might be a little different there

39905
filesystems	ntfs
my os is ubuntu 12.04 and the removable hard drive has ntfs filesystems

39907
nas	qnap
the qnap nas products run firmware that is essentially a custom linux distro

39907
nas	qnap
here s the output i get from a qnap ts-239 pro nas with a western digital re4 1tb drive output is verbatim except for the drive s serial number which i have purposely obscured

39911
filesystems	ntfs
your filesystems is damaged for ntfs volumes you should run a chkdsk under windows system but it s nearly impossible to recover

39917
filesystems	ntfs
this is all filesystem-agnostic so it is safe even with an ntfs filesystems as it operates on the disk surface level

39943
daemons	systemd
reserving some number of filesystem blocks for use by privileged processes is done to avoid filesystem fragmentation and to allow systemd daemons such as syslogd 8 to continue to function correctly after non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to the filesystem

39956
xfce	gnome
under unity gnome xfce i am able to set up a dsl connection and everything works fine

39957
internationalization	localization
would it be more interesting if i said that machine a is os x lion and machine b is ubuntu 12.04 both of which it would seem reasonable to expect to have correct internationalization localization settings

39983
ubuntu	linux
always when i install linux os ubuntu there is a possibility to encrypt the home directory

39989
ubuntu	debian
configure online repo for debian and offline one for ubuntu

39998
vmware	esx
- virtual machine on vmware esx 4.0

40017
redhat	fedora
it is the default distributed by redhat so it will be on fedora rhel centos

40018
gentoo	linux
in my system gentoo linux i have secure locate

40033
folder	directory
and my idea was to symlink to apache www folder from the ftp user directory

40053
filesystems	btrfs
as far as i know ext4 jfs and btrfs filesystems all support an extra field in the files inode to store the creation time though the naming might differ

40062
google-chrome	firefox
it has pretty much all you want except maybe for tagged bookmarks is lighter than firefox google-chrome and is based upon webkit

40069
ubuntu	debian
you might want to consider a fedora debian ubuntu or suse distro to prevent driver problems

40074
x86	64bit
scroll down in the list the rpm s are listed at the top the tar archives are at the bottom example linux - generic 2.6 x86 64bit compressed tar archive is at the bottom of the list

40085
unix	bsd
in unix linux bsd a signal is a more-or-less asynchronous event cpu tried to execute an illegal instruction i o is ready code divided by zero the modem hung up

40092
sudoers	passwd
i have also added a user and passwd and altered the sudoers file to suit

40115
ubuntu	linux
i want to write a driver to make it control my music player on my pc ubuntu linux

40131
folder	directory
you should now have a folder called 2010_07_16_rt2860_linux_sta_v2.4.0.0 inside you home directory

40157
debian	linux
please suggest to me the lightest debian linux release with console only no gui

40157
ubuntu	debian
later i ll install my own chosen gui and applications for my needs from debian ubuntu repositories

40170
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 12.04

40186
apache	nginx
in the future nginx will probably replace apache in base

40197
versioning	upgrade
when you downloaded the updates meta info from update server the program will check if any packages you installed that has a newer versioning if so that package can be upgrade

40211
filesystems	btrfs
another way to go is using filesystems snapshot support for example like yum with btrfs snapshots also snapper on opensuse

40221
filesystems	ntfs
linux driver gives us a chance to interface with an ntfs filesystems

40221
filesystems	ntfs
thanks to this driver we can use built-in linux commands on an ntfs filesystems

40221
chown	chmod
ex ls chown chmod cd locate rm ln etc

40273
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
what most linux package managers don t have is an easy way to revert an upgrade typically you need to manually download the old versioning of the package and force its installation

40279
solaris	bsd
under other oses it s available with other names such as dtrace solaris and ktrace bsd

40287
hash	md5
if you need to guard against malicious damage then md5 is the fastest hash which is secure enough although it does have known weaknesses and so sha2 is strongly preferred

40298
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
postgresql often simply postgres is an object-relational database management system ordbms available for many platforms including linux freebsd solaris microsoft windows and mac os x

40301
ubuntu	debian
for example you can install xdotool on debian or ubuntu sudo apt-get install xdotool and you re done

40302
jobs	cron
constantly excuting the date command can be quite frustrating and repetitive when checking the time for running cron jobs

40313
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
this is my first time to use centos and i ve rarely used linux ubuntu at all

40343
centos	linux
the epel extra packages for enterprise linux repo for centos 6 does include fluxbox

40380
debian	linux
the idea is to install a flavor of linux which can serve as an alternative to windows for my regular work software development and net surfing plus gives me a chance to learn the coolest os ever as a kid in my company calls it he s suggesting that i go for debian btw

40381
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
my opinion and it s only that is based on using linux since the early 1990s from slackware red hat debian gentoo compiled from scratch in addition to ubuntu for the last few years

40385
ubuntu	mint
to that end i suggest you try ubuntu first perhaps a live cd like levon said if you don t like the new unity interface and you wouldn t be the first check out mint or kubuntu

40396
openbsd	freebsd
openbsd and freebsd have these frameworks within their respective repos

40399
bash	tcsh
say i modify a lot of code that uses tcsh but since a lot of people say that bash is more modern i d also like to learn bash along the way

40401
debian	linux
almost all systems are running debian gnu linux 6.x squeeze

40410
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
i d like to install a base fedora system meaning without all the other programs applications that come when installing a gnome kde xfce spins

40422
kde	gnome
get fedora livedvdï¼œ you can choose minimal install terminal only or with gnome kde

40432
folder	directory
i d rather have expected some directory not empty error because why shouldn t you have the permissions to delete this folder

40443
debian	mint	debian	linux
i want to install kde on my linux mint debian edition which as of 10 june 2012 corresponds with debian wheezy

40443
cinnamon	gnome
i already have cinnamon a gnome shell fork installed which has regular gnome 3 dependencies

40443
kde	gnome
other people also mention problems see kde install destroys gnome desktop

40443
kde	gnome
is it safe to install kde along with gnome 3

40443
kde	gnome
related question is is possible to use kde as well as gnome on a machine

40444
ubuntu	debian
list your largest installed packages on debian ubuntu

40445
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
but using zsh just to emulate tcsh and bash is just plain dirty not to mention overly complex

40449
bash	tcsh
if you have a script currently written to use tcsh and you want to use a few bash-specific features you can invoke bash explicitly

40449
stdout	stderr
for example bash makes it much easier to redirect stdout and stderr independently

40450
ubuntu	linux
ok i have my linux ubuntu pc and a window 7 pc networked together

40451
mouse	keyboard
are you keyboard mouse wireless or just usb

40455
versioning	upgrade
if the version-number is higher than the versioning installed it should be upgrade

40456
filesystems	btrfs
with btrfs or any other copy-on-write filesystems i expect it would do nothing for forensic destruction of the data though all the other hard links to the file would be composed of junk

40467
debian	linux
i work with a lot of scientific software on linux distributions normally debian variants and red hat variants

40477
sudo	passwd
your options are to either use sudo to give non-root users permission to run iwconfig wlan0 without a passwd or setup a crontab which regularly saves the output of iwconfig wlan0 to a file which users can access

40488
spaces	linefeed
joining therefore means to replace all occurrences of the sequence cr linefeed spaces with an empty string and otherwise leave the file alone

40494
spaces	linefeed
related to how to join vcards lines vcard does a weird kind of line splitting if a line contains more than 75 characters insert a cr linefeed spaces sequence

40515
opensuse	linux
suse linux enterprise server receives much more intense testing than opensuse with the intention that only mature stable versions of the included components will make it through to the released enterprise product

40516
opensuse	linux
suse linux enterprise server is the enterprise version of opensuse

40521
folder	directory
even if this i would rather recommend to create symlink to target folder from existing directory

40547
daemons	systemd
in general you should identify your requirements fast reliable secure no user should be able to cause an disk space full for systemd daemons etc

40550
switching	screens
darkice is started in screens with -d switching that instantly detach screens

40552
folder	directory
in var www create a folder public_html and reconfigure that as your root directory for apache

40573
stdout	stderr
they should be set for stdin stdout and stderr but for all other files you have to use the codecs.open function and specify the encoding you get from locale.getpreferredencoding and you have to initialize locales like in c with locale.setlocale locale.lc_all

40590
cpu	processors
cpu 2.0 ghz intel pentium 4 processors with 400-mhz front side bus and 512-kb l2 cache

40612
dmz	was
if i was you i would seperate my network so the webserver is in a dmz

40633
ubuntu	debian
this may not quite be what you re looking for but debian and probably ubuntu by now supports the etc apt sources.list.d directory

40662
bash	zsh
i do most of my work in zsh on os x and this surprise bit me in bash on centos

40668
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux ubuntu 12.04 pc connected to the internet with a greenpacket wimax usb modem

40683
mouse	keyboard
after booting into linux i get to gdm3 or lightdm tried both login screen but my keyboard and mouse won t work

40683
mouse	keyboard
this includes a mouse and keyboard that have been connected via usb

40683
mouse	keyboard	mouse	trackpad
when i unplug the usb keyboard and mouse and plug them in again they work but not the internal keyboard and trackpad because i can t unplug plug those

40683
mouse	keyboard
there also was a proposed solution of removing the keyboard and mouse settings from xorg.conf because that is handled by evdev now but all of these solutions didn t work

40683
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard works fine in the terminal but as soon as i start x by doing startx or starting gdm3 or lightdm the keyboard and mouse cease to work

40690
packets	multicast
a simple technique to get a rough estimate of where your drops are is to install mtr on your server and then run an mtr session to trace packets loss to a single multicast client while you are transferring your 100m file

40690
packets	multicast
when you say reliable i assume that means there is some kind of packets sequencing built into the multicast service and the client application knows how to request a retransmission from the server

40695
cpu	processors
so i suppose if the work was done by several processors concurrently the cpu time would be higher than the elapsed wall clock time

40718
kde	gnome
i know that there are options for gnome kde etc.

40725
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu but i think this applies to all linux

40732
bash	zsh
zsh generally has better interactive features and better programming features than bash

40740
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
darcs is a revision control system less well-known than cvs subversion git mercurial or bazaar

40762
jobs	cron
the use of this tag should pertain to the unix facilities cron at or that are backgrounded using a shell s jobs capability

40775
debian	linux
--label debian linux kernel 3.6.0

40787
postgresql	mysql
_the options on mysql and postgresql stop the ascii art image

40792
cos	sin
btw bc can calculate even very complex expression with roots logarithms cos sin and so on

40817
udp	tcp
you should be able to see from the mediatomb section that upnp is working on the standard port 1900 over udp not tcp and is open in both directions this is the main port for you

40818
mouse	keyboard
the only thing that works is unplugging and replugging in the mouse and keyboard

40819
filesystems	xfs
restoring to an xfs filesystems on fedora 17 yields 78 gb used space

40830
debian	centos
i primarily use xfce terminal and terminator under either centos or debian

40842
folder	directory
i m trying to make a script for my magic folder that will move files to a seeding directory without ktorrent losing track of where the data is similar to the move data context menu action in the application

40843
put	get
put it all together and you get print me the first 9 alphanumeric or underscore bytes from dev urandom

40925
stdout	stderr
to redirect both the stderr and stdout output to the same file similar to as seen on terminal use

40934
folder	directory
my username is guyfawkes and in my home directory i have folder www which contains all my repos

40937
ubuntu	debian
when updating a system for example between two ubuntu versions or more interesting when running a rolling release like debian testing or archlinux there seems to be the danger of loosing optimal hardware support when the kernel version is updated

40937
ubuntu	debian
do i have to check the hardware support manually before each update or is it checked automatically in the three distros mentioned above ubuntu debian testing archlinux

40948
ubuntu	debian
i m looking for compatibility with ubuntu debian rhel-based etc. so i m not tagging this with any particular language

40948
bash	zsh
i d like this in bash but if you have a zsh script that will work also

40975
bash	zsh
in zsh or bash â 4 based on the file name

40984
filesystems	fat
this will make a fat filesystems

40984
filesystems	ntfs
if you need an ntfs filesystems there s always mkfs.ntfs but you should be aware that some implementations are buggy

40984
ubuntu	debian
fire up the kde partition manager if you don t have it the debian ubuntu package name is a slightly non-standard partitionmanager

40985
ethernet	wireless
but - the problem - when someone is using the ethernet cable and plugs it out and switches to wireless the share dissapears and it can t mount it

40991
ubuntu	debian
you would probably be better off creating a .deb package for debian based distros including ubuntu and .rpm package for red-hat based distros including fedora and making the .tar file available for everybody else

41013
filesystems	ntfs
support for ntfs under operating systems other than windows tend to be a bit flaky so choose this filesystems only if you need windows compatibility and large files

41127
daemons	systemd
reserving some number of filesystem blocks for use by privileged processes is done to avoid filesystem fragmentation and to allow systemd daemons such as syslogd 8 to continue to function correctly after non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to the filesystem

41133
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
in one hand i have general daily linux fedora centos archlinux ubuntu

41136
ubuntu	centos
fedora ubuntu centos archlinux are direct competitors in the sense that while they do things slightly differently they are still targeting your pc and or your server

41136
freertos	ecos
from your list rtems freertos ecos

41157
disk	ram
with synchronous behavior it wouldn t really matter about available ram or spare cpu cycles because everything would be waiting on disk activity

41168
mouse	keyboard
moving your mouse around pressing random characters at the keyboard or running some disk-based activity for example in another console running ls -r or find -name foo should generate entropy

41181
chown	sudo
is there a way to leave the file ownership as before without using su sudo or chown

41192
disk	ram
ram is a relatively expensive commodity compared to disk but still quite cheap

41198
versioning	upgrade
since you probably want to upgrade to versioning 13 a versioning with long term support i would not recommend updating the package repository entries in sources.list

41208
bash	zsh
the shell bash zsh ksh dash whatever reads the command

41219
mint	live-cd
from linux mint community tutorial for installing grub2 and configuration boot with a linux mint live-cd live-usb and install grub2 letting linux set up grub for you

41247
installation	upgrade
the upgrade could potentially affect any existing cygwin installation

41254
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you have your own network at home you can combine this with wpad - web proxy autodiscovery and google-chrome firefox ie and probably safari

41254
google-chrome	firefox
another client based solution is to use something like foxy proxy - an extension to dynamically switch your proxy settings in firefox google-chrome and ie

41270
udp	tcp
wan tcp udp 113.193.x.x1 53 dns 192.168.1.5 53 dns

41270
udp	tcp
wan tcp udp 113.193.x.x1 80 http 192.168.1.5 80 http

41270
udp	tcp
relwan tcp udp 115.119.116.x.x1 80 http 192.168.1.11 80 http

41270
wan	subnet
a in case of isp a there public usable ip address are on same subnet so the gateway used for the wan ip is same for the other public ip address

41270
wan	subnet
b in case of isp b there public usable ip address are on different subnet so the obvious the gateway ip for them is different from wan gateway s ip

41332
bash	tcsh
i m fine with both tcsh and bash scripts

41334
stdout	stderr
i want let crontab redirect normal stdout to dev null but mail stderr to user

41349
postfix	dovecot
i m running centos 5.6 with postfix dovecot amavis spamassassin and clamav

41354
stdout	stderr
if you want redirect both stdout and stderr then

41376
vim	emacs
regarding ide â well some consider vim emacs to be one of

41381
stdout	stderr
what s the best way to suppress output stdout and stderr unless the program exits with a non-zero code

41382
bash	subshell
i seem to misunderstand the bash rule for creating a subshell

41407
ubuntu	debian
does the same hold true when comparing ubuntu lts with debian

41407
ubuntu	debian
when trying to build up a mirror for ubuntu lts i noticed that the packages were coming from a debian repository.

41409
backslash	dollar-sign
the trick is to double-quote the string you feed to eval so that myvar gets substituted with 6 and to backslash the outer dollar-sign so that eval gets a string 6

41414
ubuntu	debian
although it s not recommended to mix debian and ubuntu packages on a single system

41414
ubuntu	debian
the closer in time the freeze of the two releases the freeze of ubuntu lts and debian s release the better compatibility you ll have

41414
ubuntu	debian
don t expect either the debian or ubuntu communities to give you much sympathy if things go wrong

41417
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is derived from sid the unstable and rolling release version of debian every ubuntu major release is nothing more than a sid frozen at a certain point in time and enriched with everything that transforms a debian into an ubuntu distribution

41418
bash	zsh
unfortunately the method differs between ksh bash and zsh

41418
bash	zsh
for your use case in any shell with arrays all ksh variants bash â 2.0 zsh you can assign to an array variable and take the element you wish

41418
bash	zsh
beware that ksh and bash arrays start numbering at 0 but zsh starts at 1 unless you issue setopt ksh_arrays or emulate ksh

41418
bash	zsh
in ksh93 mksh â r39b bash â 2.0 and zsh you can use the array assignment syntax

41419
debian	linux
using debian linux is there a way to automatically kill some processes before memory gets too scarce for smooth operation

41422
stdout	stderr
nothing there are three standard file descriptions stdin stdout and stderr

41424
bash	subshell
what s happening is that bash detects that sleep 5 is the last command executed by that subshell so it calls exec instead of fork + exec

41426
ubuntu	debian
no debian and ubuntu are not binary compatible

41426
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu may use different compilers with different abi different kernel versions different libraries different packages version etc

41426
ubuntu	debian
as not all ubuntu packages are in debian and vice versa deb packages may also depend on uninstallable versions

41426
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
but it is important to understand that the relationship between ubuntu and debian is not anything like between rhel and centos

41427
bash	zsh
here s a bash ksh93 zsh script that emulates the core behavior of rsync where you can easily tune the decision to copy or not copy a source file

41442
debian-based	linux	debian-based	mint
in linux mint debian-based how can i edit what the shortcut ctrl + alt + t launches

41444
automake	autotools
have a look at a tutorial for autotools or go browse the official automake documentation

41457
bash	tcsh
tested with bash and tcsh

41480
put	get
if you don t put in a sort before the uniq -c you ll probably get a lot of false singleton words

41480
gnu	groff
the gnu groff distribution has a file named eign in it which contains a pretty decent list of stop words

41483
daemons	systemd
for a daemons run under systemd user the program that changes the user can be su or some other tool such as debian s start-stop-daemon

41517
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu has a script imported from debian which does the install for you

41517
ubuntu	debian
later edit here is the script which ubuntu and debian use

41537
xfce	kde
thought perhaps kde was interfering something but here in xfce the problem persists

41545
vim	emacs
because i m a vim user i d like to do this with vim not emacs

41558
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
for debian ubuntu arch gentoo

41560
spaces	delimiter
which cuts the first field delimiter by a spaces and removing the squeare brackets

41582
rpm	yum
if youre asking whether this restart is performed automatically by yum during the update then there is no guaranteed way to know short of extracting the rpm preinstall postinstall scripts of every package

41587
bash	zsh
talking about differences between zsh and bash

41587
bash	zsh
with quotes around and zsh and bash behave the same and i guess the result is quite standard among all shells

41587
bash	zsh
without quotes results are the same for and but different in bash and in zsh

41588
stdout	stderr
that will pass stderr to stdout after tee therefore it drops to your stdout in terminal

41590
ubuntu	linux
i have heard that we can customize linux say ubuntu as we wish by changing its source code and can make whole new os

41591
ubuntu	linux
a big part a major part of the ubuntu source code is outside of linux

41593
minix	linux
the reason people suggested minix to you is simple it s a full operating system but it s not burdened by the needs of a system as complex as linux

41593
minix	linux
after all the first versions of linux were inspired by minix

41611
jobs	cron
i ve got some machines that run scheduled cron jobs every night and email me the output

41645
versioning	upgrade
i am using ubuntu 12.04 and dovecot versioning is 1.2.9 i want to upgrade my dovecot versioning from 1.2.9 to 2.1.7

41659
openbsd	freebsd
note that this feature is currently supported by the gnu freebsd and openbsd sort implementations

41671
bash	zsh
at least bash and zsh do

41706
freebsd	opensolaris	openbsd	freebsd	opensolaris	openbsd
this means that it should be easier to make cross-platform software for other posix compliant os like freebsd openbsd opensolaris and even mac os x

41708
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux installed ubuntu for the first time yesterday and have never dealt with any unix-based os

41710
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
on linux you type in apt-get install or yum install or emerge for debian ubuntu fedora and gentoo respectively

41710
filesystems	xfs
most distros let you chose between several different filesystems including ext4 xfs jfs reiser etc

41715
apache	cherokee	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	cherokee	nginx	lighttpd	cherokee	lighttpd
if you don t like apache use lighttpd or nginx or cherokee or .

41735
debian	centos
lsb- isn t installed doesn t exist on base centos or debian systems

41738
ubuntu	mint
i need to use a usb drive as an installation media for my mint and ubuntu

41755
filesystems	fat
the ext4 filesystems allows some characters that fat does not allow such as

41765
udp	tcp
i have two machines with two applications that talk to each other on few network ports tcp and udp

41769
cifs	smb
the cifs protocol is the successor to the smb

41773
vpn	lan
the lan has a dhcp server giving to each computer an ip address according to their mac address if the mac address is unknown by the dhcp server then it gives an ip address under a subnetwork that cannot connect to the vpn

41794
bash	zsh
unique features of bash compared to zsh

41799
ubuntu	debian
the discussion on debian bug #511121 has a pointer to two patches one of which is in some versions of ubuntu

41807
installation	upgrade
the long term solution an upgrade of our site s procmail installation which now honours config settings and ignores the bare period passed flags are no longer required

41821
pop-up	dialog
i mean all sounds on startup on dialog box pop-up on error and so on without turning off the actual media sound

41823
cinnamon	gnome	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
one solution was maximus however it doesn t work on kde only on gnome family des gnome shell unity cinnamon

41827
titlebar	window
you can also modify the settings on a window-by-window or application-by-application basis just click on a window titlebar s top-left icon then go to advanced â special window settings or special application settings

41831
disk	ram
improving disk cache performance in general is more than just increasing the file system cache size unless your whole system fits in ram in which case you should use ram drive tmpfs is good because it allows falling back to disk if you need the ram in some case for runtime storage and perhaps an initrd script to copy system from storage to ram drive at startup

41886
vim	emacs
in editors like vim and emacs one can use hotkeys like c-p vim or m- emacs to perform auto-completion on the current word using other words in the same buffer

41902
bash	zsh
short answer no not with classical shells like zsh or bash as typically your shell and terminal are different entities

41903
rsa	dsa
there is more detail on this page which describes importing your rsa or dsa key into putty format

41906
octal	hex
the value is hex x1b or octal 033

41919
sudoers	visudo
you can modify rules in etc sudoers via visudo as mentioned above if sudo is installed

41929
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have read in forums and googled results that refresh is not needed in linux ubuntu linux mint etc like systems

41930
kde	gnome
if your files entities are accessible over a medium inotify and famd don t support because it s not a locally accessible â directoryâ the gnome vfs using sftp or the kde sftp ioslave

41932
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux ubuntu 12.04 server machine which works with an usb sound card

41933
bonjour	avahi
setting up a zeroconf avahi bonjour etc server will help them find each other by name

41934
switching	screens
while i could amend the vncclient to temporarily switching the left and right mouse buttons this then requires a user-interface running outside the view port using up valuable screens space

41934
switching	screens
i believe it s possible to remap the behaviour at the server end using xmodmap or xinput and i could add a button on the taskbar panel to run a script for this already planning such for switching between windows and running xrandr to rotate screens the downside is that the image will be static i d like some visual feedback on the state and i m not sure if it will handle the right click to restore the settings

42004
sudo	passwd
â œsuperusersâ as in the users who can obtain administrative privileges are the users who either know the root passwd or are authorized to execute commands as root with a mechanism such as sudo

42004
sudoers	visudo
if there is no sudo or admin or wheel as i said before the name is a matter of convention and there can be more than one such entry you can create one with addgroup and add the line to the sudoers file use visudo to edit that file

42004
sudoers	visudo
alternatively instead of creating a group you can add individual entries to the sudoers file again use visudo to edit this file

42009
mouse	keyboard
you can obviously do all this with a mouse if you don t like keyboard commands

42010
int	double
in the following script that i wrote i is an int index and mytime is a decimal double float number

42022
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux

42041
vpn	lan
i want to use a small pc as vpn endpoint and route through it for other machines on my lan 192.168.0.0 24

42056
stdout	stderr
at their essence when working with standard unix cli programs and shell builtins collectively called commands from now on filters need a precise expected format for stdin stdout and stderr in each filter step in order to work correctly

42069
sudoers	visudo
if you want to give a group of users the right to re start tomcat add a line to etc sudoers using visudo

42074
ubuntu	linux
i have a 35 gb file on a remote linux ubuntu server

42079
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
lxde can be installed on many linux distributions including debian fedora opensuse and ubuntu

42079
opensolaris	bsd
lxde also runs on opensolaris and bsd

42082
folder	directory
gnome2 ubuntu 10.04 lts i ve made a nautilus script so that if i have a directory full of various codecs then i just need to right click in that folder - scripts - thisscript.txt then presto it recursively converts all the video files identified by video mimetype to x.264 codec with 128 kbit mp3 to avi

42086
kde	gnome
gnome is fairly simple compared to kde but not nearly as customizable and it s getting less customizable it seems

42086
kde	gnome
however it s possible to run kde apps using gnome etc buy you need to also install whatever supporting libraries etc are required for them

42086
ubuntu	debian
being new i d recommend sticking to a mainstream distro like fedora ubuntu debian etc as 3rd party software is more likely to have an easy install for their programs

42091
punctuation	words
use to break text into a single words per line without punctuation

42118
traceroute	packets
i think you refer with trace-ping to traceroute which print the route packets take to network host this will help you troubleshooting networking issues and packets loss

42127
gentoo	linux
if you have to ask then you re not ready for arch linux or gentoo although you might find them a fun way to learn more

42127
debian	mint
i d suggest mint debian edition

42140
gentoo	linux
the situation server with gentoo linux and samba on it

42147
bash	zsh
add this line export path path to dir in your .bashrc if using bash or .zshrc for zsh

42175
disk	ram
it looks like the source filesystem is damaged typically either due to a kernel bug or to bad ram a damaged disk is more likely to result in unreadable files than corrupted data

42175
disk	ram
do a ram test or plug the disk into another machine

42179
ethernet	wireless
the fact that every interface can have a different ip the loopback interface is a network interface just like your ethernet card or your wireless usb receiver

42184
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
other alternatives include lxde and xfce which are more lightweight than either gnome and kde as well as not using a desktop environment

42184
lua	scheme
the utmost in configurability comes from window managers that are scriptable in a programming language such as sawfish scheme and awesome lua

42185
stdout	stderr
in that case it prints nothing to stdout and some error message to stderr and exits with a non-zero status fairly standard

42196
sudo	passwd
set up sudo to allow your regular account to do root things but with a passwd

42252
put	get
i ve tried to automate the command with expect inside a bash script but i am obviously doing something wrong because i get a number of different errors depending on where i put the quotation marks basically

42284
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu the package is libpam-pwdfile not sure about redhat derived distros

42289
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
every other download for linux i m being asked what distribution i have ubuntu fedora debian etc

42290
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
as of version 13 linux mint gives users the choice between cinnamon and mate as their default desktop environment in the main release edition with ubuntu as its base

42290
ubuntu	mint
so packages for ubuntu 12.04 according to the list of mint releases should work

42309
nas	qnap
i have a sample nas server qnap ts-210 with very limited linux on-board although a bit reinforced with optware ipkg

42362
daemons	systemd
now you only have to tell systemd to reload its daemons files and start the service

42364
ubuntu	debian
are there any good reasons concerning performance to choose another distro debian archlinux... and do the base install with that distro instead of ubuntu alternate

42371
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
for more lightweight your best bet is a system using debian ubuntu alternate slackware arch linux or other distro that gives you more control on what you run on your system

42379
rar	zip
takes all files with supported archive formats which should at least be the most common like zip rar 7z tar.bz tar.gz .

42384
ubuntu	debian
using debian ubuntu alt you ll have a lot more control over what is installed you can choose an even lighter desktop graphic environment

42411
folder	directory
i know that my system reads the current directory and one level deeper to be able to show the cute mini-icons on the folder indicating the contents

42415
awk	ksh
my solution is short and i have previously written versions in c lua python perl awk ksh and csh the version below is ksh. some specific questions you can answer with ansi_dn nd_isna and dow given a date yyyy mm dd what is the date 100 days before or after

42426
freertos	ecos
ecos and freertos is also completely not unix linux

42426
freertos	ecos
what is the main differences between hurd and freertos ecos and general unix linux

42426
freertos	ecos
can i name freertos or ecos tree as hurd family

42428
freertos	ecos
no neither ecos nor freertos are hurd based

42436
stdout	stderr
by typing play xxxx in the console you re running it normally with stdin stdout stderr all connected

42441
bash	zsh
if your shell is ksh or bash or zsh you can make the shell do the filename matching

42448
folder	directory
my trash works on xfce and here s what my directory structure looks like in .local share which is the only place i have located a trash folder

42449
opensuse	linux
i am pretty new to linux and trying to setup cakephp on opensuse 12.1

42452
subnet	packets
the rule says do masquerading for all packets that originate from the client subnet and are addressed to hosts outside the client subnet

42455
vim	gedit
for example run gksu gedit etc xorg.conf or sudo vim etc xorg.conf

42474
g++	gcc
i seem to be missing some man pages notably gcc and g++

42474
put	get
how much work is put into those files - if i get one is it likely to be 99 correct or do they really differ a lot with time architecture

42477
migrate	upgrade
i m trying to migrate from 2.6.32 to 2.6.37 but the structure changed so much i will have weeks of work to upgrade my code

42490
packets	multicast
suddenly as of yesterday multicast packets are no longer being received from eth1 private gigabit network from one node

42490
packets	multicast
multicast packets can be seen between all the nodes 20+ except one - using tcpdump

42498
debian	linux
i recently acquired a raspberry pi and have installed debian squeeze on it and after doing a small bit of research i m not too proficient with linux i found and ordered a usb wireless dongle levelone wua-0605 n_max wireless usb adapter that appears to have support for linux

42505
centos	linux
i am tired of fedora project s policy of 12-14 month support cycle they may have their reasons and intend to migrate to something more stable like scientific linux or centos

42508
packets	multicast
therefore i think you have a bug in the software listening for the multicast packets

42526
debian	linux
i am using debian squeeze and am new to linux

42554
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu linux

42556
heredoc	herestring
this is called a herestring as it uses a short string in contrast to a whole block as in a heredoc

42560
ubuntu	centos
i have tested it and use it in production with centos ubuntu and slackware machines both physical and vps

42581
ubuntu	debian
the details of how run-levels are interpreted may vary from distro to distro but 0 and 6 are used as described here in debian and debian-derivatives like ubuntu

42583
daemons	systemd
similarly daemons and systemd services that expect to be running as a certain uid or have the ability to change uid or expect files to be in etc rather etc and so on aren t likely to work well if at all

42584
perl	tcl
personally i prefer the perl module expect itself is tcl but there are implementations for many common scripting languages

42591
filesystems	ntfs
after reading through all the back and forth on this i suspect that the ntfs filesystems has been damaged

42621
kde	kubuntu
for kdm the kde display manager add your command to etc kde4 kdm xsetup or etc kde3 kdm xsetup for older versions that s the path on debian i haven t verified that kubuntu uses the same path

42654
centos	linux
i m running centos but i m a linux noob

42667
hash	md5
the following method was top-voted on commandlinefu.com find duplicate files based on size first then md5 hash

42668
ubuntu	debian
my setup is a small desktop running debian testing and a laptop running ubuntu lucid sometimes vista

42675
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu

42703
kde	gnome
in case you re planning to have a kiosk-like setup there are lockdown tools for both kde kiosk tool and gnome sabayon

42724
post	get
then post successful authentication a command need to get executed automatically

42728
stdout	stderr
i know that 1 stdout and 2 stderr but what are the 3 and the for

42729
stdout	stderr
now will redirect the file descriptor 1 to stderr and will redirect file descriptor 2 to 3 which is stdout

42729
stdout	stderr
so basically you switched stdout and stderr these are the steps

42733
x86	64bit
the device appears to have a 32-bit x86 processor so it shouldn t be hard to set up yet copying libraries from your probable 64bit system would end in disaster

42738
mouse	keyboard
it looks like the problem occur only after resuming from sleep and beside mouse freezing i get intermittent short beeps like on keyboard error for no discernible reason

42745
sudo	passwd
but as there is no terminal attached after you logged in you must be able to run sudo without a passwd

42754
opensuse	linux
and please tell me how to know if psftp is already installed in my server both opensuse linux and windows

42763
uninstall	upgrade
you ll end up with a jumble of files of unknown origin with no way to manage dependencies upgrade or uninstall software

42764
sudo	passwd
if your server allows arbitrary shell commands you can use sudo but most file transfer programs don t have a feature to invoke it and pass it a passwd

42776
stdout	stderr
it s swapping stdout and stderr

42776
stdout	stderr
but if somewhere earlier in the script it does a redirection using exec or the script is run with a command line including redirection then swapping stdout and stderr will do something

42776
stdout	stderr
in your specific case the command that s having its stdout and stderr swapped is dialog

42776
stdout	stderr
so perhaps the person who wrote the script wants dialog s output to go to stdout instead of stderr for some reason

42781
debian	mint	debian	linux
i m trying linux mint debian edition xfce and want to use a specific theme

42789
bash	zsh
if you combine this with execute bash scripts on entering a directory or directory specific shell configuration with zsh you can easily change the settings per directory or parent directory if you enter into a directory in work you can automatically adjust the environment variables to change your email address

42791
traceroute	packets
if you will traceroute to 192.168.2.69 your packets will be routed to your network s gateway 192.168.1.1 and then further on via that machine s default route

42792
subnet	packets
so if your router receives a packets addressed to a host in a subnet it doesn t know 192.168.2.x it forwards that packets to the default gateway

42792
subnet	packets
and that router follows the same train of thought either it knows a subnet and the next router in the direction of that subnet or it will forward the packets to its default gateway

42824
filesystems	btrfs
filesystems reiserfs and btrfs on my internal harddisk btrfs on the usb drive

42842
stdout	stderr
all of your output from the find command including error messages usually sent to stderr file descriptor 2 go now to stdout file descriptor 1 and then get filtered by the grep command

42845
xen	openvz
or in different openvz units or different xen domus or on different hardware

42868
solaris	sunos	opensolaris	sunos	opensolaris	smartos
opensolaris releases openindiana smartos etc illumos based oses and current solaris 11 sunos 5.11 based oses are still using it

42869
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
i m using linux mint myself and trying to answer your question exhaustively i am forced to acknoledge that linux mint and probably all of ubuntu or even all of debian has become quite nasty when it comes to what used to be a quite simple task .

42872
debian	linux
i have a basic dual setup with linux debian and windows 7 grub is my bootloader

42873
debian	linux
if you do not care at all for the data stored on that machine you can insert a bootable install cd and install into that debian partition which will probably get formatted before the new linux is installed

42878
bash	zsh
i m using bash but i use zsh occasionally

42893
chown	sudo
i chown the directory to me so i don t have to fiddle with sudo

42896
redhat	fedora	opensuse	linux
i have read that opensuse is to suse linux enterprise desktop what fedora is to redhat enterprise linux but is there a document that explains this in more detail

42935
width	height
if equalalways is set then all new windows will be created equal in width height or both depending on the value of eadirection

42947
folder	directory
i need to change the folder permission of the directory opt and i know in linux you do the following

42954
sudo	passwd
if sudo is not installed on the system you will need to gain elevated privileges using su you ll need the root passwd when you will be able to use chmod in exactly the way you would on linux - using either absolute or symbolic permissions

42967
kde	gnome
you may have to change the desktop environment when you do do the upgrade to 12.04 as the latest default des gnome or kde are memory hogs

42982
rpm	yum
the problem is that the sdk for the board is extremely basic and doesn t include make or any update manager like rpm yum or apt-get

42988
debian	linux
for a lightweight desktop out-of-the-box try crunchbang linux which is based off of debian and uses the super-lightweight openbox desktop

42988
ubuntu	debian
if you don t mind configuring things yourself you could always install ubuntu server debian archlinux or any other distro that doesn t install a graphical desktop by default and then install and configure the desktop yourself

42997
filesystems	btrfs
filesystems wise i would very much like to suggest using btrfs the reason for this is that it provides block-level checksums

43006
bash	tcsh
you can use set -o vi to change your line editing commands as jahroy posted but you may be thinking of the fc command available in bash and i think ksh but probably not tcsh which will put the previous command into an editor fcedit or editor which you probably have set to vi and then executes the command when you exit the editor

43009
vim	emacs
personally i use vi actually vim for most of my editing but i prefer set -o emacs in the shell

43030
bash	zsh
command works both in bash and zsh

43031
sudoers	passwd
either make sure that permitrootlogin is set to yes in etc sshd_config or add a passwd for the root account or make the account you can log in to a sudoers account and give it a passwd

43040
put	get
ask the first installed one to put its loader into mbr and manually add records for all others into list of the loader of the first distro and you would get boot-time manual selection

43045
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
but everything that has perl and python and mono and ... bindings gnome kde and likely xfce is going to require a few more packages which will add up to a lot of mb to download

43051
tunnel	packets
when long output would be sent to the terminal this is what would happen long output means large packets means over the real mtu limit say if you re connecting thru a tunnel

43069
debian	linux
i have a geforce 250 gts card and i am using the proprietary drivers in linux kde on debian testing

43069
kde	gnome	google-chrome	firefox
i need a reasonable graphics card for some gaming in windows but in linux i am just using basic kde and gnome applications iceweasel firefox google-chrome gimp etc

43081
switching	screens
cap 5 entry for xterm allows the visual editor vi 1 to switching to the alternate screens

43081
switching	screens
switching between the normal and alternate screens for cut and paste

43082
switching	screens
one nice feature would be to have a button i could press to get a real gui login back but i don t really mind that since i m happy to just switching to a console screens and switching x-windows round that way if i need it

43096
freebsd	linux
for the goal to prevent multiple copies from running use flock linux lockf freebsd shlock provided with some systems less reliable

43099
dynamic-languages	compiled-language
it s a compiled-language cross-platform with the ease of programming of a dynamic-languages and support for concurrency and communication

43126
filesystems	btrfs
i have an opensuse 12.1 install on my main desktop running with btrfs filesystems for root boot is ext4

43126
switching	screens
i used alt+f1 to switching to a terminal screens and although i was sure i was no where near the 1tb limit of my hard disk i moved some 150 200gb of music and video files onto an external drive and rebooted

43128
rpm	yum
yum as opposed to rpm will resolve all dependencies needed

43135
ubuntu	linux
on a sandbox vm environment i have a setup of ubuntu linux which is firewalled and cannot be accessed from outside the local system

43135
sudo	passwd
therefore on that vm i d like to give the administrative user which i set up the ability to run anything with sudo and not need a passwd

43148
folder	directory
i m in a server through ssh and the directory is full of random files and folder and the password for the next level is inside one of the files

43165
versioning	upgrade
will apt-get always upgrade to the latest versioning regardless of which source offers the latest versioning

43173
macbook	bootcamp
i m trying to install 64-bit maya on the new macbook pro with retina display using a bootcamp partition

43185
wan	lan
from this i would know at what time my lan wan isp makes troubles

43195
kde	gnome
i d like to get working like it is in gnome kde but iâ m looking for a lightweight solution without gnome-power-manager and similar

43214
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu are moving to a new multiarch implementation spec

43294
bazaar	git
that said i d also like to mention distributed version control systems like mercurial git bazaar etc

43300
stdout	stderr
by default you ll have both stdout and stderr

43300
stdout	stderr
in your terminal stdout is given the file handle 1 and stderr is given the file handle 2

43300
stdout	stderr
the second command throws away stdout and prints only stderr

43300
stdout	stderr
the third command throws away stderr and prints only stdout

43303
jobs	cron
basically i have rsync set up with ssh keys and cron jobs

43327
folder	directory
i recommend avoiding reinventing the wheel and instead using tree which presents a directory s files folder and subdirectories files folder

43355
bash	zsh
set a bash ksh zsh array ct to the output of wc -lm then use shell arithmetic

43359
put	get
i heard some people saying that i should put swap closer to the head of a partition to get higher performance

43361
debian	linux
coming from debian servers and little experience with linux desktops and gnome i have only heard of the default unix permission system

43388
installation	upgrade
so in order to upgrade my ruby installation and gems rails i

43389
bash	tcsh
the bourne shell can be used as an interactive shell just like bash or tcsh

43389
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
modern shells like bash zsh tcsh etc have many features that bourne shell doesn t have that make them more comfortable and convenient for interactive use command history completion etc

43416
ubuntu	mint
i have tried mint and ubuntu and the new ubuntu is what i would suggest

43421
filesystems	ntfs
its original filesystems was ntfs but i formatted it to ext4

43428
jobs	cron
if it exists what is the maximum number of cron jobs entries

43430
uptime	reboot
i m on debian testing and after reboot after an uptime of 3 weeks or so that included a bunch of package updates i believe including the kernel the other day the fine-adjustment - what a golfer would call putting - of the mouse pointer position gets really hard it feels like the pointer is still moving although the the trackpoint is already back at its center position

43431
daemon	cron
cronies limit seems to depend on the filesystem maximum file size as the cron daemon stores the crontab entries per user in a linked list - see user.c from cronie for details

43450
lvm	umount
naturally you need to umount any filesystems on the disk and it d be a good idea to deactivate any lvm groups vgchange -an and generally make sure nothing is using the disk for anything

43483
opensuse	linux
newer syntax for suse linux enterprise 11 sp2 and opensuse

43487
folder	directory
how is it that if you are in a folder with various files --- pictures binary executables scripts even directory zip files just about everything --- how it is that when you hit ls -l you get output that is similar to the form for all files

43488
folder	directory
directory or folder are just a way to match up a file name to an inode the metadata apart from the name file type permissions ownerships etc live in the inode

43526
vim	emacs
it seems to them to represent linux unix in some way and prove that the environment is obtusely difficult to use. i remember when i was first forced to use vim the sysadmins refused to install emacs

43528
debian	linux
i am trying to compile glib 2.24.2 under debian 64bit gnu linux 6.0.4 squeeze using

43536
bash	zsh
if your shell is ksh93 bash or zsh you can use process substitution

43538
unix	solaris
given the fact bin and usr bin are interchangeable under solaris and this is a trend on other unix like oses too whether type bash will return bin bash or usr bin bash depends only on what first appears on your path and anyway doesn t matter that much

43540
profiling	debugging
dts debugging store buffer for debugging and profiling instructions

43540
x86	64bit
ia64 intel itanium architecture 64bit not to be confused with intel s 64bit x86 architecture with flag x86-64 or amd64 bit indicated by flag lm

43554
bash	zsh
for example my favorite shell is zsh but here i ve just started a home-compiled version of bash that isn t in the

43563
cpu	processors
the features are obtained from looking up the cpu id with read_cpuid and looking it up in the processors type definitions known at compile time where the features are expressed as a mask of hwcap_xxx flags

43563
cpu	processors
unfortunately each arm cpu manufacturer has its own method for reporting processors features if any

43568
gentoo	linux
in that case i would recommend you arch linux or gentoo

43576
ubuntu	debian
i will do a minimal install of ubuntu or debian server

43579
ubuntu	debian
i don t know how ubuntu fares as a server os i tend to use debian

43582
gentoo	debian
installing debian archlinux gentoo bsd should be no problem

43582
kde	gnome
when installing graphical applications you have to consider that the apps of the kde or gnome projects tend to be a bit heavy-weight

43582
vim	emacs
there are some very good console-based apps that are even lower on resources like mutt slrn vim emacs mpd links2 etc

43582
debian	linux
debian is also text-based but more intelligent and when selecting a minimal installation it will also just install the most basic things to boot you into a linux shell with the option to select and install whatever other programs you need

43614
integer	unsigned
usr src linux-headers-3.2.0-3-common arch x86 include asm uaccess_64.h 53 6 warning comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions -wsign-compare

43640
tunnel	packets
however there is something else you can do encapsulate the ethernet packets using an ip-in-ip tunnel between the two ppp endpoints then use brctl to bridge the ethernet and tunnel interfaces

43643
ssl	https
how would you set up squid so that everything else is transparent e.g ftp http etc. except for ssl https which needs to be set manually

43659
vpn	lan
and now i want to access the pc b in the local lan of pc a a is in vpn net with my macbook i can access pc a with my macbook so vpn works i just need some way to route the traffic from the macbook over pc a i guess to reach pc b in the lan of pc a i cant add pc b to the vpn net because i dont have physical access to it

43663
ubuntu	debian
on my ubuntu 10.04 workstation there have been two security updates to the libtiff4 package in the last couple of weeks addressing the cve-2012-2088 vulnerability but none to libtiff4 on the debian installation

43680
folder	directory
the problem is the directory that contains most of the data on the disk is in a certain folder that when listed in testdisk lists as a directory

43698
filesystems	xfs
i noticed that xfs does not implement a fsck at system boot and one of the reasons touted in that journaling filesystems help ensure the filesystems is in a consistent state after an unclean shutdown

43726
udp	tcp
you can have tcpdump log all port 53 udp and tcp activity

43736
debian	linux
if you re on a debian based linux you can unpack your ramdisk like so

43747
daemons	systemd
every process in a unix-like systemd just like every file has an owner the user either real or a systemd pseudo-user such as daemons bin man etc and a group owner

43747
temp	tmp
to protect a user s temp files tmp has the sticky bit set so that only i can delete my files and only you can delete yours

43760
centos	linux
i m stuck with a pretty old linux distribution at work centos 5.4 from the end of 2009 and also don t have root access

43762
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
if i m using ubuntu or linux mint the only two flavours i ve tried and know work for sure i can run something like this

43772
vtk	itk
in python import vtk worked but import itk did not work yet

43777
lvm	btrfs
it has four hdds combined into a software raid 5 md device on that an lvm and on that btrfs

43782
freebsd	solaris
i don t use sco but on my various freebsd machines at home and the numerous solaris machines here at work ctype.h is in usr include

43792
tunnel	vpn
some tunnel vpn

43804
kde	gnome	google-chrome	firefox
if you start having multiple alternatives for each program gnome and kde firefox and google-chrome â the sky s the limit

43804
ubuntu	linux
if you feel like comparing with the size of windows keep in mind that a linux distribution contains much more than the equivalent of windows distributions like ubuntu and fedora ship a lot of applications that you would need to install separately on windows

43806
ubuntu	linux
if you have a file called lib ld-linux.so.2 you have gnu libc the same library that you have on your ubuntu pc and any other non-embedded linux

43808
opensuse	linux
update please read the question i ve opensuse and linux is a bit weird

43819
mouse	keyboard
i like to work in linux without using the mouse because of that i would like to know if there is any method to set a keyboard shortcut to set gnome-terminal tab title

43837
min	max
min max sequence numbers 4379495

43844
gentoo	linux
on a gentoo linux box which i m not administering and to which i don t have root access how can i find out the options which were used to compile the package

43844
gentoo	debian-based
please note i ve never worked with gentoo before but have good working knowledge of debian-based distros

43851
daemon	cron
what you want is the cron daemon

43851
daemon	cron
feed you favourite search engine for cron daemon and you have a bunch of manuals and instructions

43860
filesystems	btrfs
my first guess was btrfs since the i o processes of this filesystems sometimes take over

43872
daemon	cron
my vote is for the cron daemon

43876
stdout	stderr
the problem is your designated output from dd goes to stderr and not stdout so you have to redirect stderr as well and not only stdout

43876
bash	zsh
for bash and zsh you can use instead of | which will also redirect stderr to stdin of the second command e.g

43880
daemons	systemd
if you turn on the systemd at 7 59 50 and the at daemons starts at 8 00 01 should the job be executed

43892
solaris	netbsd
on systems that support it solaris free netbsd mac os x oracle linux a simple dtrace script would be a useful tool for this task

43895
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
usera is a sudoers but after i create a new normal user sudo createuser xxx assign passwd and login with this new account it s the same

43911
bash	zsh
read -t is a kshism also supported by bash and zsh but not standard

43925
versioning	upgrade
here s the solution i came up with to hold unhold nvidia pkgs i usually only want to upgrade nvidia pkgs when i m willing able to log out of my current x session...and after a few unpleasant surprises with new nvidia versioning i like to test them on my least-important machine first

43926
ubuntu	debian
it s available pre-packaged for debian and presumably for ubuntu too

43936
profiling	debugging
i already know callgrind offering some basic profiling features but only with debugging information and lacking most of the other mentioned information

43937
redhat	fedora
based on the files you mention i think you re on fedora redhat or similar

43963
kde	gnome
is it possible to have an or some alternative launchers open with for each file type and be able to trigger them using keyboard modifier keys shift ctrl alt in linux s kde and or gnome file managers dolphin and or nautilus

44000
put	get
in order to get your interactive settings in login instances of bash you should put this code in your .bash_profile

44013
debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
i have to find a free gratis command line solution to convert primary microsoft powerpoint presentations into html files 1 html file per foil on linux debian opensuse

44029
portrait	landscape
unfortunately it comes out landscape and if i try to make it portrait it s squished over to the left and tiny only up taking 50 of the page

44046
sudo	passwd
i m trying to setup sudo with no passwd but still i get prompted for passwd

44065
subnet	packets
does the router y see packets bound to 192.168.0.0 from c and automatically drop them whereas when packets originating from the same subnet b get allowed

44066
tunnel	vpn
create an ip-ip or vpn tunnel between computer c and computer a

44067
tunnel	packets
the last command is to forward packets from your newly created tunnel device to your virtual ethernet devices

44074
ubuntu	linux
i have ubuntu installed on one and a backup from a direct copy of an older arch linux install on the second

44091
sudo	passwd
see why is sudo telling me my passwd is wrong

44092
multiplying	add
also i would like to be able to arbitrarily adjust add 42 and then multiplying by 7 every numeric field contained in this file

44103
disk	ram
in the past i had a similar issue in the past many many years ago and it turned out it was some cups log or something and i simply redirected that one not important logging to a real ram disk

44104
portrait	landscape
the whole purpose of this is to be able to print the resized content as 2 portrait a4 sheets instead of 1 landscape a4 but actually creating new pdf files would be better than printing directly as they can then be reprinted anytime and shared with other people who ll then be able to print them directly as intended as well

44136
bash	zsh
in bash or zsh

44138
macports	homebrew
i am a bit frustrated with macports lately and homebrew

44138
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux	slackware	archlinux
so i am curious if anyone here has had any experiences with running a linux distro like slackware archlinux debian or a unix os such as freebsd on their macbook pro

44149
daemons	systemd
on unix-like operating systemd a daytime server is usually built into the inetd or xinetd daemons

44162
gtk	motif
wxgtk is the linux implementation of wxwidgets on top of the gtk library there are others such as wxmotif on top of motif

44162
rpm	yum
only packages installed with the rpm command or commands that call it such as yum are known to the package manager

44162
ubuntu	debian	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian
if you want to have a lot of packages get something like debian or ubuntu or fedora or gentoo

44164
hide	show	move	drag
if you want to hide some icons and show others expand the icon area to see all the ones you want to see and click and drag to move them around

44168
bash	zsh
you can see it with the limit zsh built-in seems to be analogous to ulimit -u in bash

44170
ubuntu	mint
i shortlisted mint which is based on ubuntu

44174
opensuse	linux
opensuse is a quite kde centric linux distribution

44178
ubuntu	linux
the easiest way to make the transition to linux in my case was setting up a dual boot system with windows and ubuntu where the windows system simply didn t get to be booted anymore

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i would install a dual boot setup with ubuntu or mint two of the friendly desktop linux distros

44185
gentoo	linux
if you want to learn the in and outs of the boot process and all the other linux goodies a distro like gentoo or slackware might be a good playground for you

44200
opensuse	linux
if you don t like opensuse definitely try mandriva linux

44207
vim	emacs
a clipboard is nothing special and just a implementation detail for some programs x emacs vim and other programs have implementations what you could refer to as clipboards

44213
ubuntu	debian
this is especially important when the example i ve given hasn t actually been tested with ubuntu release names merely adapted from what i do with debian for testing sid experimental packages i mostly use debian rather than ubuntu ....in principle it should work

44219
mouse	keyboard
i don t like using the mouse at all so if you know how to bind this to a keyboard shortcut please tell me

44223
filesystems	ntfs
you could have a home partition using any linux filesystems and a separate data partition formatted as ntfs

44238
gentoo	debian
there are a number of advantages over distributions like debian stable gentoo slackware arch

44238
disk	ram
packages loadable on-demand even though it primarily runs in ram packages can be loaded on-demand which means you can use a usb disk to store a set of packages for one purpose web server

44251
mouse	keyboard
if you prefer the keyboard over the mouse then ctrl-l is very fast.

44271
debian-based	ubuntu
while working with ubuntu and other debian-based distros i ve noticed that packages in the software repos often contain the major version number

44273
versioning	upgrade
my company s dependence on particular versioning of gcc autoconf and perl might be on a 5 year cycle while my os might be on a 3 year upgrade cycle

44275
short	base
short version is you need to copy your config files for openvpn to conf base etc local etc openvpn

44280
cvs	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn
ikiwiki supports git svn bazaar monotone mercurial darcs cvs and is written in perl

44309
mouse	keyboard
i like having keyboard paste a special key on my left hand because that means i can move the mouse around with my right hand and i don t have to move from mouse-to-keyboard-and-back with my right hand all the time

44328
post	get
my guess is that you can use vts via gui under solaris to get post configured the way you expect it

44347
openbsd	linux
these are the basis of openbsd firewalling the linux equivalent is netfilter mostly controlled by the iptables command

44347
openbsd	linux
comparable but not compatible and most say that openbsd is superior to linux in this aspect

44369
lvm	mdadm
grub2 is capable of booting linux from all common linux filesystem types on lvm and mdadm software raid devices - whether used separately or in combination

44381
xfs	btrfs
i am trying to research on jfs btrfs xfs and ext4 in particular

44401
versioning	upgrade
if above solution doesn t help then try to upgrade your distro to the latest versioning

44402
cpu	affinity
now if you doubt from you cpus you could expose them to an intensive job like compiling a kernel or any other big source like libreoffice xorg etc...you can use cpu affinity if you ve got several cpus

44408
stdout	stderr
and then redirect all stderr and stdout from those commands into

44411
ubuntu	debian
it is used by debian ubuntu and their derivatives

44432
stdout	stderr
i use to redirect stdout and stderr at the same time

44441

bash	zsh
in bash ksh and zsh you can use the select keyword for that

44478
ubuntu	debian
on newer debian and ubuntu systems your keyboard settings are put in etc default keyboard and shared between x and the console

44502

44502
ubuntu	linux
5 menuentry ubuntu with linux 3.2.0-24-virtual recovery mode

44502
ubuntu	linux
use grub-set-default ubuntu with linux 3.2.0-24-virtual instead

44510
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
this applies to any filesystems that partimage supports including fat and ntfs so it doesn t matter that you re backing up windows partitions

44533
hide	show
ctrl + k i - hide all windows except the current one press again to show all windows again

44535
folder	directory
however i don t know how to move an existing folder to another folder thereby becoming a subfolder of the destination folder or to move a subfolder up one or more levels in the directory structure mv folder

44557
chmod	sudoers	chown	sudo	chown	sudoers	chown	chmod
i can configure sudo via the sudoers file to allow a user to run the chown and chmod commands on any file or directory in the system

44557
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
restrict sudo such that the user may only run chmod and chown from within var www html

44561
sudoers	visudo
you can restrict the command to be used by myuser with all arguments in etc sudoers file with the command visudo add

44575
disk	ram
manual symlinks would not be persistent since dev is a kind of ram disk

44591
ubuntu	debian
i ve been trying to use a socks proxy which i have been using with success from an ubuntu 11.4 box with gnome on my debian box with kde.the socks server is bound to the local port 1080 through the following ssh command

44596
centos	linux
i have a centos release 5.4 linux box on amazon ec2 that i m trying to set up to be monitored via nagios

44600
vmware	virtualbox
you can communicate using nat mode also which means that the virtualbox or vmware acts as a network address translator in between the windows and ubuntu vm

44605
debian	linux
i need to write a couple of linux debian startup scripts

44606
for-loop	loops
the for-loop iterates over this set of matches using as loops variable

i am using lxde rather than gnome or kde

44622
next	except
you need whitespace on each side of the brackets except when the character next to it is a shell punctuation character

44623
chown	chmod
even if you did restrict the application of chown and chmod to files under a specific directory someone could still pass a symbolic link and so affect files anywhere they like

44655
put	get	post	put	post	get
curl is a cli tool for issuing http get post put request

44692
min	max
i need to read the file contains 16k rows and print the entire row if any of columns and all columns contains max value 100 and all columns contain min value 0 .the ouput example is given

the type of the filesystems is ntfs

44713
debian	linux
i m using debian linux

44725
filesystems	btrfs
i am asking for tool for btrfs filesystems

44732
ubuntu	debian
the sfill secure-delete home page is now seems to have vanished but it is packaged for debian and ubuntu

44745
folder	dir
win is a folder in my home dir

44746
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
man mount has a section mount options for ntfs assuming your filesystems is ntfs and not fat where it says

44746
filesystems	ntfs
will mount the ntfs filesystems with all files having

44748
octal	decimal
you have to first convert the decimal value of i into its octal value and then you have to print it using using printf and putting in front of their respective octal values

44748
octal	decimal
to print a you have to convert the decimal 65 into octal 101 and then you have to print that octal value as

44753
post	get
if so please post it so we can get a better idea of how you have your site set up

44774
kde	gnome
one for gtk gnome and the other for qt kde

44785
freebsd	linux
so if i want to use a linux script in freebsd and i run . script.sh in the shell it will run the bash script in sh and not bash since bin sh in freebsd is not bash

44785
bash	zsh
i would like to run bash script trough zsh if possible

44785
bash	zsh
don t want to install bash and since zsh can run bash scripts.

44788
folder	directory
i do not know how each and ever nix deals with thumbnails but at least in my case ubuntu gnome all thumbnails are by default kept together in one place the .thumbnails folder in my home directory and in subfolders like .thumbnails normal and .thumbnails large

44797
yacc	bison
this can involve quite a lot of steps like special pre-processors moc for qt code for example code generators flex yacc or bison for instance compilation linking and possibly post-processing steps building tar.gz or rpm files for distribution

44815
opensuse	linux	opensuse	mint
this is surprising because both the live version of linux mint from which i installed it and the opensuse running on the same computer on which i m currently typing this are connecting quite fine over the very same network cable which i didn t touch in the mean time

44822
udp	tcp
so any tcp udp aware applications should be able to use them as a gateway to route their traffic

44837
opensuse	debian
checkbashisms should be packaged by different distributions for debian it is in the devscripts package - fedora in devscripts-minimal it used to be in rpmdevtools and opensuse in rpmlint-mini

44845
gentoo	debian
i don t know the reasons for gentoo but in debian mount.cifs has the suid bit set and it is supported by upstream nowadays

44849
post	get
if you get it sorted please do post what you ve done because i m not satisfied with the obvious methods of processing the 1000 s of video files i need to demux

44866
ethernet	wireless
i can get the wireless to work but only if i connect the ethernet cable in for a second or two

44866
ethernet	wireless
wireless is still up after ethernet is removed and i can putty my way in

44870
rpm	yum
anyway if the rpm command doesn t show anything for installing it the easiest way is using yum for downloading it from online repos

44894
hash	salt
since there is no salt which is a grave security flaw you can look up the hash in a table

44895
redhat	fedora
or use the stable release which is a bit like redhat to testing s fedora at this time squeeze is the stable release and wheezy is testing

44938
bash	zsh
either use an actual file or use process substitution a ksh93 feature also available in bash and zsh

44954
pthreads	fcntl
hylafax is intended to run on any unix system that supports a particular set of features fifo special files bsd-style sockets and the tcp ip communication protocols bsd-style file locking flock or equivalent functionality from which it can be emulated fcntl lockf and pthreads 1003.1-style interfaces including termios for manipulating tty devices

44975
ethernet	wireless
in order to keep the power and size foot print small i want to stay away from using a computer with three nics and i was wondering if there are routers no need to be wireless 802.11 won t be used that would be suitable linux access to all ethernet interface can support batman-adv

44976
rpm	yum
with yum being unhelpful in this case is there somewhere or a way dependencies for an rpm can be downloaded without having download each one individually

45006
ubuntu	debian
in a debian ubuntu system you could just add a sudo before the find command

45015
daemon	cron
the script is called by cron daemon

45036
folder	directory
the folder with the pkgindex file is that directory in the auto_path

45039
lan	localhost
this command will listen on the localhost network interface and will ignore requests from other interfaces like your lan

45045
centos	linux
if you want something that has a longer support cycle use red hat enterprise linux or one of the rhel clones like centos

45050
filesystems	ntfs
if the filesystems were ext3 ext4 ufs zfs or any kind of unix filesystems you will not have any kind of problems but i guess you are mounting an ntfs or even fat32 disk

45053
filesystems	xfs
once you have it installed select the correct block device partition and format it using a filesystems like ext2 3 4 jfs xfs resiserfs etc depending on your needs

45072
ubuntu	linux
it works fine on my home computer ubuntu but in a work computer scientific linux enterprise linux the prompt colors are actually spelled out

45077
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
extra packages for enterprise linux or epel is a fedora special interest group that creates maintains and manages a high quality set of additional packages for enterprise linux including but not limited to redhat enterprise linux rhel centos and scientific linux sl

45080
hash	salt
i have been able to extract the salt and the hash and i know the plain text password

45080
hash	salt
i am wanting to input the salt and password and get back the password hash so the i can compare it to what is stored on the server

45089
sudo	passwd
of course i could type in my username and passwd and then sudo shutdown -h now

45103
hash	salt
if you have perl or if you want to use a c program see this answer to a similar question which shows how to extract the password hash and compute a hash of the supplied password with the same salt under linux

45123
debian	linux
is there a way to up downgrade the ios of my ipod touch 2g under linux especially debian

45125
vim	emacs
i am currently learning to use emacs it s been a few months actually after years of using vim

45139
debian	linux
i m running raspbian â œwheezyâ a debian based linux distribution for the raspberry pi and i would like to know where i can change the desktop environment that boots with the os

45158
kde	gnome
i don t have enough experience with kde or gnome to know how their filemanagers deal with extensions.

45215
ubuntu	debian
in response to rush s comment my rename is is actually a link to prename shipped with debian s and ubuntu s perl package

45219
rpm	yum
what i do is copying rpm files from var cache yum i386 17 fedora updates packages to the corresponding directory of the pc

45240
pulseaudio	mixer
if on the other hand you use pulseaudio you should see only one channel in the kmix mixer in this case the answer is a little out of my league

45259
bonjour	avahi
i suspect the services shared by windows including shared folders can be looked for with a samba command similar to avahi-browse -a for exploring the avahi bonjour services available in the local network

45293
bonjour	avahi
you can also discover the services that have been published through avahi bonjour mdnssd with tools like avahi-browse -a cli and avahi-discover gui

45293
bonjour	avahi
modern gnu linux distros and mac os x usually publish itself and their shared services through avahi bonjour for the discovery in the local network

45314
vim	emacs
i use tmux and vim for split-screen editing in a terminal-based environment though you could use any command-line based text editor for this nano emacs etc.

45334
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
pf short for â œpacket filterâ originated on openbsd and is also available on freebsd netbsd dragonfly bsd and mac os x

45377
umask	chmod
read readonly set shift times trap umask wait busybox cat chmod

45408
vim	emacs
i m working in xcode so vim emacs solutions won t help

45428
filesystems	fat
ms-dos and other filesystems where the directory hierarchy is all mixed up with the allocation fat are pretty fragile

45437
filesystems	ntfs
they re a byproduct basically any reasonable unix-like filesystems design and even ntfs is close enough on this point has hard links for free

45486
stdout	stderr
the problem is the error messages are not send to stdout but stderr

45486
bash	zsh	stdout	stderr
if you have something like bash or zsh you can use to automatically redirect stdout as well as stderr

45487
stdout	stderr
the errors are printed to stderr not stdout

45487
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout before the pipe and then all of your output will go through grep

45491
ubuntu	centos
iâ m planning to set up several virtualized centos rhel or ubuntu guest machines on a single centos host server most likely using kvm

45491
ubuntu	centos
the guest vms run centos rhel and ubuntu distros

45505
stdout	stderr
i redirected stdout to but didn t redirect stderr since i thought there would be nothing on it

45511
stdout	stderr
call close 2 closes the stderr filedescriptor of the process for stdout the filedescriptor is 1

45512
gentoo	linux
emerge is the main command-line tool of the portage software suite which is the package management system used by the linux distribution gentoo and its derivatives calculate and funtoo linux

45512
freebsd	netbsd	gentoo	openbsd	gentoo	freebsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
the gentoo alt project works on porting portage to other operating systems using ports collections freebsd netbsd openbsd osx

gentoo	linux
there are at least three distributions which widely use this tool calculate funtoo and gentoo linux

45518
bash	zsh
i recently switched to zsh from bash and i m using oh-my-zsh

45520
debian	mint	debian	linux
i d like to install linux mint debian edition into the fedora partition and the boot loader that comes with it grub2 iirc while not messing up the windows part

45632
icmp	tcp
bad or typical fingerprinting scanning packets bad tcp ip flags xmas most icmp types etc

45642
gentoo	ubuntu
use ubuntu installation livecd to install gentoo

45651
ubuntu	debian
i tried ubuntu debian etc

45666
put	get
anything that is established related should be accepted or put through a existing tcp connections chain and outgoing tcp that doesn t get caught by that could be rate limited

45674
kde	gnome
im pretty new to kde 4.8 and i can not figure out how to get this behaviour that i used to have in gnome

45674
kde	gnome
in gnome is possible to configure the windows to always appear in a specific desktop and this is what i want to achieve in kde

45679
folder	directory
final question in a unix environment do folder directory

45680
folder	directory
folder is a term used by mac and windows people to refer to directory

45682
systemtap	perf
i think that if you really wanted to track it down the first step would be trying to watch your disk usage patterns more carefully maybe with atop iostat or even more powerful tools like perf or systemtap

45683
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux x86_64

45694
titlebar	window
you can get to it if you right click on window titlebar and select advanced special application settings or special window settings if you would like to apply only to specific window and not all windows of this app

45737
ubuntu	centos
i m trying to get the colors in an ssh terminal session with a centos machine to look the same as it does when i m ssh d into my ubuntu server

45748
folder	directory
is it only the desktop directory or all directory in your home folder

45781
sudo	passwd
now when run this script install and sets up the environment without error but you have to enter your sudo passwd more than once due to sudo s time-out value by default

45786
ubuntu	debian
running this script with sudo will raise a syntax error in recent versions of ubuntu and debian

45808
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
the advantage i see using lsof is that -p in netstat doesn t work for all unix flavors i happen to manage aix solaris and hp-ux besides red hat and use lsof cause all parameters are the same even though some features don t work as they should having propietary and non-standard filesystems could cause trouble finding file names or other information

45819
versioning	upgrade
the issue was fixed with the upgrade to versioning 3.3 though suspend still doesn t work

45819
ubuntu	mint
i recently changed distributions switching from ubuntu to mint and when i wanted to update to 3.3 i saw that 3.5 was out too i m not really kernel-aware

45828
folder	directory
i like tree it s a nice way to display my files and the size of folder directory

45874
folder	directory
you can place the script wherever you like but typically such scripts are saved in somewhere in your folder like and not in the global directory

45879
ubuntu	debian
as ubuntu is based on debian code base i was expecting that the same would work in debian too but it doesn t

45880
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian but includes things debian doesn t and in turn are often incorporated into debian later

45885
xfce	kde
what is the procedure for installing kde or xfce on debian 6

45893
folder	directory
when working with directory everything s fine and i can access the symlinked folder from everywhere

45893
folder	directory
to get inside the symlinked folder regardless of my current directory

45906
ubuntu	centos
i have a ubuntu server complaining of a status drdy and a second centos 6.2 server complain of the same error as the first and the first server has crashed in a new way.

45906
centos	linux
i have fix the first problem centos by moving it the a un-clusterd hyper-v and blacklisting all the linux integration drivers followed by completely uninstalling them

45906
rpm	yum
question is there a way of completely removing these drivers without using rpm or yum as now both complain it s there and not there and fails to remove it and trying to do anything too disk heavy like using rpm and yum cause the whole system to crash again

45909
bash	zsh
is there another recursive syntax supported by bash and zsh

45911
bash	zsh
both codes work in bash ksh 93 sure no idea about 88 and zsh so i guess yes shells do support recursion

45912
dpkg	aptitude
aptitude and dpkg have separate hold functions which won t respect each other unfortunately

45912
dpkg	apt
apt dpkg

45920
mouse	keyboard
the vnc service is meant to transports input mouse keyboard from the client to the server and output an image from the server to the client

45921
stdout	stderr
i want all lines of stderr output to have timestamps but if possible i want to leave stdout alone

45921
stdout	stderr
i also want one file all.txt to log both stdout and stderr either with or without stderr timestamps and a file dedicated to stderr output errors.txt with timestamps

45922
spaces	delimiter
input_file columns are tab delimiter only column 4 contains spaces

45922
spaces	delimiter
it is also necessary to keep the formatting output file to be intact.as all the columns are tab delimiter but the values in column 4 has spaces too d

45923
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout so we can pipe it later

45924
solaris	sunos
it works on linux specifically rhel6 but not on solaris sunos 5.10

45932
bash	zsh
this works at least with bash zsh and ksh

45935
dpkg	apt
you can use dpkg conffile support to put the file in etc apt sources.list.d

46012
filesystems	hfs+
the confusion was furthered by the fact that one of the partitions has a hfs+ filesystems which is specific to os x

46054
bash	subshell
note janos s comment implies this is not the case for bash . we can achieve the redirection of time s output by running time in a subshell and then redirecting the output of that subshell

46054
stdout	stderr
so now we have everything written to stdout and fd 3 will go to the terminal and everything written to stderr will go to the file

46063
centos	linux
i m migrating tomcat server from windows to linux centos 6.3 64bit and want to use samba to share tomcat directory to technical department staffs windows domain users with read+write rights

46066
solaris	bsd
i didn t check bsd solaris hpux because i don t have any

46081
debian	linux	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
to clarify what i want to do is run a given command and on debian or any of its derivatives it ll return something like apt on opensuse it ll return zypp on fedora et al it ll return yum on arch linux it ll return pacman etc

46089
ubuntu	linux
the only linux distribution which i have found which works out of the box is ubuntu 11.10

46094
ubuntu	debian
i am testing on live ubuntu 10.04 lts 32-bit live-cd and i was trying to reinstall debian squeeze 64-bit

46109
udp	tcp
note that the above allows three ports domain both tcp and udp for dns http tcp and https tcp

46109
wan	lan
also there is no wan interface traffic goes out over the lan

46114
ubuntu	linux
as a long time linux user i recently set up a new ubuntu 64 bit 12.04 lts system and was mystified as to why my bash scripts weren t working mdash

46135
ubuntu	debian
any suggestions on windows manangers configuring gnome or other debian ubuntu compatible distros

46136
ubuntu	debian
if you want a stripped-down debian ubuntu system then the easiest way to get it is to install the debian base system into a vm and then install only the packages you actually need with apt-get or aptitude or whatever

46137
ubuntu	debian
you could do with a minimal debian ubuntu install by individually selecting the packages you want

46137
putty	winscp
you are better off ssh ing to it using putty and copying files from to the vm using winscp or virtualbox s shared folders

46153
pop-up	dialog
every half hour or so a dialog pop-up on the side of my screen with the message -

46155
ubuntu	debian
also upgrading to a new version in debian or ubuntu usually is only installing new versions of the applications you have installed

46156
versioning	upgrade
after this updating with aptitude full-upgrade you can upgrade your software versioning on current distribution versioning

46168
chown	sudo
i have tried to change that to root sambashare with no errors with sudo chown sambashare stora however when i confirm it completed it is back to root root

46184
pop-up	dialog
if that dialog pop-up and the system is still responding you can run dmesg from a terminal to see the kernel s messages which will show the error

46196
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
is there a way to add a guest login account on welcome screen of linux mint 13 mate-32bits similar to the one present in ubuntu 12.04

46207
disk	ram
my setup is as follows i have my local workstation with home mounted from a nfs partition which works well in general and i also have a good chunk of ram so i have tmp setup as a ram disk

46210
ubuntu	mint
when i download the newest version of mint and ubuntu aren t they the same at their core kernel

46210
ubuntu	mint
with the sudo apt-get command can t i install ubuntu from a mint terminal

46211
switching	screens
alternatively is there a way to switching the video adapter to the resolution above physical resolution of the lcd screens and have the screens video adapter itself to handle scaling as used to be possible with crt monitors

46212
ubuntu	mint	dpkg	apt	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	mint
ubuntu mint and all other debian-based distros use dpkg apt as the packaging system

46212
redhat	fedora
other distros will use other systems redhat fedora suse will use rpm arch will use pacman

46212
ubuntu	mint
effectively mint is an ubuntu with some extra packages codecs not included with ubuntu for patent copyright reasons and a different theme to create a custom identity and avoid trademark plagiarism questions and user confusion

46212
ubuntu	mint
of course you can install any other gui in mint you could use mint s desktop environment cinnamon in ubuntu and technically reality is another story you probably will bump into package conflicts you should be able to install unity and ubuntu s visual identity themes icons in mint

46212
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	kde	kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon
in our case we would call cinnamon or kde gnome unity xfce a desktop environment a set of applications window manager panels notification tray items etc... that provide the user experience

ubuntu	mint
you can t install ubuntu from mint any more than you could take your cadilac to a car shop and ask them to make it into a porsche but keep the cadilac intact

46213
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
similarly you could theoretically convert a linux mint installation to an ubuntu installation don t try this it s a lot of effort but they are two distinct products

46216
spotify	last.fm
for streaming and support of spotify last.fm etc. use clementine

46229
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
there are a lot of software layers added on top of linux to create something like ubuntu or mint with infinite possibilities of configurations and choices to make

46229
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian	gentoo	mint
projects like red hat suse or ubuntu serve the purpose of businesses while others like mint debian or gentoo are managed by volunteers

46229
gentoo	linux
rolling release distros like arch linux or gentoo will make it available quickly in their repositories

46229
ubuntu	mint
what s the real difference between mint and ubuntu

46229
ubuntu	mint
for the record i should point out that i haven t used ubuntu for over 2 years and barely used mint for a few months 4 years ago

46229
ubuntu	mint
the differencce between mint and ubuntu is minimal after all mint is completely based on ubuntu

46229
ubuntu	mint
originally mint was simply a repackaging of ubuntu with 3 differences

46229
ubuntu	mint
a few years ago the schism grew wider as ubuntu tried to push the unity graphical environment mint community made a big deal about rejecting it

46229
ubuntu	mint
i have never tried it but i wouldn t be surprised if someone makes cinnamon run on ubuntu and unity on mint

46229
ubuntu	mint
differences between distros like mint and ubuntu are much more about the community and the subtle choices than it is about the software itself

46237
stdout	stderr
when you connect to a remote server you usually just have 1 channel for the normal user interaction or 3 channels if you consider stdin stdout stderr separate

46267
ubuntu	linux

there will be a password challenge unless you have set up dsa or rsa keys for a passwordless login

46280
disk	ram
you can also see detailed information about ram network and disk utilization

46280
munin	cacti
munin cacti and zabbix are some examples

46305
xfce	gnome
the title is quite exhaustive is there a way to retrieve the desktop environment name gnome unity xfce lxde kde... from the command line or using python

46334
versioning	upgrade
if there s a major bug in a program rather than upgrade it to its latest versioning the debian team patches the versioning in the stable release to fix the bug

46346
ubuntu	linux
i d like to find all of the files in my home folder on linux ubuntu in this case that contain a match a particular regular expression

46352
freebsd	linux
i found that there s setterm in linux and vidcontrol in freebsd but vidcontrol doesn t work for me and i think it s not that what i need because it s for vesa stuff

46370
ubuntu	linux
i have done extensive security testing as part of my work as a linux educator and have found puppy to be more secure than ubuntu even in root due to the above service reasons

46379
stdout	stderr
to grasp what s going on you must understand what stdin and stdout since it s not immediately related i omit stderr are

46385
x86	64bit
not an answer to the question but it may be difficult to upgrade all packages from x86 to amd64 but you can at least easily install the amd64 kernel package which will at least allow you to run 64bit applications and virtual machines and containers which may be enough for what you need

46421
debian	linux
these steps are based on what i know of the design of debian having used it almost exclusively among linux distros over the past 12 years including having used debtakeover before and the approach that i would take

46430
spaces	delimiter
in this example spaces and tab as the delimiter characters

46430
spaces	delimiter
the output delimiter is a single spaces

46457
ubuntu	linux
i recently found out about the upstart service starter that ubuntu is using and that is apparently the future to start stop jobs in linux

46457
sysv	systemd
it s pretty new to me i was used to the old sysv systemd of putting scripts in and i don t know if it s possible to stop a service call the service with the stop parameter although the parameter doesn t seem to matter that much anymore before other services are stopped

46479
ubuntu	linux
in linux you can modify the etc ld.so.conf file to do the same thing - and ubuntu adds the files in the etc ld.so.conf.d directory also

46494
sudoers	passwd
in your sudoers file you can add dev to allowed users and if you wish restrict which commands they re allowed to run and that passwd isn t required

46504
openbsd	linux
please do not recommend a linux solution truecrypt without checking that it works on openbsd

46535
bash	zsh
in case there s a difference in how this might be accomplished in different shells i will chose an answer that supplies methods for both bash and zsh over answers that only cover one or the other

46536
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
since btrfs is a multi-device capable and dynamic grow shrink etc filesystems i don t really need the lvm layer for my purposes

46536
filesystems	btrfs
other than that use a recent enough dm-crypt that has --allow-discards capability 3.1+ kernel and a filesystems that also allows discards btrfs ext ...

46541
stdout	stderr
and they are sort of invisible - outside of stdout stderr

46552
folder	directory
what are the corresponding folder directory in linux ok i m really running on a mac

46554
folder	directory
user-installed applications may be placed under usr local the conventions for which mirror those for usr or in directory under opt which slightly resembles mac os x s applications folder in which each application has a folder directly underneath and in that folder the directory typically mirror those found under usr

46567
mouse	keyboard
it should look exactly like this no more content is needed unless you want to configure keyboard mouse or similar devices

46587
bash	zsh
ksh93 zsh bash syntax

46596
sudoers	visudo
add the following line to the sudoers file use the visudo command

46619
filesystems	fat
this is not a tar file rather it looks like a very corrupted incomplete copy of a fat filesystems

46620
sysv	systemd
scripts will depend on your init systemd but for example with sysv init on debian you could put it in etc default rcs

46631
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i can boot into ubuntu desktop 12.04 64 bit lts and linux mint 13 mate 64 bit

46638
mp3	wav
the wav file generated by mplayer -ao pcm from an mp3 is in pcm format

46642
solaris	bsd
use the command ps -ef on linux and solaris or ps -ej on os x or bsd to see the user executing each process

46653
debian-based	ubuntu
debian-based such as ubuntu has etc issue this can a set of escape code such as n l when you try to login from another tty you ll see etc issue s content.of course it s when possible you don t use motd system

46658
bazaar	git
in contrast to all of this when you download a source archive or get source code from a revision control system such as bazaar or git build it and install it it usually installs to the prefix usr local unless you tell it to do otherwise

46665
mouse	keyboard
the problem with that is who gets the keyboard and mouse

46667
mouse	keyboard
in my setup they each get a vterm and the active one has keyboard and mouse

46668
kde	gnome
you can do that from the command line but the easier way is to choose start new session in kde i assume gnome has some equivalent but i m not familiar with it

46669
mouse	keyboard
the problem with that is who gets the keyboard and mouse

46669
mouse	keyboard
i was interested why exactly it becomes a problem who gets the keyboard and mouse

46669
mouse	keyboard
an individual display is defined by the x11 documentation as having exactly one keyboard and one pointer mouse but potentially multiple cpus monitors etc

46676
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
what you install from the software center or with an apt command apt-get aptitude or with dpkg is known to the package management system

46676
dpkg	apt
dpkg is the low-level package manipulation tool apt and friends are higher-level tools that invoke dpkg to perform the actual installation and also handle dependencies and package downloads

46676
versioning	upgrade
alternatively make your own .deb package â it s more work but it pays off if you upgrade often usually redoing the package for the next minor versioning is very fast or if you deploy to many machines running the same distribution

46684
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
according to the man page alltray works with gnome kde xfce 4 fluxbox and windowmaker

46700
ubuntu	debian
in particular i couldn t get the method described by what is the fedora equivalent to the debian ubuntu package search pages

46716
ubuntu	debian
i want to do some experiments with buffer overflows on my various virtual machines including but not limited to debian 6 ubuntu 12.04 fedora 16 but every time i try to execute the buffer overflow exploit i get the following message

46716
clang	llvm
gcc for instance uses gcc stack-smashing protector propolice clang llvm uses two buffer overflow detectors safecode and addresssanitizer

46721
clang	llvm
llvm clang

46721
clang	llvm
on llvm clang to enable disable adresssanitizer

46733
postfix	dovecot
i m going to build an experimental mail server with postfix + dovecot and mysql for user accounts

46748
rsa	dsa
instead of using sudo to force copying my ssh_host_ dsa rsa _key files into place i used ssh-keygen to create dummy ones for myself

46750
umask	mount
however according to the mount man page this option is not available for ext4 file systems and when i try to automount an ext4 stick this way i get an error message via dmesg | tail which tells me that umask is an unrecognized mount option and the mount operation fails

46750
umask	mount
is it possible to use somehow an if condition to decide whether to mount it with umask or not

46750
umask	mount
i studied the mount man page to solve the problem and discovered the mount parameter -s sloppy but i don t know how to apply this for autofs and it did not even work with normal mount command and umask

46753
versioning	upgrade
the best would be to upgrade to another lts versioning of ubuntu 8.04 to 10.04 is a supported upgrade path

46763
freebsd	netbsd
if you have gnu find or freebsd netbsd osx find it has everything you need built in

46766
bash	zsh
in ksh bash and zsh but not in ash you can also use which has different parsing rules is an ordinary command whereas is a different parsing construct

46768
openbsd	freebsd
there is a freebsd port which i think could easily be adapted to openbsd

46768
vim	emacs
you can edit the file in an editor such as emacs or vim that automatically decrypts and encrypts the file on the fly

46801
jobs	cron
it s not as reliable but for simple cron jobs you should be ok as cron does not by default allocate a tty to a script

46806
mouse	keyboard
i was able to forward the mouse but not the keyboard due to compatibility issues

46823
ubuntu	debian
you can also run memtest86 which on ubuntu is installed by default and is available from the boot menu i am not sure about debian but could be the same

46825
centos	mint	centos	linux
i had the same problem with installing centos 6.3 using virtualbox running on linux mint 13

46829
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
it looks like on kde desktops ssh-agent is not initialized properly when you first start the sshd service it works fine on other de like gnome or xfce

46830
daemons	systemd
it works either standalone mode puppet apply or in client-server mode puppet agent with puppet agents running on client systemd checking in with the master daemons on the server on a regular basis

46835
symlink	dotfiles
as it turns out this is the main reason people checkout their dotfiles into an isolated folder and then symlink into it

46835
folder	directory
git allows for something called a fake root where all the repository machinery is hidden in an alternate folder that can be physically separated from the checkout working directory

46845
virtualbox	esx	vmware	esx	vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox will take away too much performance since it is neither a hypervisor like xen or vmware esx or hyper-v nor directly kernel-based like kvm

46856
bash	zsh
login shells typically read a file that does things like setting environment variables etc profile and .profile for the traditional bourne shell .bash_profile additionally for bash â etc zprofile and .zprofile for zsh â etc csh.login and .login for csh etc

46856
bash	zsh
that shell might read a shell configuration file .bashrc for bash invoked as bash etc zshrc and .zshrc for zsh etc csh.cshrc and .cshrc for csh the file indicated by the env variable for posix xsi-compliant shells such as dash ksh and bash when invoked as sh if set and .mkshrc for mksh etc.

46856
bash	zsh
some shells read a startup file in this case bash runs the file indicated by the bash_env variable zsh runs etc zshenv and .zshenv but this is risky the shell can be invoked in all sorts of contexts and there s hardly anything you can do that might not break something

46876
pureftpd	vsftpd
i ve seen this before with vsftpd as the server but here it s pureftpd when the server was accepting the data connection but could not write a lock for the uploaded file

46880
ubuntu	linux
where can one get these builds and how to adapt them for a usual gnu linux system like ubuntu

46881
mp3	flac
need to convert all your flac files to mp3 for your media player

46889
put	get
scripting in a linux system is more closely equivalent to all the nuts bolts rods brackets clamps and welds that hold your car together all the wires hoses gears and shafts that get things where they go and most of the machinery at the factory that put it together

46912
ubuntu	linux
i don t know what desktop environment you re running how you gonna assign a shortcut key can varies but this script works globally at least on my ubuntu 12.04 box and arch linux

46915
freebsd	linux
in freebsd and also in linux how can i get the numerical chmod value of a file

46917
freebsd	linux
by the way i use stat command on linux box not freebsd because it investigate hfs probably work with ufs

46931
next	except
-t t passes t as the separator an unquoted backslash always takes the next character literally except when the next character is a newline

46934
ubuntu	linux
i couldn t find any publicly available distributions of ubuntu for android but the idea must similar to installing a gnu linux distribution into a chroot like here

46942
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
are there any debian based distributions that have a regular release cycles besides ubuntu or linux mint

46946
debian	mint	debian	linux
i mentioned about linux mint but do you know about linux mint debian edition lmde is a rolling distribution based on debian testing

46953
xfce	gnome
i tried to start raw x without any window manager without gnome without xfce etc and problem is still the same - so i guess it s not x s fault

46961
folder	directory
in a folder in my home directory every 24 hours

46961
folder	directory
i also want to perform a dump of all mysql databases every 24 hours and store it in another folder in my home directory

46977
sudoers	passwd
i also know i can change sudoers to disable passwd prompts but i am not interested in that

46999
switching	screens
this switching is usually done during the vertical blanking interval to prevent the screens from tearing half the old frame is shown and half the new frame is shown

47003
ubuntu	debian
since ubuntu 11.04 natty and debian 7.0 wheezy introduced multiarch support 32-bit and 64-bit libraries can coexist on one system

47005
debian-based	ubuntu
if you re looking for another debian-based distribution with up-to-date packages i would suggest ubuntu

47041
ubuntu	linux
this of course assumes that you have not changed the term environment variable yourself which is automatically set to linux only when you log into a virtual console under ubuntu it is set to xterm in console applications but this may vary between oses

47054
wmv	flv
this trouble can be solved when you install the system and the upgrades of the software which can include xvid divx 3gp mp4 wmv flv and other basic video codecs different of mpg

47104
gentoo	linux
if you re really interested in source take a look at linux from scratch and gentoo

47105
debian	linux
linux debian 2.6 and grub i managed to install it the boot loader on a usb flash drive

47112
redhat	fedora
i am just going through the service-list of a server centos 5 - the question will probably apply to other redhat fedora .

47123
folder	directory
a workaround for this might be to have your .ssh folder with your authorized_keys in plaintext in your unencrypted home directory

47129
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
this also means that you can cleanly uninstall the package with removepkg or upgrade to a new versioning with upgradepkg

47141
disk	ram
the point of having pages duplicated between swap and ram is to avoid waiting for the disk if either

47142
ubuntu	debian
take a look at fedora ubuntu or debian

47158
opensuse	linux
opensuse is not so much an operating system but more likely a distribution of linux

47158
x86	64bit
so if you want to transfer one program to another system you may just copy it comparable hardware assumed 32bit 64bit x86 processor or copy the package rpm deb or just a tar file perhaps gzipped or you may transfer the sources and recompile it which sometimes is the hard way but assures the best performance of the compiled program due to compiler optimization

47232
truecrypt	umount
is there any way to have truecrypt automatically umount the container after a given amount of inactivity in dir

47258
ubuntu	linux

47268
zsh	tcsh
what are the equivalent functions in tcsh for the following zsh functions

47272
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
the file works well under zsh and bash but it does not work well in tcsh

47273
ubuntu	linux
i don t know anything about backtrack linux but iirc ubuntu s installer is rather clever and should be able to detect both windows and another linux bootloader and automatically configure itself to chainload into either

47281
rar	zip
now i d like to verify all files which contain verification information like zip archives including libreoffice and other xml-in-zip kind documents 7z and rar archives self-extracting exe arcives etc.

47302

on my debian ubuntu systems the script etc x11 xsession sets the variable

47411
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs
the gparted cd makes it easy to move and resize partitions and most common filesystems including linux ext2 3 4 xfs and windows ntfs

47422
ppp	dhcp
usually when you connect with dhcp or ppp your computer receives dns server addresses and the software updates etc resolv.conf automatically to add your provider s dns servers addresses and remove them when you disconnect

47422
debian-based	ubuntu
with debian-based distributions ensure you have the resolvconf package installed it s now installed by default under ubuntu as it takes care of managing etc resolv.conf

47424
buffering	sigpipe
when head exits tail receives a sigpipe signal and dies so it won t have read more than a buffering size s worth typically a few kilobytes of lines from the input file

chown	chmod	chown	passwd
is there any way i can force re-entry of my passwd for certain commands i m thinking for rm chmod chown vi .bashrc c

47554
chown	chmod	chown	passwd
i have thought of chmodding .bashrc and .bash_profile to read-only for all users including myself and then alias chown chmod whatever to a script that requires a passwd but that seems so hacky

47555
disk	ram
a is not directly affected by this operations at least for the moment since it is running in ram and the update just replaced a on the hard disk

47557
for-loop	loops
in bash i know that it is possible to write a for-loop in which some loops control variable i iterates over specified integers

47564

if you just don t want the package manager to override your customized files you could hold the package on debian ubuntu you could do

47798
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux
depending on the type of image amazon linux ubuntu suse centos debian etc... you could find out the path where the files are installed and run them i assume the reason for this is the fact that the application is in sbin or usr sbin and not in the default path of the non-root user

47798
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
to find the location of the files in rpm based distributions such as redhat fedora amazon linux suse and centos

47798
ubuntu	debian
for deb based distributions ubuntu debian use

47808
chown	chmod
then i read somewhere i should chmod 4755 and chown the scripts

is ksh93 syntax also found in zsh and bash

47849
centos	linux
i am a system admin with limited linux experience and have been tasked with setting up centos 5.8 64bit install and creating a template once complete

47856
ubuntu	debian
i m a ubuntu debian fan and most of my development experience has been on that platform but my current employer uses redhat

47879
versioning	upgrade
note that installing newer packages from a newer versioning of ubuntu like this may cause other packages to be upgrade even if you didn t specify them - if a package you want installed depends on newer versioning of other packages then the only way to satisfy those dependencies is to install them too

47892
id3v2	id3-tag
trying to get my id3-tag cleaned up and am loving id3v2 on the command line -- but i ve been using it only with a .mp3 wildcard and want to explore if there s a way to use it recursively so i can batch all of my mp3s

47934
bash	subshell
for example on my bash 4.2.28 nothing is ever written to subshell stdin

47941

the use case is that i am reading some log files that have spaces delimiter columns

47982
ubuntu	linux
i have access to a ubuntu linux node at my institution

47989
jobs	cron
i strongly recommend putting any non-trivial cron jobs into their own shell script file for many reasons

switching	screens
is there a way to switching it to the top-right of the screens

48057
freebsd	linux
you d also need to consider things under var for information about installed software running services etc usr local etc at least on freebsd and certain linux distros for configuration information for installed third party apps and of course each user s dotfiles which customise how software works for them roughly equivalent the the hk_current_user hive in the registry

48074
sudoers	passwd
in debian-derived linux distros if you are not root but are authorized in etc sudoers gnome will ask you for your own passwd to allow privileged operations

48074
sudo	passwd
however scientific linux asks you for the real root passwd even if you can do the same action with sudo

48091
gentoo	linux
since my laptop an acer aspire 5750g running a gentoo linux with a not-quite-up-to-date kernel 2.6.39-r3 a weird wlan hardware makes the update difficult tends to run rather hot i am trying to control the situation by employing the service cpufreqd

48104
fish	tcsh
in other shells csh tcsh fish you can always use the env command instead

48117
bash	zsh
if you need a bash or zsh history synchronizing solution which also solves the problem below then see it at

48141
mouse	keyboard
if i ve understood the idea of x-windows correctly an application is an x client and the windowing apis send receive ui messages to an x-server via a tcp socket sends window drawing commands to the x-server and receives mouse and keyboard activity messages from it

48142
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
and this whould do the trick also i reccomend to you that visit and suscribe on the backtrack forum but as bahamat said if you are new on linux world try first ubuntu or another distro like mint

48158
stdout	stderr
in order to get the help text from stderr to stdout so that it s readable by the pipe you need to redirect it

48168
folder	directory
for example if orignialpathname was a directory it also creates a link to access all files and folder for a new link

48199
debian	centos
i am not sure if it will work on centos as i do not have access to one but it is working on debian

48208
x86	64bit
some architectures may also have holes in the syscall table like 64bit version of x86 so you can use this too

48225
stdout	stderr
so you should redirect strace s stderr to stdout to be able to pipe it

48253
ubuntu	linux
how to undelete restore the deleted files in ubuntu linux

48258
mouse	keyboard
is it possible to configure keyboard and mouse for second seat with a usb hub on a single usb port or i need to connect each of them to a separate usb port

48262
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is ubuntu-based you can install packages from the ubuntu repositories

48266
ubuntu	mint
i have a triple boot machine with windows 7 mint 13 with xfce and ubuntu 12

48266
ubuntu	mint
under both mint and ubuntu the second screen is blank and under my display properties i only seen on screen the second screen enters power saving mode because it is receiving no signal

48266
ubuntu	mint
do i need to tweak something specifically in mint or ubuntu to enable a second gpu

48299
cinnamon	gnome
the cinnamon desktop environment is a fork of gnome shell gnome-shell

48300
cinnamon	gnome
cinnamon is desktop environment which is a fork of gnome shell

48305
bash	zsh
both bash and zsh support a shorthand of not placing a command in history if you prepend it with a space

48315
tunnel	vpn
systems have ip addresses on several subnets sometimes several per subnet some of which ipv4 some ipv6 using devices like ethernet adapters loopback interfaces vpn tunnel bridges virtual interfaces.

48317
bash	zsh
if you were using bash instead of zsh you could use these techniques to remove a command from history

48339
unix	bsd
could somebody tell me the difference between unix bsd and freebsd

48339
freebsd	linux
i ve been using linux from always but now i m curious about freebsd and bsd because maybe there are more unix-legacy .

48357
filesystems	ntfs
for an external hard disk chances are that this is an ntfs filesystems mounted through the ntfs-3g driver which is base on fuse

48359
ubuntu	linux
can ubuntu linux run sco unix openserver 5.0.7 applications like filepro

48359
ubuntu	linux
can i use ctar to copy application directories from a ctar backup tape to linux ubuntu

48436
ubuntu	debian
at least the debian installer does ubuntu should too

48444
pull	push
and of course you can go the other direction and run the rsync from the destination machine pull instead of the source machine push

48446
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is based on ubuntu and can use packages from the ubuntu repositories ncluding the many bleeding edge ppas

48446
ubuntu	mint
in general to have access to both mint s and ubuntu s repositories your sources list should look something like this

48446
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
see here for a howto on installing jre on ubuntu change lucid to natty for linux mint 11

48466
ssl	https
google is using https ssl everywhere now

48478
rtp	rtsp
that is vlc is telling the rtsp server it wants the media delivered on ports 60860 and 60861 via rtp

48482
gentoo	debian
the livecd distros such as systemrescuecd usually start with an existing distro such as slackware or gentoo or debian and then remove everything they don t want

48499
freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	debian	linux
if you prefer the traditional unix style just install freebsd or debian gnu linux

48499
minix	linux
and if you want to learn how unix works via source code try to download linux 0.0.1 and minix source code

48510
unix	bsd
directory creation is atomic under linux and unix and bsd and a lot of other oses

48524
gentoo	linux
linux distributions like arch linux gentoo lfs etc

48540
stdout	stderr
i have also redirected stderr to stdout to ensure that all output goes to dev null

48553
freebsd	netbsd
sudo is not installed by default in freebsd or netbsd

48553
ubuntu	opensuse
i only count on sudo on systems i personally manage or ones like ubuntu os x or opensuse where it s the only way to get root privileges by default

48553
centos	linux
centos oracle linux scientific linux.

48559
sudo	passwd
you need to have a terminal available to run sudo so that it can prompt you for the passwd

48559
sudo	passwd
if you expected the ssh passphrase to replace your passwd for authentication to sudo that s not going to happen

48559
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
sudo requires a passwd unless you add the nopasswd tag in the sudoers file

48561
sudo	passwd
the most widely-used distribution ubuntu uses sudo as the recommended method to become root when using the command line â users who stick to the gui will get a passwd prompt without understanding or caring about what happens under the hood

48561
sudo	passwd
on the other hand su is available everywhere and usable on most systems except those where only sudo is available because the user won t have the root passwd

48565
opensuse	debian
check procps or procps-ng the latter is used by debian fedora opensuse arch and other distros

48565
opensuse	debian
debian fedora and opensuse fork of procps

48586
kde	gnome
i ve tried using the file managers in both gnome and kde environments neither one works

48587
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
i found that the one from the xfce project called thunar works for me and can be run inside of either gnome kde or your favorite de window manager

48588
chown	chmod
you can t do anything to an immutable file - you can t delete it edit it overwrite it rename it chmod or chown it or anything else

48588
filesystems	xfs
afaik immutable is supported by all common linux filesystems incl ext2 3 4 and xfs

48596
redhat	fedora
if you want to restart udev without restarting the machine do this redhat el6 fedora

48598
freebsd	debian
you get either the debian documentation or the freebsd documentation

48600
freebsd	netbsd
now the netbsd kernel does not work so well with the vps provider but freebsd is a supported option there so i am thinking to make the switch

48616
rpm	yum
i m familiar with using yum but not so familiar with using rpm

48637
ubuntu	openbsd
i thought the best would be for this task is using ncurses the replay solution needs to be used on several different oses like openbsd ubuntu redhat

48639
versioning	upgrade
i would try an intermediate step to check the hypothesis first put your server s versioning of debian in to a vm make a snapshot upgrade the kernel there and see if it will see the usb device after the upgrade

48643
stdout	stderr
the easiest way is probably to tee the message to stderr as well as stdout

48643
stdout	stderr
by default both stderr and stdout go to the screen

48643
stdout	stderr
you re redirecting stdout to mail leaving just stderr going to the screen

48666
filesystems	btrfs
filesystems that implement snapshotting like btrfs nilfs zfs... would do that as well

48683
rpm	yum
as a general rule upgrading a package with rpm rather than yum is straight-forward search for somewhere you can download a the rpm for centos from download it and install it with rpm -i packagname.rpm

48683
versioning	upgrade
repeat also for any currently installed packages that require the versioning of libc that comes with centos 4.8 or are incompatible with the newer versioning you ll have to upgrade them to versioning that are ok with a newer glibc

48683
versioning	upgrade
sounds like you may have a fairly rigid change-management process at work so that will require careful planning always a good idea anyway and written justification of the need to upgrade - including details of the problems that the old versioning is causing and the benefits that upgrading will provide

48686
debian	mint	debian	linux
the current distro is linux mint debian

48686
ubuntu	debian
previously i have had ubuntu fedora 17 and debian 6.0 installed all with the same sickly colours problem

48711
debian	centos	opensuse	centos	opensuse	debian
os debian 6 opensuse 12.1 centos 6.2

48732
tablet	galaxy
i checked some videos on youtube and it talks about how to install bt on different linux tablet like the galaxy tab and really wonder if reaver aircrack or whatever other tools would work just fine or lets say detecting the wireless adapter wlanxx embedded in the tablet as a normal wifi device to start the work

48747
jobs	cron
for instruction on how to edit and create cron jobs and an explanation on the files structure see this crontab syntax guide

48751
bash	zsh
this option works in bash zsh and ksh93

48752
bash	zsh
zsh ksh93 or bash make this much easier but i should point out this is not built into mkdir and may not work in other shells

48758
octal	hex
it would be nice if it also supported other printf 3 numeric types like integer d i octal o u or hex x x

48758
int	double
anyway a double format with 0 decimal precision like .0f or 02.0f is close enough to an int for this purpose

48778
bash	zsh
to proceed with process substitution bash zsh ksh like shells only

48787
solaris	bsd
i test on solaris bin sh and xpg4 sh and bsd

48788
ubuntu	linux
i want to configure a remote linux ubuntu precise to use a pptp vpn

48789
disk	ram
sounds like you want suspend-to-both hybrid suspend which should do all the steps of hibernating including writing ram to disk but not actually turn the machine off

48798
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to add a webiste on ubuntu linux server and following this tutorial

48810
centos	linux
i compiled tested it so far on some linux distributions centos sles without problems

48813
jobs	cron
the owner of this directory is an sftp user and cannot run cron jobs

48813
jobs	cron
i have one shell user that can run cron jobs but does not have permission to edit files in the sftp user s directory

48813
jobs	cron
i have an admin user that can access the sftp user s directory when using sudo but can t read i d really rather not run cron jobs

48828
disk	ram
probably including the whole disk contents and a dump of the ram several times over

48828
disk	ram
in addition to regular files and directories there are symbolic links pointers to other files and device files which represent hardware devices disk partitions the ram serial ports etc.

48830
openbsd	ifconfig
from what i have been reading apparently on openbsd you can configure the ssid and wpa shared secret key on the ifconfig command line

48835
sudoers	visudo
edit the etc sudoers file use visudo

48841
put	get
however i can t put the boot filesystem on my md0_crypt because i get the warning that one cannot store the boot fs on an encrypted partition because it needs to load the kernel and initrd

48850
bash	zsh
not a direct answer to your question as you re mentioning bash but with zsh you can specify the sort order and numerical sort with globbing qualifiers

48866
ubuntu	debian
however due to various issues mostly licensing ones newer netpbm versions are not packages by debian and as a result its derivatives like ubuntu as well which means that most of the pam conversion utilities are not present there

48869
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
csh tcsh or zsh will allow you to alias any of those above but not bash or ksh though pdksh will allow you but you won t let you use them

48874
ubuntu	mint
it might be related to os upgrades ubuntu 12.04 lte right now but on the other hand if i boot live mint 12 then there s no sound on speakers there neither

48901
debian	linux
when i try to ssh to my server from a linux computer with debian i just get

48908
perl	tcl
so while the plugins for python and perl are loaded correctly the tcl plugin is not

48908
perl	tcl
in fact python2 and perl packages are installed on my system while tcl package is not

48908
gentoo	debian
so i checked debian and gentoo and it seems they don t have this problem

48943
flac	ogg	flac	opus	opus	ogg
the same community that brought you ogg flac vorbis and now opus created xspf

48974
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is based on ubuntu so i m guesing the runlevel system is probably the same

48975
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
update since linux mint is based on ubuntu which has a different startup shutdown procedure here is the procedure relevant to you

48975
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu follows the debian runlevel numbering so you have runlevel 0 for halt and runlevel 6 for reboot

48989
overwrite	preserve
having that custom launcher in your home would preserve your settings after terminal-package upgrades that would otherwise overwrite the default .desktop file in usr share applications

49009
bash	zsh
double bracket is a bash and ksh and zsh extension is not in posix and has the advantage of cleaner syntax see below and not using a separate process

49048
folder	directory
in zsh is there a way to use ls to only list files and folder in the current directory that match a specific globbing or regex pattern

49060
disk	ram
this is desirable ram is faster than disk and absolutely normal behaviour

49075
debian	linux
i m setting up print server for custom thermal printer on raspberrypi running linux debian and i have a strange problem

49075
google-chrome	firefox
if i print a test page it prints ok same with web page from firefox but when i try print from google-chrome or google cloud printing i set up cloud printing server half of page is cut like there s wrong width defined

49077
sudo	passwd
sudo does not require a passwd

49122
width	height
what i want to add now is a way to read the height and width which are the sourceimageheight and sourceimagewidth with exiftool and do a case or if where if the height is x and width is z then add to the output file another variable which is the quality ie 720p 1080p dvd...

49156
unix	bsd
other unix variants may not have bash installed bash is part of the standard installation on osx but an optional package on bsd and most commercial unices

49156
unix	bsd
almost all unix variants other than linux and osx bsd and commercial unices have some version of the korn shell at least pdksh

49156
ubuntu	linux
perl is the traditional scripting language and few non-embedded linux systems lack it but python is gaining ground boosted in part by being the recommended scripting language for ubuntu

49156
freebsd	netbsd
it s optional but very commonly installed on freebsd and optional but often installed on netbsd

49164
bash	zsh
i d suggest follow ksh93 or even posix flavour and you can always use bash zsh to run

49167
filesystems	fat
look here its associated link and ext vs fat where they discuss about various filesystems performance

49173
crypt	md5
however since we changed how passwords are handled in order to include ldap support passwords now don t have to be crypt but can also be md5 or sha-1

49174
debian	linux
most linux systems will have both mawk and gawk available but on some distros debian for example mawk is installed by default and you have to install gawk yourself if you want it

49174
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
many cpan modules are pre-packaged for linux and the remainder are easily installed with the cpan tool or dh-make-perl on debian ubuntu etc to turn a cpan module into a .deb package

49176
unix	bsd
the share is hosted on a linux nis domain and i am accessing from a mac bsd unix

49203
vim	emacs
i was an emacs user and i have to switch to vim

49203
vim	emacs
but i miss some basic emacs commands in vim insert mode

49203
vim	emacs
but not yet found the opposite customize vim to use emacs commands.

49203
vim	emacs
i am interested about the emacs commands in vim insert mode only

49220
hash	md5
i m aware of mktorrent and know how to use it but for testing purposes i require a utility that will also include the md5 hash of every file in the torrent in the torrent meta info

49220
hash	md5
i realize that the md5 hash for each file isn t typically used with most modern torrent apps and is superfluous but i m hoping there s a utility out there i missed that supports this

49267
octal	hex
lfhex is an application for viewing and editing files in hex octal

49281
debian	linux
i need to port a qt project from ms visual studio 2010 to linux debian

49289
versioning	upgrade
first of all you can take a look at the versioning available for the package you want to upgrade with this command

49293
freebsd	debian
i ve been trying to install freebsd alongside my debian installation in a single partition

49293
ubuntu	debian
none of the solutions work on debian the naming of the grub2 options on debian seems to be different from ubuntu

49293
freebsd	debian
so how do i dual boot debian and freebsd in the most reliable way

49306
filesystems	fat
20 years ago we did not know any other filesystems than fat under dos

49306
filesystems	ntfs
probably ntfs would allow the same behavior as nix filesystems but microsoft decided to maintain the habitual behavior of the file deletion

49314
cvs	rcs
the information is filled-in by a source code management system such as sccs rcs or cvs

49353
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
btw as a rule of thumb if you re using a package-managed distribution like fedora or rhel centos debian ubuntu and others it s a good idea to view any web page that gives instructions for installing that start something like downlaod this binary tarball from this location or even download the source... with deep suspicion

49371
debian	linux
just checked angstrom linux it s debian based so copy these lines to etc rc.local would work for you

49376
folder	directory
unfortunately some ambiguity exists in documentation and various implementations regarding how the logical email folder are to be stored inside the main maildir directory ie

49383
ubuntu	debian
it may be lpadmin on ubuntu debian

49389
centos	linux
on many linux distros there is no difference in live to install but the centos rhel fedora distros do have different iso s for a reason good or not is debatable

49392
pulseaudio	mixer
after that all i had to do was go to the mixer control panel and select playback internal audio analog stereo pulseaudio mixer

49400
put	get
sometimes they get confused if you manually put stuff there

49413
innodb	myisam
you re not using innodb but are using myisam so you don t have transactions

49433
jobs	cron
you don t need to have a shell set for cron jobs bin false will do fine

49434
bash	zsh
but in ksh bash zsh there s a better way use an array

49439
bash	zsh
lineno is a ksh feature also present in bash and zsh

49471
centos	linux
i know it s kind of old but this centos 6.3 is the first ever linux distro to give me that error of not having pae

49489
folder	directory
i would like to use a similar command and specify a directory instead of a single file and have it upload that directory and all contents maintaining folder structure

49492
icmp	udp
udp dns icmp ping â i get instant response

49502
mp3	ogg
is there any utility to search mp3 ogg files by tags or other characteristics from the command line

49511
tar	gunzip
i would like to skip a large gzip file when i extract a tar file but everytime tar starts to gunzip it to look inside it seems

49520
installation	upgrade
i decided to upgrade my debian installation and after some days using mysql 5.5 i found that mysql prints garbage to the terminal intead of utf-8 characters

49523
tar	gunzip
tar does not decompress the file huge_mysql_file.gz but it has to read and ignore the file huge_mysql_file.gz because this is provided by the pipe to gunzip

49530
ubuntu	mint
ubuntu 12.04 and mint 11 are both rough going

49530
ubuntu	mint
trackpad support is minimal though slightly better in ubuntu than mint

49530
mouse	keyboard
if all you need is the self-contained macbook with no need for a bluetooth mouse keyboard or second monitor then kde.

49556
daemons	launchd
just launchd wicd-gtk since you re using the root user wicd daemons will start automatically by you and configure it in gui

49573
opensuse	linux	opensuse	mint
distro opensuse 12.2 x86_64 and linux mint 12 x86_64

49578
dropbox	skydrive
if your home folder is not huge and all your pcs have normal connectivity you could try one or more of these cloud storage services dropbox google drive sugarsync microsoft skydrive but there are many more

49588
chown	chgrp
if you find that on your system chown 2 or chown 1 and chgrp 1 do change the mtime or atime and you re concerned about preserving both mtime and atime then you ll need to write code to collect the current times using stat 2 or stat 1 and reinstate them using utimes 2 or touch 1

49590
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
thus learning red hat or centos which is based upon red hat s source code and debian ubuntu should be enough

49602
dpkg	apt
attempt to upgrade vlc-data first using dpkg -i on it look in var cache apt archives the .deb should be there

49604
pull	push
and now every users of the group can pull push and nobody else can and that without messing with the file system rights

49608
debian	linux
i have a raspberry pi though could be any debian linux box connected to an external hard disk formatted as ntfs

49658
sudo	passwd
if there is no root passwd then login as a regular user and do the sudo su

49674
debian	centos
also i wrote etc rc.local scripts earlier this year for centos and debian distros to get the ec2-style metadata from openstack on so that vms would get their ip hostname ssh keys and other instance-specific information

49688
tunnel	packets
the ssh tunnel is a form of tunnel protocol in which tcp traffic originating and meant to certain tcp ports is transferred in packets labeled with completely different port numbers

49695
daemons	systemd
the scripts to be executed at boot usually for starting daemons and mounting file systemd

49696
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	opensolaris	opensolaris	netbsd
fuse is available for linux freebsd netbsd as puffs opensolaris minix3 android and osx

49711
zsh	tcsh
tcsh has a similar feature and is probably where zsh got it from

49726
imagemagick	wand
usr local include imagemagick wand magick accelerate.h 25 31 error magick morphology.h no such file or directory

49726
imagemagick	wand
if i copy folder magick over into usr local include imagemagick wand magick magick

49726
imagemagick	wand
i created a symlink in imagemagick wand magick ln -s .. magick magick however it still has the same problem inside file accelerate.h on line 25 it has

49733
imagemagick	wand
try adding -i until the wand directory like -i usr local include imagemagick wand or -i usr local include imagemagick wand magick

49742
ubuntu	debian
iselect is packaged for debian probably ubuntu and other distros too

49746
chgrp	chmod
i did addgroup www and then chmod -r 775 var www html then groupmod -g www mitch and did a chgrp -r www var www html but when i went into html on mitch and tried to make a file with touch it said permission denied.

49770
bash	zsh
with gnu xargs and ksh zsh bash

49775
debian	linux
since the windows partition is larger than all the debian partitions there s space enough for the whole linux installation in the current windows partition

49778
ubuntu	debian
if you re not already booted from a rescue disc boot from one you could use the debian install disc just switch to a terminal at the appropriate point or alternatively a ubuntu disc

49799
stdout	stderr
this will redirect stdout to the file log then tee stderr to the file log and direct it back to stderr

49799
stdout	stderr
in this way i get a single file log which shows both stdout and stderr in order and stderr is also displayed on the screen as usual

49825
ssl	socks
tor doesn t work with my isp because ssl was banned so systems corresponding to socks don t work

49862
sudo	passwd
but there is sudo which can be used for what you want and it has a configuration file where you can disable the need to enter a passwd

49865
bash	zsh
with ksh93 zsh or bash try

49866
bash	zsh
same results with bash or sh or zsh

49874
udp	tcp
anything interesting in a comparison from udp traffic to tcp traffic

49894
bash	zsh
with ksh or bash with extglob option or zsh with kshglob option

49906
clang	llvm
it basically states that freebsd starting from version 10 and above will deprecate gcc in favor of clang llvm

49906
clang	llvm
from what i have seen around the net so far clang llvm is a fairly ambitious project but in terms of reliability it can not match gcc

49909
clang	llvm
i m no expert but my understanding is clang llvm uses fewer resources than gcc and is quicker

49927
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
configure sudo via visudo to allow your non-root user to execute all commands as root possibly even without a passwd but then your non-root user is root-equivalent from a security standpoint

49930
tunnel	vpn
at least if goes over the vpn is something that iptables can see for example its a separate tunnel device

49933
stdout	stderr
redirected stderr to stdout

49945
packets	multicast
the problem is that while i m running wlan0 in monitor mode i only see broadcast packets i see arps dhcp transactions beacons and other random management and data packets that are being broadcast or multicast

49945
libpcap	wireshark
this is the case in kismet wireshark 1.2.x 1.4.x and 1.8.x and my own packet reader program that uses libpcap

49952
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
99 of bash features come either from the bourne shell the korn shell csh tcsh or zsh

49976
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux

versioning	upgrade
i solved the same issue by creating a link without a versioning number by using gsub in awk to clean it from the filename and replace the link s to upgrade jar files

50054
bash	zsh
is there any way using bash or zsh so that i can keep the list of hostname and bash auto-completion goes through the file and gives me suggestion for the boxes starting with those letters whenever i type the first few letters of the hostname

50062
mouse	keyboard
i have a multiseat machine and the second seat has usb access from a signle port by hub a keyboard and a mouse are connected to it

50070
gentoo	debian
i ve tried to chroot into debian gentoo userspace - it doesn t help

50084
bash	zsh
dash bash ksh and zsh

50099
ssl	ocsp
openssl s_client ocsp x509 ... to debug all ssl tls pki issues

50100
gentoo	ubuntu
that said if you want ubuntu there is little use in looking at gentoo s screenshot contest

50100
gentoo	ubuntu
the culture is so different ubuntu is supposed to be easy while gentoo aims to be customizable and not easy

50103
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
arping ash awk basename brctl bunzip2 bzcat cat chgrp chmod chown chroot clear cmp

50103
rmdir	pwd
poweroff printf ps pwd reboot reset rm rmdir rmmod route sed seq sh sleep sort

50103
xargs	zcat
wget which xargs yes zcat

50119
bash	zsh
with bash â 4 ksh93 or zsh you can avoid most uses of find that only use -type d or -name â predicates by using the glob to match subdirectories at any depth

50153
folder	directory
because your current theme doesn t support gtk3 i.e a gtk-3.0 folder in the themes directory all gtk3-based apps will look ugly they will use the default built-in theme

50173
min	max
it visualizes the in- and outgoing traffic using two graphs and provides additional info like total amount of transfered data and min max network usage

50191
ubuntu	centos
why does ls | nano - open the editor in ubuntu but close the editor and save a file to -.save in centos

50258
debian	linux
it should be in the repositories of your linux distribution for debian based systems run

50281
daemon	cron
this is how the cron daemon works

50286
ubuntu	linux
i just built a linux kernel on ubuntu and now i want to make it run on virtualbox

50300
ubuntu	debian
since you mention dpkg you re probably using debian or ubuntu or some other debian derivative

50306
bluetooth	usb
i m trying to use an asus usb bluetooth dongle in opensuse

50360
hex	binary
readelf -x 30 path to binary - which will display the hex dump of section .comment

50403
rpm	yum
i downloaded the fedora-release rpm of fedora 18 and locally installed and rebuilt my yum cache is that what i did

50435
switching	screens
if you want to use alt tab to switching between applications on your remote windows system then you need to select the option grab all keyboard events there is an icon at the top of the remmina screens to enable disable this

50453
bash	zsh
you can get it added to history at least in bash i m not sure on zsh by doing the following

50463
post	get
if it doesn t work you should at least get a new error that you can post back here

50480
cifs	smb
a samba share can never behave as a ntfs share only as a smb cifs share

50482
disk	ram
since i have a slow hdd and a fast ram i would like at least giving higher priority to the ram usage for swap and tmpfs or disabling the disk usage for tmpfs related mount points

50486
disk	ram
so if your ramdisk fills up your ram and you crash you will never see what was on your ram disk again

50487
folder	directory
how can i move all files and folder from one directory to another via mv command

50491
uniq	grep
the first and perhaps most obvious approach is to use grep sort and uniq in the following way

50504
ubuntu	linux
i have a working server running ubuntu 12.04 lts gnu linux 3.2.0-24-generic x86_64 including apache and php

50520
mouse	keyboard
the entire system freezes mouse pointer doesn t move keyboard input doesn t work

50533
solaris	sunos
later versions of sunos solaris don t seem to have that problem

50534
bash	zsh
you ll see that some shells spawn a new instances of themselves to execute the script bash ksh93 while others spawn bin sh dash pdksh zsh

50548
kate	kde
in kde 4.8.1 you can disable them by first closing kate and then typing

50548
kate	kdevelop
not kwrite kile kdevelop or any other application using kate part

50550
truecrypt	umount
currently a truecrypt container has to be manually mounted via ssh and also umount again unless you solve my timeout question

50578
opensuse	debian
serious distros such as fedora opensuse debian etc

50584
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i ve set up sudo not to prompt for passwd by editing the sudoers file

50584
sudo	passwd
and it works fine running sudo with no passwd prompting

50584
sudo	passwd
but when entering sudo -v i noticed that it prompted for passwd only once

50584
sudo	passwd
the question is why sudo -v prompted for passwd when sudo is configured not to ask that user from passwd

50584
sudo	passwd
edit running sudo sudo -v requires no passwd but doesn t seem to update the timestamp because when immediately followed by sudo -v it prompts for passwd again

50589
sudo	passwd
sudo tee it asked me for a passwd and then the options o k and l oad

50594
hex	binary
xxd installed with vim is great too - especially since it allows you to convert to a human-readable hex format and to convert back to binary

50609
x11	konsole
this occurs from any x11 using xmonad including konsole or gnome-terminal etc

50620
sudoers	passwd
considering that the sudoers file is something capable of changing removing the nopassword parameter from your user is an option that could happen in the 15 minutes following your -v call so in order to create a timestamp file that does not exist is not relevant unless you input a passwd you are asked for a passwd

50620
sudo	passwd
edit if you run sudo -v under sudo or any other command under sudo the fact that you have run a sudo command successfully does not count as authentication only if you have entered the passwd or authenticated using pam in another way fingerprint smart card private key etc...

50620
sudo	passwd
in recent ubuntu versions maybe in other distributions root can run sudo without a passwd by default

50622
sudo	passwd
the user is already a member of group wheel and has full sudo access without passwd

50629
xfce	kde
and the problem is this before launching x11 my altgr works in the right way it allows me to enter # but in x i tried xfce fluxbox kde it stops working it simply does nothing

50646
debian	linux
ps why do you want to install dpkg on a non-debian barebones linux system and not install debian

50667
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
on most unix linux systems multiple shells are available bash csh ksh sh tcsh zsh just to name a few

50670
mouse	keyboard
in the x window system a display consists simplified of a keyboard a mouse and a screen

50670
debian	linux
notably the default configuration of debian gnu linux is to disable the x server listening on the tcp port

50672
daemons	systemd
manager shell gsettings daemons gvfs virtual file systemd keyring

50683
cinnamon	gnome
since around cinnamon 2.2 api has changed so much that the gnome shell mouse wheel zoom application no longer works with cinnamon

50692
bash	zsh
i m on solaris 10 and i have tested the following with ksh 88 bash 3.00 and zsh 4.2.1

50697
rpm	yum
as it seems that use a red hat based system the default package manager should be rpm and probably yum the corresponding user-frontend

50698
ubuntu	linux
virtualization of a linux guest on my local windows host using for example virtualbox with ubuntu and then ssh -x to the linux box from it here is a thread that discusses configurations for fast ssh x tunneling

50707
post	get
when the service goes down i will get a wall post in my ssh connection saying script execution started but it will not trigger my disableserver.sh script

50710
debian	linux
i am currently installing debian linux on a computer that does not have internet access

50718
debian	linux
besides open office is there any solution for opening .pptx presentations on linux debian to be more precise

50728
ati	nvidia
in this alternate method you loose your 3rd party modules virtual box ati nvidia etc but it might be something you could run from cron and automagically detect kernel updates have occured

50729
debian	linux
i just started using linux installed debian and the one thing i m trying to do right now is have my internet working

50730
xfce	gnome
note that if you want all your apps to have a consistent look fonts buttons colours etc you ll need to use a theme that supports both gtk2 for xfce and gtk2 and gnome2 apps and gtk3 for newer gnome apps like latest evince etc

50731
tunnel	lan
if one of your servers allow to set the tunnel to any machine in the lan then just create the proper tunnel say

50740
sudo	passwd
2 use a method of running a single command as root - the sudo command makes this rather simple - so a sudo vi etc network interfaces should allow you to edit it once you enter your passwd

50744
debian	linux
setting up networking when you are new to linux and debian can be very frustrating if it doesn t work out of the box

50772
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
now if your filesystems is xfs or btrfs it will execute sbin fsck.xfs or sbin fsck.btrfs respectively

50783
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint	debian	linux
so far i ve tried linux mint debian edition crunchbang debian and ubuntu

50783
ubuntu	mint
however in some of my attempts with ubuntu and mint i managed to boot

50785
sudoers	passwd
is it possible that i just don t know my passwd or does this mean that i am not sudoers

51798
mouse	keyboard
the result from your point of view will be that the computer is completely unresponsive to keyboard mouse and probably network for as long as the realtime process is using the cpu

51815
gentoo	linux
in gentoo linux it is possible to set the makeopts variable in etc portage make.conf to tell make how many jobs it should run in parallel when building packages

51819
bash	zsh
in zsh .zshrc and bash .bashrc alike

51823
gentoo	linux
i d like to get a list of all files in my gentoo linux system that were not installed by the package manager portage

51829
mouse	keyboard
xdotool lets you programatically or manually simulate keyboard input and mouse activity

51837
ubuntu	linux
i want to play this java simulation in java 3d mode on a linux ubuntu system

51849
ubuntu	linux
by the way if you really want to dive into linux don t go for ubuntu cause you won t ever understand the core workflow of linux systems

51858
undo	yank
use copy-paste m-d c-_ m-x replace-string ret c-y kill-word undo replace-string yank

51861
cpu	hyperthreading
that makes it -j3 for a dual-core cpu or more precisely for a dual-cpu machine â if each core is hyperthreading that would be 4 cpus so -j5

51869
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	solaris	netbsd	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd
pkill is what i recommend if it s available linux freebsd netbsd openbsd solaris

51872
cifs	smb
as people in the comments have pointed out it s possible to use smb cifs nfs or use scp

51891
bash	zsh
now read -d and are in zsh bash and ksh 93u but i m not sure about earlier ksh versions

51905
mouse	keyboard
w crash i mean that it freezes and refuses to any signals mouse keyboard etc.

51905
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that firefox works but i would like to keep using chromium or google-chrome

51911
umask	chmod
no effect of umask and chmod on mounted drives

51927
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
generally i m a linux noob but i m more familiar with ubuntu and since this server is more for learning ubuntu is basically a variation of debian and debian is now the most popular os for web servers i figured i d use it

51927
ubuntu	debian
a side question - is going with debian over ubuntu really going to yield that much of a performance increase

51927
ubuntu	debian
i basically want what would be the debian equivalent to ubuntu server - a simple bare-bones non-gui os

51927
apache	nginx
i d prefer to install my http server as well - i m not yet sure if i ll be going with apache or nginx or handling http requests my self in node.js.

51928
ubuntu	debian
the difference between ubuntu and debian is the way they are doing package testing

51928
ubuntu	debian
debian is all about stability and ubuntu is more about all the new things less stability

51929
ubuntu	debian
anyway there are a few important topics package managers and init scripts for example that require you to get your hands on distributions such as debian ubuntu and fedora

51938
bash	zsh
see pasting from clipboard to vi-enabled zsh or bash shell for a proof-of-concept in vi mode

51961
post	get
for instance on debian-based systems the package libwww-perl installs three symlinks to lwp-request which are called usr bin get usr bin head and usr bin post

51961
post	get
generally and for many years it has been quite a safe assumption that get head and post executables are available on unixoid systems

51962
udp	tcp
work connections using tcp or udp protocol

51963
ubuntu	linux
when running on linux different ubuntu variations

51991
bash	zsh
with ksh bash or zsh you can use the ksh filtering syntax

51994
ubuntu	linux
i m using this guide to add my linux 10.04 lucid ubuntu machine to domain

51999
chown	chmod
ntfs does not support permissions and thus chown chmod won t work for files and directories in that partition

52004
put	get	post	put	post	get
it s 155 lines of shell script and when i run it i get functions for get put post delete and options

52004
put	get
thereafter any call to get put post.

52054
ubuntu	linux
i am quite new at linux and i have to install this swissranger camera on ubuntu

52075
centos	linux
i am setting up a linux to act as a fileserver using centos 6.3

52079
bash	zsh
this also exists in zsh but not in bash 4.2

52106
subshell	ifs
i use a subshell the paranthesis so that i won t have to store and restore ifs

52172
zsh	tcsh	bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
in csh tcsh bash or zsh you can use pushd instead of cd to change directories and then popd +1 to cd to the first directory you pushed onto the stack

52173
chown	chmod
see the rest of bindfs man page for more things like chown chmod policies

52186
mouse	keyboard
unplugging and plugging the keyboard mouse may also restore service

52188
cpu	hyperthreading
i have a dell server with two intel xeon e5645 cpus each cpu has 6 cores and each core is hyperthreading should be equivalent to two virtual cores

52212
udp	tcp
for the third rule it is the lo interface so this rule allows any traffic on loopback interface and this is correct as otherwise you will not be able to access any local to the host services over tcp or udp at localhost address

52220
bash	zsh
the call to cat and fork except for bash can be optimised away with bash ksh93 and zsh with

52228
folder	directory
i made a bin directory in my home folder where i place all my scripts

52229
centos	linux
my laptop operates with crunchbang linux and the server has centos willing to change the tower s os but #

52234
ubuntu	linux
i have linux ubuntu server which i have root access to through ssh port 22 only

52264
mouse	keyboard
i installed fedora 17 on my laptop where i use a keyboard logitech k120 and mouse generic usb mouse connected to a hub

52264
mouse	keyboard
then i noticed that neither the keyboard nor the mouse worked

52264
mouse	keyboard
if i plug the mouse keyboard directly into the usb ports they work properly

52264
mouse	keyboard
this shows that neither the usb hub nor the keyboard mouse are damaged

52264
mouse	keyboard
lsusb of the relevant devices usb hub keyboard and mouse respectively

52264
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard mouse appears on xinput list only when they re connected directly to the usb ports

52264
mouse	keyboard
when i plug the mouse keyboard through the hub nothing happens in the x logs

52287
move	drag
alternatively you can use either middle wheel click drag or alt + drag to get a move copy link menu

52295
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
checked with gnome xfce lxde kde

52299
debian	linux
let s say we have 5-10 pcs of them and we ve solved basic things they run some not too rare kind of linux distribution debian say we have root access and they are connected on local network with ip

52299
mouse	keyboard
it has keyboard mouse monitor we want to use it as the frontend of the cluster

52311
bash	zsh
note that ksh93 zsh and bash have introduced in april 2005 zsh 4.3.0 bash 4.1-alpha ksh93r the possibility to have dynamic fds like

52318
bash	zsh
also note that all of bash ksh and zsh have a special variable that counts the number of seconds since the shell was started

52327
put	get
however you ve forgotten to put quotes around so it does get expanded at that point as arguments to cd

52330
stdout	stderr
in the above cron entry i am redirecting both stderr and stdout to a log file

52382
stdio	fputs
this is sometimes called â œ stdio bufferingâ after the name of the library component that performs this task in c the functions like putc fputs fprintf etc. declared in stdio

52403
ubuntu	linux
the suse linux enterprise server 11 service pack 2 release notes state that suse offers commercial support for btrfs while ubuntu and fedora appear to be holding back until a working fsck utility is available

52429
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this varies from one linux to another but since mint is like ubuntu you can probably set in etc default rcs

52431
debian	linux
the box is running raspbian linux debian wheezy

52436
freebsd	linux
during installation using the fsbd utility gpart i have allocated a total of about 23gb for freebsd leaving 17gb totally free neither partitioned nor formatted for a later linux installation

52436
ubuntu	linux
now when try to install linux ubuntu 10.10 ppc on the remaining 17gb the linux ubuntu installer or linux s disk utility for the same matter wants presumably a linux partition and when i try to add a linux partition on that area using linux du it fails with this message

52436
freebsd	linux
now i m trying to add a linux partition on freebsd running on the harddisk

52436
freebsd	linux
so how to add properly a linux partition on freebsd

52438
sudo	passwd
when i try to use a sudo command i am prompted for a passwd

52453
for-loop	arrays
now -- i want to use a gnuplot for-loop s index to access a shell arrays variable

52473
bash	tcsh
i want to run the line from tcsh with one line interpreted by bash

52476
gentoo	linux
i ve got a thinkpad t400 with gentoo linux installed

52492
kde	gnome
it may also be the case that your window manager or desktop environment kde gnome steals those keys and switches between vts like you say

52496
sudo	passwd
but when i am in and i want to run some commands as root sudo it ask for passwd and not allowing me to run it

52505
sudo	passwd
to run a command as root you must run sudo which asks for your own passwd

52505
sudo	passwd
the ubuntu installation creates one account with sudo privileges and asks you to enter a passwd for that account

52505
ubuntu	linux
the easiest way to do this if you aren t fluent with the linux command line is to boot the ubuntu installation media and select â œrescueâ rather than â œinstallâ at the menu

52510
debian	linux
the program i ve used for this is reptyr which i ve successfully built and used on mac osx and debian linux flavours

52532
folder	directory
in my boot folder i don t have a grub2 directory

52551
pull	push
how can i make it that git can push pull without any passphrase input from me

52566
gentoo	ubuntu
i searched for it in the documentation for gentoo and for virtualbox had a look at templates for ubunto boxes - but still don t know how to replicate the automounting behavior of the default ubuntu box

52582
put	get
what url s should i put in my sources.list to get apt-get source dwm to work

52587
freebsd	linux
i own a dozen pcs mostly running unix-based oses freebsd and various flavors of gnu linux with a few running windows 7 or windows xp

52587
kerberos	ldap
i think as far as this goes that s what ldap or maybe even kerberos

52587
kerberos	ldap
ldap kerberos windows server 2008

52618
filesystems	fat
common ones include a read-only filesystems or a filesystems that does not support permissions such as fat

52631
opensuse	linux
i m trying out linux by installing opensuse 12.2 x64 on virtualbox

52639
ubuntu	mint
and i m not sure that this applies to mint 13 or only to real ubuntu 12.04

52651
put	get
at the moment when i use get or put command from client end i got following message on ftp client

52670
folder	directory
and it is that directory that should be used to access to the shared folder by putting the local user into the vboxsf group

52670
umask	mount
if you manually mount the shared folder then you need to use the relevant options on the mount command to set the folder with the right ownership the gid uid and umask options to mount

52684
filesystems	ntfs
now tell partimage to restore your ntfs filesystems to that dummy space

52684
filesystems	ntfs
once it finishes successfully your dummy_disk.raw file will contain the restored ntfs filesystems

52715
put	get
if you can get the source-rpm of an alternative java you might put an obsoletes jdk into the spec-file.

52717
loops	if-statement
break will go one level higher in loops - but not in if-statement according to my bash-manpage

52728
bash	zsh
some shells have other subprocess constructs for example process substitution etc. on ksh bash and zsh

52735
ubuntu	debian
for example both ytalk last updated in 2005 and gtalk gnu talk last updated in 2000 are available on debian and ubuntu today and ytalk is in the netbsd package collection

52837
repo	egit
git works well on windows and there is a plugin for eclipse called egit which would allow you to sync to a repo elsewhere

52856
filesystems	btrfs
i used to have a system that rsynced filesystems onto a backup server with a btrfs filesystems to do snapshots on the backup server and due to stability issues moved to zfs-on-linux which unfortunately doesn t support posix acls yet but there are work arounds

52865
bash	zsh
aka process substitution requires ksh93 where the feature originated in bash or zsh

52868
freebsd	linux
here s a list of ones available on freebsd most of which will also be available on linux

52874
stdio	fflush
for instance you could make sure it does use output buffering ã la stdio and call fflush or whatever the equivalent is in python after one or a few lines have been written

52883
sudoers	visudo
always use visudo to edit etc sudoers

52891
jobs	cron
the primary intended use of the package filters cron jobs - meaning you would need permissions to edit the crontab

52899
ubuntu	linux
i regularly have the problem that my linux ubuntu 12.04 writes some files to an usb drive that are afterwards missing or broken in windows

52899
ubuntu	linux
what i am actually looking for is an option that tells my ubuntu linux to perform any pending writes as soon possible and afterwards doing a safety check if the data was really written correctly

52914
debian	linux
here s my question i don t know a huge amount about the natural dependencies of linux debian specifically so i need to know a way to get them installed without internet

52925
ubuntu	debian
there don t seem to be any debian repositories that have up-to-date chromium versions but there s an ubuntu lucid ppa that can be ab used

52926
bazaar	git
etckeeper is an add-on for apt the package management tool used by debian and derivatives that manages etc in a version control system bazaar darcs git mercurial

52926
vim	emacs
emacs and vim have interfaces for that as do most diff viewers

52949
keydown	keyup
it s not a keydown keyup thing as near as i could tell from the pattern

52964
ubuntu	debian
note you didn t mention what os you are using and the above is coming from personal experience with debian ubuntu

53021
bash	zsh
writing - is suggested by the completion code by the way but in bash it only actually works with -- before it bash doesn t have a special case for cd - zsh does

53046
sudo	passwd
i noticed after running a sudo command in terminal or running a administrative application that uses gksudo it won t ask again for the passwd for a time something like 5 minutes

53046
sudo	passwd
is it possible for an attacker to do sudo or gksudo without the passwd prompt before the passwd expires and take over my system

53049
sudo	passwd
an easy way to find it out is running sudo in one terminal and run it again in another one you d be prompted for passwd again see var db sudo

53055
jobs	cron
np in the password field of etc shadow indicates that that the account cannot be logged into with a password but can be logged into with other authentication methods such as su down from root or cron jobs

53058
debian	mint
i have a mint repository as a source in addition to the main debian repositories and i m able to limit the packages that aptitude shows to just the ones from mint by typing l

53059
sudo	passwd
it can even change your shell process so that when you think you re running sudo you re actually running the attacker s program that just silently records your root passwd

53066
daemon	cron
my linux has many not-human users like cron ntp daemon http etc

53074
solaris	bsd
it is in both gnu and bsd grep but it s possible some systems don t have it solaris

53075
sudo	passwd
is it possible for an attacker to do sudo or gksudo without the passwd prompt before the passwd expires and take over my system

53076
put	get
the only ways to get into their accounts without a password as far as i know are ssh with keypair auth impossible unless someone with write permissions in their home directory put a public key in their .ssh authorized_keys you can use alex s allowusers configuration to prevent that remote possibility

53077
google-chrome	firefox
tomcat6 only deploys my web application successfully in firefox not google-chrome so i m really hoping to resolve this dependency issue

53113
ubuntu	debian	debian-based	ubuntu
open a terminal and type sudo apt-get install unetbootin for debian and other debian-based systems such as ubuntu

53122
sudoers	visudo
i m trying to edit etc sudoers via visudo but i don t know how to change the root rights

53126
lisp	scheme
you mention lisp be aware that 64-bit debian does not include a package for gnu mit scheme

53127
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian but the versioning are more recent than on debian stable and it has a predictable release timeline so you can plan your upgrade ahead of time and you can use the long term support versioning and be sure to get bug fixes for 5 years

ubuntu	debian
the other difference is that ubuntu doesn t support as many architectures as debian so software that is only available on intel architectures can be used by default while it cannot be used by default on debian

53127
ubuntu	debian
both debian and ubuntu are very developer friendly in my experience

53127
opensuse	linux	opensuse	centos	gentoo	opensuse	gentoo	linux	gentoo	centos	centos	linux
arch linux centos fedora gentoo opensuse slackware.

53135
bash	zsh
since bash or zsh is in no way responsible for handling the compose key what must have broken is your session startup files

53150
width	height
but the manpage only shows how to resize to a certain height and width for example

53150
width	height
also it would be nice to have that command with height 100 and width 50 instead of the absolute values

53188
bash	zsh
i suspect your interactive shell is bash or zsh where time is a keyword

53188
bash	zsh
and your script is a sh script where sh is not based on bash ksh nor zsh where time is usr bin time which would only time the echo command above

53189
decoder	encoder
suppose i point a decoder to video file then it s output gets piped in as encoder s input

53195
folder	directory
but now my folder on dropbox still has all the directory with the pdfs in it

53210
folder	dir	bazaar	git
for those i need versioning and alpha-updating i personally have git or bazaar repository resides in dropbox folder do commit in my local dir then push to dropbox folder simply faster than any hoster

53213
ubuntu	mint
on mint 13 maya which is based on ubuntu precise 12.04

53217
ssd	sata
is it possible to create lvm partitions for both ssd and sata hard disks

53220
ssd	sata
i don t see any points on doing so you want a volume group that contains both sata and ssd that s possible

53223
put	get
so you put a set histdup all in your .tcshrc and while you will still get trivial commands in your history you will only get one instance of each which at least reduces the clutter

53227
daemons	systemd
my coworker thinks that running rsync as a daemons on the systemd would improve performance but it s my understanding that you run rsync as a daemons when you are doing remote transfers a client server relationship

53233
ubuntu	linux
how do i resize a partition in ubuntu linux without losing data

53253
dpkg	apt
from the answers it seems that neither dpkg nor apt have this capability

53261
ubuntu	debian
i was under the impression that the grub-firmware-qemu package on debian ubuntu was intended for that but i have not managed to make it work

53265
ubuntu	debian
on debian it s in the kbd package i guess it should be the same on ubuntu

53275
ubuntu	linux
i have installed a virtual machine running ubuntu on my mac so that i can test my changes before deploying to the actual linux box

53279
post	put
i put following line in .vimrc after going through one of the post on se

53282
cpu	processors
i have recently compiled a minimal kernel for my intel r pentium r dual cpu t3400 2.16ghz and chose config_mcore2 core 2 newer xeon under processors type and features processors family

53338
filesystems	ntfs
to my surprise filesystems changed to hidden hpfs ntfs

53351
lvm	btrfs
i would highly recommend using lvm because of its maturity over btrfs

53373
ubuntu	linux
on a standard linux ubuntu in the case of this post system you d be seeing the three default rule tables local main and default of which you normally only see the main table when invoking netstat -rn for example

53392
debian	linux
is it possible to run netbeans on a arm cpu with linux as os maybe debian

53402
tunnel	vpn
you could either tunnel it through ssh vpn or use nfsv4 which supports encryption on its own

53411
kde	gnome
if you want the installation to behave like a desktop install the gnome or kde package group

53413
lvm	umount
you can not shrink an ext4 volume without umount it with or without lvm

53414
daemons	systemd
at the end of the systemd os install it will ask you for options to what daemons services you want to install

53416
x86	64bit
because amd was the first one to release 64bit x86 x86-64 cpus

53416
x86	64bit
the amd64 architecture was positioned by amd from the beginning as an evolutionary way to add 64bit computing capabilities to the existing x86 architecture as opposed to intel s approach of creating an entirely new 64bit architecture with ia-64

53451
ubuntu	debian
i ll be using ubuntu but i m likely to switch over to debian and maybe other debian based os

53458
filesystems	ntfs
as you know ntfs is basically a microsoft protected product and thus access to an ntfs filesystems using any other operating system other than windows is frought with real risk

53458
filesystems	ntfs
so i d say you are not mitigating any of the risk using a particular linux distribution in accessing an ntfs filesystems

53471
ubuntu	debian
i currently have a few vm images of both debian and ubuntu

53471
ubuntu	debian
i m using debian and i may want to do this with ubuntu as well

53474
versioning	upgrade
now that i ve upgrade i ve found a bunch of packages that have no repository which the yast software manager marks with red text in the versioning column

53485
stdout	stderr
the stdin stdout and stderr of the shell and the programs it runs are all run through the tty pty device

53503
folder	directory
in a gui file manager it is possible to select a few files press ctrl-c which supposedly copies come info about the files to clipboard then navigate to another folder and press ctrl-v which will then copy the files into that directory

53531
spaces	delimiter
multiple spaces are treated as one delimiter

53563
stdout	stderr
is it possible to configure bash so that stderr can be a different color than stdout

53563
stdout	stderr
i d like to color the user input in a color and possibly use two different colors for stdout and stderr text printed on the screen

53566
vim	emacs
a tilde suffix marks a backup file for a few text editors such as emacs and vim .ext

53567
sudo	passwd
the question is there a way to remotely and automatically the script is not monitored so passwd authentication as sudo requires will not work elevate to root privileges to restart a job or give a user group the ability to do that

53569
sudo	passwd
you can do sudo w o passwd

53587
stdout	stderr
the application like those using readline like gdb bash... may send that on its stdout or stderr which is going to be difficult to differentiate from something that it outputs for other things than echoing back the user input

53587
stdout	stderr
then to differentiate an application s stdout from its stderr there are several approaches

53587
stdout	stderr
many of them involve redirecting the commands stdout and stderr to pipes and those pipes read by an application to colour it

53587
stdout	stderr
even if it s the same process that processes the two pipes there s no guarantee that the order the text written by the application on stdout and stderr will be preserved as the reading process can t know if there s something to be read from both whether to start reading from the stdout pipe or the stderr pipe

53587
stdout	stderr
then a trick for dynamically linked applications can be to hijack using as in sickill s answer the outputting functions called by the application to output something and include code in them that sets the foreground colour based on whether they re meant to output something on stderr or stdout

53587
stdout	stderr
however that means hijacking every possible function from the c library and any other library that does a write 2 syscall directly called by the application that may potentially end up writing something on stdout or stderr printf puts perror... and even then that may modify its behavior

53587
bash	zsh
you ll notice how if you replace some-cmd with bash the bash prompt and what you type appears in red stderr while with zsh it appears in black because zsh dups stderr onto a new fd to display its prompt and echo

53587
stdout	stderr
if the application redirects its stdout or stderr our hijacked strace will keep writing the colouring escape sequences on the terminal

53587
stdout	stderr
it s colouring based on the write s on stdout stderr of each individual process

53587
stdout	stderr
so for instance in error would be green because echo outputs it on its stdout which sh redirected to sh s stderr but all strace sees is a write 1 error n 6

53602
bash	tcsh
bash does not seem to insert whitespace but tcsh does

53640
ffmpeg	libvpx
and the problems is that ffmpeg requires a higher minor version of libvpx recompile ffmpeg will solve this issue

53651
g++	gcc
before a gcc 4.7.2 build the g++ m4 gawk gcc-multilib

53651
mpfr	mpc
gmp mpfr and mpc must be built

53665
ubuntu	debian
tested with debian squeeze and ubuntu 12.04

53683
spaces	delimiter
the -d option sets the delimiter to one spaces and -f selects the first field
