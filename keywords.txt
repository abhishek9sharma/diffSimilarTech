dfa is a better choice over nfa because it has only one transition for an input while nfa can have many

more states
if we express combinations of states in an nfa as states themselves we ve got a dfa with a lot more states than the nfa but which does the same thing

slower yet
perl uses nfa which is slower yet more powerful than the dfa engine sed has

far easier
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa

larger
if it can be practically determinized this give you a dfa that can be exponentially larger than the nfa then by all means do that

faster
generally speaking dfa is faster but nfa is more compact

slower
regex is a nfa and is as such in most cases slower than a dfa or hand-written parser

typically more
at the same time the compilation phase for a dfa is typically more complex than for an nfa and dfas don t have all the capabilities of nfas

better choice
dfa is a better choice over nfa because it has only one transition for an input while nfa can have many

in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that

slower
perl uses nfa which is slower yet more powerful than the dfa engine sed has

more expressive
the net effect is that the backtracking implementations i like that name better than traditional nfa are slightly more expressive than dfa implementations because they can match regexes like which matches three or more word characters repeated twice something that can t be matched by a dfa

more productive
as one good programmer can be more productive than two average programmers i vaguely remember an old ibm study concluding someone in the top percentile was 27x more productive than median it s useful to see the same programmers doing it both ways

precision less
however if you have large enough number the limit checking does not work because 64bit double precision has less bits usually 54 but this is not defined in standard for the fractions part than a 64bit int

more
we could check that void mymethod int i is more specific than void mymethod double a if any invocation handled by the first method can be passed on to the other one without a compile-time type error

less
it implicitly converts an int to a double gets the double form of largest int that is less or equal to that double and converts that back to an int

more information
you can t convert a double to int because the double has more information than the int

less space
i don t understand how an int 63823 takes up less space than a double 1.0

bigger numbers
clearly calling int x on a double is asking for trouble since double can store bigger numbers than int

less precise
since int is less precise than double i thought i needed to cast it when parsing it into a method

larger range
if one of the operands is a double the result of the multiplication would be a double which allows for a much larger range than an int

higher precedence
i have a decent understanding on why there is an error because of how double has a higher precedence than int and how an int cant necessarily store a double value

far greater
another reason is that the range of double is far greater than that of int

precision less bits
however if you have large enough number the limit checking does not work because 64bit double precision has less bits usually 54 but this is not defined in standard for the fractions part than a 64bit int

larger
a double is 1 typically larger than an int and 2 has some internal structure

more
double s length is way more than int that s why you should be checking int first

smaller
in vararg functions such as printf int smaller than int are promoted to int and floats smaller than double are promoted to double

more precision
the problem is that i need to draw some simple objects points lines especially rectangles with double float decimal precision it doesn t matter with more precision than an int on a windows form i m using visual studio but i can t find anything

less
because all int s can be upcast to a double without loss and the pow function on a double is no less efficient that that on an int

value much bigger
you can convert your object into double and then into int but you should take care as double value is much bigger than int

smaller values
another option would be to add a cast not recommended due to the same loss of information the error warns you about - the fractional part will simply be removed from the value and double can hold way larger and smaller values than int

less space
1 if your data are int or some data form that takes less space than a double float

more difficult
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

faster
the versions using diff are especially impacted ave_diff with int constants is about 2.5 times faster than the double contants version

less
your nummines calculation will always return 0 because when you cast a double that is less than 1 to an int it will be set to 0 which means that the statement in your while loop will only be run a single time hence only a single mine being placed

wider
so in your smartadder interface the method with signature add double a double b does not override the method add int a int b of your adder interface because double is wider than int

more inexact
about the inexactness problem you should be aware that double can be more inexact than int

slower code
using and at the same time to check equality on a int results in slower code because it takes two comparisons instead of one taking the double amount of time

lower
num is a of type const int which is of lower rank when compared to the type of z which is double

smaller rank
for historical reasons you can not pass an int argument of smaller rank than int or a floating type of smaller rank than double to a variadic function

slower
incrementing the value might be a special case but it s possible that on your machine incrementing double is slower than incrementing int

faster
the difference is that int are still faster than double because it takes very few clock cycles to do arithmetic operations on int

better
note how i cast the result to int which is better suited for years than the double precision returned by extract

more mantissa
since double has more mantissa bits than int can have significant bits comparisions between double and int are precise in that regard

probably larger
furthermore the representation of type double is probably larger than that of type int in your system 8-byte double s and 4-byte int s are common

much more
it seems to be that double is much more flexible than int

larger
the undefined behaviour as identified in other answers is explained on my intel platform with vc as that the f format specifier expects a double on the stack which is larger than an int so when it retrieves the value it retrieves more bytes than of an int and now assumes the next parameter at a diferent position on the stack causing z to be printed wrong it is not z that is printed

less space
int would take up less space than a double

much better
except that double is much better than int for storing the join_angle in radians

faster
so i asked myself can a double be faster than a int

less space
int takes less space than double on ram

wider
the widths are positive int not wider than the double significand 53 bits

more
and it shouldnt be too surprising that copying a double 3 strings and an int takes more time than copying a single double

bigger
a double is also probably bigger than an int

much less
indeed fact is limited by the range of type unsigned int which is much less than the precision of type long double

larger
if you are not storing infinity nowhere and use it just for comparison you can use double infinity which is larger than int and long max value

value bigger
i wanted to check if a double value is bigger than maximum int value but because converting function does not return an optional value i am not be able to check by using optional binding

typically smaller
in contrast accessing the bits of a double as an int is usually in-practice safe even though it s formally ub because 1 an int is typically smaller or equal in size to double and 2 an int usually does not have any invalid bit patterns

number bigger
i know that there s another way to check if a double number is bigger than maximum int value but i m curious as why it s happening this way

less
that wouldn t work on platforms where a double is less than 64 bits but it would work on many platforms without 64-bit int

bigger maximum
i know that there s another way to check if a double number is bigger than maximum int value but i m curious as why it s happening this way

more efficient
if you want the modulus use as it gives an int and would be more efficient than double arithmetic

greater
if a 64-bit long is written as an int and is greater than 2 53 ieee double has a 52-bit mantissa then reading it as a double will lose precision

more
i thought when i pass 1 as the argument java would have picked the first argument because int is more specific than double

much smaller
don t forget that the range of int is much smaller than the range of double

simpler
in general casting from long to int is simpler than from double to int

higher values
to prevent the code from overflowing the int value space you should could change the type of res to double long anything that can hold higher values than int

less
the problem is that a positive double very slightly less than an int casts to the next int down but rounds to the closest int

bigger
you could try using double which is bigger than a long and use only the int part

quicker float
a solution using int only calculations should be quicker than float double calculations is

more
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

more
2 unless you have a strong reason to use int it is more idiomatic to use double for spreadsheet values

value also larger
the largest double value is also larger than the largest int so it would have to be a long

more bits
there is also the wrinkle that typically a double consists of more bits than an int does - so by printing in this way your code is interpreting random memory to the right of x as data

better performance
i m writing a c# class to perform 2d separable convolution using int to obtain better performance than double counterpart

better
is simply a hard error because f int is a better match than f double even though the f int overload causes a hard error further on

more
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

bigger
if you tell it the top of the stack has a double and double is bigger than int you ve now just told it to take extra bytes off of the stack which is terrible

not bigger
this will work as long as the double is not bigger than what can fit in an int

more precision
double doesn t have infinite precision and you can t gain more precision than a double has by converting a double to a bigdecimal like you can t gain more precision with an int when you do which is 0.0 because it widens an int to a double

greater value
double has a greater value range than int

stricter alignment
on some real-world architectures double has stricter alignment requirements than int

better
except that double is much better than int for storing the join_angle in radians

little less
you will get 24 if pow 10 2 returns a double that is little less than 100 99.9999999998765 which when cast to int would be truncated resulting in 99 and thus you get

larger values
a double variable can hold larger values than an int and is able to store an approximation of the value 4000000000

higher precision
you can assign the int s returned from integer.parseint string s to your double variables because double s are higher precision than int s and so type conversion happens automatically without the need for an explicit cast

more idiomatic
2 unless you have a strong reason to use int it is more idiomatic to use double for spreadsheet values

better
double is better than int though as it will help you keep precision

less specific
so overloadedsingleparam double a is less specific than void overloadedsingleparam int a when an int value is passed as argument

part less
the int part is less than 2 and the double part is less than 3

larger type
the math.round double a method returns a long which is a larger type than int

larger
bear in mind that if the double returned is larger or smaller than that which can be held in an int then the program behaviour is undefined

smaller range
int or int32 has a much smaller range than double

smaller
you could try to add some value to the double to make sure it s bigger or smaller than an int can be

wider
it is not exact on rare platforms where the range of int is wider than the range of a double s exactly representable whole numbers

less
you really might need to up cast everything into a double and then check to see if the result is greater than or less than an int

smaller
the problem is that the precision of the data type int is smaller as the precision of double the function pow returns double therefore the value of binarychar i will be implizit converted to double and so on.

larger
you do explicit type casting to get your result in int because double is a larger data-type than int

more specific
i thought when i pass 1 as the argument java would have picked the first argument because int is more specific than double

narrower fabs
code should use abs with int or narrower fabs with double fabsf with float labs x with long etc

larger
many processors and or compilers implement long double types larger than any int type regardless of name and there are processors with 32 byte pointers

no better
the conversion from float to long double is no better than the conversion from float to int since they are both not promotions

greater
this causes a referencing to a memory area that was not completely initialized with value passed as parameter to the printf because double size memory buffer area is greater than int size

bigger
edit actually my solution does not work because double can be very big much bigger than int and also very small like fractions

smaller
extra arguments to variatic functions with types smaller than int are promoted to int and passed as such and floating point types smaller than double are promoted to double and passed as such

easier
here for what it s worth is a pipes-csv variant which just compresses each parsed row into an unboxed vector of int s by hand this easier than finding double which is what this csv is really storing using readint from the bytestring package.

higher maximum
a double has a higher maximum and presumably lower minimum than an int so there s no conversion necessary so you shouldn t experience any side effects of assigning a double an int so there s no need for an error

higher magnitude
not really considering that a double can be a much higher magnitude than an int

more accurate
i figured out this was happening because i was storing the wall coordinates in double and although double are certainly more accurate than int they still aren t exact

larger
for platforms where int is larger than double it s obviously false

more
a double is a more precise type than an int in a general manner of speaking

better
with gcc 4.9 it prints error because the second overload isn t discarded and int is a better match than double

more
you used the double to calculate an int result the double is more precise than the int so you lost precision

less
the double literal 99.9999999999999 can be represented as a double which is less than 100 so the cast to int truncates the decimal part and 99 is the result

wider
this conversion is legal because double are wider than int

faster
on my machine the double swap loop completes 11 times faster than the int swap loop

higher
because a double is higher it will merge the int into the 0.0

better
byte takes less memory than double and int and provides better performance than bigger datatypes especially better than double

smaller
on many systems int is smaller than double so if that s the case on yours this is very likely to be the cause of your crash

better
well in multithread the performance of the int version is 2.6 times better than the double precision

slower
using and at the same time to check equality on a int results in slower code because it takes two comparisons instead of one taking the double amount of time

more space ints-an
you re getting the outofmemory because if you declare int 1000 the memory is allocated immediately additionally double take up more space than ints-an int representation will also save you space

less
if a value in the double array is less than the int value at the same position of the two dimensional array then in that part of the boolean array the value would is true

more precision
double can hold more precision than int

faster pow
this can t help performance either since pow double int is significantly faster than pow double double in general

larger
because a double which f expects probably is larger than an int on your platform

indeed more
an implicit conversion from byte to int is indeed more specific than an implicit conversion from byte to double according to widening primitive conversions rules

more
you are doing linear programming on int which is more troublesome than with reals double

less memory
typically an int will use less memory than a double that is why one doesn t just use the largest possible datatype

greater sizeof
alternatively if fieldsize is equal to sizeof double and sizeof double is greater than sizeof int then you are writing off the end of d_buffer and then something is corrupting your data

precision much more
as for the last question floating point arithmetic particularly double precision is much more complex than int arithmetic so on a reasonably modern pipelined processor each instruction will take longer to execute

more precsion
this is important because if the int needs more precsion than 52-bits the precision is too low for a double

more complex
as for the last question floating point arithmetic particularly double precision is much more complex than int arithmetic so on a reasonably modern pipelined processor each instruction will take longer to execute

more time
and it shouldnt be too surprising that copying a double 3 strings and an int takes more time than copying a single double

more difficult
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

higher
a double has a higher maximum and presumably lower minimum than an int so there s no conversion necessary so you shouldn t experience any side effects of assigning a double an int so there s no need for an error

slower
even dividing int is slower than multiplying floats or double in some cases

lower ranges
if we use float data type in java we have to add f at the end of floating point literal as java assumes it to be double data type and gives an error why not do the same for short and byte as both have lower ranges than int

type substantially narrower
the int portions of the logarithms of 31 and 310 use different numbers of bits so there are different numbers of bits left for the significand so they end up being rounded to slightly different values. as long as the int type is substantially narrower than the double type the calculated limit will be much larger than the error in log10

more
but this isn t true because double is more general than int and therefore int is the most-specific option in this case

less memory
int needs less memory comparing to double numbers

less
int needs less memory comparing to double numbers

larger data-type
you do explicit type casting to get your result in int because double is a larger data-type than int

higher
if your resulting double has higher int value then simple int math sometimes stops working

larger
i understand that the compiler isn t happy because a double might be larger than an int can hold but this particular control is guaranteed to be a value from 1 to 10 so i know that it will be okay

greater
a double has a range that can be greater than any int type

larger
because a double is larger than an int this accesses the 4 bytes of the original int and an extra 4 bytes on the stack

smaller
these conversions promote float to double and anything smaller than int to int or unsigned int

smaller
in the third case double precision loss is much smaller than the int and you get something like

bigger mantissa
the double has a bigger mantissa the int bits of the real number

more
or math.ceil double which returns the closest int that is more than the double

range wider
can be false when int range is wider than double uncommon and dx is a rounded value whose next higher representable value to 2 greater

greater
you should be using math.ceiling which will return the smallest int value that is greater than the double passed in

bigger maximum
i wanted to check if a double value is bigger than maximum int value but because converting function does not return an optional value i am not be able to check by using optional binding

larger numbers
because double can contain larger numbers than int or long

more
this is important because if the int needs more precsion than 52-bits the precision is too low for a double

types more instructions
on a 32-bit machine doing addition and comparison on 64-bit int types takes more instructions than doing the equivalent on double s

larger
your upccode int is larger than the long data type so i tried it with double which is a float but works

bigger
the double has a bigger mantissa the int bits of the real number

more
by contrast void doitagain int is more specific than void doitagain double because int is a subtype of double according the the jls

less
i should point out previously in the code the double is less than 1 i.e 0.987 and is then multiplied by the number of decimal places to make it a real positive int though it s stored as a double still at that point

smaller range
int can hold a smaller range than double

greater
alternatively if fieldsize is equal to sizeof double and sizeof double is greater than sizeof int then you are writing off the end of d_buffer and then something is corrupting your data

range much smaller
1 int range is much smaller than double and for pow 2 100 that fails

more specific
this behaviour is due to the fact that int is more specific than double while there is no such comparison between int and boolean

wider
the most urgent one that comes to mind is that a double is wider than an int on your platform and garbage memory is read

lower
so no arguments after the 1st one get automatically converted except as defined by default argument conversions basically any int type with a rank lower than int to int and any floating-point type with a rank lower than double to double thank you pascal cuoq

much wider
the range of double is much wider than the range of int or long

better
it would really depend on the processor and the range of the int which is better and using double would resolve most of the range issues

wider
can be false when int range is wider than double uncommon and dx is a rounded value whose next higher representable value to 2 greater

more general
but this isn t true because double is more general than int and therefore int is the most-specific option in this case

better
imho int looks better than double in your task

higher
i have a decent understanding on why there is an error because of how double has a higher precedence than int and how an int cant necessarily store a double value

much trickier
note that the double is much trickier than the int s

bigger maximum
so if i try to convert a double number bigger than maximum int it crashes instead of returning nil

less
i don t understand how an int 63823 takes up less space than a double 1.0

much bigger
double is much bigger than int

more precise
you used the double to calculate an int result the double is more precise than the int so you lost precision

greater
and the second calculation 33 5.0 the result is actually promoted to double which has greater precision than int and resulted to decimal

faster
int subtractions are 2.5 times faster than double subtractions on my machine

greater
double has a greater value range than int

narrower
but there was this legacy thing dating all the way back to k r c called default argument promotion that essentially says the compiler will implicitly convert all int types narrower than int to int if necessary to match a function signature and all floating point types narrower than double to double ditto

faster
maybe division between double and int is faster than it between double

higher precedence
i have a decent understanding on why there is an error because of how double has a higher precedence than int and how an int cant necessarily store a double value

way greater
the range of double is way greater than the range of 32 or 64 bit int which is why std floor returns a double

shorter
note that when float values are passed to printf they are automatically converted to double just as numeric types shorter than int are promoted to int

better fit
so your compiler picks the double constructor as a better fit than the int one

higher
and if the value of your double is higher than the range of an int then this can produce undefined behavior

more
the reason is simple double has different handling than new - mql4.56789 float the more than int et al

range more
double has range more than a 64-bit int but its precision is less dues to its representation since double is 64-bit as well it can t fit more actual values

less
int takes less space than double on ram

smaller size
4 + 4 since int is smaller size compared to double padding of double size is done

narrower
i believe the following works as a sort comparison function for positive int provided the int type used is substantially narrower than the double type 32-bit int and 64-bit double and the log10 routine used returns exactly correct results for exact powers of 10 which a good implementation does

stricter
on some real-world architectures double has stricter alignment requirements than int

smaller
since an int is representing by a non-decimal number 1 and a double is represented by a decimal-number with precision 32 bytes more than that of a float 1.0 we can say that int s are less than or smaller than double s and by that logic int s can be promoted to double s and double s can be demoted to int s

smaller
that means a float will be a double and anything smaller than an int will be an int

smaller
and since float is typically promoted to double with varargs calls if your int is smaller than your double this will break

more appropriate
also int are more appropriate than double numerics for this case of logical coercion

bigger
one of long long and double is bigger than 3 int and a multiple of 8

more flexible
it seems to be that double is much more flexible than int

more specific
we could check that void mymethod int i is more specific than void mymethod double a if any invocation handled by the first method can be passed on to the other one without a compile-time type error

less
i don t understand how an int 63823 takes up less space than a double 1.0

precision much more complex
as for the last question floating point arithmetic particularly double precision is much more complex than int arithmetic so on a reasonably modern pipelined processor each instruction will take longer to execute

lower rank
num is a of type const int which is of lower rank when compared to the type of z which is double

lower minimum
a double has a higher maximum and presumably lower minimum than an int so there s no conversion necessary so you shouldn t experience any side effects of assigning a double an int so there s no need for an error

slower manipulations
also after the first coercion from a side effect of a benchmark as noted above r will operate on double s and that contains slower manipulations than on int s

slower
with it is nub on and comparing big int is slower than comparing double

more precise
a double is a more precise type than an int in a general manner of speaking

wider
the range of double is wider than int

trickier
note that the double is much trickier than the int s

better performance
byte takes less memory than double and int and provides better performance than bigger datatypes especially better than double

more bits
you can work around this issue if you ll advance to big int floating point numbers that store more bits than a double precision number

more
this behaviour is due to the fact that int is more specific than double while there is no such comparison between int and boolean

smaller
1 int range is much smaller than double and for pow 2 100 that fails

less
you can also use math.floor double to get the closest int that is less than the double

less
similarly when i cast a double that is less than the minimum possible int i also get -2147483648

smaller
it doesn t matter if second member would be int short or whatever - as long as it is smaller than double sizeof struct will be 16

more specific
by contrast void doitagain int is more specific than void doitagain double because int is a subtype of double according the the jls

less
as far as i m aware so long as the spacing between two double is less than 2 then int values stored as double should be exact - and though 10 14 is pushing it this should be an exact int since 10 14 2 46.507 2 53

less
further the precision of double may be less than int introducing other problems

more
for example an int is more specific than a double because 1 can be promoted to 1.0

smaller
this is the reason for which if you use printf to print floats you don t need to say lf int the format strings and f is enough lf is needed for scanf however because that function stores a result and a float can be smaller than a double

type larger
you need to use 2 even if the number of bits in your int type is larger than the precision of a double since the number of used bits in the most significant value might only be 1

larger 64-bit
typically a double is 64-bit ieee floating point with roughly 52 bits precision and with range much larger than 64-bit int so magnitude is no problem

faster
if such a hardware unit is present floats double can be faster than int unless there is also hardware int support

more
you can t convert a double to int because the double has more information than the int

greater precision
and the second calculation 33 5.0 the result is actually promoted to double which has greater precision than int and resulted to decimal

bigger
a double is bigger than an int

more
there is also the wrinkle that typically a double consists of more bits than an int does - so by printing in this way your code is interpreting random memory to the right of x as data

smaller
this imply that result of pow x y converted to int will be truncated because of double arithmetic and exponentiation that will return double value slightly smaller than int

bigger
you can convert your object into double and then into int but you should take care as double value is much bigger than int

more specific
for example an int is more specific than a double because 1 can be promoted to 1.0

wider range
also given that double has a wider range what would one return for those out of range int values

less specific
this is java detecting what you are doing and thinking it may be a mistake on your part - int s are less specific than double s

greater
what i need to do it iterate over a list find the first int which is greater than 3 and is even then just double it and return it

narrower
the int portions of the logarithms of 31 and 310 use different numbers of bits so there are different numbers of bits left for the significand so they end up being rounded to slightly different values. as long as the int type is substantially narrower than the double type the calculated limit will be much larger than the error in log10

more complex
i am guessing this is because modifying a double is a more complex operation than modifying an int

better results
if you use int between -128 and 127 you will get much better results than double from -128 to 127 because the former uses caches values the later does not

better
why does f double is a better match than f long int 0 for f long

less
so overloadedsingleparam double a is less specific than void overloadedsingleparam int a when an int value is passed as argument

faster
int multiplications however are only 1.5 times faster than double multiplications

higher
i have a decent understanding on why there is an error because of how double has a higher precedence than int and how an int cant necessarily store a double value

more troublesome
you are doing linear programming on int which is more troublesome than with reals double

greater
since double is greater that int and long int and long will be turned into double in double long and int double

indeed more specific
an implicit conversion from byte to int is indeed more specific than an implicit conversion from byte to double according to widening primitive conversions rules

less
or a value for int a that is 6 less than double c

less
since int is less precise than double i thought i needed to cast it when parsing it into a method

more expensive
while both double comparisons and hashes are more expensive than int s the number of comparisons is theta n log n while the number of hashes is o n

much longer
if they are double it takes much longer until w w 2 is 0 than with int

less efficient
because all int s can be upcast to a double without loss and the pow function on a double is no less efficient that that on an int

much slower
double is much slower than int

slower
double is much slower than int

less space
i don t understand how an int 63823 takes up less space than a double 1.0

array less
if a value in the double array is less than the int value at the same position of the two dimensional array then in that part of the boolean array the value would is true

more
as soon as the int needs more than 29 bits the atom is changed by the vm into a number type which is really represented as a 29 bit pointer to the actual 64 bit double precision float

types more
on a 32-bit machine doing addition and comparison on 64-bit int types takes more instructions than doing the equivalent on double s

more
i am guessing this is because modifying a double is a more complex operation than modifying an int

larger
when the result of math.pow i j a double is larger than integer.max_value and you cast to an int then the result is integer.max_value

significantly faster
this can t help performance either since pow double int is significantly faster than pow double double in general

smaller sizeof
since sizeof int is very probably smaller than sizeof double this is going to lead to horror

bigger
with the cast that bad stuff is undefined behavior most likely double is bigger than int and it overruns the memory for i

more general type
double can in a way be seen as a more general type than int

smaller
4 + 4 since int is smaller size compared to double padding of double size is done

wider
also given that double has a wider range what would one return for those out of range int values

math faster
often using int math is faster than double

bigger
a normal 3 will be treated as int but in the test function you are retrieving double which are bigger than an int on most platforms and you might end up reading wrong locations which inturn leads to exc_bad_access run time signal being generated

slower
double is a different data type and generally much slower than int

bigger
double is much bigger than int

much more flexible
it seems to be that double is much more flexible than int

greater
today i noticed that when i cast a double that is greater than the maximum possible int to an int i get -2147483648

more
since double has more mantissa bits than int can have significant bits comparisions between double and int are precise in that regard

larger
double is larger than an int hence the overflow

more
operations on float and especially double cost more than on int

more
i could add the dropzone in a ng-include above the area and have it hidden when the template is looking elsewhere but have heard that ng-include uses more processor than ng-view so would prefer to keep it all together

more processor

more visual flexibility
finally you might want to look into uicollectionview which provides a lot more visual flexibility than uitableview and can be seen as a sort of generalization of the latter

better candidate
on second thoughts in your case uicollectionview is surely a better candidate than uitableview

more generic
uicollectionview is more generic than uitableview and you can custom almost thing on it

using printf isn t faster than cout but scanf is a little faster than cin 0.04s + - 0.05

printf faster
scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc

slower
at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam

from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to tokudb s compression and it s much much faster than myisam or innodb

cell much wider
the difference between a min and max dimension can be very large as the given area covered by a landscape cell is much wider and shorter than a portrait cell

wider
as long as landscape means wider than taller and portrait viceversa it means to read the image into memory and check width and height

smaller
but the only thing i get is that the activity is still in landscape but the rectangle now is smaller with the portrait dimensions and the camera becomes weird because the image is rotated 90 degrees and moves down when i move the phone left and up when moving the phone right

layout more
i guess you are able to see the complete layout in portrait just because portrait layout is having more space and your complete layout is fitting well but landscape is having lesser space

lesser
as landscape has lesser space than portrait you are able to view only top scrollview so only that portion would be scrollable

lower right
without more detail it s hard to say why your approach doesn t work but my guess is that you are seeing the sprite positioning you describe as a result of the fact that if you don t change orientation the lower left in portrait is the lower right in landscape when rotated left it s the same point in gl space 0 0

bigger
you are using the screen size to generate your placeholder image and the width of the screen in landscape is bigger than portrait

mode greater
the amount of spacing to the right of the uiview when in portrait mode is greater than i want for landscape mode and the distance from the bottom is less than i want for landscape mode

more space
in portrait the spacing is decent but in landscape mode i feel like the graphs should be bigger and take up more space than in portrait mode which is simply not possible with the tab bar and navigation bar

bigger
my problem with this is that the calculation works fine in the portrait mode but as soon as i switch to landscape mode the distance between bottom and button is bigger than in portrait mode

mode less
now my doubt is when i rotate it to portrait mode from landscape mode since the width of the textblocks present inside the itemtemplate of listbox is already defined when i rotate the it to portrait i am not able to see all the data present it cuts off since the width of the portrait mode is less when compared to landscape mode

height bigger
topbar portrait height is bigger than topbar landscape height everywhere except iphone 6 plus

narrower
as you can see the bottom two photos landscape so have been rotated are narrower than the portrait ones at the top

taller
portrait is taller landscape is wider

mode lower
you have this issue because height in landscape mode is lower then in portrait

more buttons
in landscape it has more buttons in addition to what is there in portrait mode

view less vertical
or the tableview is covering it up because the landscape view has less vertical room than the portrait view

more
then you can write separate css for width less than 650px portrait more than 650 landscape

mode more
its because the height of the screen in portrait mode is more when compared to height of the screen in landscape mode

orientation better
currently i m using only the portrait orientation for all devices but the portrait orientation looks better on phones meanwhile landscape orientation looks better on tablets

smaller
your imageview in landscape is smaller than portrait

choppier
if you switch between portrait and landscape when viewing this on an ipad3 you ll need to refresh the browser window between switches you can see that portrait mode is choppier than landscape

more
in landscape it has more buttons in addition to what is there in portrait mode

more horizontal space
i want all of the images to fit inside the width of the text area which will change dynamically with the window size and i want them all to be the same height meaning of course that landscape images take up more horizontal space than portrait ones etc

higher
you may try to listen to uideviceorientationdidchangenotification within your subclass cell to rotate the webview and within your view controller with the table view and run a -reloaddata on your table view in order to properly resize the cells assuming the landscape webview is way higher than the portrait webview

mode choppier
if you switch between portrait and landscape when viewing this on an ipad3 you ll need to refresh the browser window between switches you can see that portrait mode is choppier than landscape

more rows
portrait mode can display more rows than in landscape mode

larger
i had an outlet of a viewgraph which was a subclass of uiview in which i drew some graphics.in landscape mode the size of the viewgraph is larger than in portrait mode

view less
or the tableview is covering it up because the landscape view has less vertical room than the portrait view

less
on an iphone compact in landscape mode the status bar is hidden and the navigation bar height is less than in portrait

bigger topbar
topbar portrait height is bigger than topbar landscape height everywhere except iphone 6 plus

taller
i am trying to make all a row of 4 images all have the same height size i already tried to play around with the width and height using css but nothing seems to work the portrait images always end up taller than the landscape ones here s the code

layout more space
i guess you are able to see the complete layout in portrait just because portrait layout is having more space and your complete layout is fitting well but landscape is having lesser space

webview way higher
you may try to listen to uideviceorientationdidchangenotification within your subclass cell to rotate the webview and within your view controller with the table view and run a -reloaddata on your table view in order to properly resize the cells assuming the landscape webview is way higher than the portrait webview

smaller
because in landscape your height is smaller than in portrait you need to have a value smaller than 1.0

lower
without more detail it s hard to say why your approach doesn t work but my guess is that you are seeing the sprite positioning you describe as a result of the fact that if you don t change orientation the lower left in portrait is the lower right in landscape when rotated left it s the same point in gl space 0 0

lesser space
as landscape has lesser space than portrait you are able to view only top scrollview so only that portion would be scrollable

shorter
the difference between a min and max dimension can be very large as the given area covered by a landscape cell is much wider and shorter than a portrait cell

smaller
obviously i want in portrait view the content area of this iframe to be smaller than in landscape

mode lower then
you have this issue because height in landscape mode is lower then in portrait

i know that in java there is a compareto method that you can write in a class that will compare two variables and return a value -1 1 or 0 signifing greater than less than and equals to operations

less
implement compareto in temporary temporary.compareto left such that it returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as temporary is less than equals to or greater than the left

less
all i changed was the first compareto comparison to be less than instead of less than or equals to

less grater
if this works it seems that u are still comparing the strings in your ordered list and u should now check if the return value of compareto is less grater equals to 0

greater less
the only significance of a compareto return value is if it is greater less than or equals to zero

less
if this works it seems that u are still comparing the strings in your ordered list and u should now check if the return value of compareto is less grater equals to 0

greater
you need to call the compareto method which will indicate the result of the comparison by returning an integer less than greater than or equals to 0

less
in the compareto method you can decide which fields are used for the comparison greater less than or equals

less
icomparable declares the compareto method which returns an integer that specifies a less than equals to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type

greater less
in the compareto method you can decide which fields are used for the comparison greater less than or equals

with this rather than needing to implement a comparator all you need to implement is the int compareto class o method in the class which returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

less
is a generic type at compile time java will require that an instance provide an implementation of int compareto t o which from the javadoc returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

slower
most likely hashcode will be faster unless for whatever reason calling hashcode + equals once is much slower than calling compareto log n times

bigger
we can call its compareto method to decide whether it is bigger than equals to or less than any int

the compareto method returns one of -1 0 1 depending on whether or not the argument is less than equals to or greater than respectively

or is it compareto returns negative numbers 0 and positive numbers respectively indicating whether the calling object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

less
you should be using compareto method for less than or equals or greater than

less
compareto returns a number that is less than equals to or greater than zero corresponding to the first string being before the same as or after the second string respectively

less
in the compareto method you can then write the code which will call the getters for the year month and so on until it figures out whether the current object is less than equals to or greater than the object o being passed into the compareto method

less
note that in both cases you can take advantage of the fact that int also implements so you can use its compareto method to determine whether corresponding values in each instance of your class are less than equals to or greater than each other

greater
the compareto method returns 1 0 or -1 depending on whether value a is respectively greater than equals to or lesser than value b

less
compareto compares values and returns an int which tells if the values compare less than equals or greater than

the only significance of a compareto return value is if it is greater less than or equals to zero

once much slower
most likely hashcode will be faster unless for whatever reason calling hashcode + equals once is much slower than calling compareto log n times

according to javadoc compareto needs to return a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

less
this interface defines the method compareto t which will return a negative number zero or a positive number if the first object is less than equals to or greater than the other one respectively

less
the interface defines one method compareto that must return a negative integer zero or a positive integer if this object is less than equals to or greater than the other object respectively

less
per the page i linked to compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

less
compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

worse
when one of the strings is a prefix of another the performance of compareto is worse as it still needs to determine the lexicographical ordering while equals won t worry any more and return false immediately

less
and my guess as to why an element is being dropped is your compareto method never returns a 1 in any case so elements are always considered to be less than or equals to other elements which is probably screwing with the treeset

less
compareto return a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

on i386 the dyld stub is much faster than the powerpc equivalent so we didn√¢ t bother doing extra work to bypass it

worse design
in short it s worse design to move things to the base class than it is to downcast to the specific class

worse
in short it s worse design to move things to the base class than it is to downcast to the specific class

less
as the condition reads a loop can not be zipped tighter if it s either too short less than five base or its ends do not match

less
precision parameter if centroid amount of change is less than a threshold delta stop the algorithm

slower plain
plus the overhead of doing it is extremely costly- hive queries against hbase are on my cluster at least an order of magnitude slower than against plain hdfs files

faster
namedtuple is faster and significantly more memory efficient than a dictionary

lighter
2 you probably want a namedtuple - i m pretty sure they re lighter than dictionary and you can access properties using dot notation for which i have an aesthetic preference anyway

less overhead
namedtuple should perform better less overhead than dictionary if the lists are long

lighter
as namedtuple lighter than dictionary

lower overhead
namedtuple have a lower overhead than dictionary since the duplicate keys don t have to be stored per item but have the convenience of named access

better
depending on your use case a dictionary might fit better than a namedtuple

easier
creating an instance of the namedtuple is easier than creating a dictionary

less
if that distance is less than the radius of the circle then you know that the polygons intersects the circle

less intuitive
the one drawback is that distance between vertices might be slightly less intuitive than polygons area but the two are proportional

greater
calculate the actual minimum distance and continue through the sorted list until the maximum distance between the polygons is greater than the minimum distance found so far

more x
plenty of others don t use a delimiter at all and require you to start a new segment polygons if you re more than x distance away from the last point. furthermore these things often wind up being multi-gb ascii files so reading the entire thing into memory can be impractical

more
1 might not yet be sparse enough to make this better compared to just a plain bitarray assuming longs storing 64 bits each it doesn t take more than 2 longs to have more than one bitset on average but if the sparsity increases beyond that the space and time savings will show

still better

significantly more
while i think the move to swift is prudent but i think it overstates the case to argue that swift is significantly more secure that objective-c

safer
apple seems to claim that the optional type in swift is safer than nil in objective-c but i don t understand why this is so

more
after reading some related articles i don t think swift is more effective than objective-c

runtime smaller
the swift runtime is smaller than the objective-c runtime

more
swift is more strictly typed than objective-c

example more
as you can see the swift example is more complex and error prone than your objective-c code

more
swift won t allow you to do absolutely everything that objective-c does but it will allow you to do almost everything and the code will be probably more robust considering that swift is more modern language with stronger typing than objective-c

print more readable
objective-c print is more readable compared to swift

better
better if you have a code swift is better but is not problem objective-c

more
i also use objective-c more than swift but here s what my guess is as to what the objective-c code would come to

no longer visible
however when i switch to swift 4.0 the methods declared in swift is no longer visible in objective-c

less complicated
it seems to me that swift would be way simpler to learn then objective-c for beginners i know because i learned it in like 2 months and swift is less complicated and better laid out then objective-c

less safe
swift in that case would not be safer but less safe than objective-c

better
so i ve started learning swift because it looks way better than objective-c

better
swift also prevents us i believe from overriding a parent class s property but also still lets us observe changes to that property--this is much better than objective-c s approach

better
i feel swift is better than objective-c in many aspects but my major question is - will swift dynamic libraries support older version of swift

more
im new to swift but i like it more than objective-c as it looks a bit like java does to me from syntax wise compared to objective-c

more strongly
specifically it makes it possible to write objective-c code that plays nicely with swift which is more strongly typed than objective-c

greater
i know that swift is buggy as heck i run into bugs everyday but ill bet objective-c was even worse when it started out benefits of hindsight so in a couple of years swift will be equal or greater than objective-c keeping its basic simplicity as well

stronger typing
swift won t allow you to do absolutely everything that objective-c does but it will allow you to do almost everything and the code will be probably more robust considering that swift is more modern language with stronger typing than objective-c

faster
bottom line i would personally hesitate to draw any simple conclusions of swift is faster than objective-c or vice versa

faster
most importantly for your image processing app the compiler will optimize swift code to run faster than objective-c

less
it seems to me that swift would be way simpler to learn then objective-c for beginners i know because i learned it in like 2 months and swift is less complicated and better laid out then objective-c

more just
the swift designers went through a lot of trouble to make sure that it s more than just objective-c without the constraints of c in fact i almost wish they hadn t said that since it s so often misquoted

more comfortable
however i read that swift was the successor of objective-c and i would feel more comfortable with swift syntax

easier
as you can see defining a singleton class in swift is much easier than in objective-c

faster
i don t think that as of today you can run these tests and determine with any certainty whether swift 1.0 is faster or slower than objective-c

much more free
objective-c is much more free and easy with types and compilation checks where swift isn t

less
but swift is less dynamically typed than objective-c and has less support for reflection

much more
objective-c is much more free and easy with types and compilation checks where swift isn t

easier
download xcode free and learn objective-c or swift swift is easier to learn than objective-c

older programming
as objective-c is the older programming language for ios or macos applications swift allows you to use those classes structs in your code

more static
we ve seen that swift uses a more static method dispatch than objective-c which unless a class dervices from foundation nsobject prevents the style of swizzling based on remapping method implementations at runtime

more faster
and also apple does might not confidently announce that swift is more faster than objective-c in all the cases

more readable
with swift the code is much more readable than with objective-c

stricter
swift is stricter about runtime type correctness than objective-c so duck typing alone is not enough

dramatically slower
the swift one is dramatically slower then objective-c implementation

more
if you get a difference between swift and objective-c it s more because swift is probably better on optimisation

more effective
after reading some related articles i don t think swift is more effective than objective-c

application harder
injecting code in a swift application is harder than it was for an objective-c application but it s still possible

no longer
however when i switch to swift 4.0 the methods declared in swift is no longer visible in objective-c

application much bigger
executable size of swift application is much bigger than size of objective-c application

more
personally i prefer objective-c because you can use c very easily as anything that is legal in c is also legal in objective-c added to which swift is a more procedural in style where objective-c is quite clearly object orientated

more
writing swift 2.0 in my professional work my personal opinion is that it s indeed ready for enterprise applications -- maybe even more than objective-c ever were

example more complex
as you can see the swift example is more complex and error prone than your objective-c code

more strictly
swift is more strictly typed than objective-c

more comfortable
i have a objective-c application working fine and smooth to be more comfortable with swift i decided to write the unit tests for this app in swift

older
as objective-c is the older programming language for ios or macos applications swift allows you to use those classes structs in your code

faster pure
it is possible for swift to be faster than pure objective-c in things that you would traditionally use c or c++ for anyway

significantly more secure
while i think the move to swift is prudent but i think it overstates the case to argue that swift is significantly more secure that objective-c

less dynamically
but swift is less dynamically typed than objective-c and has less support for reflection

smaller
the swift runtime is smaller than the objective-c runtime

code slower
there are multiple reasons why the swift code is slower than the objective-c code

easier
early this month i started learning swift as i found it fun and easier than objective-c

larger
you will notice that swift bundles are always about 4-5 mb larger than their objective-c counterparts and this is precisely why

easier
swift is neither easier to read nor understand than objective-c

more
also note that i use objective-c more than swift

better deal
or is it merely a hint to whatever tool converts between swift and objective-c to better deal with swift optionals

slower
wouldn t swift be slower than objective-c in this case since it is layered on top of it

faster
as craig revealed within the announcement of swift it is said to be faster than objective-c by far

dictionary more
this is because the swift dictionary is more strongly typed than the objective-c nsdictionary

faster
the perf hit will be ridiculous i know apple say swift execute faster than objective-c but this is low level so it will be harmless

clearer
swift is clearer on versions releases and i keep asking myself if i am missing something related to objective-c since i can t find this information

more procedural
personally i prefer objective-c because you can use c very easily as anything that is legal in c is also legal in objective-c added to which swift is a more procedural in style where objective-c is quite clearly object orientated

much easier
as you can see defining a singleton class in swift is much easier than in objective-c

fewer situations
swift will incur this penalty in fewer situations than objective-c will for instance method calls to swift-only protocol methods do not hit objc_msgsend but if the protocol is declared in objective-c or if the swift protocol is decorated with objective-c such that it can be adopted by objective-c objects as well then method calls to methods in that protocol adopted by swift objects appear to be dispatched via objc_msgsend

cleaner
usually i find swift s method naming to be cleaner than objective-c s but init methods can be an exception

dictionary more strongly
this is because the swift dictionary is more strongly typed than the objective-c nsdictionary

slower
i don t think that as of today you can run these tests and determine with any certainty whether swift 1.0 is faster or slower than objective-c

api easier
adding lightweight generics to your objective-c api makes it easier to interface with swift because your api gets translated more precisely

easier
on the other hand swift is easier to learn especially if you have objective-c background so it can be adopted during the time slowly and paralelly with using objective-c

more
swift s compiler is also doing a lot more than objective-c s compiler considering swift is more strongly typed and does not required specifying imports among other things

-documentary more
objective-c -documentary provides more content than the documentary for swift

print more
objective-c print is more readable compared to swift

more
and also apple does might not confidently announce that swift is more faster than objective-c in all the cases

slower
there are multiple reasons why the swift code is slower than the objective-c code

more modern
swift won t allow you to do absolutely everything that objective-c does but it will allow you to do almost everything and the code will be probably more robust considering that swift is more modern language with stronger typing than objective-c

less dynamic
swift seems to be less dynamic than objective-c in these stuffs

-documentary more content
objective-c -documentary provides more content than the documentary for swift

lot smarter
swift is lot smarter than objective-c about singleton class

more
no objects come magically into existence in swift any more than in objective-c

more sensible
note that swift s arrays are much more sensible than objective-c s

faster
my view is that if in some cases objective-c is faster than swift it doesn t mean that all over performance of swift is slower

much nicer
i find that objective-c is much nicer for working with core audio than swift

more
specifically it makes it possible to write objective-c code that plays nicely with swift which is more strongly typed than objective-c

less
so it should have always been gkagent under objective-c in order to be strictly correct however objective-c is less type-safe than swift so you could get away with it with the possibility that you d get an unrecognized selector exception if a gkagent object was ever passed to the delegate method and you assumed it was a gkagent2d

more familiar
this article seems to suggest that this is possible by swizzling a fake location into apple s cllocationmanager class to be used by other apps but i am unfamiliar with the objective-c code more familiar with swift

slower
wouldn t swift be slower than objective-c in this case since it is layered on top of it

more understandable
those attributes let you create objective-c code which is more understandable by swift and complier warn you when you break the rule for example

more secure
one of the reasons we want to move is because swift is more secure than objective-c

more
we ve seen that swift uses a more static method dispatch than objective-c which unless a class dervices from foundation nsobject prevents the style of swizzling based on remapping method implementations at runtime

dramatically slower then
the swift one is dramatically slower then objective-c implementation

newer
the swift compiler is doing a lot more and is quite a bit newer than the objective-c compiler so it unlikely it will be as stable fast for quite some time

more
one of the reasons we want to move is because swift is more secure than objective-c

less familiar
i m learning swift and much less familiar with objective-c but for the life of me i can t figure out how they are trying to achieve the goal stated as build list of encodings sorted and including only those with human readable names.

stricter
furthermore swift is stricter than objective-c when it comes to initialisers

more
making abstract-class before i had more than one subclass in mind for them

better
edit i found out that piston was proposing query throttling but everywhere people say that tastypie is better than piston

nicer
i recommend to take a look on tastypie which turned out to work even nicer than piston it helps you also with things like versioning your api and mamange multiple endpoints nicly

more
tastypie is more tightly coupled to the orm than piston but there are methods that you can define in a tastypie resource to specify how to handle create read update delete

more tightly

less overhead
my intuition is that transient properties would incurr less overhead than persistent properties because they do not need to be persistent and read from the database so converting them to persistent properties will likely only make things slightly worse

so more
memcache data lives in memory and isn t persistent so is for more transient data

faster
since json can store arrays i can create quite complex config with it and it parses faster than ini files

simpler
it is similar to incron however config uses a simpler to read ini file instead of a plain text file

probably better
if you intend manual config it s probably better to choose something else for example ini

slightly more
because spring s xml config is slightly more powerful than shiro s ini spring users are encouraged to use full spring config instead of shiro ini

more
i like that ini is more for config purposes but with todays interest in json it seems more logical for the config be designed with json in mind

less
ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested

slightly more powerful

nothing more
i can make this happen with the minimal project where oncreate does nothing more than call super and setcontentview

but i ve had difficulty implementing this it seems as though nsprogress is meant more for long operations that execute all their code on one background thread but have separate sections that make it easy to determine when progress has been made if this is the case then the use of the term suboperation is a bit misleading as it brings to mind the use of nested nsoperation

datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord

model much easier
from my point of view the datamapper model is much easier to grasp but since activerecord is the defacto standard it feels weird to change the orm just for this little problem

i d say iqueryable is more suitable for interaction with a database than ienumerable is

more
ienumerable is more generic than iqueryable though all instances of iqueryable implement ienumerable and only defines

better
final result will be of type ienumerable and in terms of performance this would be better than iqueryable since here join is taking place between in memory collections

more
ienumerable is more generic than iqueryable though all

implementation more picky
entity framework s iqueryable implementation is more picky about creating new objects in objects than regular linq to objects ienumerable

faster
i assume applying iqueryable will be much faster than the ienumerable not to forget i was able to use iqueryable on the other entities without any issues

smaller
for your view to expect an ienumerable you need to change your view declaration to be also if you really need to perform a find use iqueryable first them return the result as ienumerable since the payload on ienumerable is smaller than iqueryable

better
the ienumerable side of linq which works on in-memory objects that are already in the heap will almost certainly perform better than the iqueryable side which exists to be translated into a native query language like sql

slower
in simple words all operations on ienumerable causes simple iteratation over all elements well it s lazy ienumerable really slower than iqueryable

more useful
can you provide any useful example that shows ienumerable could be more useful than iqueryable

way quicker
with really basic calls to the database iqueryable is way quicker but when do i need to think about using an ienumerable in its place

implementation more

more suitable
i d say iqueryable is more suitable for interaction with a database than ienumerable is

better
i have read about ienumerable and iqueryable i have read that iqueryable is better with linq because when you use where clauses it creates the exact query it needs but with ienumerable it retrieves all rows from database and then filters on memory

better
what i know is using iqueryable is better than ienumerable if another query is going to be performed

better
i had previously used aptana 3 for a couple days and may have come to the conclusion that it is better than dreamweaver at actual html css coding

now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

you can try x1 c1 and then x1 + c1 but i don t think the addition is much faster than multiplying on todays cpus

more complex operation
however multiplying is a more complex operation than addition or shifting

more complex
however multiplying is a more complex operation than addition or shifting

slower
if multiplying is slower than addition then case 2 is slightly slower than case 1

slower
we don t actually multiplying it s slower than simple addition and as you can see we destroy temporary register t0 but don t touch s0 s1

better
so the compiler can t make the optimization because it can t tell if you wanted the exact behavior where multiplying is better or the implemented behavior where the scale of sum affects the result of the addition

deeper
so we must show that a gradeschool multiplying circuit is o log n times deeper than an addition circuit

more complex
the boilerplate code would multiplying rapidly when the express get more complex than addition of two terms

slower simple
we don t actually multiplying it s slower than simple addition and as you can see we destroy temporary register t0 but don t touch s0 s1

higher priority
which i think makes sense because extends from a class should take higher priority than implements from an interface

runnable better
implements runnable is better because you can extends other classes

runnable more
they say that implements runnable is more preferrable than extends thread

better
i also know implements runable is better than extends thread

easier
second in order to add or update the value of listview in general extends arrayadapter is much easier than implements baseadapter because of arrayadapter support add remove insert method by itself

stronger relationship
a possible reason is that extends represents a a stronger relationship than implements although both represent is a or is a type of relationships

better option
why is implements runnable a better option than extends from thread class

larger errors
implements gives larger errors because i tried with extends

better position
but if you d like to extends this api to be used by the external services then you ll be in a much better position with implements oauth 2.0 using doorkeeper because you can easily configure for example a authorization code grant for them

is implements the rawcomparator that much faster than extends writablecomparator

runable better

more features
vmware has more features but costs 80 virtualbox on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see virtualbox licensing faq for details

much more stable
however i found that vmware is much more stable full screen resolution much much better to handle the iphone connection via usb and i didn t have yet any crash when on virtualbox it s quite often

slower
virtualbox is slower than vmware

better
fwiw i have never gotten freebsd to work properly under virtualbox perhaps if you need that you would be better off with vmware which does

faster
even though vmware has been faster for me i still use virtualbox because it s good enough and is free and im cheap

however i found that vmware is much more stable full screen resolution much much better to handle the iphone connection via usb and i didn t have yet any crash when on virtualbox it s quite often

faster
from my experience vmware 5 is faster than virtualbox 4.2 rc3 and has better smp performance

less powerfull
virtualbox free but less powerfull than vmware

better
i am not sure if vmware server will be much better than virtualbox

more
i really miss this feature on virtualbox because i find vmware to be bloated and it slows the host system down much more than virtualbox does

faster
in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up

worse
im trying very hard to like virtualbox but so far i find it so much worse than vmware in so many ways

i think the listview is better than gridview in this situation

more
the error is because the gridview is being applied to more than one listview

more lightweight
regarding comparison between gridview and listview my experience is that listview is more lightweight as compared to gridview

better fit
here s another article that describes the listview control and why it s probably a better fit than the gridview

better
i think using a gridview is better for your case than a listview

easier
you may also consider using a listview which is easier to customize than the gridview

better
listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html

more
note that i do not want to bind a gridview directly to the view property from a resourcedictionary where the datatemplates x shared attribute is set to false as this leads to problems in the xaml designer view can t be shared by more than one listview

much finer
i believe gridview allows much finer grained control of display than does listview

more
regarding comparison between gridview and listview my experience is that listview is more lightweight as compared to gridview

this is a lot more pom.xml code but i like it better than the maven-shade-plugin because it does just what i want and nothing more

mayavi has more options for moving the camera than matplotlib but it doesn t seem to have a way to rotate around the y axis so i m guessing i ll need to perform some complex calculations on the azimuth and elevation to achieve the same result - but i m at a loss as to where to start i m new to working in 3d space and my brain doesn t think that way yet

anyway if you re willing to do advanced 3d stuff mayavi is way better than matplotlib

personally i ve used mayavi in the past and found the performance much better than matplotlib for 3d scatter plotting though the python bindings are somewhat in question moving forward i think

easier
mayavi makes it easier to visualize the data but matplotlib looks more professional

also larger
phpmyadmin also shows the larger number however i have switched to heidisql since i find it s gui is superior for my local development

also larger number
phpmyadmin also shows the larger number however i have switched to heidisql since i find it s gui is superior for my local development

brighter
in firefox and other browsers the background is much whiter and brighter than in google-chrome

passwords smaller
google-chrome renders passwords smaller than firefox

larger 15px
for example if you have a text size of 15px well firefox makes a larger 15px than google-chrome does

larger
for example if you have a text size of 15px well firefox makes a larger 15px than google-chrome does

more details
i usually use google-chrome s developer mode which imho already gives even more details than firefox

perhaps more right
thus i think firefox is perhaps more right but other developers at google-chrome think otherwise

less conveniently
what s up with google-chrome that the debugger behaves less conveniently than firefox

slower
when i posted this on facebook someone said that since firefox is open source project developers optimized math.min but google-chrome didn t since google-chrome is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why google-chrome s and firefox s math.min a b performs in similar speed and google-chrome s math.min a b and firefox s performs in same speed because if firefox is faster than google-chrome then google-chrome s math.min a b should be much slower than firefox s

better
ps i ve noticed that in google-chrome situation is better than in firefox but new line still starts beneath tag

more lenient
maybe google-chrome is more lenient when it comes to illegal characters in the url than firefox or something like that

faster
as google-chrome s v8 is dramatically faster than firefox s spidermonkey at the moment these things are constantly in flux pick the forward loop as it s faster on the slower engine

more strict
google-chrome s parsing may be more strict than firefox is at having things like trailing commas as specified by the standard at as stated in danilo celic s answer

better
my knowledge of firefox is better than google-chrome so my apologies if i missed something

more persnickety
obviously google-chrome is more persnickety whereas firefox defaults to moving and sizing the printout as necessary

more
firefox is more technically correct in this case as it outputs the state of the object at each point in the loop whereas google-chrome is apparently waiting until the end of the loop to output each console.log but i m not aware of a standards specification that covers the console host object

more complete
pd note that firefox s developer tools are better and more complete than google-chrome developer tools but in essence are for the same purpose

more technically
firefox is more technically correct in this case as it outputs the state of the object at each point in the loop whereas google-chrome is apparently waiting until the end of the loop to output each console.log but i m not aware of a standards specification that covers the console host object

less pleasant
i m trying to add a ribbon to a page using css3 linear-gradients but the rendering in google-chrome looks a lot less pleasant than its firefox or ie alternative

console more
the google-chrome console gives more information than the firefox console

higher security
found that the issue stemmed from using the firefox webdriver which apparently has much higher security than its google-chrome counterpart

much more strict
apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

more power
firefox extensions have much more power than google-chrome and have wider access to browser s internal api

slower
using firefox even it s slower than google-chrome it s still more respectful of privacy

easier
firefox is probably easier than google-chrome these days

less
but firefox keeps being less responsive than google-chrome or ie

bigger
in google-chrome the green div is bigger than in firefox i really don t know what is the problem i think in firefox it displays as it should but in google-chrome and ie9 it displays different

bigger
why height in google-chrome is bigger than firefox of input

better
so firefox is better than google-chrome - but both suck in that regard

more
firefox which is more standards-compliant than google-chrome doesn t allow this

better
they use iframes in firefox which seems better but in google-chrome they do this by putting manually defined span and font tags

higher
in google-chrome it is appearing higher than the original in firefox

more
maybe google-chrome is more lenient when it comes to illegal characters in the url than firefox or something like that

more
that means firefox is more than 7x faster than google-chrome here

slower
use firefox rather than google-chrome - google-chrome with dev mode is much slower than firefox

bolder
font-face bold in firefox is bolder than in google-chrome

more sluggish
firefox on nexus 7 is a bit better at producing reasonable sample rate readings but the updating of the display is even more sluggish than google-chrome

everything more
i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in google-chrome than other browsers saf firefox everything is more saturated in google-chrome even a background-color rgb

more
in google-chrome it seems more or less ok but in firefox when i first tried it it should give me not logged in my console

better
the logs only seem to work with a google-chrome browser which is a laugh as usually firefox is better at running google apps than google-chrome

better
the google-chrome apis are currently experimental hence these tools are likely to be better developed under firefox

easier
i found programming google-chrome extensions easier than firefox but i couldn t come across something similar to xpcom in google-chrome

more ram
we use google-chrome though which i believe uses more ram than firefox

less width
firefox has like 40px less width than google-chrome in columns which is causing problems

higher however
i just found out that if you re using google-chrome you trigger antialiasing at 49px or higher however with firefox it s set at 257px or higher

less responsive
but firefox keeps being less responsive than google-chrome or ie

more strict
is this due to firefox being more strict than google-chrome

more
ellipsis still wraps in google-chrome but is more user friendly in firefox by adding the .

slower
this is trickier to work around and you should file a google-chrome bug describing the situation and where it s slower than firefox but you could potentially reduce the amount of buffer uploads by looking into instancing or using uniform arrays instead of updating vertexes for positions textures

older versions
on stable versions of google-chrome the permissions show allow and it still won t connect even with firefox works older versions of google-chrome work

reproducible more often
this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome

faster
however if thats the case does this mean firefox is faster in execution than google-chrome

easier
i have been trying to do this in firefox webextensions but if it s easier with google-chrome i will try it that way instead.

quicker
also google-chrome has a great tool that allows you to edit css on the fly which i find more useful and quicker than using firefox s extensions

stricter
i d say that firefox is correct in being stricter than google-chrome here even though i m not entirely sure the base uri has changed and this new uri should be used for the relative uri #symboltype1 too

more handy
first just a heads up you may want to try firebug+firepath on firefox which is a more handy tool than google-chrome s developer tool

better
transparency is also an issue however google-chrome seems to handle all three better than firefox

more reliable
2 install the firefox extension there s also one for google-chrome but the firefox one is more reliable -- so if you re a google-chrome addict like i am then use both

much more
apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

filter slightly faster
tldr in firefox filter is slightly faster in google-chrome that s the opposite

faster
for example using renatoargh s test google-chrome is faster with option 2 firefox with option 1

lower
open up the fiddle in both firefox google-chrome to see what i m talking about - in firefox the positioning of the background image is much lower than in google-chrome safari

smaller
google-chrome renders passwords smaller than firefox

more
any ideas why google-chrome is apply more spacing than firefox ie

more
often google-chrome is understanding more thing then it should and firefox is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh

slower
google-chrome is extremely slow for your code path but grep seems to be 50 faster than array.filter here making it 900 slower than the firefox run

bigger
google-chrome has a bigger time difference yet firefox is the one with the gap in the animation

more
firefox allocates lots of memory during that preloading up to 20-30 times more than google-chrome or safari do and even twice as much as ie

consistently better
also it does appear that firefox consistently handles this better than ie or google-chrome

less frequent
this doesn t happen in google-chrome and is less frequent in firefox than in ie

faster
but i guess google-chrome i have version 10 should be much faster than firefox 3.6

less noticeable
support exists in firefox and my test just confirmed this√¢ but the handle is a little less noticeable than in google-chrome

more picky
i had a hiccup in firefox but found a fix after figuring out firefox is a bit more picky than google-chrome when defining svg attributes

more lenient
in my experience firefox is sometimes more lenient than google-chrome but i would definitely test in both

better
i m sticking with firefox debugging of my angular 2 app outside of vs code as its user experience is better than google-chrome especially when working with typescript files so i ll stick with that for now unless i can figure this out

less
update3 now it works here which means that i couldn t fully reproduce my bug to show it to you but in general the problem is that the height of 5x5 table in google-chrome is less from firefox on 22px which is 22px gap between table container and a table itself

smaller
if we remove the font-size it appears properly in google-chrome but shows up smaller in firefox

just stricter
it is also proper browser behavior firefox is just stricter about it than google-chrome is

much better javascript
is it because google-chrome has much better javascript support than firefox

more forgiving
i guess google-chrome is a bit more forgiving than firefox

better
also ie and firefox seems to work better than google-chrome

earlier
i suspect that this may be the case because ie and google-chrome need to know about the content of the div earlier than firefox

faster
now when clicking a time less than 1 millisecond will be displayed however it obviously takes nearly a second on my computer until the changed color actually is displayed where btw. google-chrome seems to be faster than firefox

higher
what firefox displays is about 5 inches higher than what google-chrome displays

older issue
i have encounter a problem with google-chrome that is similar to an older issue with firefox at this url scrolling blocks javascript execution in firefox

actually load
based on what you have provided i cannot tell if google-chrome actually does load faster than firefox

more padding
in firefox the input button has more padding than in google-chrome

much better
on my computer firefox performs much better than google-chrome on these tests using jsperf

taller
by highlighting the shape of the two elements you can see that in firefox left the button is 2px taller than in google-chrome right

less
or does this mean firefox is less secured on that point than google-chrome

less efficient
so why is google-chrome less efficient than firefox and ie

faster
google-chrome is just faster than firefox which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations

greater
i ve ran into out of memory errors on firefox with canvas heights greater than 8000 google-chrome seems to handle much higher at least to 32000

more forgiving
google-chrome is more forgiving or you could call it less compliant firefox less so

slower
do you have any idea why google-chrome loads javascript function much slower than firefox

more strict
google-chrome is a bit more strict than firefox here

more user
ellipsis still wraps in google-chrome but is more user friendly in firefox by adding the .

bolder
i have too problem with text in the firefox is bigger maybe bolder as in google-chrome .

s much longer
i want to set my own time limit rather than use the browser s default i believe google-chrome s is much longer than firefox s

higher severity
google-chrome is reporting the missing key with a higher severity than firefox is so i want to eliminate that as a possible cause

richer
i inspected the range object in both google-chrome and firefox and then noticed that firefox s range object is far richer than google-chrome s

faster
maybe google-chrome is working faster than firefox try adding a wait with expected conditions

higher baseline
ie firefox higher than baseline google-chrome on baseline

security fussier
i ve learned partly by trawling this site that the google-chrome security is fussier and the app loads correctly without errors in firefox and ie but i can t find any resources that are loaded from a non https source

slower
update just tried it on firefox 30 and it did not experience the same slowdown in a worker thread but it was slower than google-chrome when run in the main thread

better
it seems google-chrome applies some formatting to render better than firefox

nicer
in firefox this might be handled a little nicer than google-chrome but rather than completely redraw an element you should try to append only what you need

older
on stable versions of google-chrome the permissions show allow and it still won t connect even with firefox works older versions of google-chrome work

taller element
the reason this is happening is because firefox renders the select box as a taller element than google-chrome and the container of the blue text is getting caught on the select s container element because it s now sticking out lower than the others

better
graph beeing cut in google-chrome is a known issue google-chrome does not respect some print css and works much better with firefox not all versions still

longer
i want to set my own time limit rather than use the browser s default i believe google-chrome s is much longer than firefox s

nicer
in my testing google-chrome is nicer it pops-up the unresponsive alert whereas firefox apparently doesn t care

more
firefox is more tolerant when it comes to image headers then ie and google-chrome

slower
because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

pickier
apparently google-chrome is pickier than firefox

much slower
because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

thinner
even then google-chrome s fonts look thinner than in firefox or ie

better
bad buffering can also be a result of a slow computer because statistics show that google-chrome is better for a normal-fast computer and firefox works best on slow computers

better
in firefox it s much better than google-chrome but still not as black as ie

console more information
the google-chrome console gives more information than the firefox console

faster
in my experience google-chrome will be a lot faster than firefox to debug huge js files

less
i need to do the same condition but for less than google-chrome version 46 and for less than firefox version 44

better
firefox is easier and better than google-chrome in finding the element from the webpage

better
evidently firefox debugger firebug is better than google-chrome debugger

typeof slower
in google-chrome typeof is slower than the other two but in firefox it is the fastest

more picky
firefox is more picky about characters that are set in uris than google-chrome

slower
better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay

fatter
it works fine even for italics but i m aware that the user s browser is being asked to make a best-guess here and have noticed that google-chrome will make individual chars appear slightly fatter than firefox when i do things this way

better
given these last two complications i am leaning towards a browser plugin as the solution probably firefox since low-level http stuff seems to be better supported than in google-chrome but i am wondering if anyone has an idea for a more cross-browser-y solution and or if there is something out there that might provide a good api for this kind of thing

faster
rendering without buffering on google-chrome is faster than firefox so i m actually not sure why google-chrome is having such a problem with drawimage

more
in google-chrome there is more files download 47 than in firefox ie 42

more
google-chrome is more forgiving or you could call it less compliant firefox less so

faster
it s just a matter of preferences and browser implementation eg firefox works faster with brackets while google-chrome works faster with the dots

better
in firefox the render of new tiles and the panning is laggy this is not the case when using maps.google.com so it s not an issue of google-chrome being better than firefox

longer
firefox takes almost 3 times longer than google-chrome

sometimes more
in my experience firefox is sometimes more lenient than google-chrome but i would definitely test in both

chromium much better
also for animations google-chrome chromium behaves much better that is why i use it for development but do my general browsing in firefox

everything more saturated
i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in google-chrome than other browsers saf firefox everything is more saturated in google-chrome even a background-color rgb

slower
firefox is slower than google-chrome which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit

more
firefox can get away with more than google-chrome before aborting

more smoothly
notably this doesn t happen in all browsers google-chrome renders more smoothly than ie and firefox for instance but is there any way i can make those white lines stop appearing when the user zooms in

much better
in firefox it s much better than google-chrome but still not as black as ie

smaller
my menu links seem in google-chrome correctly but in firefox my menu links are 1 px smaller than google-chrome

less noticeable
in firefox it s less noticeable but in google-chrome it s very noticeable

quicker
firefox seems to animate the element quicker than google-chrome does and so while a duration of 1s is enough for the animation in google-chrome firefox needs it to be 2s to be slower and show the effect

lower
i m seeing a strange issue on windows in google-chrome the framerate is almost 2 times lower than in firefox on mac google-chrome and firefox have similar framerates

better
when i ran the test individually with a timer google-chrome actually performed better than firefox hope this helps

best less
the performance in google-chrome is best less so in firefox and ie

more
google-chrome provides more detailed information about the ajax errors even when firefox doesn t say anything

better browser
although firefox is a better browser for developers than google-chrome cause it gives you more tools to work with

faster
when i posted this on facebook someone said that since firefox is open source project developers optimized math.min but google-chrome didn t since google-chrome is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why google-chrome s and firefox s math.min a b performs in similar speed and google-chrome s math.min a b and firefox s performs in same speed because if firefox is faster than google-chrome then google-chrome s math.min a b should be much slower than firefox s

more
my guess is google-chrome is caching more agressively and thats why you are seeing worse load time on firefox

sometimes more lenient
in my experience firefox is sometimes more lenient than google-chrome but i would definitely test in both

taller
currently with the 10px top padding the cells in google-chrome look taller than in firefox

earlier
if google-chrome seems to finish earlier than firefox then that is the freezing glitch in action

better
it s not the first time that the plugin for firefox works better for me than the one for google-chrome

more detailed
use firefox network in development tools and check your requests sometimes it just sends options request in cross origin i insist on firefox because it s network tool is much more detailed than google-chrome and safari

more forgiving
most likely your post value has one or more characters in it that are breaking the html of the page and ie firefox are being a bit more forgiving than google-chrome is

better imo
google-chrome sends back and html collection that is longer really better imo than firefox ie or chromium

better
although firefox is a better browser for developers than google-chrome cause it gives you more tools to work with

slower
i have been working with linear parsers lately and noticed the performance in google-chrome v37 was much slower than in firefox v30

faster
and of course the results - if they are reproducible - might suggest that google-chrome is faster than firefox or that firefox just prioritises timeouts over dom events

larger
this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

less
this doesn t happen in google-chrome and is less frequent in firefox than in ie

wider
after looking into the issue with the inspection tools of both browsers it seems that firefox is making the #main_nav_bar ul 10px wider than google-chrome

much better
ie8 is the same and firefox is much better but i ve migrated away to google-chrome now so would like to stick with the one browser if possible

version better then
install firebug firefox version is better then a google-chrome one

slower
the reason google-chrome is slower than firefox is that the devmode plugin runs in a sandbox so calls and data have to cross the sandbox boundaries

version better
install firebug firefox version is better then a google-chrome one

just faster
google-chrome is just faster than firefox which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations

not slower
better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay

larger
safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

reproducible more
this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome

faster
this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

clearly less
firefox is clearly less secured it deliberately allows something that google-chrome locks down

far more
it s clearly visible in firefox and is far more subtle yet also distinguishable in google-chrome

text 1px lower
firefox text is 1px lower than in google-chrome and ie

slower
and also does anyone know why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome in 3d rendering

better
in my experience google-chrome has better javascript performance than firefox

more detailed
google-chrome provides more detailed information about the ajax errors even when firefox doesn t say anything

less close
btw google-chrome is less close to w3c specs than firefox de 42+ i d opt to start using firefox for your initial testing and then test it in ch to detect quirks

larger
arabic default font in google-chrome is larger than it is in firefox

lower
phantomjs achieves a better accuracy than firefox slightly lower than google-chrome but in around half the time of firefox

more
it works in firefox because firefox is more lax about this security restriction and google-chrome happens to be more strict on mixed-content errors

more files
in google-chrome there is more files download 47 than in firefox ie 42

just more
google-chrome is just more forgiving for some mistakes then firefox

more
i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

more time
in firefox it takes some more time compared to google-chrome safari

bigger
that happens because pixels size in google-chrome is bigger than in firefox

further
you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both google-chrome lines up perfectly but firefox seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or google-chrome dev tools

slower
in google-chrome it seems .prototype is faster firefox shows no difference between the two although generally performs slower than google-chrome

more
my firefox adds more chopping to video playing itself google-chrome plays the video much better

better
google-chrome dev tools are by far better than firefox ie whatever imho

even slower
firefox is even slower that google-chrome

actually load faster
based on what you have provided i cannot tell if google-chrome actually does load faster than firefox

better
firefox works a bit better than google-chrome but the settimeout just seems to delay the final result being shown rather than delaying each step

wider
the same word in firefox look wider than in google-chrome

faster
as you said google-chrome is faster than firefox so the webdriver is trying to interact with the dom before when elements are not yet visible exist

more limited
google-chrome extensions are considerably more limited than firefox extensions √¢ √¢ they can only hook the behavior of the browser in certain predefined ways

better
google-chrome shows it better than firefox firebug

longer
this is due to the simple fact that firefox has been in the extension business longer than google-chrome or ie

more
firefox has a more advanced plugin than the google-chrome extension but both work

more handy tool
first just a heads up you may want to try firebug+firepath on firefox which is a more handy tool than google-chrome s developer tool

better
if you are able to enforce browser usage i find that google-chrome on android preserves line breaks when copying and pasting much better than firefox

much better
is it because google-chrome has much better javascript support than firefox

higher
i know different engines render fonts differently and but the issue i m having is that firefox renders the font higher than google-chrome - at the size i am displaying the font this is very noticeable 3 or 4 px - which on a button means they re totally misaligned

smoother
i m on a mac os x 10.8.2 running firefox 18.0.2 - it actually runs the game faster and smoother than my google-chrome 25.0.1364.99

older
i believe the error might be how firefox and google-chrome handles these multiple times included jquerys and it might be that google-chrome uses the older and firefox newer version

significantly faster
on google-chrome it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on firefox it s slightly faster to do this using bool

faster
i am not concerned about the fact that firefox runs faster as browser js implementations will vary so much as the wide spread of results encountered in google-chrome that makes getting an accurate result impossible

easier
firefox is easier and better than google-chrome in finding the element from the webpage

lower
in firefox it seems that this is 1px lower than in google-chrome and safari

higher
most noticeably if you look or google-chrome firefox and then internet explorer 9 you ll notice that the terms and conditions are slightly higher than in google-chrome or firefox and thus slightly touching the main content area

more space
firefox produces more space compared to google-chrome

faster
the funny thing is that for abc_def property google-chrome is actually much faster than firefox and ie as i expected

perhaps more
thus i think firefox is perhaps more right but other developers at google-chrome think otherwise

probably easier
firefox is probably easier than google-chrome these days

slower
as you can see ie 8 is about 5 times slower than firefox 3.6 and almost 20 times slower than google-chrome 9 at least when using sunspider tests

better
i have tried firefox and it better than google-chrome crash issue is not always happen but not solved this issue

faster
also firefox 4 has hardware accelerated canvas that is marginally faster than ie9 and a lot faster than google-chrome

more tolerant
firefox is more tolerant when it comes to image headers then ie and google-chrome

bigger
i have too problem with text in the firefox is bigger maybe bolder as in google-chrome .

slower
why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome on my laptop

bigger time
google-chrome has a bigger time difference yet firefox is the one with the gap in the animation

slower
it depends on the browser its definitely true for ie and firefox but seems slower on google-chrome

less
btw google-chrome is less close to w3c specs than firefox de 42+ i d opt to start using firefox for your initial testing and then test it in ch to detect quirks

better performance
of late firefox has had much better performance than google-chrome

smaller
in google-chrome the button should be a tad smaller than in firefox

better
on my computer firefox performs much better than google-chrome on these tests using jsperf

larger heights
suffice to say ie and google-chrome start having problems at larger heights than does firefox

objects better
performance is browser and device dependent for example firefox handles objects better than arrays while google-chrome prefers arrays

worse
though from a design perspective it may be easier to simply add the extra 5px to the width designing for the worst case browser to prevent wrapping in google-chrome which is worse than extra space in firefox ie

bigger
i built a site and the problem is google-chrome display font-size 1px bigger than firefox

higher
for my website i noticed that tooltip delay in firefox was much higher than in google-chrome

more strict
i think from my tests perhaps firefox has more strict standards than google-chrome about cookie manipulation

faster
the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie

less forgiving
actually your code doesn t work on firefox because he is less forgiving than google-chrome about errors

more
google-chrome is more flexible in this sense than firefox which is why it works there

far more subtle
it s clearly visible in firefox and is far more subtle yet also distinguishable in google-chrome

older
i would like this function to work in firefox ie google-chrome etc but at the moment it only works in google-chrome and older than firefox version 49

more
in firefox it takes some more time compared to google-chrome safari

situation better
ps i ve noticed that in google-chrome situation is better than in firefox but new line still starts beneath tag

just more forgiving
google-chrome is just more forgiving for some mistakes then firefox

more
first just a heads up you may want to try firebug+firepath on firefox which is a more handy tool than google-chrome s developer tool

more padding
firefox s default textbox includes more padding than ie google-chrome

lower
it seems that in firefox ie the line-through style is a bit lower than google-chrome i am not sure if this is because of the implementation of different browsers or something

bigger height
but in firefox the left-collumn gets a much bigger height than in google-chrome

more standards-compliant
firefox which is more standards-compliant than google-chrome doesn t allow this

more
the issue that i encountered was that google-chrome was giving me height about 300px more than the firefox ie

faster
that means firefox is more than 7x faster than google-chrome here

bigger
here the working header request with firefox bigger than google-chrome request

better
and additionally the algorithm that google-chrome uses is better than the one in firefox at least for handling the resizing of text

stricter
google-chrome is stricter than firefox when it comes to loading data from your local filesystem

typically narrower
try your current setup in google-chrome google-chrome typically has a narrower minimum viewport width and try something like min-width 600px in firefox and your styles should be applied as expected layout.css will be applied when the viewport is at least 600px wide

more advanced
firefox has a more advanced plugin than the google-chrome extension but both work

slower
svg performance in firefox is slower than in webkit google-chrome and ie10

bigger maybe
i have too problem with text in the firefox is bigger maybe bolder as in google-chrome .

less
the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

faster
here is a simple performance test showing that in google-chrome filling is faster than clearing i am not sure what goes on with google-chrome and canvas nowadays but in firefox clearing is many times faster than filling both significantly faster than google-chrome

more
obviously google-chrome is more persnickety whereas firefox defaults to moving and sizing the printout as necessary

best less so
the performance in google-chrome is best less so in firefox and ie

better
google-chrome handles these better than compared to firefox

worse
google-chrome is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however firefox is worse than google-chrome in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than google-chrome but the innerhtml test runs much faster than google-chrome

smaller left
why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right

slower
also google-chrome s map function is up to 2x slower than firefox on my machine

slower
firefox is slower than google-chrome in javascript

faster
i use google-chrome for development as i find it runs faster than firefox and ie so it is a bore to guess where the icons are

wider
in google-chrome the button is wider than in firefox

quicker even
the most interesting thing i noted is that certain test combos in firefox are much quicker than even google-chrome

more
firefox encodes more characters than google-chrome

larger
i am checking it in firefox and google-chrome and see that in google-chrome spacing between letter is larger than in firefox

worse
firefox gsap performance is still much worse than in google-chrome but google-chrome gsap does still lag every few repeats or so while in google-chrome the css animations do not

smaller
firefox thumbnail 4 times smaller than on google-chrome

more
firefox produces more space compared to google-chrome

more flexibility
firefox may be sniffing the document s encoding with more flexibility than google-chrome is

more
notably this doesn t happen in all browsers google-chrome renders more smoothly than ie and firefox for instance but is there any way i can make those white lines stop appearing when the user zooms in

more finnicky
in general i have found google-chrome to be more finnicky than firefox

lesser extent
this is sporadic and i see it happening most of the time with firefox 4.0.1 and 5.0 and to a lesser extent with google-chrome

larger
i ve found that the font-size in firefox is a bit larger than in google-chrome

more characters
firefox encodes more characters than google-chrome

slower
firefox - good a bit slower than google-chrome

more thing
often google-chrome is understanding more thing then it should and firefox is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh

more
2 install the firefox extension there s also one for google-chrome but the firefox one is more reliable -- so if you re a google-chrome addict like i am then use both

smaller
in google-chrome the font appears to be 1px smaller than firefox and ie and i cannot see why

faster
right now google-chrome is faster than firefox sunspider tests so your statement it loads faster in firefox is not really correct

less
using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

shorter
however a sdp object local description by firefox does not contain datachannel at all and moreover the sdp is much shorter than google-chrome and less information bundled

smaller
while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document firefox reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie google-chrome and safari reports 1920 while firefox reports 1903

smaller
it looks like google-chrome is smaller in your screenshot there so firefox could just not be at the defined break-point yet

greatly faster
i ve found that firefox is greatly faster with imacros than google-chrome

more restrictive
no and there won t be any time soon because google-chrome s add-on api is more restrictive than firefox

more flexible
google-chrome is more flexible in this sense than firefox which is why it works there

longer
google-chrome renders longer input fields than firefox and ie

always higher
the position of the list in firefox is always higher than that of google-chrome no matter how i padding or margin the list

faster
the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

better
firefox handles this better than google-chrome does but neither exactly the way i want

smaller
if i remove this code the width of green image in firefox becomes smaller but it s still bigger than necessary about 100px the google-chrome images keeps unchanged

higher
so i wonder the benchmark is also influenced by the installed extensions or google-chrome is really so much higher than firefox in performance

more
i m taking a quite educated guess here that firefox is more forgiving with the irregular syntax than google-chrome

less
also about firefox i know still less than google-chrome and i m not sure about how it innerly manage resources among threads and if it is even possible to achieve what i want but if possible i d need to do the same work with firefox threads

more agressively
my guess is google-chrome is caching more agressively and thats why you are seeing worse load time on firefox

more information
the google-chrome console gives more information than the firefox console

slower
i ve tested the sample on firefox and it s a bit slower than google-chrome but usable

better javascript
in my experience google-chrome has better javascript performance than firefox

less
in firefox it s less noticeable but in google-chrome it s very noticeable

even faster
in ie8 and google-chrome it runs even faster than firefox in general and this slow down never happens

slower
spidermonkey firefox is slower 50 of google-chrome max speed but the speed is consistent

longer input
google-chrome renders longer input fields than firefox and ie

more
when i run my http web server on google google-chrome it gives more 324 error than in firefox

faster
what we can see is that regardless of raw hardware power google-chrome seems to run up to three times faster than edge and also significantly faster than firefox all updated to the latest verion

lower
firefox text is 1px lower than in google-chrome and ie

more spacing
any ideas why google-chrome is apply more spacing than firefox ie

smaller
my question is similar the same page in my pc renders fine firefox google-chrome but the same one on a server rendered smaller by firefox google-chrome ok

more
i think from my tests perhaps firefox has more strict standards than google-chrome about cookie manipulation

more-so
it looks like it shows for firefox more-so than google-chrome but it might help

more forgiving
i m taking a quite educated guess here that firefox is more forgiving with the irregular syntax than google-chrome

typically narrower minimum
try your current setup in google-chrome google-chrome typically has a narrower minimum viewport width and try something like min-width 600px in firefox and your styles should be applied as expected layout.css will be applied when the viewport is at least 600px wide

higher
on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera

easier
with firefox it was very easy i just grabbed the apk from their ftp server run the adb install command one would think it should be even easier with google-chrome but it s really not

more lax
it works in firefox because firefox is more lax about this security restriction and google-chrome happens to be more strict on mixed-content errors

better
also why does firefox perform way better than google-chrome on this benchmark

smarter
i guess google-chrome is smarter about me being careless than firefox is

easier
another alternative for javascript ajax is writing a google-chrome add-on easier than firefox or embeding a web browser within your application

more
firefox is more picky about characters that are set in uris than google-chrome

wider
even if you give the inputs a attribute firefox renders them wider than google-chrome

more strict
firefox and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than google-chrome in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in google-chrome it doesn t need to be a domain as such

i try to make shooter game on c# with sfml.net but i can t imagine how to make an ability to shoot more than 1 bullet because now i have just one null-object of bullet-class and when player presses space key this object gets link to the new bullet

more
since your patterns are just 0 and 1 values you can think of them as numeric values long is a 64bit int which is more than enough which can be converted later to a boolean matrix

more time
since the logic is the same i thought evaluating boolean objects takes more time than int equivalence true 1 and false 0 therefore i came up with the following benchmark and it turns out that i was correct

greater
if the boolean value is true and the length of the string is greater than the int value print the sum of the float and the int

better performance
a boolean would most likely not yield better performance than int since the excel formula engine is dynamically typed

more memory
int occupy more memory than boolean so the heap got corrupted

less
a boolean takes less space than an int

better
there is one case when boolean or int works better than boolean and int

true more
boolean true is more meaningful than int or chars 1

more
however the second loop causes the additional task of casting each of the values between a.length and 0 to a boolean which is more time consuming than int comparison

less space
a boolean takes less space than an int

array more
but counting the number of trues in a boolean array is more difficult since the accumulated type int differs from the source type bool

longer last case
but wait it s not really constant for boolean arrays and why does int array indexing take longer last case than boolean array indexing even if it has to process 5 times less elements

better
also your examples about why int would be better than boolean are kinda flawed

better
perhaps using int type if values are all numeric would work better than boolean for a and b

objects more time
since the logic is the same i thought evaluating boolean objects takes more time than int equivalence true 1 and false 0 therefore i came up with the following benchmark and it turns out that i was correct

objects more
since the logic is the same i thought evaluating boolean objects takes more time than int equivalence true 1 and false 0 therefore i came up with the following benchmark and it turns out that i was correct

less
which is invalid as a boolean cannot be less than an int

more space
would a boolean array of size 32 take more space than an int variable for example

less
keep in mind that depending on the use and on the system using it while a boolean takes less space because it s just a single bit depending on the implementation an int is the native word size of the hardware

array more difficult
but counting the number of trues in a boolean array is more difficult since the accumulated type int differs from the source type bool

longer
so boolean operation is quite longer than for int or float

true more meaningful
boolean true is more meaningful than int or chars 1

less space
keep in mind that depending on the use and on the system using it while a boolean takes less space because it s just a single bit depending on the implementation an int is the native word size of the hardware

more time
however the second loop causes the additional task of casting each of the values between a.length and 0 to a boolean which is more time consuming than int comparison

more efficient
i always assumed that boolean were more efficient than int at storing an on off value - considering that s their reason for existence

operation quite longer
so boolean operation is quite longer than for int or float

less space
it is saying this because using the int to store the value 32 bits is going to use less space than a boolean 256 as each allocated boolean will take up 8 bits 8 256 2048

more meaningful
from the link which is mentioned in question my question is that microsoft says the c# type keywords and their aliases are interchangeable but why we need aliases from my point of view boolean is more meaningful then bool and int32 is more meaningful then int then why aliases

faster
the int version seems to execute much faster than the boolean one

more
you can encode up to 32 boolean in an int as follows the method won t error on more than 32 boolean s but won t be able to unpack correctly

pypy is supposedly faster than cpython while gevent is based on co-routines and greenlets which supposedly makes for a faster web server

just keep in mind most of the time c is faster than python but then again most of the time pypy is faster than cpython

more memory
secondly the current version of pypy consumes much more memory than cpython in a rather large set of cases

faster
in the competing programming a lot of problems are never meant to be solved with cpython but with pypy which has a faster integer-arithmetic and a git-compiler but otherwise a python interpreter just as cpython

faster
judging from the benchmarks posted on the pypy speed center it appears as if pypy is faster than cpython for all but two of the tests presented

faster
that site does not claim pypy is 6.3 times faster than cpython

faster
pypy compiled with jit is almost always faster than cpython frequently by a large margin

faster
i finally ran it through pypy and was delighted to discover that when the lists got really deep pypy was running significantly faster than cpython

faster
for python there is a pypy project which it includes jit making possible the code to run faster than in cpython in many cases

more secure
edit again one completely different approach would be to use pypy s sandboxing mechanism which should be much more secure than cpython plus a sandboxing module

supposedly faster
pypy is supposedly faster than cpython while gevent is based on co-routines and greenlets which supposedly makes for a faster web server

much more memory
secondly the current version of pypy consumes much more memory than cpython in a rather large set of cases

you might want to try running your trainer under pypy if you aren t already -- it s significantly faster than cpython for some workloads

better
now there are some implementations like pypy rpython which run a static-typing phase and should favor much better than cpython here

some people may argue with me on this one but i find pypy to be faster than cpython

slower
long-term evidence is showing that pypy runs certain python codes slower than cpython and this drawback seems to be rooted very deeply in pypy

this is why pypy may be slower than cpython sometimes it needs a warm-up phase in which it can actually optimize repeated operations

better
the waf benchmark has less of a pronounced difference in performance and i d guess that the answer would be more complicated some factors pypy does better some factors cpython does better and overall cpython comes out slightly ahead

however consider that pypy might do the linear search 100 times faster than cpython then a few times might be dozens

faster
you could try running it in pypy - for some cases it can be significantly faster than cpython

further the relative speed of profiled code may well differ hugely between them - pypy code is low-level and so introducing profiling is likely to slow it down relatively speaking more than cpython

more complex
the pypy jit for python is also much more complex than cpython but also typically much faster √¢ increased complexity is a fairly typical cost for speed. the four levels of disassembly for julia code give you access to the representation of a julia method implementation for particular argument types at different stages of the transformation from source code to machine code

slower
jython is more unpredictable√¢ sometimes almost as fast as pypy sometimes much slower than cpython

but for a really useful explanation you d have to tell us exactly which database and library you re using and which python version√¢ cpython 3.3.2 s csv module seems to be a lot faster than cpython 2.7.5 s and pypy 2.1 2.7.2 seems to be faster than cpython 2.7.5 as well but then either one also might run your code faster too√¢ and so on

unfortunately as martijn pieters noted there are no accepted solution for python 3.x and only one for python 2.x and according to the amount of memory spent for solving it numerix could have used psyco the library on which pypy is based much faster than cpython

better
if pypy succeeds to be better than cpython in general which is questionable the main weakness affecting its wider adoption will be its compatibility with cpython

less memory
if the dominant memory usage is program data structures then i wouldn t be at all surprised to find pypy using significantly less memory than cpython whether or not the jit was enabled

smaller
i know many of pypy s data structures are actually smaller than cpython s but again that has nothing to do with the jit

higher recursion

more complex
double has its ieee floating point definition which is also much more complex than decimal

the third line displays the data with the maximum useful precision - an ieee 754 64bit floating-point number has slightly less than 16 decimal digits of precision so all those digits of the literal in math.h are pointless perhaps they can be seen as future-proofing against a possible future redefinition in a format with more precision

decimal types libraries are fantastic for financial applications because we re used to dealing with the style of rounding required in financial stuff but there is the cost that they tend to be slower than ieee floating point

you can also see that for smaller collections quicksort is faster but then mergesort takes the lead but all of this is case specific so take your time to study all 4 algorithms

generally faster
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

worse
given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort

it might be helpful to see why quicksort is usually faster than mergesort since if you understand the reasons you can pretty quickly find some cases where mergesort is a clear winner

for instance quicksort can outperform mergesort although mergesort is provably better than quicksort in the worst case

algorithm faster
the quicksort algorithm is faster than mergesort which is what sorted will get you when called on a sequence of objects via java.util.arrays.sort

faster
to be specific the quicksort runs faster than mergesort in the first test case and loses badly in the following 9 tests

more
quicksort is more sensitive to input sortedness in a positive way than mergesort

worse
this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so

the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great

that s hard to say.the worst of mergesort is n log2n -n+1 which is accurate if n equals 2 k i have already proved this .and for any n it s between n lg n - n + 1 and n lg n + n + o lg n .but for quicksort its best is nlog2n also n equals 2 k .if you divide mergesort by quicksort it equals one when n is infinite.so it s as if the worst case of mergesort is better than the best case of quicksort why do we use quicksort

in simple words we can say performance of repeater is far better than gridview

in my understanding repeater is most suitable since it faster than gridview

fewer templates
repeater has fewer templates then gridview

faster
the repeater is still faster than the gridview but the difference shouldn t be big if you code it right

better decision
a repeater might be a better decision than a gridview as they are friendlier for using custom layouts

each button raises the correct event but the events never reach the gridview because they are handled at a lower level by the repeater

we keep track of what cmd s length ought to be in a variable and copy the string with memcpy which is slightly faster than strcpy and does neither check string length nor copy the extra zero at end of string

more efficient
memcpy can be more efficient than strcpy since rep movs is highly optimized on intel cpus esp

usually more efficient
performance difference memcpy is usually more efficient than strcpy which must scan the data it copies

faster
but sometimes memcpy performs faster than strcpy because it moves blocks of memory at a time which allows it to perform some optimization i will not go into details here

rarely slower
memcpy is rarely slower than strcpy or strncpy and often significantly faster

more time
memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute

faster
so i feel that on x86 memcpy is faster than strcpy

notice that memcpy is faster than strcpy unless the source string is much smaller than the buffer s size which is rarely the case with ip addesses.

safer
your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy

more complicated
the reason for not having strcpy i m guessing is that strcpy can be replaced more efficiently with memcpy for constant strings and if the string is not constant strcpy is a bit more complicated than memcpy anyway so not as beneficial to make inline optimisations for

slower
for example for small amounts of data an memcpy optimised for large amounts of data may be significantly slower than a strcpy that wasn t optimised for large amounts of data

faster
is memcpy usually faster than strcpy on most real platforms

murmurhash has 64 and 128-bit versions so you can experiment between the two and it s faster than md5 largely owing to md5 being a cryptographic hash function whereas murmur doesn t have the added expense complexity of being cryptographically secure i m assuming that you re not concerned about anybody attempting to intentionally generate hash collisions or anything like that

the only issue with applying that technique for the single source shortest path problem is that reweighting with bellman-ford takes o mn time which is slower than dijkstra s o m log n

in fact i think it is fair to say that bellman-ford is more similar to dijkstra because of its use of iterative relaxation

bellman-ford as suggested in your question tends to be slower than either dijkstra s or a - it is primarily used when there are negative edge-weights which there are not here

also faster
as a general rule of thumb at least in security you should trust no user so i think it would be the wise choice to validate the data client-side it s also faster and then if the first validation passed validate it server-side to double-check or to have a safety net if the user has javascript turned off something you don t see that often

easier
now if you aren t generating your html server-side and are instead writing it by hand you can make your life just a dash easier with a client-side transformation like this

more valuable
not all of the reasons given are necessarily valid but one important one is that unless you re google server-side cpu cycles are a lot more valuable than client-side cycles so it s easier to have the client compile optimize what is quite often dynamically generated html javascript rather than the server

more dangerous
in theory encoding client-side is no more dangerous than encoding server-side

far more critical
how you handle things server-side is far more critical than client-side validation which can and will be ignored by malicious users

faster
while not really a console skulpt.org runs python code client-side with no plugins or anything which makes it a lot faster than a server-side prompt

javascript much more common
that said client-side javascript is much more common and if you were using server-side javascript you would probably know the answer to your question

the problem is that the server-side selectedindexchanged event triggers earlier than the client-side change event so the data never reaches the server-side

since you don t want to repeat yourself it s very tempting to put all your validation on one side or the other but there are tradeoffs either way and it is true that server-side validation is going to be slower than client-side

tabletools more

my guess is that server-side implementation may turn out to be more flexible and more powerful than client-side as i can add functionality to the server easily as long as the client understands it

first vb.net can be used to perform this xslt transformation which is really simple as you said just applying the xslt stylesheet at server-side if it is considered better than at client-side or even just sending the processing instruction for that to the browser

validation faster
client-side validation is faster than server-side because the validation takes place on client side on browser and the networking time from client to server is saved

javascript much more
that said client-side javascript is much more common and if you were using server-side javascript you would probably know the answer to your question

smaller
since servers omit the working copy you should generally expect server-side bare repositories to be smaller than client-side non-bare repositories

probably more common

the serializable seems quicker but deserialization much slower and the app is doing more deserializing than serializing

p is sometimes chosen to be 31 because not only is it prime but a compiler resolves it to a bitshift and a subtract which is much faster than a multiplying

more reliable
adding and subtract logarithms of factorials then taking the exponential at the end is more reliable than multiplying and dividing factorials directly

weaker
similarly if you skip the five first elements your loop takes o n-5 time but that too is the same as o n because adding or subtract a constant is even weaker than multiplying by a constant

it recommends using ctr cmd + 1 to use the keyboard this is much better than having to use the mouse but i m still looking for a just do the right thing most of the time automatic solution

faster
i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me

events more similar
this approach using purely images screenshots and generating mouse and keyboard events is more similar to manual testing activities performed by real people which have just monitor mouse and keyboard

this is a radical concept i know but the mouse is slower than keyboard shortcuts

the last fallback is to go the snail way - to mouse over to click on the red close window button but any mouse movements are slower than a keyboard shortcut

much harder
programmers like to use this property to speed up programs because it s easy to chop off some number of bits but performing a modulo is much harder it s about as hard as doing a division

more mathematical
modulo is more mathematical if you like while the remainder in the c-family is consistent with the common integer division satisfying and this is adopted from old fortran

higher
is the same as because division has higher priority than modulo

faster
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo

faster
if you compute modulo a power of two using bitwise and is simpler and generally faster than performing division

higher priority

inverse modulo for 300 time take 1.422 seconde more than executing division sub and multiplication 10k time even the core of inverse modulo is build with same division and sub and multiplication functions and for this number it just do 150 time inside while help plz why

really more
python respects this definition whereas in most other programming language the modulo is really more like a reaminder after division operator

better
using an extra variable to avoid the costly division and the resulting time was 18.9s so significantly better than the modulo with a statically known constant

better straight
modulo gives you a remainder which is why it s better than straight division in situations where you re number of elements can change

much faster
since bit wise operations can be done very fast and division operations are relatively slow this type of modulo is much faster than doing a division

classifier construct
maven uses the classifier construct for artefacts build from the same pom.xml but differing in there content for example one for jdk1.6 or jdk1.7

that continued usage of 1024-bit prime field elgamal or dsa keys is much riskier than it is for 1024-bit rsa all are still commonly used because once a successful attack has been conducted against a single well-chosen prime field all users of that prime field may be affected at little additional effort.

uglier code
i think silex produces a bit uglier code than slim but i m afraid to choose slim because it s changing constantly and i will be stuck with the current version if it breaks backward compatibility

bigger community
silex seems to have a bigger community than slim maybe it s just my point of view

more common
you could use the tga format which is more common than ppm and allows true grayscale images

#inner
let s boil your trouble down to this if the mouse is over #inner you can t use the usual methods spacebar arrow keys trackpad wheel to scroll #outer up and down

much more sensitive
the trackpad is much more sensitive and can get the breakpoint increment correctly but the mouse wheel ends up scrolling through the section much quicker without correctly keeping up with the proper frame rate so i never end up reach the final frame by the end of the section

much more
the trackpad is much more sensitive and can get the breakpoint increment correctly but the mouse wheel ends up scrolling through the section much quicker without correctly keeping up with the proper frame rate so i never end up reach the final frame by the end of the section

higher
unfortunately the trackpad s scrolling deltas are orders of magnitude higher than a mouse s so the scroll speed is psychotically high

faster
puremvc is generally much faster than robotlegs in terms of performance

wider
but i don t need a perfect width even if the width is wider than the longest word it is ok as i will text-align center to enhance visibility

less
the has text-align center so the will be centred if the size of the is less than the width of the

less
this means they won t float next to one another unless you set the width of each so that the combined width + margin + border + padding of both blocks is equal to or less than the width of the container

bigger
what i do not understand is why the size of the point and the text is not the same and why the margin can be bigger than the width of the figure

less
instead of the reaching 100 width the margin is causing less width for them due to the 20px x 12

more
if browser width is more than 768px then set a 110px margin

higher
now if the div with has margin 660px from the left it should be hidden because it s margin is higher than the maximum width of the main container

more div
how to place 2 div side by side one div is of 75 width and the other is 25 width.one more div with margin 0 auto

bigger
anyway i just set the margin to a value a little bigger than the width of the image and overlap is eliminated only in the very specific case we want

auto better
first one margin auto is better if you can know width of container list and you don t want centre content of this container

greater
give the sample text div a right margin greater than the width of the right-floated element

less
if the content leads to a width that is less than 100 of the table s containing block then setting the left right margin to auto will center the table within the containing block

slightly wider
another option is not to float the main content column but instead assuming it s the right column to give it a large left margin that is slightly wider than the width of the left column

more
adding margin adds more width making the total width of the two elements and their margin greater than 100 pushing the elements onto separate lines

greater
you can try giving an id to each one of the divs or style them for margin that is greater than or equal to the image width.assuming you image width is 50px this code shall work

greater
i just made the left margin of div2 greater than the width of div1 and it worked for me

less
essentially my logic is when the window is re-sized and the width is less than 810px then remove all css styling and add margin top items 2 through infinity

lesser
one way of doing this is checking if left margin of the inner div is lesser than the width of sidebar and then only add class adjust

larger
the the main content div needs to have left margin larger than the width of your sidebar

less
but if the screen width is less than 200 then it will be from left view edge margin to right view edge margin.

clipping earlier
so it would also be possible to have all three textblock columns starsized but that means width clipping does occur earlier and there is more margin

more
you re negative margin is more than half the viewport width of an iphone therefore it is dragging it out of view

less
the elements are sized relative to the entire viewport but the body width is less than this because of the default margin on body

s more related
margin using percent doesn t work cross browsers on flex items so if your margin s is more related to the viewport use viewport units vh or vw else you can combine px with css calc width calc 33.333 - 20px to match an equal gutter between the items

bigger
the reason why your website is x-scrollable on all devices is that you forgot to add to and the row inside it has 100 +15px left margin +15px right margin which is bigger than window width

less
you have to take into consideration that borders take up width and that the margin of 1 of either side of the large container means that it can only be less than 100 width

greater
you have given width of 50 with additional margin of 5 to each of the element which is greater than 100 width

more
50 width is more than enough for the images to fit even with the image margin

more
but the margin is more difficult to include in the width because it is on the outside of the box

greater
once the negative margin is equal or greater than the width of that element further negative margin has no effect

bigger
aside of the left floated div i have another div article with a margin a little bigger than the width of the floating div just usual for a two column layout

larger
by giving the middle indicators div a left and right margin slightly larger than the width of the left and right button divs you allow it to float up between the two and take up as much space as possible

greater
i m using the function window .resize to detect if the total width of all open windows plus some margin is greater than the window s width then hide the first chat window or show the last one if there s space for more windows

bigger
the box is never too small infact the margin of the adjacent div is bigger than the width of ul div

more difficult
but the margin is more difficult to include in the width because it is on the outside of the box

size greater
the first-child column has 10 pixels or whatever the margin size is greater content area width than it s siblings

bigger
but in general this wouldn t work because of the specified width is bigger than the real one and exceed it so there s no margin to auto it and center the content which found in div

size greater content
the first-child column has 10 pixels or whatever the margin size is greater content area width than it s siblings

animation longer
my guess is that they are technically happening simultaneously but that the margin animation takes longer to complete than the width animation

bigger window
the reason why your website is x-scrollable on all devices is that you forgot to add to and the row inside it has 100 +15px left margin +15px right margin which is bigger than window width

nicer
edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use

s more
margin using percent doesn t work cross browsers on flex items so if your margin s is more related to the viewport use viewport units vh or vw else you can combine px with css calc width calc 33.333 - 20px to match an equal gutter between the items

when i launch it with firefox or internet explorer the box gets immediately to a huge distance from the margin much bigger than the width of the screen and now i noticed that if i run it with stackoverflow s snippet function the box does not move

larger
when the screen width becomes larger than 500px the contents of the media query are ignored and the margin becomes 20

less
just so you know you want the total width object width + padding + margin + border of both columns to be less than the width of the container

more
and if they aren t next to eachother that means your padding and margin is more than the 5 width of total width so reduce them

greater
on release the drawer should slide open if its margin is greater than half its width and should close if its less

wider
another option is not to float the main content column but instead assuming it s the right column to give it a large left margin that is slightly wider than the width of the left column

i notice that when the arrow block is rendered when width is less than 296 px inside the carousal there is some space between the left border of the carousal and the arrow block even though i did not add padding or margin

greater
a common solution is to float your fixed-width column left or right and give the other column a margin equal or greater than the width of the fixed-width column

faster
wel i have used both orika and dozer i can say orika is at least 10 times faster than dozer in my project after the replacement

way faster
orika is way faster than dozer and quite close to manual mapping

better
performance will depends on your application use cases basically orika perform better than dozer or other mapping reflection based frameworks because it use bytecode generation behind the scenes

faster
orika is way faster than dozer and quite close to manual mapping

slower
i tested orika and it was a lot faster but was slower than dozer with small collections

more powerful
it fills the gap between scalatra and lift more powerful than scalatra and easier to use than lift

effect much softer
note the show hide effect is much softer because of the commented fadein fadeout declarations that were triggering console errors probably because jsfiddle uses jquery slim now

less weird
as far as the syntax goes i guess it s a bit different from the more classic syntax of the algol family languages but it s no more and possibly less weird than apl

more polygons
i recently switched from unity to unreal and the first thing i wanted to do is create a skybox but the only thing it seems to support is a skydome which has far more polygons than a cube and the generated .dds cubemap files are far too huge to be used in webgl projects

better
however if you want to use the sha256 hash alogorithm which is better than the md5 then here s a code sample

much more secure
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text

faster
this generally uses a hash algorithm that is much faster than md5

longer
because sha256 hash are much longer than md5 hash you can detect the hash algorithm by looking at the length of the hash

larger
the difference between crc32 and md5 is that md5 generates a larger hash that s harder to predict

stronger
you can for example store a hash stored with something stronger than md5

stronger
use hash and choose hashing algorithm that suits you well if possible something stronger than md5 but don t go all the way to sha512 either

better
or you could employ a request signing scheme in which certain request fields are hash together with the password of the user basically sending the password without sending the password similar to digest authentication but you can use something better than md5

more compact
i would like to apply a hash code solution on my webpage which is more compact than md5 and sha-1 because i want to use them as keys in a json hash table

much more secure
with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

actually less secure
double md5 hashing is actually less secure than a single hash with some attack vectors

less likely
other hash functions such as sha-1 also have hash collisions although it is much less likely than md5

much more
obviously md5 is much more difficult to reverse even in this anything that will hash to the right value sense then a simplistic algorithm like take the last two digits

bigger
it s like complaining that a sha256 hash is bigger than an md5 hash - yep it is but only one of them might slow the attacker down for a while

implementation significantly more
the wrapper uses these in such a way that even the md5 implementation is significantly more secure than a simple hash

implementation significantly more secure
the wrapper uses these in such a way that even the md5 implementation is significantly more secure than a simple hash

value longer
so i guess it s the md5 in the dump output cause the conflicts and the hash value is longer than md5 outputs

much more
with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

faster other
in that case some hash functions are somewhat faster than other md5 being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle

larger
any hash function like md5 sha1 sha256 etc obviously cannot be 100 unique - because they have a fixed length and due to the there must necessarily be non-unique results for input content that is larger than the hash

more reliable
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1

much more
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text

actually less
double md5 hashing is actually less secure than a single hash with some attack vectors

larger
hashing is one way you can prove this to yourself by taking an md5 or shasum of a large file since the file s size is larger than the hash output by pigeonhole principle hash can t be restored.

less cryptographically
if you don t need the cryptographic properties then a non-cryptographic hash or a hash that is less cryptographically secure md5 being broken doesn t prevent it being a good hash nor still strong enough for some uses is likely to be more performant

no longer
but if you still wish to figure out the phpbb password encryption hash it is no longer md5 in version 3.0 or higher and is a custom hash

much more difficult
obviously md5 is much more difficult to reverse even in this anything that will hash to the right value sense then a simplistic algorithm like take the last two digits

stronger
valid choices for hashing include sha1 or md5 although sha1 is preferable because it produces a larger hash and is considered cryptographically stronger than md5

longer
so i guess it s the md5 in the dump output cause the conflicts and the hash value is longer than md5 outputs

higher strength
it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5

more complex
the hash cake generates are more complex than md5

slower
the fact that bcrypt produces hash slower than md5 because of security reasons is also clear for me

cake more complex
the hash cake generates are more complex than md5

safer
finally sha1 hash are safer than md5 i tell you that because you used the md5 tag in your post

no longer
md5 is no longer secure and it can be broken with a good gpu no typo you can use your graphics card to break a hash

cake more
the hash cake generates are more complex than md5

less
if you don t need the cryptographic properties then a non-cryptographic hash or a hash that is less cryptographically secure md5 being broken doesn t prevent it being a good hash nor still strong enough for some uses is likely to be more performant

less secure
if you want to compare you re better off putting your result through getstring and compare the much less secure hash even less secure than md5 already is

simply more
crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5

better options
of course any hash algorithm is going to have some chance of collision but you have better options than md5 that would still satisfy the 1024-byte limit

slower sha1
also the hash algorithm itself is much slower than sha1 md5 sha1 md5 are made for speed - not a useful property when storing passwords

simply more expensive
crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5

function more complex
if the hash function is more complex and cryptographically strong md5 or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible

no longer secure
md5 is no longer secure and it can be broken with a good gpu no typo you can use your graphics card to break a hash

more expensive
crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5

worse
mac os x llvm gcc based crypt fuction is borked junk hardwired to only use des a proven breakable hash worse than md5

function more
if the hash function is more complex and cryptographically strong md5 or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible

more robust
all hash functions have that problem but some are more robust than md5

harder
malloc free is harder because there√¢ s also calloc and realloc

better
this performance difference issue when doing profiling is better than debugging also has troubled me for a few hours i even tried to move code from web api to console application to test and console application has similar performance as good as when profiling web api

much easier
the reason is that maybe like in my case the xcode bot was attempting to archive with the development profiling and development profiling is much easier to debugging than 4f96f173-7ebe-4892-b283-52489de2f409

less efficient
using varchar is less efficient than using tinyint like aju john suggested in his comment but unless i m dealing with a really performance-critical or a huge table - i find it easier to deal with

because you can determine what code in a compiled-language is likely to do better than a dynamic-languages it has been determined more error free to use a compiled perspective for more things so as you can see with the availability of offset-management and lookup compiled behavior given to you in core perl there is no reason to mess with the symbol table if you don t have to

instead knowing that we want to grouping by these columns we can make the application code to do so simpler by sorting by these fields

if the database is sophisticated enough adding an explicit order by clause will hint that sorting is more optimal for the grouping operation as well as the sorting can then be re-used in the query execution pipeline

the reason being that sorting less elements which the grouping generally produces is going to be faster than sorting all input documents

more optimal
if the database is sophisticated enough adding an explicit order by clause will hint that sorting is more optimal for the grouping operation as well as the sorting can then be re-used in the query execution pipeline

much better
this way only a single int column needs to be sorted grouping which performs much better than sorting two text columns

more efficient way
of course ordering could be forced obj.gettype .tostring and using lexical order but since a strict order is not necessary only grouping i was wondering if there s a more efficient way than sorting

less sense
your desired output does not reflect what you have as input if you want to grouping common sublists you can use itertools.groupby considering you want sorted output using a dict and then sorting makes less sense than just creating the grouping from the sorted list using groupby

looser
grouping has looser constraints than sorting so in theory it could be marginally faster than sorting but unless you re dealing with a lot of data you re unlikely to see a speed difference

malloc finds 10 more free bytes and marks them as used

more memory
one interesting experiment you can try is to try and malloc more memory after you free d that pointer

earlier
how does free know how much memory to be free d which was earlier allocated by malloc or calloc

safer
in addition to the previous answers the strncpy char pointer which seems unsafe for my opinion and the malloc which is safer but you need to remember to free it outside of the function and its inconsistent with the hierarchy of the program you can do the following

more memory
most likely malloc allocates more memory and puts so-called guard values that happen to contain null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by free later and this metadata happens to contain a null byte right at that position

bigger buffer
here is a solution which encapsulates the call to malloc allocates a bigger buffer for alignment purpose and stores the original allocated address just before the aligned buffer for a later call to free

more

suppose char p malloc n assigns more than n say n bytes of memory are allocated and free p is used to free the memory allocated to p

more
if your .so are statically linked to c++ runtimes - you should free objects in the same module where they were allocated since new delete is something more than malloc free and need some extra info to work properly

bigger boundaries
presumably the mac malloc aligns to bigger boundaries and so it s spotting the pointer you re passing to free can t be correct since it has the wrong alignment

more
remember malloc is quite expensive action and free costs even much more than malloc

more
now if you free some values on the heap and allocate more with malloc you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier

quicker
in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

if you want to accept a number rather than a digit and only a number strtol works much better than atoi as it allows you to check for failures

better
strtol is better than atoi with better error handling

better
you can also look into strtol which is better than using atoi in terms of error checking

better
use strtol it does better error reporting than atoi

much more
i understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10

better error
use strtol it does better error reporting than atoi

more
i start off calling gets to fill the buffer then using strtol to convert the human-readable text in buffer to an actual computer int value - note that strtol is more powerful than atoi and uses long int instead of int as its declared type

obviously better
you can also use strtol which is obviously better than atoi

better
for instance strtol is better than atoi and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null

better error
i would recommend strtol which provides better error handling than atoi or sscanf

all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno strtol is way much better than atoi in any case so avoid using atoi

more flexible
i understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10

better
you need to error check strtol and ensure there are as many passed before using them -- strtol is better than atoi as helps detect errors

better
besides strtol is a better option than atoi as strtol can handle failures better

much better
the c function strtol is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to atoi

you cannot use mocks in conjunction with roboguice it s better to let robolectric provide the context you need here

raphaels younger
if you definitely need svg and want to only use existing elements you may want to look at snap.svg which is raphaels younger sister and shares a lot of the same codebase or another like svg.js

shorter
i prefer using these short forms because to me year getdate is shorter to type and better to read than datepart yyyy getdate

easier
matrix multiplication is the easier one there are several matrix implementations with a multiplying method in packages org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg and org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed

slightly more
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

faster
mathematically left shifting is the same as multiplying a number by a power of 2 but as the operation is done only by shifting it is much faster than doing multiplication

easier
multiplication is the easier of the tasks just remember to multiplying each block of one number with the other and carry the zeros

easier
implementing multiplication is easier if you remember an shl operation performs the same operation as multiplying the specified operand by two

slightly harder just
multiplication is slightly harder just multiplying two scaled numbers and then divide by your scale factor

slightly harder
multiplication is slightly harder just multiplying two scaled numbers and then divide by your scale factor

first probably simpler
multiplying first is probably simpler than using floating point if you only want an integer result and if you know that the multiplication will never overflow

longer
if i make a mistake and multiplying a number by 1.0 instead of 1 and i do not use any compiler optimization then my multiplication will last much longer than multiplying a number by 1

slightly more complex
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

more comfortable
my friend used beyondcompare however i am more comfortable with winmerge

more
there is another principles which i like even more than srp - dry

better
you can do it with qtkit but works better in 32bit quicktime framework

file newer
if a flac file is newer than the corresponding mp3 file or the corresponding mp3 file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of commands to convert the flac file to an mp3 file and copy the tags across

file newer
if a flac file is newer than the corresponding mp3 file or the corresponding mp3 file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of commands to convert the flac file to an mp3 file and copy the tags across

better
this is the one thing i think sublimetext does better than emacs

higher
to be able to use std allocate_shared with boost fast_pool_allocator as the allocator method using g++ 4.8 or higher with boost 1.56.0

intrusive_ptr better
boost intrusive_ptr performs better than shared_ptr because it doesn t need a second allocator to hold the reference count

string_ref much faster still
just to goof off a version using boost string_ref is much faster still due the reduced allocator

more
the latter doesn t do any dynamic memory allocator and is more than 10 times faster than std to_string on boost karma benchmarks

string_ref much faster
just to goof off a version using boost string_ref is much faster still due the reduced allocator

more convenient
android 5.0 api 21 allows surface input to mediarecorder which is often much more convenient than mediacodec

faster
i d like to use mediacodec to encode the data coming from the camera reason it s more low-level so hopefully faster than using mediarecorder

significantly more
xslt is significantly more appropriate to use than xquery for such kind of tasks

streaming better
saxon-ee supports streaming of large xml documents using xslt or xquery streaming is better supported in xslt than in xquery

better
as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries

better
generally i know it sounds banal xslt is better at transformation generating a new document from each source document while xquery is better at query extracting a small amount of information from each source document

significantly more appropriate
xslt is significantly more appropriate to use than xquery for such kind of tasks

better
my usual rule-of-thumb is that xquery is better than xslt for simple tasks whereas xslt is better for complex tasks

more strongly
unless you are using the static typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt

more
xquery is more amenable to static analysis than xslt because it lacks the very dynamic template despatch mechanism

much better
as dimitre says xslt is much better at this class of problem than xquery

simpler
if your output is going to be similar to your input with small changes then the xslt solution is often a lot simpler than the xquery solution

more
this kind of processing is most easily done with xslt which is more expressive than xquery

better
i hate to answer a request for a solution in language a by suggesting a solution in language b but what you are doing here falls into the class of problems which xslt handles much better than xquery

more
unless you are using the static typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt

better
xquery works better than xslt for this because it s more amenable to static analysis as it lacks the polymorphism of xslt s template rules

more expressive
this kind of processing is most easily done with xslt which is more expressive than xquery

newer
note that centos software versions are older than debian s but versions of opensuse software are newer than debian s versions

indeed slower
the cpu is indeed slower on sparc 1.2ghz and as answered by one of the sun s engineers t2 is usualy 3 times slower for single-threaded application than modern intel processors

cache much more
notice also the the cpu cache is much more important than processors registers today

far more
having data structures that start on 4 byte word alignment on cpus with 4 byte buses and processors is far more efficient when moving data around memory and between ram and the cpu

more
binding threads to cores prevents the operating system from moving around threads between different processors cores which speeds up the executing especially on numa systems machines with more than one cpu sockets and separate memory controller in each socket where data locality is very important

much more
as soon as you go beyond single processors it s much more effective to add another cpu or two to system than to struggle with gpu calculations

more
if that processors has more than one cpu can the interrupts run on different cpu cores at the same time

more
the operating system will give your program all the resources it needs the reason your process is not consuming all the cpu is probably because it s waiting for the io sub system more than the processors

vastly more
not only is it more expensive in terms of developer costs designing a cpu is vastly more difficult than writing user-space assembly code but it would increase the transistor count of the processors

more time
the difference you notice is very small but i think the multi-thread processors is spending more time because the concurrency for the cpu resources between the threads

much more effective
as soon as you go beyond single processors it s much more effective to add another cpu or two to system than to struggle with gpu calculations

far more efficient
having data structures that start on 4 byte word alignment on cpus with 4 byte buses and processors is far more efficient when moving data around memory and between ram and the cpu

more
i have a quad core processors and the threadpoolexecutor is set to 4 core threads but when i submit my callables hundred or so to the threadpoolexecutor java never uses more than 25 cpu

usage higher
i find using system monitor that consistently 100 of one cpu is used when i run the program directly in terminal whereas when i run it in bash in a loop a maximum of 60 of cpu usage is recorded and seems to be linked to the longer completion time although the average cpu usage is higher over the 4 processors

smarter
so whether or not method 5 or 6 is faster depends on the cpu i can only surmise this is because the branch prediction in the command processors of the cpu is smarter on the new processors but i m not really sure

more
if a task is cpu bound calcuating something making it multi threaded will only improve performance if you have more than one processors to run the calculations

more
passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processors

more
multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can execute multiple instructions at the same time.

more
if the processors is loaded enough then my thread works fine but when the processors is more or less free i rich quickly my cpu limitation 50 and finally the pool terminates and needs to be recycled

cache physically closer
the point of this cache is to store data that the cpu is using quite regularly to speed up transfer time since the cpu cache is physically closer to the processors then ram is

vastly more difficult
not only is it more expensive in terms of developer costs designing a cpu is vastly more difficult than writing user-space assembly code but it would increase the transistor count of the processors

more
to the operating system a single thread which i assume is what you mean by java process essentially cannot use cpu on more than one processors which may or may not mean a physical core-- see below simultaneously

more tasks
given that you re seeing extra tasks causing a slowdown you likely either have resource contention via locking or your tasks are cpu bound and having more tasks than processors cores will cause slowdowns

smaller
in general when used on single processors single core machine this should be sufficient assuming int size same or smaller than cpu word like 32bit int on 32bit cpu

cache much more important
notice also the the cpu cache is much more important than processors registers today

cheaper mainstream
one addition for embedded cpu architecture they have to be usually cheaper than mainstream processors so that they do not raise the product s life considerably

better
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processors

more important
notice also the the cpu cache is much more important than processors registers today

more
multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can physically execute multiple instructions at the same time

more
the difference you notice is very small but i think the multi-thread processors is spending more time because the concurrency for the cpu resources between the threads

more
many current processors chips incorporate more than one cpu and a cpu may itself be able to interleave a couple of threads

more
but the problem is that i need to terminate a process if it lasts more than a timeout 3 seconds

more components
primefaces has more components but lack combobox available in richfaces

more
richfaces is more developed and tested generally since primefaces came out later than rf

better
i haven t tried any of these in a jsf 2 application but i would recommend using the primefaces one at least the documentation is better than richfaces

more freedom jacoco
in jacoco 0.7.9 there are jacoco ant tasks and in 0.8.0 there will be jacoco command line interface - both provide more freedom than jacoco maven plugin in specification of what should be included into report in particular can be used for arbitrary third-party jar files

more
ant pre-dates more modern tools like maven and gradle that have this feature baked in

definitely better
maven definitely has better integration with flex than ant

better
maven is a better alternative as build system compared to ant

older
first of all ant is older than maven and therefore does not include core support for dependency management

more modern
ant pre-dates more modern tools like maven and gradle that have this feature baked in

more
maven can t be compared with ant as in maven vs ant maven is more than a build script than ant is

more
i know maven is more powerful than ant

definitely better integration
maven definitely has better integration with flex than ant

much more powerful
ant is much more powerful than maven in many respects but maven excels in dependency management and ease of deployment

more
but as i checked-out some example apps from spring source repo and it seems that maven is more preferred and powerful than ant

definitely better
maven is definitely better than ant and well used for big projects

really better job
and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy

more
maven is more of a meta-program that can use ant scripts and run your junit tests

usage lower
maven usage is lower compared to ant but just how much lower is not really known

much more
ant is much more powerful than maven in many respects but maven excels in dependency management and ease of deployment

better
i also find ant with ivy to be better documented than maven although that s not too difficult

really better
and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy

less verbose
alternate build tools ant lots of configuration gradle conventions again less verbose than maven

older
ant is older and while it is still used in a number of projects it is rapidly losing ground to maven

more
did maven has achieved more then ant or ant is still alive

more
since ant is more of a scripting tool and doesn t impose structure or lifecycle like maven and gradle you simply manually invoke ant when you want to use it

more powerful
i know maven is more powerful than ant

better bet
if you want to stick to lower level basic file operations ant is better bet than maven

clearer
i find the ant one much clearer than the maven one

jar bigger then
the size of maven jar is bigger then ant jar i don t know why help me please

more then
did maven has achieved more then ant or ant is still alive

more
but maven and ant are so different that there is no real point at comparing them and maven is still much more than ant + dependency management

more
i d definitely use ant or maven - my preference is ant because it s more flexible and i think it would suit your development style more than maven as well

better tool
while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2

more
the quotation you brought up just claim that maven does more than ant so that it s not fair to compare the two

better
while you can munge together a solution with ant maven is a better solution for managing dependencies than ant

earlier
can maven examine and resolve internal dependencies of non-mavenized jar library defined earlier by ant

more sophisticated
a hood technique is to tag milestone releases of your projects giving then a version number and then manage dependencies with maven or a similar tool a bit more sophisticated than ant

better
if you want to stick to lower level basic file operations ant is better bet than maven

better
while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2

more
maven is more or less an update concept of ant

script more .class
1 - why ant script generates more .class files than maven

less reliable
troubleshooting the build maven is less reliable than ant especially the non-core plugins

simpler
ant is simpler and older and the default just called a java project maven is newer more powerful and flexible

younger tool
first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications

more preferred
but as i checked-out some example apps from spring source repo and it seems that maven is more preferred and powerful than ant

simpler
so i suggest you build a p2 repository can be done in ant but seems simpler in maven tycho and split the projects to several repositories

more
also maven projects come with a different directory structure and seems to be doing much more than what ant does in the spring source tutorial

slower
also note that while maven is no slower than ant for multi-module projects of this sort importing your maven project into an ide will generally result in far faster builds than maven can perform itself

jar bigger
the size of maven jar is bigger then ant jar i don t know why help me please

more
maven is more like a replacement for ant

more powerful
ant is much more powerful than maven in many respects but maven excels in dependency management and ease of deployment

better
trust me i did this before for another job where the system architect decided that maven was better than ant and all of our projects must be converted from ant to maven

version much more
i guess that the maven version contains much more than the ant version

better
however some things ant handles better than maven and if there s not a maven plugin for it it may be difficult to handle in maven

better solution
while you can munge together a solution with ant maven is a better solution for managing dependencies than ant

better
maven is definitely better than ant and well used for big projects

script more
1 - why ant script generates more .class files than maven

better alternative
maven is a better alternative as build system compared to ant

more
as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application

higher level
maven is higher level than make makefile the classic c c++ build tool or ant build.xml

pretty easier
i think updating dependencies with maven is pretty easier than dealing with ant but of course you could select the other way if you feel more conifrtable

less
troubleshooting the build maven is less reliable than ant especially the non-core plugins

better
maven is better for managing dependencies but ant is ok with them too if you use ant+ivy and build artefacts

easier
you can take a look on gradle which for me could provide more freedom than maven but is easier to use than ant

more complex
does this make ant more complex than maven

better
this question is similar in nature to whether ant is better than maven or c# better than java

higher
maven is higher level than make makefile the classic c c++ build tool or ant build.xml

more
i guess that the maven version contains much more than the ant version

greater 2pi
just take the difference and if it s negative add 2pi and then if it s greater than 2pi subtract 2pi

less
i need some help though i need each number in that list to be subtract from 27 then if the result is less than 33 add 94 then print the numbers as they were just with that sum completed how do i do this

less n
to find all the pairs of integers x and y that sum to n when cubed set x to the largest integer less than the cube root of n set y to 0 then repeatedly add 1 to y if the sum of the cubes is less than n subtract 1 from x if the sum of the cubes is greater than n and output the pair otherwise stopping when x and y cross

greater
look at it this way based on your logic while x is greater than 100 add 5 while it s greater than 500 subtract 5 .

greater
provided a string i want to convert the chars from the string to an int add a value from another method getkey to this number and if the result is greater than 26 subtract 26

closer
we observe that for 7 nodes 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 we are getting further by 1 add 7 9-2 to the score for other 2 4 7 we are getting closer by 1 subtract 2

more object-oriented
there are various object systems you can load as libraries when you want to do oop but integration with existing code heavily depends on the scheme dialect and its surrounding culture chicken scheme seems to be more object-oriented than racket for instance

much more
all of racket s languages can interoperate so your language of choice is up to you though the rnrs languages tend to go unused in the racket community #lang racket is much more useful for writing programs than any of the scheme implementations but they can be useful if you want to write programs that run on different scheme implementations

more specifically
i would suggest you start with scheme and more specifically with racket formerly plt scheme

closer
racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development

much more useful
all of racket s languages can interoperate so your language of choice is up to you though the rnrs languages tend to go unused in the racket community #lang racket is much more useful for writing programs than any of the scheme implementations but they can be useful if you want to write programs that run on different scheme implementations

more advanced other
on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations

less secure
but since ntlm is less secure than kerberos why isn t it the other way around

more secure
but as i understand it ntlm disallows the more secure kerberos domain credentials if they re available

slower
for a low traffic site the huge tokens that kerberos send across the network actually makes it slower than ntlm

better
i understand that kerberos has better performance than ntlm

better option
kerberos could be considered as a better option than ntlm

less
but since ntlm is less secure than kerberos why isn t it the other way around

faster
kerberos is complex to set up and even though it generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site

more
but as i understand it ntlm disallows the more secure kerberos domain credentials if they re available

better performance
i understand that kerberos has better performance than ntlm

better
in fact in some ways ntlm is better than kerberos

shorter
using options such as -os for the compiler to tell it to make the code small in other words don t inline-functions unless the code is shorter by inlining than by calling the function and don t unroll loops etc etc - but do inline-functions called only once as that does make the code shorter

better
i think greenfoot is better than bluej for 8-years old

more
i have been working on a simple textctrl project to get more acquainted with wxpython and i have hit a small road block

slower
as disk i o is orders of magnitude slower than ram i o this can cause a very significant difference in query execution times

much smaller
so even if your ram is much smaller than your disk you could assume you can read data that s already in ram 90 of the time or more

less
any db tech is fine with me as long it does not need lots of ram and uses less disk

larger
so while the writes my be sequential on disk for datasets larger than ram these random reads will quickly become the bottle neck

slower
since your disk even if it s an ssd is several orders of magnitude slower than ram the systems gets unresponsive

access much slower
using multiprocessing is probably not going to speed up reading data from disk since disk access is much slower than ram access or calculations

slower
ssd disk are good but they are still much slower than ram

slower
the initial read has to access the disk which is a lot slower than accessing ram

access much more fast
and ram access is much more fast than disk access

slower
i think it is because the disk is slower than ram

slower
however be aware of this to cache pixels to disk is several orders of magnitude slower than using ram

slower
it won t do anything to change the fact that disk io is orders of magnitude slower than ram

slower
that means that without caching a hit against disk will be 200 times slower than accessing ram

much faster then
ram is much faster then disk io

io extremely slower
when the data is in memory - you can do anything much faster on it since disk io is extremely slower then ram so sorting it and reading it multiple times is expected to be much slower then manipulating the data on memory

slower
so even ignoring practical considerations like disk is slower than ram it will be slower

io extremely slower then
when the data is in memory - you can do anything much faster on it since disk io is extremely slower then ram so sorting it and reading it multiple times is expected to be much slower then manipulating the data on memory

more
you lose two benefits of data base consistency data persists after a crash and you need more ram which is more expensive and scarce than disk flash

faster
just wanted to weigh in my two cents what serialworm and thephpdeveloper said share the fact that memory ram is much faster than any disk io bound operation you come up with

slower
changing it will require a reboot. that will slow things down a bit as the swap file on disk is much slower than ram

more expensive
i m sure there are other holes like that too - but the code above will work on any system which supports paging and where disk access is much more expensive than ram access

slower
memory is a bottleneck to performance ram runs slower than the cpu and if you re paging to disk than it s really slow

less
and at worst impossible at all ram size is usually much less than disk size

much slower
changing it will require a reboot. that will slow things down a bit as the swap file on disk is much slower than ram

far more expensive
but ram is volatile the data in ram is erased when the computer loses power and ram is far more expensive than disk per unit of storage

less
more ram means less disk access

much faster
obviously reading a block from cache is much more efficient than reading it off the disk since ram is much faster than disk

slower
this is relatively slow since reading from the hard disk is slower than reading from ram

read slower
pros of objects faster disk read is slower than ram lesser dependencies of the system s state

access much slower
disk access is much slower than ram

significantly slower
this is slow because your hard disk is significantly slower than ram and at 7gb there will be a lot of data being read from your hard disk put into ram then moved back to your page file the file on disk your operating system uses to store data that has been copied out of ram

slower
the first load involves reading alot from the hard disk which is slow even ssd is slower than ram subsequent loads should be faster though 3 seconds on the ssd seem to be odd

much faster
reading audio files from ram is much faster than reading audio files from hard disk

faster
i would say that probably yes as long as we have enough of ram which is faster that virtual memory in case we need to access something from the disk which is extremely slow... but also i know that some applications just require having paging

much faster
just wanted to weigh in my two cents what serialworm and thephpdeveloper said share the fact that memory ram is much faster than any disk io bound operation you come up with

bigger
disk is bigger than ram

slower
disk is 100x slower than ram

slower
if too much memory is consumed it might swap to disk which is slower than ram

faster
ram is always faster than disk

access much more
i m sure there are other holes like that too - but the code above will work on any system which supports paging and where disk access is much more expensive than ram access

slower
disk io will be slower than ram

access much more expensive
i m sure there are other holes like that too - but the code above will work on any system which supports paging and where disk access is much more expensive than ram access

far more
but ram is volatile the data in ram is erased when the computer loses power and ram is far more expensive than disk per unit of storage

memory faster
we all know that the access to ram memory is faster than access to hard disk

faster
for this reason it seemed natural to me to initially load the file into memory and interpret it later at my leisure since reading from ram is supposed to be much faster than from disk

slower system
there exist battery-backed packages of ram modules which can act as an ultra-fast hdd substitute but if they attach via sata scsi or other typical disk interface the still are slower than system ram

always faster
for the stand of file operations writing to memory ram is always faster than writing to the file on the disk directly

alway faster
buy as much memory as you can afford ram is alway faster than io from disk

faster
obviously reading a block from cache is much more efficient than reading it off the disk since ram is much faster than disk

more important
if the hot data won t fit in ram on either machine then disk i o performance becomes more important than ram mostly random read i o and the fsync flush rate

much slower
only one disk read - since the disk is much slower then ram -

faster
so my question is how to move this database into ram where i can access it via sqlite3_open or if my idea is bullshit and leaving the database on disk is faster than moving it into ram via mapping

larger
edit true the file on disk is not larger than ram but the in-memory representation can easily become much larger than available ram

larger available
it is needed for a lookup of repetitions in disk files much larger than available ram

slower memory
because hard disk have a much slower memory than ram virtual private server performance may slow down considerably

slower
which will lead to performance issue all programs will be work slower because read info from disk is slower than from ram

more expensive
basically ram is more expensive than the disk storage

much slower
reloading pages data or program code from disk which is much slower does not usually happen very often as long as the program is actually running and as long as the machine is not desperately low on ram

much faster
ram is much faster than disk

faster
ram is a lot faster than disk so reads and writes are temporarily stored until the data is requested by the code or the disk is able to receive it

much slower
as you run queries it has to fetch data from disk which is much slower than ram

slower
as you run queries it has to fetch data from disk which is much slower than ram

faster
i understand that ram is typically thousands of times faster than disk but i o speed is not the only code running

more enough
this particular jboss runs in a vm with 4gb of ram and 2 cpu s and more than enough disk space it has never has less than 5gb free at any time

faster
1 yes there is a obvious benefit reading from ram is faster than reading from disk

space cheaper
this approach will radically reduce heap space usage - disk space is cheaper then ram too

faster
ram is much faster than disk

slower
using multiprocessing is probably not going to speed up reading data from disk since disk access is much slower than ram access or calculations

slower
disk io - even ssd - is many orders of magnitude slower than the ram that the hashing is going though

access much slower
however if this is indeed the case - and the data does not fit ram and you cannot use map-reduce i suspect sorting and iterating - though will be o nlogn will be more efficient using external sort - because the number of disk accesses will be minimized and disk access is much slower then ram access

slower
as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram as the memory usage increases your machine grinds more and more closer to a halt

slower
there are libraries that allow on-disk data structures comes to mind and another one whose name i can t recall at the moment but disk accesses are orders of magnitude slower than ram

access much more
and ram access is much more fast than disk access

slower
or if there is too much intermediate output to be shuffled your job will become slow as you will need disk based shuffle in such a case which will be slower than ram based shuffle

bigger
the table on disk is bigger than your ram

slower
disk files are of course an order of magnitude slower than ram and thrashing your virtual memory system could actually be worse than that depending on your access patterns

io way slower
but you should consider that disk io is way slower than ram

more memory available
the os heap uses the cpu s virtual memory hardware and is free from fragmentation issues and can even effectively use the disk s swap space allowing you to allocate more memory than available ram

slower
another option is to spend a bit of cash on a 15000 rpm disk or a ssd solid state disk although that ll be slower than a ram disk

larger
it uses swap space on disk to allow for processes much larger than ram

smaller
so even if your ram is much smaller than your disk you could assume you can read data that s already in ram 90 of the time or more

much slower then
only one disk read - since the disk is much slower then ram -

smaller
in this case the latter is likely to cause trouble because the insertion of a name hits a random node in the tree i.e the name insertion doesn t follow a pattern and your ram is smaller than the index chances are high that the destination must be fetched from disk

more space
data in ram can take a lot more space than on disk

slower
a disk seek takes about 10 000 000 nanoseconds of course some disk are faster but the best of them are still thousands of times slower than ram

slower
as sven marnach wrote in the comments your problem is most likely i o bound since disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access

faster
no trivial support for cache accessing ram is faster than accessing disk

not larger
edit true the file on disk is not larger than ram but the in-memory representation can easily become much larger than available ram

slower
because disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access

access much slower then
however if this is indeed the case - and the data does not fit ram and you cannot use map-reduce i suspect sorting and iterating - though will be o nlogn will be more efficient using external sort - because the number of disk accesses will be minimized and disk access is much slower then ram access

slower
anyway you will have a huge performance loss due to the fact that your disk is way slower than your ram

much faster
the idea is to get the library and application loaded from ram into ram which is much faster than loading from disk

way slower
anyway you will have a huge performance loss due to the fact that your disk is way slower than your ram

bandwidth much higher
also ram bandwidth is much higher than disk or ssd or network bandwidth and the ram latency is much lower too

slower
remember disk is 1000s of times slower than ram

slower
if the worker processes do other things than just calulations read from or write to disk they will have to wait a lot since a disk is a lot slower than ram

slower
disk i o is about 100 000 times slower than ram

faster
ram is a lot faster than disk

much faster
the ram is much faster than the hard disk

slower
once you re out of ram and the system starts swapping - disk access is thousands times slower than ram so any potential benefits of 64-bit code are flying out of window

more expensive
but ram is volatile the data in ram is erased when the computer loses power and ram is far more expensive than disk per unit of storage

more expensive
you lose two benefits of data base consistency data persists after a crash and you need more ram which is more expensive and scarce than disk flash

slower cpu
query speed is mainly limited by disk i o speed which is at least 1000 times slower than cpu ram speed

vastly slower
remember the tuples are saved into the disk which is vastly slower to access than things in ram

always faster
ram is always faster than disk

slower
disk access is much slower than ram

slower
if lob-storage isn t in ram at the time of a query execution then we need to read it from a disk which is of course much slower than from ram

cheaper
always favor disk persistence disk storage is cheaper than ram

less
if the amount of ram is less you ll have a lot of swapping to disk which is a lot more time consuming

cheaper
disk space is probably always going to be cheaper than ram

larger available
in future these lists may be read from disk and larger than available ram

higher
also ram bandwidth is much higher than disk or ssd or network bandwidth and the ram latency is much lower too

space cheaper then
this approach will radically reduce heap space usage - disk space is cheaper then ram too

much faster
ram is much faster then disk io

slower
disk even ssd are orders of magnitude slower than ram

faster
ram is 100 thousand times faster than disk for database access from

slower
caching and buffering are quite important since disk are just so much slower than ram and ram is much slower than the cpu

slower
which will lead to performance issue all programs will be work slower because read info from disk is slower than from ram

slower
that s basically possible but it would take hours as hard disk access is so much slower than accessing ram caches

slower
pros of objects faster disk read is slower than ram lesser dependencies of the system s state

much faster
accessing the main memory ram is much faster than reading values from the hard disk

typically more
however they may be cheaper to operate depending on how much data you are expecting to store with each session key holding large quantities of data in ram is typically more expensive than storing on disk

larger
this is well within disk space but far larger than ram

usually faster
but becuase reading from ram is usually faster than from other kind of memory storage divice os copy the program from disk on ram and start executing program from there

slower
run the following to sort the data on disk this is slower than pulling it into ram sorting and then writing to disk

more enough
for this reason i deployed a 2 cores 4gb ram and more than enough disk to run through the getting started example of the enterprise integrator

slower
but you should consider that disk io is way slower than ram

faster
since using ram is faster than using disk zram allows linux to make more use of ram when swapping paging is required especially on older computers with less ram installed

typically more expensive
however they may be cheaper to operate depending on how much data you are expecting to store with each session key holding large quantities of data in ram is typically more expensive than storing on disk

slower
make sure you have enough ram so that your data set fits with ram atleast your index should fit inside the ram coz each time a data fetched from disk is 10 times slower than ram

greater available
also keep in mind that once ram is exhausted your program will start running in virtual memory on disk which will probably cause far more disk i o activity than the program itself so if you re concerned about disk i o your best bet is probably to make sure that the batch of data you re working on in memory doesn t get much greater than available ram

faster
loosely speaking ram is 1000 or more times faster than disk and cpu is faster still

slower
as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram this problem can grind the machine down to a practical halt

more
basically ram is more expensive than the disk storage

slower
this is slow because your hard disk is significantly slower than ram and at 7gb there will be a lot of data being read from your hard disk put into ram then moved back to your page file the file on disk your operating system uses to store data that has been copied out of ram

slower
in other words the operating system is using some of your hard disk space to satisfy your 13 mb allocation request at great expense of speed since the hard disk is much much slower than ram

larger available
alternatively you can use an ssd with file storage in varnish to reduce disk io bottlenecks when using an object cache larger than available ram

lower
at any rate disk speeds are orders of magnitude lower than the ram speed and i wouldn t be too much concerned about the mode here unless of course it turns out that caching is different in the two modes

storage cheaper
always favor disk persistence disk storage is cheaper than ram

always faster
saving information to a variable and therefore to ram is always faster than direct to disk

greater seperation

faster
which uses all integer arithmetic is usually faster than its floating-point equivalent likely significantly faster in the case of a floating-point type equivalent to t-sql s decimal type

more general
floating-point solves the more general problem of representing some real numbers that aren t integers and some real numbers that are larger than the maximum integer up to which all integers are representable here 16777216 all with a nearly uniform relative accuracy at least 1 2 precision

higher rank
because the floating-point value is of a higher rank than an integer it will promote the integer to a float

faster
there are lots of cpu gpu combinations where a 32b integer multiply is faster than a 32b floating-point multiply on cpu and vice-versa on gpu

arithmetic much faster

add layout_weight properties to sub views as well.assign 3 to imaveview and 1 for textview now imageview always will be bigger than textview 3times and textview can not invade imagevies s space

higher then
in this case if textview is higher then imageview imageview aspect ratio should be intact with max width possible and if imageview i higher then textview again width should be maximal and parent should have height as imageview

bit taller
the imageview is bit taller than the textview and so what i do is add padding margins to the bottom of textview to get it align and look like the imageview and textview horizontal centers are aligned

more priority
how could i make the imageview have more priority than textview

smaller width
however the imageview has a smaller width than the textview

bigger
i have an imageview that is bigger than a textview and i want to center the textview on top of the imageview both vertically and horizontally

higher
i want to set imageview and textview on same line in linearlayout but the imageview is always higher than the textview

performance probably better
as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysql s bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysql for any even slightly complicated query

more restrictive
postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql

more famous
while mysql is more famous for serious enterprise-quality database where preserving your data is critical i recommend postgresql

slower
do you find rails with postgresql is slower than mysql knowing that it produce more query on the background

better option
is postgresql a better option than mysql for partitioning tables by date

easier
postgresql supports recursive queries in the form of recursive common table expressions which make querying heirarchical data easier than in mysql and also give better performance

more permissive
mysql is more permissive and allows the non-standard use of distinct but postgresql throws an error

better
given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

much better
postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

generally better
now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it

faster
some recent tests we did showed that postgresql does perform faster than mysql and we believe the table partitioning feature in postgresql will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production

more mature
postgresql will always be a little bit more mature than mysql

older
postgresql is older than mysql so it might have influenced them

better
i d also recommend postgresql over mysql if you are going to have nested comments as postgresql does hierarchical querying better than mysql

much more complete
postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

better
if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with postgresql is better than mysql

better
is postgresql better than mysql for such purpose

worse
mysql mariadb is slightly worse than postgresql

easier
mysql is easier than postgresql but it doesn t really matter either way

better
postgresql with the optional hstore module might be better than mysql at this.

not less
mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing

much faster
with django it is easy to use postgresql instead of mysql so i tried it with the same query and same data in db postgresql is much faster that mysql x10 more faster while using inner join analyse shows it uses indexes unlike mysql

more correct
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

more compliant
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

bigger repertoar
b use indexes - postgresql has bigger repertoar of indexes then mysql so use it - there are gist gin indexes

much better
some say mysql is much better for bigger projects while others think just go with postgresql

more security
i d have said that postgresql is more security aware than mysql supporting roles more authentication methods ... but that the database itself has generally a very limited impact on the security of an application

worse
i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql

more widely
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

more
why postgresql is more capable than others mysql etc. on django

more simple
postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s

better
fyi postgresql scales better than mysql on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

more compliant
looks like postgresql is a little more compliant than mysql so try this instead

more
i d have said that postgresql is more security aware than mysql supporting roles more authentication methods ... but that the database itself has generally a very limited impact on the security of an application

better support
postgresql has better support but the support by mysql depends on the used storage engine

more
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

higher pdo
drupal 7 mysql 5.0.15 or higher with pdo postgresql 8.3 or higher

more
poor performance from mysql has more to do with it not being smart and automatically creating an optimized plan like sql server postgresql or oracle would

more
i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options

more
postgresql requires more tuning than mysql to achieve optimal performance

larger
while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions

better
if you want to use sql i strongly reccommend postgresql it seems to deal with large databases and frequent writes a lot better than mysql

more advanced
the query optimizer in postgresql is more advanced than in mysql and copes with complicated statements much better especially when it comes to sub-selects

much better
postgresql is much better suited for data warehousing compared to mysql

more established
postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

more
the query optimizer in postgresql is more advanced than in mysql and copes with complicated statements much better especially when it comes to sub-selects

much better
then postgresql is much better than mysql

much more
i feel postgresql is much more mature and robust than mysql

slower
unfortunately in postgresql select count is often slower than mysql to which it often get s compared to

more robust
i hear postgresql is more robust and doesn t crash like mysql does in these situations

more compliant
following the first answer it appears that postgresql is more compliant to sql standard than mysql so it needs a group by clause for each selected column you want to display with your aggregated function

better choice
i was told that postgresql is a better choice than mysql for displaying hierarchical data so i installed postgresql and i m ready to go

better
postgresql is way better than mysql in nearly every respect

faster
mysql run 4x faster than postgresql

better
then postgresql is much better than mysql

picky pickier
postgresql is picky pickier than mysql -- all fields in the select list when using distinct must be present in the order_by and group_by clauses

specifically easier
postgresql specifically has gotten easier to manage while mysql has lost some of the simplicity that gave it an advantage without picking up enough features that really matter

better
i found that postgresql 9.3 has better capabilities for json than the mysql versions i am using

more
in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysql optimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with

less time
may be postgresql takes less time than mysql

more
i am using postgresql btw which can do more than mysql incase that changes things

more capable
i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options

smarter
ps you can also migrate to postgresql it s smarter than mysql when choosing right indexes

slower
in my personal openion mysql is slower than postgresql and mongo db

more strict
postgresql is a little more strict than mysql about type conversion and does not let you implicitly cast convert between numbers and strings

stricter
postgresql is stricter to the sql standard than mysql is

mariadb slightly worse
mysql mariadb is slightly worse than postgresql

fewer
and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

faster
mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

implementation less sql
i totally understand the error and assume that the mysql implementation is less sql conform than the postgresql implementation

more tricks
in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysql optimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with

more popular
it s a shame postgresql isn t more popular than mysql since it supports exactly this feature out-of-the-box you d only have to share one sequence object between tables.

fewer
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

more
does that mean perhaps rails team favor postgresql slightly more than mysql

much better support
the only reason i was considering postgresql was that some research suggested postgresql has much better support for changing schemas along the way than mysql

way more
explain in postgresql is way more useful than in mysql

stricter
i am aware that postgresql interpretation of the sql standard is stricter than mysql and that consequently this type of query won t work...and have read a number of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere on the subject - but none of them seem to be the definitive answer on this subject

more complex
triggers in postgresql have a syntax a bit more complex than mysql because they execute procedures as the action

much more
postgresql is much more similar to oracle than mysql is

much smarter
if you want open source postgresql is much smarter than mysql as well

more sane
since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on

more powerful
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql

higher pdo
drupal 7 mysql 5.0.15 or higher with pdo postgresql 8.3 or higher

more popular
though mysql is more popular than postgresql but instagram is using postgresql maybe due to these reasons

more resistant
the question is is mysql somehow more resistant than postgresql to sql injection attack under the perl dbi and why might this be the case

better
the other question is that what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates

more
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

less popular
while postgresql is less popular than mysql most of the serious web hosting supports it

better
i was told that postgresql is a better choice than mysql for displaying hierarchical data so i installed postgresql and i m ready to go

better
i really like postgresql s indexes which are far better than mysql s

more flexible indexing
not only does postgresql have a far more flexible indexing than mysql but the table approaches are very different also meaning the appropriate indexing strategies are as different as the tactics are

more advanced
postgresql is worth learning and much more advanced than mysql

more
postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

better
honestly though postgresql scales much better than mysql

bigger
b use indexes - postgresql has bigger repertoar of indexes then mysql so use it - there are gist gin indexes

much more mature
i feel postgresql is much more mature and robust than mysql

slower
i did a simple performance test and i noticed postgresql is slower than mysql

better
postgresql seem to better than mysql in terms of speed

harder
does this affect postgresql harder than mysql

probably more often
mysql is probably more often offered by shared hosting providers postgresql is probably a little more powerful

less troublesome
this is ancedotal but the postgresql servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than mysql which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down

better
some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.

more sql
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

more
mysql is more permissive and allows the non-standard use of distinct but postgresql throws an error

better capabilities
i found that postgresql 9.3 has better capabilities for json than the mysql versions i am using

more proven
either postgresql more proven than mysql for such huge data

better
now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it

much better
the only reason i was considering postgresql was that some research suggested postgresql has much better support for changing schemas along the way than mysql

less
while postgresql is less popular than mysql most of the serious web hosting supports it

better db
anyways mysql is bad and on longterm especially if you are enough good for java i suggest you to use some better db with postgresql you were really satisfied i think

more logical
you might look at postgresql as i find it a bit easier to manage and maintain as i feel some aspects are more logical than mysql

pickier
postgresql is picky pickier than mysql -- all fields in the select list when using distinct must be present in the order_by and group_by clauses

more mature
i know postgresql could be considered more mature than mysql with regards to locking thanks to mvcc - can i use row-locking or some other feature in postgresql instead of the token field

much more
postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

much more acid
all that said postgresql is much more acid compliant than mysql it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post

better imo
postgresql is also a lot better imo than mysql and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

already slower
postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database

more capable
why postgresql is more capable than others mysql etc. on django

slower
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql

better
postgresql is better than mysql in many ways

worse
in other words is mysql better or worse than postgresql to handle unicode etc

more advanced
however postgresql s sql features are far more advanced than mysql s and mysql has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise

better
i just recently switched databases to postgresql which has given me a slew of problems although i must admit i like it a lot better than mysql

more robust
there is also postgresql its a bit more robust than mysql and is free just the same

better
generally speaking i find postgresql lends itself to 24 7 operations better than mysql

fulltext 10-100x faster
i did some benchmarking 3 years ago may be stale... which showed that on large datasets basically postgresql fulltext is 10-100x faster than mysql and xapian 10-100x faster than postgresql but not integrated

more
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

way more useful
explain in postgresql is way more useful than in mysql

better
an efficiently configured mysql is better than a badly configured postgresql and vice-versa

more
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

more
though mysql is more popular than postgresql but instagram is using postgresql maybe due to these reasons

cleaner
however people often argue that postgresql is cleaner and easier to use that mysql

more
i hear postgresql is more robust and doesn t crash like mysql does in these situations

more forgiving
it seems mysql is more forgiving with this than postgresql but in every case you use a reserved word you should escape it

better
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

faster
i wonder why postgresql s single insert statement is completely faster than mysql s when autocommit is turned on

fewer surprises
i would recommend postgresql for a beginner as it has far fewer surprises than mysql

more
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

stricter
but in mysql it is ok and in postgresql it is wrong and ask for the other fields besides site_id either in a group by clause or in a aggregation function i know that postgresql is stricter on sql than mysql so i must select the site_id in the query object of msg_published but in pure sqlalchemy i can do like this

more
if you are looking for location based queries in relational databases postgresql is more matured compared to mysql

more
while mysql is more famous for serious enterprise-quality database where preserving your data is critical i recommend postgresql

less
may be postgresql takes less time than mysql

implementation less
i totally understand the error and assume that the mysql implementation is less sql conform than the postgresql implementation

faster
mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

better
in fact this presentation which still refers to an older incomplete version of mysql s opengis support suggests that with proper indexing some mysql geospatial actions may actually perform better than postgresql postgis though i m sure that s up for debate

better
also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql

slower
for these ultra simple queries postgresql can be slower than mysql - postgresql has richer planner that works better on more complex queries but on trivial queries is slower

way better
postgresql is way better than mysql in nearly every respect

better
in my cases postgresql was better than mysql mysql do not completely support unicode

much more similar
postgresql is much more similar to oracle than mysql is

more reliable
as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here

faster
according to my own experience postgresql run much faster than mysql especially handling big tables 1.4 gb lineitem table in my case

much more
all that said postgresql is much more acid compliant than mysql it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post

better
i would need a scalable database so probably postgresql would be better than mysql

better
postgresql has better support but the support by mysql depends on the used storage engine

better handling
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

better
there are workloads where postgresql is better and there are workloads where mysql is better

better
this is a weak point that iirc postgresql can handle better but with mysql you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks

more
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql

fewer experienced
and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

better option
in your case postgresql may be a better option than mysql because your query is going to likely be against secondary indexes

better
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

faster
postgresql is faster than mysql s innodb

larger user
while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions

more
i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

more security
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

safer bet
if i were able to upgrade the server s versioning of mysql to 5.5 would innodb be a safer bet than postgresql

stricter
postgresql is stricter about conversions than mysql is and generally will throw an error rather than try to convert a string to an integer if it doesn t look like one

slower
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

and a wiki for why postgresql is better than mysql

fewer security
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

more standard
for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use postgresql a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standard than mysql via py-postgresql

unlike radio button the user can select more than one checkbox at once or select none of them at all

more
checkall and uncheckall on single button is worked if there is more than one checkbox present.but it will not worked for single checkbox

better fit
checkbox may be a better fit than button here

list more suitable
if you want the users to select only one option perhaps a dropdown or radio button list is more suitable rather than checkbox

better
you ll want to have multiple radio button each with it s own value to set some property to although this is weird for a yes no you are better off with a checkbox but if you had multiple values this is how radio button work

more column
currently i am able to generate checkbox in column what i need is one more column with button same as checkbox in each row

better radio
using checkbox to check uncheck is better than radio button

more
one more thing i also want select only one radio button when i have selected more than 2 checkbox

more
but works fine if more than 6 checkbox are selected then reduced to 6 with more than one button click

better choice
so i think a custom checkbox is the better choice here but if you really want to use a button i would use a hidden checkbox field and apply onclick functions to the button to change the value of a hidden checkbox field

disabled.after
initially the value of button is disable because value of button is true so the button is disabled.after selecting the checkbox now the button should be able to click

values greater
i have created a php form with multiple checkbox and there is a script that controls if the sum sum of all checkbox values is greater than a specific number.if yes a sweetalert box appears.the problem is that when i click the ok button on the sweetalert i want to remove the last checked attribute and to remove that value from the sum to execute the script again and display the right results.i cannot figure this out..any ideas will be helpful

better
actually i found out why using two radio button with same names and different values true and false is better than checkbox

more useful
i saw he used checkbox which to seems much more useful than button since you can take multiple objects out at a time

better
you ll want to have multiple radio button each with it s own value to set some property to although this is weird for a yes no you are better off with a checkbox but if you had multiple values this is how radio button work

more sense
obviously for something like show hide functionality a checkbox makes more sense than a button

as image shows below i want to make next button enabled only if more than one checkbox get checked

more
obviously for something like show hide functionality a checkbox makes more sense than a button

i can verify that by unchecking the checkbox it does flip the value because i enable disable the next button depending on the myproperty value - i have more than one checkbox btw

in both cases plus minus same except in case where is the small checkbox the button is bigger on width maybe it is related with space for checkbox

when i reload my html pages its button select and checkbox are goes added more and more.because all the html data fetch from a data base and after added new things in the page i store all the html of the page in data base and when i display this page agiain becuase of jquery mobile its button select and checkbox are increased check here visit jsfiddle.net sharma9853 gbe6p 7

slower
you can have a look at this speed performance benchmark from fftw which suggests that gsl is about 3-4 times slower than fftw 3

i recently got this error with tomcat 7.0.21 on windows 7 when a war contained jars which had duplicate class definitions a class was defined in more than 1 jar within the war s web-inf lib directory

better embedded
is embedded jar better than embedded war file

more packaging
i set up a maven multi module project one with packaging war two more with packaging jar

file not longer
i tried to do it in server s pom.xml file and i set the impl module to provided scope so the jar file is not longer contained in war but now the tests are failing as after unpacking the war file used for running the tests does not contain the impl jar file which is required for that

easier
so in my practice using war app easier than jar to manage and re-configure

more common
5 a war file can be runnable executable though this is more common with jar files

more
keeping your business logic in ejb jar will pay off when you ll need more than one war in your ear different security realms etc.

really thinner
if your client jar is really thinner for example only the interfaces having the war s reference the client jar effectively disallows them to access to ejb implementations which is always a good idea

community much stronger
qcubed community is much stronger at the moment so you might want to check in qcodo forum for your answers on basic problems but post on the qcubed forum

when resizing the image if the width side is larger than the height resize the image so that the image height is the div s height and hide the width overflow after centering

first do one thing get the width of the document using java script and your sub div set min width of generating div on hover of sub menu if it is greater than minimum height than animate your sub menu sub div to wherever you want or you can also give style using java script css property

how to set the size of img so that it s max-width is set to 200px if the width is smaller than height the image height is auto in this case to preserve aspect ratio and set max-width to 200px if the width is bigger than height

then when the width or height of the control is less than width or height of given size the suitable scrollbar will be shown

the problem is that when i move to an android device whose orientation is landscape by default the device s hardware is arranged in such a way that it is clear it is intended to be used mainly in landscape orientation the x and y coordinates are reversed and the fact that the window s height is greater than its width can t be used to determine whether the user is holding the device with it s top up and its bottom down

greater
so it s even more odd that the width is greater than the height when it should be the other way around

to generalize this approach you could try and check whether the offsettop of an element is greater than the height of the container or the offsetleft is bigger than the width

as you can see if image width is greater than height the script first makes image 128 px height

once your image have a width higher than height you need to set only the new width and let the browser do the trick with the new height

it seems like it would be a mistake to simply check if the image s width is greater than it s height and to rotate it to portrait orientation based on that

greater
take screenshot of rotated screen and while uploading turn the dimension to portrait if their dimension is landscape i.e width is greater than height

now you should have square cell - as you see those dimension are not pixels and height must be bigger than width

in your xml you gave and 10dp both vertical and horizontal spacing and then in your custom view implementation you gave 150 as width and height and 8 as padding basically they conflict try to make both values convenient since the columnwidth you gave is way more less than width you gave in your custom view

width is always bigger than height

ratio always higher then
your and are static which means and are always they same aswell respectively 5.1785714285714 and 2.55625 so width ratio is always higher then height ratio

here is how the regular imageview handles resizing of images if you are using match_parent as width and wrap_content as height i tested with both as match_parent and the results were the same it will not scale the image if the height of your picture is lower than the width which is quite typical

greater
otherwise if the height of the image id greater than its width

your ratio is a little more than one since your width is longer than your height so your left and right boundaries are essentially something like -1.5 and 1.5 whatever your ratio happens to be

or i can set the width to more than 36 and it appears to grow by width-36 but if for instance i set both the height and width of one of these narrow cells to the same number lets say 60px the height of what gets displayed is greater than the width and it appears as a rectangle not a square

greater
in addition to that you can also check at run time if width is greater than height programmatically set width as match parent and height as wrapcontent and vice versa

smaller
i.e if the browser height goes smaller the image will scale down while not overlapping or going under the text and staying centre same goes for width

and i m just having trouble saying if the image original file s width is greater than the height then we need the height to expand to the height of the surrounding element and put the width at auto so it doesn t get squished but keeping in mind that the client can upload any image size they want with no restrictions of must be 350x350

bigger
there is an image restriction that is not documented or at least i couldn t found anything the aspect ratio limit is 1 3 when the height is bigger than the width on the image

it should look wheter the image width is higher than its height and the opposite and according to that set a height or width and the other value height width should be set proportionally so it won t get stretched

for some of them the width is much more bigger than the height for some of them the height is much more bigger than the width and for some of them height and width are almost the same

it seems to work by seeing if the width is bigger then the height landscape so it also works on desktop really well

smaller
if the device width is smaller than height so the device is a tablet or a mobile phone in standard position and rotation usually

bigger
so the ring shape will be cropped if the width of the imageview becomes bigger than the height

greater
and for landscape width of the screen is greater than height

more
so never height is more than 150px and width is auto to this height to keep it s ascpet ratio and also fit in this div

greater
the mediasize class and all of it s inner classes only have sizes where the height is greater then the width

bigger
i have an image where the width is bigger than height

now i can see the image and just fit the screen nicely but the image is just at the top of uiscrollview . notes in this circumstance the width of my image after being zoomed to minimum zoomscale equals to the width of uiscrollview the height of my image after being zoom to minimum zoomscale less than the width of uiscrollview

it applies to window objects but also to scrollable frames and elements with the overflow css property set to scroll or auto when the element s explicit height or width is less than the height or width of its contents

greater
the img tags will have rotateimg class if its width is greater than its height

greater
to explain the logic all it does is sets the width to 100 and checks if it s height is greater if it isn t then width 100 is fine

greater
so if the parent s height is greater than the width then the child is limited by the parent s width and if the parent s width is greater than the height then the child is limited by the height

longer
the webview is in landscape setting width longer than the height

smaller eventually
even though you ve given your header a fixed height of 10vh if one resizes the browser whereby the header s width gets smaller eventually a height 10vh might not be tall enough to contain all of header s content thus it overflows

bigger
if height is bigger than width then this will result in unallocated arrays for some of the in your code as it stands

greater
in the case the matrix s width is greater than height it will be padded with 1 s to make the matrix square

smaller
when the window is resized the background image shrinks in height once the window is adjusted smaller than the width of the actual photo

most devices seem to recognize the highest dimension as the max-width but some amazon kindle 2 appear to treat lower dimension as the width and higher as the height

always greater then
okay here is the problem i have images of different sizes but that doesn t really matter because their width is always greater then their height and all images are resized to a 100px width height still is different in each image

ratio more
i guess it s because the height to width ratio is more than 4 3 so it s cropping the height to give a width of 300

this method works great except for one thing if the new height is smaller than the new width the new height and new width successfully get modified but after the imagetoadd.draw rectanglef the size of the imagetoadd still has the new width value instead of the cropped width that is if i can assume that if i draw an image with -20 as its x-value the width gets modified with -20 as well

i wouldn t scale the image every single time in the paintcomponent method but do it once if the width and height have been changed since the last call and in that case recreate a bufferedimage containing the image which you blit every single time before calling the superclass paintcomponent scaled up to the right size use something like image scaling does not work when original image height width is smaller the scaling height width

this xml code works well if the image is a 1x1 ratio or if the height is bigger than the width

the only way i found to be sure that the view is in landscape mode is to test that the view height is less than the view width

alternatively you can use jquery filter method to filter all the images which have width greater than height and then add the required class at once

smaller side
portrait mode sets the smaller side as the width and larger side as height for example 9 16 landscape the sets the larger side as the width and smaller side as height 16 9

now usually with this approach when the element width and height is more than the default width and height of the drawing surface what the browser does is it scales up the drawing surface to find the canvas element size

basically it should check weather container length or height is smaller compared to image width and height normalized and adapt it to that

since your height is smaller than the width it should do the trick

smaller
right now i scale by height which works to some degree however as the width gets smaller the image gallery will be cut off as the container has overflow hidden on some smaller widths as it is adjusting by the height of the container to stay in proportion but doesn t consider the width of the container too essentially the width is longer than the container width

smaller
the height width ratio since the height of the text box is relatively smaller than the width and the area of the text box

higher value
it s because you re using and orientation portrait so once the width of the window has a higher value than the height none of your css will be taken into account because it s considered landscape orientation at that point

bigger
if the width is bigger than the height i want the height to be set to auto

bigger
it will also automatically apply a 90 degree rotation transformation if the width is bigger than the height before applying any scaling

...then using the animate on click event you could give the height a value and animation time the width a delay equal o bigger than the height animation time and then it s value...that should do the trick but it s more stiff than actually using the ui

my solution was to use a php variable and increment it on each generated then if i have let s say 13 rows it echoes but the cells must have an exact width so it may add a new line of text if i have a longer text on a cell and the table will have more than 1280px height

but since i want a portrait preview i need to rotate the image and as a consequence i get images with an height much larger than the width the transpose of the original image i guess

better
rather than using fixed width height it is better to create a layout which allows the textblock to adjust its width

it depends what is your default stylesheet like if you want to tell the browser that when the width is smaller than 700px apply these styles but as soon as the height goes smaller than 600px over ride these styles with these new values

larger
the basic idea behind the approach is that you map the coordinates of the images to the interval by dividing by the width assuming the width is the larger dimension but it does not matter if it is smaller than the height

in retrospect what you re trying to do will not get you to make the imageview circular because the default imageview is rectangular the height is always more than the width and so.

less window
but is it dangerous to assume that while working in landscape mode the window height will always be less than window width and therefore making it the main constraining factor

bigger smaller virtual
if you wan to account for all the possible options real height width bigger smaller than virtual height width and to make sure that the best configuration is delivered the rescaling occurs such that the available space is maximised it is not so straightforward

i have a fullscreen image standard 16 9 that scales proportionally unless the users height is larger then the width

greater
according to the exif-information the orientation is 0 so supposedly the picture is not rotated - but since the width is greater than the height the picture is in fact rotated

ratio always higher
your and are static which means and are always they same aswell respectively 5.1785714285714 and 2.55625 so width ratio is always higher then height ratio

bigger
it works well when height is bigger than width but it does not work when width is bigger than height

if the ratio is bigger then 1 then the width is bigger than height let s say 700px 500px and after resizing the image is filled with white spaces in the top and bottom of the image

checking if screen width is larger than height is useless in my case because the app always runs in landscape

so its width is the width of the user s browser minus as much as possible without making them larger than 90 height of the viewport

basically you would start with a font height smaller than the height of your textview and then iterate or do a binary search through fonts of varying sizes until you find one that measures to smaller than the width of your textview

less
find out if the height is less or the width is less

far smaller
in this case if i want to have a fixed width while keeping ratio i just set height to a very large number so that the resizer will actually ignore it since the ratio of real height to desired height is far smaller than the ratio of real width and desired width

in some scenarios i can prevent the image from getting too torn apart by rotating the image 90 degrees if the width of the image is greater than the height of the image

lower
you do this by dismissing all variations where the width is lower than the depth so for each i w i d i and then dismissing the variation where the height is not the highest nor the lowest of the three dimensions because the other two variations can go one on top of the other and this one can t join in

better approach
managing the content via width is a better approach you don t really need to know the height

edit actually you resize the one that is the biggest if width is bigger you resize that and if height is bigger then you resize that

less window
judging by these i would assume that in landscape orientation the window height will be less than window width

this approach doesn t work when the width of the container is larger than the height as the child overflows the parent as demonstrated in the following snippet

as far as i can tell the javascript is only detecting when the height grows greater than the width and vice versa

i expect that in portrait orientation screen width is less then height

value not less
i have ensured that the width value is not less than height always

alternately you could make use of background-size contain it would preserve the aspect ratio but it will leave white space on the left and right if the width is larger or on the top and bottom if the height is larger

greater
in that case if the total images width height is greater then the screen s width height it will just cut off. br

so whenever width is less than height this shall be a portrai eventually will load your css file even if the original screen was initialized at landscape

larger
that will also works if the height of the window is larger than the width

larger
the asymmetry might ve been caused by the dimensions of the spinner container .round where its width was 2px larger than its height

larger
if image width is larger than height landscape then scale the height to 1024 pixels and scale the width to appropriate value to maintain aspect ratio

the height is 3 times larger than width which is unexpected

greater image
given a scenario where you don t know the height and width of image elements in advance let s say that in cases where image height is greater than image width you d like to vertically center the image by cropping the same amount of pixels form its top and bottom such that the new image height matches the image width

greater
i would like to avoid top bottom padding in the uiimageview when the images width is greater than its height

you can check wether the width larger is than the height which is landscape

greater
as of today no browser implements a vertical slider based solely on height being greater than width

greater
so if the parent s height is greater than the width then the child is limited by the parent s width and if the parent s width is greater than the height then the child is limited by the height

bigger
if your height is bigger and width is smaller than container width will be stretch to 100 and height will be trimmed from both side

smaller
for images having width much smaller than height no margins observed

much taller
everything seems good until i previewed the website on an ipad iphone portrait mode where the screen height is much taller than its width

turns out √¢ ≈ìportrait√¢ really just means the height is greater than the width and √¢ ≈ìlandscape√¢ means the width is greater than the height

greater real
its a bool value so if the maximum of width or height is greater than real width then you get true

bigger then
if window height is bigger then window width the we have a portrait or in any other case we have a landscape orientation

you can see the page s width is wider than the height but when the app runs on a desktop or a simulator device like 7 pad the extra space is pushed into the top and the bottom

smaller
the other page isn t rotated but it has a height that is smaller than the width

larger
the width should be larger than the height

less
but i can see if i give width as wrap_content then height is less than fixed height because keeping aspect ratio height corresponding to wrap_content width is less fixed height

i ve found that if you load an image from the camera roll that is a png pngs have no orientation data flag and the height is greater than the width upon applying certain distortion filters to said image it will rotate and present it self as if it were a landscape image

a picture can be put in a frame if the frame width and height is greater than the picture width and height the pictures and frames cannot be rotated

much bigger
since the height is much bigger than the width there are top and bottom parts that are captured in the image that are not showing up in the live feed naturally

larger then
most popular video formats are 4 3 or 16 9 so the width is larger then the height

other approaches like making the element s width larger than height or using scale would result in an elliptical arc and it would also require tweaking to positioning attributes when height or width changes

larger
is the height of the viewport larger than the width

greater
and if their width or height is greater than their containers width or height then make them automatically shrink while keeping their proportions

larger
if the height is larger than the width the window is in portrait mode

as your container height is less then the image you have to rely on this otherwise set width height screw background image

larger
however if you want to redesign your layout or make adjustments based on wether the screen is in landscape width is larger than height or portrait height is larger than width mode you can definitely use css media queries

more
in case height is more than width then you have to resize with height

sometimes bigger
the images can be of any resolution size and the height sometimes is bigger than the width and vice versa for both images

greater
this is because the height of the second image is greater than the width

in landscape the height is smaller than the width

greater
documents are most likely to be in portrait format taller than they are wide so if the height is greater than the width then do don t have to do anything

taller
i interpred this to mean that for example the width will be 5 8th of the width of the working area unless this results in the dialog which is taller than the height of the working area in which case it will use a wider width

greater
the problem is that on some devices the width is greater than the height and vice versa

longer
else if the width is longer than the height you set the width to 500px and the height to auto

smaller
width should be smaller than height at about 100px - the all works fine

i have this doubt i have a menu in which i run a javascript code or another depending on whether its width is greater or less than its height works me well the first time the screen resolution is detected but if there is a change of resolution or a change of orientation does not detect it and despite for example of having changed to portrait orientation still executing the landscape orientation code

in ios emulator works all right width of screen is greater than height views frames and bounds are as shown

so the problem is the javascript is not adding class from the image if image height greater than the width

bigger value
this is weird cause i would figure that the width should have a bigger value than the height right now

lesser
sometimes width greater than height and sometimes width lesser than height

less
so what i need to do is to check if the exif wants to rotate 90 or 270 degrees and if so only perform the rotation if the height is less than the width which would mean the portrait picture isn t already rotated

width - set it a width make sure it has a priority more than others but less than height

greater
likewise if we change img and #clock to have a defined width instead of a defined height then we have a clock that can scale properly but only if the viewport height is greater than the width

greater then
if the width is greater then height 3 4 screen.width then

here smaller unit
if a user s screen had a resolution of 1000x800px 100vmin would be equal to 800px and 100vmax would be equal to 1000px as the height here is the smaller unit and the width is the larger unit

sql server is probably smart enough to translate isnull into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then coalesce is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with isnull and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in isnull

a treemap costs a lot more than a linkedhashmap and adds nothing to your project if you only need to keep original insertion order

i actually found the setup of nginx much easier than lighttpd not to mention that you can install a macport of nginx port install nginx +ssl that does not contain the ssl-breaking bug that lighttpd suffers from here

even more ridiculously
it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd

slower
after reading a question related with the performance of sin cos why is std sin and std cos slower than sin and cos

faster
or maybe flip them on my machine sin seems faster than cos

bigger
3.14 is pretty close but a little smaller than pi and sin 3.14 is thus pretty close but a little bigger than 0 cos 3.14 is thus pretty close but a little smaller in absolute terms than -1 so tan 3.14 is a little less than 0

better
cos itself seems to be consistently a tick 0 01 better than sin but the case distinction to reconstruct the sign has an extra test

cheaper
if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

faster
so if we have a vector and want to calculate a component-wise function over it say sin and cos it is faster to use vvsincos from accelerate because it will pipeline the calculations of sin and cos for all the entries in the vector which is faster than using a for-loop over the vector

to allow you to scale down the data away from 0 and 1 i had to do this when combining colormap in matplotlib single pcolormesh with more than one colormap using matplotlib so you can likely see how the code works but basically say you have values -5 1 10 in a sample but want to normalize based on a range of -7 to 7 so anything above 7 our 10 is treated as a 7 effectively with a midpoint of 2 but shrink it to fit a 256 rgb colormap

in general multiplication is more costlier than subtraction right

since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

far more common
malloc is far more common in c code than calloc

faster
malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros

faster
it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo

closer
actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest

slower
also calloc is slower than malloc from operating system memory allocation perspective

better
it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset

slower
calloc itself is slower than malloc because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory

faster
this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed

longer
calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

far more
malloc is far more common in c code than calloc

bigger blocks
for this reason since calloc uses two arguments of type size_t it can allocate bigger blocks than malloc will ever be able to since malloc takes only one argument of type size_t

larger blocks
those answers was that calloc can allocate larger blocks than malloc can and etc

faster
this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset

faster
and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc

still faster
if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

more correct
edit i m not a java expert but i think that in java members of new array are initialized to 0 or null so calloc is more correct than malloc in my code

faster
malloc is faster than calloc reason is that malloc processed single dimensional array to pointer format whereas calloc takes double dimensional array and before processed it converts to single dimensional array then to pointer format

faster
it would be better to use malloc over calloc unless we want the zero-initialization because malloc is faster than calloc

faster
in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

faster
calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

less
g_new and g_new0 both take the same arguments unlike malloc that takes less arguments than calloc

example if using dp unit hdpi device will have 1.5 240 160 times larger than mdpi

smaller
when you put images into hdpi folder their appearance is smaller than from mdpi and ldpi

larger
for example mdpi is basically 72dpi as your computer monitor hdpi resources should be around 1.5 times larger than mdpi resources and so forth

smaller
ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

less
as mdpi is less than hdpi so it will take the values from the folder which is least below it in you case it is values which is applicable to all

smaller images
images in these different folders should have different physical pixel sizes mdpi has smaller images than hdpi but the images pixel densities aren t used

smaller
layout-sw320dp-land will pick up drawable from hdpi folder whereas layout-sw720dp-land is mdpi device so it will pick up drawables from mdpi folder which will be smaller than hdpi

larger
and you know your image at hdpi folder so its 1.5 larger than the mdpi

closer
the system will pick the closest match and mdpi is closer to hdpi than to xxhdpi

less
first of all if you anyhow provide a hdpi graphic adding an mdpi and ldpi graphic which both are less than the hdpi graphic in size there is approximately 3 4 6 scaling ratio will increase the size but far from triple it more close to double

int no better
as far as the compiler is concerned the conversion from integer 0 to unsigned int is no better than the conversion from integer 0 to pointer

larger
1 as chux has noted in a comment if unsigned is larger than uint32_t arithmetic on uint32_t goes through the usual integer promotions and if not it stays as uint32_t

bigger
an implementation that has no such unsigned type say because pointers are bigger than any integer type won t provide it

faster
the idea here is threefold readability using operator functions with compatible left and right arguments as well as return value and the use of integer multiplying operators being faster than unsigned operators

wider int
pedantic note when printing integer types that might wider than int unsigned insure the final computed result matches the specifier

constant larger
going too high gives the error integer constant is larger than the largest unsigned integer type

division much faster
in case of unsigned integer division this problem does not arise which is why generally integer division works much faster for unsigned types than for signed types

wider
it can only disappoint you if your compiler has an integer type wider than unsigned long long and you use it

rank less
an object with an integer type other than int and signed int whose integer rank is less than or equal to the rank of int and unsigned int a bit field of type _bool int signed int or unsigned int

more useful
furthermore signed integer types just tend to be more useful than unsigned types

int apparently larger
on your system unsigned int is apparently larger than uint16_t int is a greater ranked integer type than short in the standard 6.3.1.1 even if they are of the same size

according the books the variations of type integer occupy more or less bytes of memory depending on the architecture however the type unsigned short values √¢ √¢ can get up to 65 535 since the type unsigned long 4 294 967 295

constant larger
error integer constant is larger than the largest unsigned integer type

larger
the problem is that the input integer is larger than what would fit in an unsigned long long

smaller int
instead default argument promotions take place which means that any integer type smaller than int unsigned int gets converted to one of those -- that s not the only promotion but the only one relevant here -- and which also means that there is no automatic conversion to whatever type you specify with va_arg

bigger size
both of following types are semantically equivalent minimum 64bit integer without sign and with equal or bigger size than unsigned long int

using npm package is a little bit harder than using bower package

more
bower is more focused on browser libraries and css while npm is more for server-sided stuff using node.js

better fit
is bower a better fit than npm for asp .net 5 projects with separation of source and build files and if not what s the recommended way of doing it purely with npm

simpler
bower packages are simpler than npm equivalents and don t have subfolders with module dependencies

wider user
what i meant to ask is it can be argued that npm has a wider user base than bower some even argue that we should stop using bower altogether like here and here

more similar
bower is more similar to npm than to component

finally i also made a benchmark test which shows that substr operation is slightly better than sapply grepl and significantly better than vectorised grepl alone

so if using std ostream is more limiting than std basic_ostream

more dynamic
highcharts is svg and as such it is much more dynamic than flot you can restyle graphs with css attach events perform animations etc..

slower
glassfish seems to be slower than resin

more sense
i believe that the reports are using something more along the lines of vbscript edit oregonghost says vba which actually makes more sense than vbscript than vb.net and very limited at that

better
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages

better
i have tried with sublimetext 2 and it work very very good better than gedit p

more
because hql is more or less superset of jpql it of course works also in hql

slower
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort

easier
using just the keyfn return a comparable value that matches your requirements is much easier than implementing comparator

class better
a comparator class is better since use of comparable would mean using

much more time
sublimetext 3 needs much more time several seconds more then scite before the opened file shows up and i suppose it is because sublimetext does some pre-evaluation of the file content like detecting areas suitable for folding there are fold triangles available depending on indentation of non-white characters in the file

slower
i hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than git

10x more technical
i would not mind changing to for example bazaar or git if needed i am a bit afraid of git to be honest everything i read about git seems 10x more technical than anything i read about mercurial or bazaar and installing it on windows seems to imply installing all sorts of secondary software it seems but that is another matter

better
it works fine and fits all my needs but recently i found that git works better than bazaar so i decided to use it but i face a problem with git usability because most git s gui not user friendly as bazaar explorer so i want your advice based on a practical experience which best git s gui user friendly or which one is most similar to bazaar explorer

easier
bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes

more powerful
note most recently i have been using bazaar and hg with fully powerful regexps so may be looking for stuff more powerful than git provides

imho easier
bazaar is imho easier to learn than git

slower
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested

mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference

slower
a lot of articles about bazaar will tell you it is a lot slower than git or mercurial

more special other
e.g. break with labels as in java or even a more generic goto. continue does not seem more special than other control-structure mechanisms except that it is present in more languages

better
also i tried installing pathogen and that worked for some bundles but would not work for perlomni.vim because it was an ftplugin and pathogen was not appending the bundles correctly and after research i saw most people saying vundle was better than pathogen

algorithm less susceptible
the structure of the hmac algorithm makes it less susceptible to attacks on properties of the underlying hash algorithm

more efficient
in some cases on embedded platforms where a fast hash function may not be available these may be more efficient than hmac

better
hmac is better than a plain hash because it is not vulnerable to hash length extension attacks

much faster
after looking it s seems that hmac is much faster and better in term of security even if the underlying hash function sha1 is broken which is not the case when using rsa-sha1

algorithm less
the structure of the hmac algorithm makes it less susceptible to attacks on properties of the underlying hash algorithm

function more modern
it looks like the onload function is a more modern convenience method and the old way of checking the result is using onreadystatechange instead

lighter
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generate callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server

smoother results
however i wish to use a custom calayer that uses an internal cggradient for drawing instead as this should produce smoother results than cagradientlayer see here

better
take a look at mouseenter and mouseleave events they are better than mousemove and mouseenter combinations

better
if you want to use a continuous gesture that tracks the user s finger you can use uipangesturerecognizer rather than uiswipegesturerecognizer and i think animatewithduration is better than catransition in that case

safer
in few words strncmp is safer then strcmp but it is slower too

safer
you should use strncmp to compare your strings it s safer than strcmp

slower
is strcmp slower than strncmp as one can give pre-calculated string length to it but strcmp does not receive such information

safer then
in few words strncmp is safer then strcmp but it is slower too

more secure
strncmp is more secure than strcmp

safer
also have a look at strncmp which is safer version of strcmp

safer
note strncmp is safer than strcmp

safer
the only case where strncmp would be safer than strcmp is when you re comparing two character arrays as strings you re certain that both arrays are at least n bytes long the 3rd argument passed to strncmp and you re not certain that both arrays contain strings contain a 0 null character terminator

safer version
also have a look at strncmp which is safer version of strcmp

more
strncmp is more secure than strcmp

safer
strncmp is a little bit safer than strcmp because you specify how many comparisons will be made at most

slower
btw on some processors unsigned short is much slower than unsigned int because the c standard requires that operations on unsigned types wrap

much slower
btw on some processors unsigned short is much slower than unsigned int because the c standard requires that operations on unsigned types wrap

narrower
alignment may fail as unsigned short can be narrower than unsigned int

smaller
as unsigned short int is in some implementations smaller than unsigned int

wider
so if you tell it to expect an unsigned short for example then it will actually expect either an int if int is wider than unsigned short or unsigned int if int and short are the same size

smaller
but i wrote this code to check if we compared an signed int x 0xdeadbeef and unsigned short y 0xffff then after converting the unsigned short to int we should have 0x0000ffff in y at the comparison which should be smaller than the unsigned value of x

wider
if size_type is defined as unsigned short and int is wider than unsigned short the lhs of your addition will be converted to the rhs and you rely on the addition being performed in the lhs s type

bigger
an unsigned char is an unsigned value which is typically smaller than and is guaranteed not to be bigger than a short

narrower
the rule for performing arithmetic operations in c c++ is that if the type such as short is narrower than int then it gets widened to int if all values can fit or unsigned int otherwise

operator higher
i looked it up and the logical-or operator has a higher precedence than the conditional operator and the conditional operator has right-to-left associativity

slower
in the experiments and discussion below i find that cufft is slower than fftw for batched 2d ffts

slower cpu
i am working on a code which needs to be time efficient and thus using cufft for this purpose but when i try to compute fft of a very large data in parallel it is slower than cpu fftw and the reason i find after finding the time for every line of code using high precision timing code is that cudamalloc taking around 0.983 sec while the time for rest of the lines of code is around 0.00xx sec which is expected ..

slower
however for a variety of fft problem sizes i ve found that cufft is slower than fftw with openmp

more structured
2 yii a bit more structured than codeigniter but you have a basic app up within 10 mins and if your familiar with mvc design its a great way to develop portals incredibly quickly

better
so latest codeigniter 2.0 is better than yii according to this benchmarks

faster
i have found one benchmark in which yii is faster than codeigniter and another benchmark in which codeigniter is faster than yii

more
personally i d say yii might have the edge as it encourages convention more than codeigniter would

more complex
i am currently looking at yii and while its more complex than codeigniter the documentation is much more informative and therefore understandable than cakephp s

yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

i have found one benchmark in which yii is faster than codeigniter and another benchmark in which codeigniter is faster than yii

generally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course

longer
when the screens resizes the longer elements in my navbar switching to two lines to take up less space

taller
however when i switching to landscape mode the listview is taller than the screens

larger
i ve already built a view that can take a drawable can use focused pinch-zoom and drag can auto-scale images can switching images dynamically and takes images larger than the screens

larger
i am using view flipper to show bunch on images like a slider where i implemented the functionality of swipe left and right to switching images now some of my images are larger than the screens size in terms of height are getting hidden

more frequent
and would the answer be different in a case where screens switching is more frequent like between an overworld screens and a battle screens in a game like final fantasy or pokemon

lower normal
after switching to windows 10 i ve noticed that when selecting a lower than normal screens resolution the panel fit mode will default to maintain aspect ratio meaning black bars appear

bigger
the point of such an architecture is because i have news with some text between which i want to be able to switching with paging effect but the news text can be bigger than the screens

smaller
but when the screens is smaller than 900px we switching from fixed to liquid via media query switching to a liquid width will allow our images to scale down our text to wrap and a whole bunch of other great things

no longer
at this point there is nothing i can do since the switching is no longer there... the external screens is just a blank screens for the sake of the exercise

more
and would the answer be different in a case where screens switching is more frequent like between an overworld screens and a battle screens in a game like final fantasy or pokemon

smaller
the panels must be side by side for a large screens but they must be responsive and as the screens gets smaller and switching to vertical orientation

longer elements
when the screens resizes the longer elements in my navbar switching to two lines to take up less space

less
but then i noticed after changing a mobile to landscape it would switching back to the desktop mode due to the width of the media query being less than the screens landscape width

size smaller
when the screens size is smaller i have it switching flex-direction to column which works well except i cannot figure out how to make the 2nd row trending down start where the trending up stops where ever that may be

better compatability
switching to 2.2 framework which has better compatability with screens resolutions and densities

size smaller i
when the screens size is smaller i have it switching flex-direction to column which works well except i cannot figure out how to make the 2nd row trending down start where the trending up stops where ever that may be

bigger
when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly

better
i ve been using uwsgi in production on heroku for over a year and it seems to handle everything a lot better than gunicorn

better performance
according to many benchmarks uwsgi seems to provides better performance than gunicorn and if the performance doesn t change significantly you ll be able to focus your investigation on nginx or ec2 configurations

better standard
first fiber won t compile with apple clang because of the use of thread_local which apple does not support according to what i found online they think they can implement it better than standard llvm and don t want to introduce it only to break abi later

more compatible
good options are llvm libc++ static library fewer features more compatible with clang and gnu stl static library more features i had an issue that required me to turn the clang optimizer to -oz to prevent a segfault

code faster
llvm compiles code faster than gcc may create code that runs faster and the clang frontend provides more accurate error messages than gcc √¢ so there are definitely reasons for switching

better
i am not sure but by reading the documentation i think you need to download the pyodbc it seems to be better supported than adodbapi

bigger
edit2 okay i just see that if the angle is bigger than 180√¢ it s concave so i have to change the shape for be simple than a triangulation

smoother
however gambit scheme has smoother access to c c++ code libraries which far outnumber common lisp s libraries

better other
t s purpose is to test the thesis developed by steele and sussman in their series of papers about scheme that scheme may be used as the basis for a practical programming language of exceptional expressive power and that implementations of scheme could perform better than other lisp systems and competitively with implementations of programming languages such as c and bliss which are usually considered to be inherently more efficient than lisp on conventional machine architectures

wider
from there on the width slowly increases again as the part of the string still on line 1 linearly gets wider as the font-size increases

larger
as you can see the font-size of the text is bit larger than the width of the noisy lines

less
the first media query says that if the screen width is less than 992px the h2 in the item class should have a font-size of 3rem should be red and should have an underline

smaller
you can remove the transform s and the margin-left and add a width set as 0 here smaller than the font-size 16px here to the get the effect

greater
when you are using fittext at that time if the font-size is greater than 100px than you have to set the exact width as per your font-size

wider
i initialize the loop with this value and increment the font-size with 1 until the string is wider than the width of the containing element

faster reliable communication
http is an application layer protocol which could be encapsulated with a protocol that uses udp providing arguably faster reliable communication than tcp

faster
i read in a case where a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

safer choice
i know tcp is a safer choice but let s assume i can only use udp and i need to ensure i can send packets over at a high rate with no missing packets what should i do

simpler
a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack

knottier
normally a server wouldn t need to know the client s address beforehand but udp s knottier than tcp the more usual stream-oriented approach to socket communication in many ways

faster
udp is significantly faster than tcp and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day

better
this was surprising for me as i expected udp to perform better than tcp

more overhead
if they are connected over the internet you could try to use the examples for tcp but tcp has more overhead than udp

faster
in that sense reliable udp cannot be faster than tcp

way better then
tcp is way better then udp for that

windowing more expensive
tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

bigger overhead
tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted

connections more aggressive
it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

more reliable
tcp ip is supposed to be more reliable than udp ip see this comparison

much more
+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

significantly easier
udp is significantly easier do you really need tcp btw

simpler
first of udp s datagram is simpler than tcp s one

better
does udp always perform better than tcp

better
udp is actually expected to work better than tcp in lossy networks or congested networks

faster
udp is faster than tcp because packets are sent without guarantee of delivery nor order

better
tcp is much better than udp in terms of reliability

better
i think udp will perform better than tcp gcdasyncsocket in your case video transfer

much more complicated
it was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp

worse
if your client connections are more or less permanent and not too many clients are connected at the same time tcp is only slightly worse than udp

higher
actually we could say that tcp is a higher level protocol compared to udp because tcp includes some advanced features which might be useful .

better
note that there are exceptions to the above - for example tcp generally traverses firewalls better than udp which may be blocked due to security to traffic policy reasons so voip speech may sometimes be sent over tcp for part of its journey at least

slower
tcp is a bit slower than udp but more failsafe

more popular
but there are some cases especially in iot domain udp is more popular than tcp for its bigger transport overheads

less
udp is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to its host you can safely skip all the tcp reliability stuff

less hungry
alternatively it can be used over udp which is less hungry than tcp

faster
i know udp is faster than tcp for various reason

faster
there is a perception that udp is faster than tcp but i think it depends on the situation - take a look at this discussion for some further discussion on speed reliability etc between udp and tcp go down through all the high scored answers

absolutely faster
if the network between the two point have a very high quality udp is absolutely faster than tcp but in some other case such as the gprs network tcp may been faster and more reliability than udp

better
in general the tcp protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the udp protocol

bigger
the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks

slower more
tcp is a slower more reliable protocol than udp is

better
we know tcp is better suited for this but the hardware development decided it s got to be udp

more
as far as tcp goes i think tcp is more generally used protocol for more data-centric requests like chat or things that require packet integrity udp tolerates packet loss to lower latency

faster
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

always faster
also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp

ip more
tldr tcp ip is more reliable than udp but not a 100 iron-clad guarantee that nothing will ever go wrong

ip more reliable
tldr tcp ip is more reliable than udp but not a 100 iron-clad guarantee that nothing will ever go wrong

slower
the problem with using tcp is obviously that it is a lot slower than udp

much better just
instead of implementing all these over udp it is much better just to switch to tcp

communication much less overhead
udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged

harder
but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over tcp which is a harder problem than udp

more
udp is more of a fire and forget whereas tcp maintains a connection state

slower
try to increase timeout value tcp is slower than udp

easier
but with the udp protocol in particular this is easier than for tcp

faster
from experience i can tell you udp is about 10-15 faster than tcp on dedicated and udp-tuned networks

more complicated
+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

more
note that udp is more difficult to work with than tcp because packets are not always guaranteed to be delivered

faster
what s currently baffling me is in my results tcp finishes almost 2x faster than udp

faster
udp is extremely faster than tcp which is suitable to stream a user s voice input

easier
keep in mind that implementing udp traversal is easier than tcp

lower overhead
one can say udp has a lower overhead than tcp because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data

less
while udp has less network overhead than tcp it generally relies on you the developer to come up with your own mechanisms for flow control fragmentation handling lost packets etc.

faster
if the network between the two point have a very high quality udp is absolutely faster than tcp but in some other case such as the gprs network tcp may been faster and more reliability than udp

far more appropriate
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case

much more
it was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp

faster
use socket for tcp and datagram for udp its a lot faster than tcp but less connection oriented

less
also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that udp is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads tcp incurs due to its inbuilt connection management

better
does udp always perform better than tcp

faster then
one often finds the argument that udp is faster then tcp

bigger
tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted

more
i ve considered that udp is more suitable for sending a series of discrete data sets but i need the reliability of tcp

less
getting much more information is needed in the packet header for connection less like udp but why the header size of udp is less than tcp

better performance
udp will almost always provide better performance than tcp at the cost of reliability

faster
we propose to use udp over tcp since udp is faster than tcp

communication much less
udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged

simpler protocol
udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp

more reliable
that among other things is why tcp is considered more reliable but slower than udp

faster
udp should be much faster than tcp because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection

better
scenario where udp is better than tcp

better
for this particular application sending simple data chunk to the client from an index given by the client tcp will not perform any better than udp

faster
because there is no confirmation on udp packets it s slightly faster than tcp

more complicated
it was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp

faster
udp protocol is unreliable but much much faster than tcp which is most commonly used for communication

less overhead
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

more likely
tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work

better
in practice this means that tcp is better suited for continuous transmission of data whereas the more lightweight udp can be used when reliability isn t important

much more
for example tcp has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all udp has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum

better
or is there any specific scenario where udp is better than tcp

faster
for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

socket even more likely
tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work

faster better
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

slower
with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features

connection faster
i know that in practice this would only happen with a great amount of connection given that processing time of an udp connection is faster than tcp but it could potentially happen

faster
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

more reliable protocol
tcp is a slower more reliable protocol than udp is

header more fields
you will notice that the tcp header has more fields than the udp header and many of those fields will be populated by information from the handshake

slower
tcp is reliable but slower than udp while udp is not safe and i have to implement my own fault-handling codes

lower overhead
udp sockets have much lower overhead than tcp because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient

slower
in doing so the tradefoff is that tcp becomes slower compared to udp

also more work
udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp

faster
i though that udp was faster than tcp but do you think that tcp will be faster due to the congestion

better protocol
hello to all i am developing an application that needs to send a image via the udp socket.i know that tcp is a better protocol but playing with kryonet in java i have learnt that udp is better for this type of application.i have this small class that i have made

faster
one often finds the argument that udp is faster then tcp

simpler
also sending receiving data over udp is much simpler than over tcp and it does not require any connections

better
i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp average 65 better

lower
one can say udp has a lower overhead than tcp because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data

worse
also note that it is easy to implement your own stack on top of udp that performs worse than tcp

faster
also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp

slower
tcp is a slower more reliable protocol than udp is

faster
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

much more flags
for example tcp has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all udp has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum

much more complicated
+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

faster
as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead

faster
for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

more reliable
tldr tcp ip is more reliable than udp but not a 100 iron-clad guarantee that nothing will ever go wrong

less reliable
udp is way lighter and faster but somewhat less reliable than tcp

better option
if you can t afford lost packets then tcp is probably a better option than udp since it provides that guarantee out of the box

more reliable
you could get them to do a udp multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use tcp to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than udp

slower
4 tcp is a slower than udp

lower performance
if you were attempting to beat the performance of tcp by shifting to udp keep in mind that part of the reason you get lower performance with tcp is because tcp tracks and redelivers the lost packets for you

better
short answer if you can tolerance with any packet loss udp is better otherwise tcp

faster
i m trying to avoid tcpclient because udp is faster but would this work in tcp since it s streamed

less
the fact that udp s header size is less than tcp s is because is a simpler protocol that needs less header space that s all there is to it

slower
i assumend that the transmission using udp have to be much faster than using tcp but in fact my tests proved that the udp transmission is about 7 to 8 times slower than using tcp

more overhead
certainly tcp has more overhead than udp

better
or is there any specific scenario where udp is better than tcp

much faster
this is the reason why udp is much faster than tcp

better
hello to all i am developing an application that needs to send a image via the udp socket.i know that tcp is a better protocol but playing with kryonet in java i have learnt that udp is better for this type of application.i have this small class that i have made

less latency
udp lends itself to real-time less latency than tcp

less chatty
in gaming especially fpss udp tends to be the chosen protocol because it s much less chatty than tcp

better
i did some research and found that udp may be more suitable in this case because udp hole punching works much better than tcp hole punching

smaller overhead
udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability

more
also remember that dns requests can use tcp if the request or response would need more than 1 udp packet

considerably simpler
a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack

less overhead
udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged

lower latency
like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

better choice
the key question was related to what kind of situations would udp be the better choice over tcp

better
if you care a lot about efficiency or really need tens of thousands of connections then implementing your specific protocol in udp will always be better than tcp

higher throughput
what is that key feature in tcp that makes it have much much higher throughput than udp

like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

more reliable
what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability

faster
the reason udp is faster than tcp is because there is no form of flow control or error correction

faster
only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp

better
since loosing some packets doesn t matter but speed latency is crucial udp is much better than tcp

more fields
you will notice that the tcp header has more fields than the udp header and many of those fields will be populated by information from the handshake

more
2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp it√¢ s not

simpler
you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp

better
i know tcp is better to send file but i have a homework about sending file via udp protocol

slower
because of tcp requires connection and provides security it is slower than udp and therefore it should not be preffered during a video streaming

way better
tcp is way better then udp for that

far better
tcp is far better at transferring large quantities of data but when the network fails it s more likely that udp will get through

better throughput
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

faster
this is the reason why udp is much faster than tcp

more
if they are connected over the internet you could try to use the examples for tcp but tcp has more overhead than udp

more difficult
note that udp is more difficult to work with than tcp because packets are not always guaranteed to be delivered

transport higher
so assess the situation the development cost of a udp transport is higher to significantly higher than tcp and to some degree you are re-inventing tcp

faster
i am using udp because it is much faster than tcp but sometimes i need the know for sure if the packet reached to the other side in my program i can not use tcp at all so i am sending ack packets

much easier
as such traversing a nat through udp is much easier than tcp

more secure
the decision on yours the tcp protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than udp

faster
if i d directly say that udp is faster comparatively than tcp that it is used for such applications

faster better throughput
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

faster better
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

slower
the reason i asking this is because i read tcp is slower than udp because tcp ensures order of packets

more appropriate
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case

higher performance
as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that udp is actually going to have higher performance than tcp for web services

way lighter
udp is way lighter and faster but somewhat less reliable than tcp

faster
i assumend that the transmission using udp have to be much faster than using tcp but in fact my tests proved that the udp transmission is about 7 to 8 times slower than using tcp

higher level
actually we could say that tcp is a higher level protocol compared to udp because tcp includes some advanced features which might be useful .

faster
udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .

more processing
moreover tcp has more processing overhead than udp

much simpler
also sending receiving data over udp is much simpler than over tcp and it does not require any connections

better throughput
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

more reliable
tcp is certainly going to be more reliable than udp since udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive

connectionless more relevant
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented

faster
don t think of it as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong

less
generally speaking udp has less overhead than tcp allowing you to receive more data but this is not a strict rule and is almost negligible in this context

just smaller
udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability

less overhead
generally speaking udp has less overhead than tcp allowing you to receive more data but this is not a strict rule and is almost negligible in this context

better
it is worth nothing that in a link where udp and tcp are sharing the bandwidth tcp is better behaved than udp in that it will try to limit itself to avoid congestion

more accurate
i m aware of the differences in general the facts like tcp is more accurate while udp is more fast

easier
as such traversing a nat through udp is much easier than tcp

traversal easier
keep in mind that implementing udp traversal is easier than tcp

less
alternatively it can be used over udp which is less hungry than tcp

throughput bigger
i am confused why tcp throughput is bigger than udp

communication connection less
udp communication is connection less as compared to tcp which need a connection

smaller
the package is bigger than udp s package but smaller than tcp s package

bigger packages
the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks

better
scenario where udp is better than tcp

lower overhead
udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

faster
for instance zeromq can leverage udp multicast to run faster than any tcp protocol but the application programmer doesn t need to learn a new api

much better
instead of implementing all these over udp it is much better just to switch to tcp

less network
while udp has less network overhead than tcp it generally relies on you the developer to come up with your own mechanisms for flow control fragmentation handling lost packets etc.

better
does udp always perform better than tcp

more
the downsides are that it is unreliable messages can be dropped or corrupted therefore you may want to add some safety and that some isp may restrict udp more than tcp test yourself to be sure but usually there is no problems

safer
i know tcp is a safer choice but let s assume i can only use udp and i need to ensure i can send packets over at a high rate with no missing packets what should i do

better
udp scales better than tcp because of reduced states that need to be maintained in the operating system

faster
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

simpler
you ve struck lucky with the requirements - because you re going from udp - tcp it s actually a lot simpler than doing udp - udp

slower
apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse

higher latencies
tcp is subject to higher latencies than udp as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations

more
certainly tcp has more overhead than udp

significantly faster
udp is significantly faster than tcp and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day

slower
tcp is slower than udp and you ll have to mitigate that in realtime multiplayer

faster
at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too

generally faster
udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with

faster
udp is faster and requires less bandwidth than tcp

less reliable
and there are no handshakings required udp are pretty much faster but less reliable than tcp

slower
tcp is slower assures data arrival udp is faster data corruption may be possible

transmission slower
maybe one of you guys already sees a problem in the code snippets or have any other suggestion or hint for me why my udp transmission is slower than tcp

better
-- in which scenario configuration would i get udp to perform better than tcp

more
tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

better results
udp is more popular in nat punching because provides much better results than tcp

faster
in a native application i would use udp for the most data player position ... because it s way faster than tcp and it s uncritical when it is lost

just smaller overhead
udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability

windowing more
tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

harder
udp port scanning is possible but it is harder than tcp scanning

bigger payload
tcp sockets- guaranteed delivery bigger payload than udp cumbersome to setup for web based solutions

harder problem
but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over tcp which is a harder problem than udp

more processing
2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp it√¢ s not

higher
so assess the situation the development cost of a udp transport is higher to significantly higher than tcp and to some degree you are re-inventing tcp

less stringent
instead you can use udp and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp

much slower
tcp has to do a lot of error checking to ensure that your packets don t get dropped and so tcp is much slower than udp

lighter
yes udp is much much lighter than tcp

slower
tcp has to do a lot of error checking to ensure that your packets don t get dropped and so tcp is much slower than udp

faster
udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with

connectionless more
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented

connection less
udp is connection less but at the same level as tcp

more relevant here
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented

better
if you re more interested in latency and small amounts of data then something udp based could be better than tcp but you d need to build extra logic for ordering the messages and retrying the lost ones

generally firewalls better
note that there are exceptions to the above - for example tcp generally traverses firewalls better than udp which may be blocked due to security to traffic policy reasons so voip speech may sometimes be sent over tcp for part of its journey at least

much slower
tcp is much slower than udp but when the two machines are not on the same lan udp is not reliable

slower
tcp is much slower than udp but when the two machines are not on the same lan udp is not reliable

less complex
in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

better
for some requirements tcp is better for some udp

bigger
i am confused why tcp throughput is bigger than udp

better throughput
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

more
moreover tcp has more processing overhead than udp

more reliable
tcp - more reliable than udp but this comes with some overhead there is a distinct connection a better match for games which require less frequent data transmission such as turn based games as is your game

easier structured
udp packets are easier structured than tcp packets but sacrifice security for their size

slower
if the data is critical you should go for tcp which is slower as compared to udp which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if they d arrive or not

better
this was surprising for me as it is well known fact that udp performs better than tcp

much better
since loosing some packets doesn t matter but speed latency is crucial udp is much better than tcp

more
udp is more popular in nat punching because provides much better results than tcp

more popular
udp is more popular in nat punching because provides much better results than tcp

less reliable
udp is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to its host you can safely skip all the tcp reliability stuff

less
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

faster better
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

header more
you will notice that the tcp header has more fields than the udp header and many of those fields will be populated by information from the handshake

lower
like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

much faster then
udp is much faster then tcp but tcp has flow control and guaranteed delivery

more efficient
it seems like udp will more efficient than tcp

slower
maybe one of you guys already sees a problem in the code snippets or have any other suggestion or hint for me why my udp transmission is slower than tcp

more
i m aware of the differences in general the facts like tcp is more accurate while udp is more fast

faster
tcp as you know udp is faster than tcp even if udp may miss some

faster better throughput
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

slower
i suppose this is one of the reasons for the misconception that udp is slower than tcp

connections more
it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

slower
that among other things is why tcp is considered more reliable but slower than udp

socket much harder
when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a tcp socket is much harder than for a udp socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept

faster
i don t think you should make the assumption that udp is faster than tcp

less overhead
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

less costly
also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that udp is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads tcp incurs due to its inbuilt connection management

more generally
as far as tcp goes i think tcp is more generally used protocol for more data-centric requests like chat or things that require packet integrity udp tolerates packet loss to lower latency

faster
only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp

slower
i was going through internet and so and understood that web sockets are encapsulations to tcp which by itself is slower than udp ofcourse at the cost of reliability but i couldnt find much info if websockets or udp would be ideal to implement such a server

faster
i was expecting that udp would be faster but tcp is on average two times faster than udp

also more
udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp

faster
in a congested network yes udp will send its packets faster than tcp this is because tcp takes then congestion into account using a mechanism called congestion control

faster
tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

more reliable
tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

really faster
udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .

quicker
udp is quicker than tcp but if you re using quickfix you ll be using tcp

better otherwise
short answer if you can tolerance with any packet loss udp is better otherwise tcp

better
but when i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp for 10mb of data

simpler
udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp

simpler
c++ is not my first language and this is small part of code i can t figure out i ve chosen udp because it is always much simpler than tcp

more
some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

less
why the header size of udp is less than tcp

faster
udp should be much faster than tcp because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection

faster better throughput
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

faster comparatively
if i d directly say that udp is faster comparatively than tcp that it is used for such applications

larger
des code is 8 times larger than rsa

faster
by comparison des see section 3.2 and other block ciphers are much faster than the rsa algorithm

wider
when viewed on a screens wider than a tablet to be responsive according to the smaller screens size like this

wider
you could make your css mobile-first meaning that all properties are optimized for mobile then as the screens gets wider you apply tablet and desktop optimized css for elements

diagonal greater
to determine device is tablet or mobile i use criteria if device s screens diagonal is greater than 7 iches the device is tablet

often lower
this is because that tablet often has a lower density of screens pixels

always smaller
that hopefully explains why a typical 320dp phone screens is always smaller than a 720dp tablet screens although the smaller screens can have more pixel than the larger

higher actual
by contrast a nexus 7 tablet has higher actual screens resolution than an ipad mini but it reports to your web page a smaller screens size

more
it simply comes down to the space available a tablet gives more room to developers thus allowing developers to put more on one screens

smaller
this only happens when the window is on a computer in full screens mode but when the screens is made smaller to a phone tablet size the divs function how they should

size much smaller
splitactionbar works only on phones because the screens size is much smaller than tablet and it takes space at the bottom for extra space for your action items

bigger
this tablet has a bigger screens yet is still showing only 2 child views in the row

smaller
twitter desktop accomodates screensizes from around 1048px wide when you are on a screens that is smaller then that you are probably on a tablet or smartphone and if you open twitter from a browser on your phone you are instantly redirected to and prompted to download the twitter app

less
on a tablet or phone which may have less than 750px screens width it will go off the viewport

size reasonable bigger
having different ones based upon screens size is reasonable bigger margins on tablet though the mix then would be something like res values dimens.xml and res values-sw720dp values.xml

smaller
based on my understanding i hope that is because the size of the tablet screens which is smaller than the desktop that makes the strokes to get hidden inside the area that was not visible on the tablet however the area is visible in desktop

higher resolution
i can t use screens size because of devices like galaxy note with huge screens and some phones have higher resolution than some tablet same with dpi i think

width larger
in my actual code i ve set the display to none if the screens width is larger than tablet size because that s the only time i feel like i need the button

smaller
what i would like to do is use css media queries to have the title be above the tabs when the screens gets smaller or on a tablet or iphone

higher
i know that obviously a tablet has a higher screens resolution than a phone because it has more pixels dots on the screens from what ive been reading tablet also have a higher dpi dots per inch than phones as well

width smaller
this will only be added if the screens width is smaller than 480px else the tablet version would show the mobile version

much smaller
however the number of people using these giant tablet is much smaller than the number of people with small screens laptops

bigger
my aim is to use a bootstrap 3 dropdown to display links at mobile screens size and use a list to display the same links when the screens is bigger desktop and tablet size

more
i have been working on this page that works fine in desktop devices and tablet but not on phones because the width of the page is more than the screens width i need to make this width responsive to have the page with height-only scroll

higher
by contrast a nexus 7 tablet has higher actual screens resolution than an ipad mini but it reports to your web page a smaller screens size

size smaller
for example when the screens size becomes smaller to a tablet or mobile you could do this as an example

bigger
if the screens is bigger than 1024px it should be green my tablet screens is but the background stays yellow

more room
it simply comes down to the space available a tablet gives more room to developers thus allowing developers to put more on one screens

much smaller
the screens is much smaller so you can not present your app the same way as you can on a tablet

bigger desktop
my aim is to use a bootstrap 3 dropdown to display links at mobile screens size and use a list to display the same links when the screens is bigger desktop and tablet size

more
a tablet offers more screens space than a phone

larger
in my actual code i ve set the display to none if the screens width is larger than tablet size because that s the only time i feel like i need the button

you will also notice that the fonts are not scaling as the 7 tablet simply has more screens space available vs the 4 phone

smaller then

less full
as an example my android tablet s stock video player app has a feature that allows it to be less than full screens

often lower density
this is because that tablet often has a lower density of screens pixels

less
the issue is that the phone screens height in landscape mode is likely much less than a tablet or pc

higher
screens resolution i.e higher than tablet i.e col-md and col-lg in bootstrap language should only cover 11 grid with offset of 1

wider
when viewed on a screens wider than a tablet to be responsive according to the smaller screens size like this

smaller
splitactionbar works only on phones because the screens size is much smaller than tablet and it takes space at the bottom for extra space for your action items

size smaller
basically my layout has 1200px grid width but i figured that there will be a problem with 1024px screens resolution 20 of the population bla bla so i created media queries when the screens size is smaller than 1199px the grid to change its width to 960px and so on for tablet phones etc..

in practice i ve never had resource management issues with wxhaskell although i agree that it s possible and is an area handled better by gtk2hs which uses reference counting in the underlying library

first you can use double-quotes or q it just takes more work than single-quotes or q

tidier
another side note single-quotes inside xpath string looks a bit tidier than escaped double-quotes imo

closer
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

distribution far more
sometimes a linux distribution contains far more than an operating system but is informally referred to by a single name such as ubuntu and so the line between what the operating system is the linux kernel and standard libraries perhaps and the applications that merely ship with that operating system the gnome and kde environments on linux is pretty gray

things worse
also very particular that this should be done on centos or amazon linux which makes things worse for me as i have been on ubuntu for long

much easier
even if you re on linux it s much easier to get a precompiled version sudo apt install r-cran-rgl on ubuntu if you have the appropriate cran repositories set up

however less
linux however is less forgiving and has a filesystem that is case sensitive at least my dev ubuntu version does but i guess it is the default for linux

easier other
although if you aren t interested in using adobe cs you can use ubuntu distro which is easier than other linux distro and quiet popular so you won t have any problem finding solution

faster
i m testing some simple benchmarking calculations on win7 and linux ubuntu 16 to compare the timings and being wonder win appears to be much faster than linux

also i would recommend doing a dual boot to ubuntu it s much easier to work with opencl in a linux cli fashion

fuser -n
one one ubuntu distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another linux distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it

more familiar
i am new at a firm and i was given a project that was on amazon linux ami now we need to transfer project on another server and because i am more familiar with ubuntu than with amazon linux ami i was wondering if there much difference and will project work perfectly

simpler
see but if you are using a linux distro there may be shortcut instructions that make it simpler under ubuntu for example there are shortcuts in

better
you can use alpine linux docker image it is very light and is better than both ubuntu and centos image to be used as the docker

though it s unrelated to your actual question des is generally slower than aes at least in software so unless you really need to keep the key small aes is almost certainly a better choice

slower
des turned out to be even slower than aes but for my current requirements a much simpler algorythm rc4 is sufficient

less vulnerable
which steps of aes encryption makes it less vulnerable than des

less secure
edit 3des is better than des in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than aes but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than aes des or twofish because you re essentially applying des three times

encryption less vulnerable
which steps of aes encryption makes it less vulnerable than des

faster result
aes will indeed yield a considerably faster result than des

encryption more secure
i ve read that aes encryption is more secure than the triple des encryption ms is using in their example above

slower
though it s unrelated to your actual question des is generally slower than aes at least in software so unless you really need to keep the key small aes is almost certainly a better choice

faster
if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications

larger triple
note that the effective key size of aes is larger than triple des

faster
using des assuming it s a little faster than aes and requires a smaller key and

more power
turns out this was a hardware failure the aes commands need more power than the des crypto1 ones 50 more which the antenna failed to deliver at the reading range i was testing with

faster
aes can be even much faster than des or 3des when the cpu supports aes-ni

encryption more
i ve read that aes encryption is more secure than the triple des encryption ms is using in their example above

more secure
also see why aes is more secure than des

faster
because bellman-ford runs in time o mn the overall asymptotic runtime is still o mn + n 2 log n so if m o n 2 note that this is little-o of n this approach is asymptotically faster than using floyd-warshall

less worker
if you want to batch and parfor at the same time open one less worker with matlabpool than you otherwise would

more flexible
the first thought is that you could build a uiview showing image and text then attach a uitapgesturerecognizer to it which would be more flexible than uibutton

i mostly work with esri software though i ve had a little bit of work with mapguide mostly for clients whose engineering departments are using cad more than arcmap

larger
if i set a pixmap to a qgraphicsscene that is larger that the window it will add scrollbars so is it possible to get what is displayed in the qgraphicsview

better connection
generaly qgraphicsscene better using with connection qgraphicsview

larger
by default when you scale a qgraphicsscene larger than the qgraphicsview in which it is displayed it will show the necessary scroll bars

always less
when i generate rsa key pairs by openssl it seems like private key private exponent is always less than public key modulo

shorter
the rsa private exponent may actually be shorter than the modulo

longer
the private exponent must not be longer than the modulo

normally shorter
little wonder you get errors the exponent is normally shorter than the modulo which is always the same size as the key size

better
so no choice of the public exponent for this modulo is better than 19 using the public exponent to decrypt will work for at least half of the messages when e√¢¬≤ 9 16 and in many cases for almost all the messages when e√¢¬≤ 1 16

value faster
using the pow function and passing a modulo value is faster than computing the full exponent and then taking the modulo because the modulo can be applied to the partial products at each stage of the calculation which stops the value from getting too large 10 6 to the power of 10 6 has 6 million decimal digits with a modulo applied at each step the values never have to grow larger than the size of the modulo - about 13 digits in this example

shorter
i must also add that designing the rsa key so that the private exponent is substantially shorter than the modulo to speed up operations is a security risk if the exponent is smaller than 29 of the modulo length then the key can be cracked

smaller
in rsa signing a message m means exponentiation with the private exponent d the result r is the smallest integer 0 and smaller than the modulo n so that

smaller
i must also add that designing the rsa key so that the private exponent is substantially shorter than the modulo to speed up operations is a security risk if the exponent is smaller than 29 of the modulo length then the key can be cracked

substantially shorter
i must also add that designing the rsa key so that the private exponent is substantially shorter than the modulo to speed up operations is a security risk if the exponent is smaller than 29 of the modulo length then the key can be cracked

shorter
little wonder you get errors the exponent is normally shorter than the modulo which is always the same size as the key size

always smaller
the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt it using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero

smaller
the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt it using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero

lower
1024 bit private exponent large number lower than the modulo

smaller
edit as gregs points out in the comments you cannot be sure that the private exponent of the key you want to encrypt is smaller than the modulo of the key you want to use to encrypt with

higher precedence
of course multiplication has higher precedence binds more tightly than addition

faster
instead of computing the slower it instead computed x + x because addition is faster than multiplication

higher
and the value of this expression evaluated according to the precedence rules is 62 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

more expensive
multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

higher precedence
mathematics clearly defines the order of operations as giving multiplication higher precedence than addition

tighter
remember that multiplication even with strings binds tighter than addition so we must use brackets

higher precedence
you expression is then 7 + 5 7 + 5 which is 7 + 35 + 5 as multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

higher precedence
associativity and precedence specify that the last two statements must be performed in that order since multiplication has higher precedence than addition

higher
i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

cheaper
addition is cheaper than multiplication

faster
i would also be moderately surprised if the multiplication actually was faster than the addition

higher precedence
you probably already remember that multiplication is higher precedence than addition

higher precedence
for instance in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition

more
though i was thinking the addition is more simple than multiplication

higher
an expression like binds as not because of associativity but because 2 multiplication has higher precedence that + 2 addition

more
each operation takes a specific length and typically multiplication will take more than addition

slower
yes pow is slower than multiplication multiplication is slower than addition

this is valid under normal arithmetic operator precedence rules because multiplication has higher precedence than addition +

stronger
the reason for this is that and is strong than or it s like in math where multiplication is stronger than addition 3 5+3 15+3 18

this line works because of operator precedence multiplication has a higher precedence than addition + so it will be done first

higher
trig functions should have precedence lower than multiplication and higher than addition

higher
the precedence relationship is the same multiplication is higher then addition

higher precedence
i assume that is parsed correctly because the two operators have different precedences meaning that associativity does not come into play and that your grammar correctly implements precedence although you should note that is a more standard example for showing that multiplication has higher precedence than addition since simple left-to-right parsing of gives the same result as your parser

truly faster
if the multiplication is truly faster than the addition then i expect somebody well-versed in byte code could explain why the load_fast for num is faster than the five operations for line 12

more tightly
the multiplication has higher precedence and therefore binds more tightly than addition

harder
multiplication is much harder than addition

higher
for example 1 + 2 3 is treated as 1 + 2 3 whereas 1 2 + 3 is treated as 1 2 + 3 since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition +

operator higher
well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first

tighter
m_expr can expand to a u_expr because unaries bind tighter than multiplication operations and a_expr can expand to a m_expr because multiplication operations bind tighter than addition operations

lower precedence
of course it is 10 because the addition operator has a lower precedence than the multiplication operator and so 4 + 3 2 always means 4 + 3 2

higher
just because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition doesn t mean we need to perform all multiplication in the expression before doing any addition

higher
multiplication is higher precedence than addition and addition is left-associative so this is equivalent to but knowing that only tells you that the first addition will happen before the second addition and that the multiplication will happen before the second addition

slower
if we look at the speed of operations multiplication is not drastically slower than addition

higher priority
based on the order of operations e.g where multiplication is evaluated with higher priority than addition push the operators and operands onto a stack

more time
not sure about this but multiplication should take more time than addition so it s slowing it down ex

higher precedence
that s because the multiplication oprator has higher precedence than addition

higher
for example multiplication is of higher precedence than addition so 2 + 3 x 4 is equivalent to 2 + 3 x 4 not 2 + 3 x 4

higher
of course multiplication has higher precedence binds more tightly than addition

higher operator

higher
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas

operation more trivial
i know that addition operation is more trivial than multiplication operation

slower
if multiplication is slower than addition instead of doing

longer
the multiplication are the bottleneck of the calculation even though they may be one instruction a multiplication takes longer than an addition

more overhead simple
as multiplication of ints has more overhead than simple addition

higher precedence
just like it would be possible to come up with arithmetic expressions that could be written with less parentheses if addition had a higher precedence than multiplication

much more expensive
also remember multiplication is much more expensive than addition

lower precedence
that is if you have then you are guaranteed that a happens before b and that b happens before c regardless of the fact that a is involved in an addition which is lower precedence than a multiplication

higher precedence
for example 1 + 2 3 is treated as 1 + 2 3 whereas 1 2 + 3 is treated as 1 2 + 3 since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

higher precedence
so in your case an expression like 3+2 5 would yield 25 instead of 13 because addition is of higher precedence than multiplication

faster
in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

higher
for example multiplication is of higher precedence than addition so 2 + 3 x 4 is equivalent to 2 + 3 x 4 not 2 + 3 x 4

operator higher
for example in the expression 1 + 5 3 the answer is 16 and not 18 because the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition + operator

higher precedence
division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

easier
if memory serves this is the same technique slide rules used although they also took advantage of with the idea being that addition is easier than multiplication but my exposure to slide rules is limited to an eccentric high school physics teacher and a cryptographic teacher using it to explain certain tricks with big number math

higher precedence
for example in the expression 1 + 5 3 the answer is 16 and not 18 because the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition + operator

more time
it is well-known that the processor instruction for multiplication takes several times more time than addition division is even worse upd which is not true any more see below

it is because multiplication operator has higher precedence over the addition + operator

slower
multiplication is a relatively complex operation and is likely to be slower than say addition or comparison

not more difficult
multiplication is not more difficult than repeated addition

higher
multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction

more expensive
since multiplication is more expensive than addition you want to let the machine paralleliz it as much as possible so saving your stalls for the addition means you spend less time waiting in the addition loop than you would in the multiplication loop

in any case if addition is faster than multiplication a better solution might be to use a table and index by it

higher
note that the type cast has a higher precedence than multiplication which is in turn higher than addition 3 vs

this is done on an extremely large image and i feel vips might do a better job than opencv on this

you will probably find that bitvector performs a good deal better than bitarray

better
you can also try using innodb since it s said is better than myisam handling bulk inserts with data already on it

more
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

better
i heard correct me if i am wrong that innodb is better for tables that will be updated a lot because of row locking opposed to myisam s table locking

faster
myisam is still widely used in web applications as it has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads

faster
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb

better
therefore innodb can handle higher levels of concurrency better than myisam

more
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

higher throughput
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns

faster
i am creating an commerce website and i am stuck in a database problem i am storing customer orders please tell me which is better myisam or innodb i have to use transaction like feature in customer order table and i personally prefer myisam because it is much faster than innodb and it also supports full-text searching is there any way to use transaction like rollback feature in myisam so that if anything goes wrong table will be rollback to its previous state how to do that without any external library or any other server side access and i have to use mysql

more strict
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

slower
generally speaking innodb is slower than myisam as innodb is atomic while myisam is not

more
innodb is also being developed more than myisam

less suitable
plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb

faster
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

better
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering

better
mostly innodb is better choice than a myisam

better read
myisam delivers better read performance compared to innodb at the cost of being less acid compliant

faster
edited to add myisam is faster than innodb because it is simpler

slower
i have been told innodb is faster on executing writes but slower than myisam doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research

better
oracle has kept improving innodb by so much that they declare that it is better than myisam in virtually all situations

newer
innodb is newer while myisam is older

faster
speed does matter here myisam is still slightly faster than innodb especially for reads

more complex
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

more strict
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

more
and now i have learned that innodb uses more memory at-least while reading than myisam engine so i am trying to change the default engine of mysql to use myisam

much faster
if you have so many records in the table then the first thing is to change the table engine to innodb if its not innodb because for large number of records innodb is much faster as it caches the table data while on the contrary myisam engine only caches the indexes so each time it has to do a full table scan from disk if the data required cannot be fetched from index

stricter
innodb is much much stricter than myisam

faster
i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it

more performant
not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma

much better
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam

slightly faster
myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

more
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

more reliable
innodb is more reliable than myisam

engine more efficient
it is possible that the config of your innodb engine is more efficient for your searches than the way you have myisam set up

better
myisam is better for high read volumes innodb for high update volumes due to table vs row locking

much better
generally innodb is much better for preserving your data integrity so stick with it and do not go back to myisam there is also a matter of what each engine is best fore but unless you give us more details there is no point in dwelling on that

often slower
innodb is often slower than myisam being a transactional db engine with acid properties

actually better
myisam is actually better than innodb for spatial data btw because it also supports r-tree spatial indexes but not as powerful queries as postgis. if you just need points though innodb or myisam b-trees are adequate

slower
in innodb the count s when where group by or join is not used execute slower than in myisam because the row count is not stored internally

longer
so that means that in practice an innodb write will take 3 times longer than a myisam write

slower
innodb is slower than myisam but in which cases

better
in many discussions and even in mysql documents it has been mentioned that in case of updates innodb performs much better than myisam

slower
innodb does support transactions and referential integrity but the trade-off is that it is a bit slower than myisam

better
if your database has a large innodb buffer pool and a small key buffer then innodb performance is going to be better than myisam performance especially for large tables

better
sometimes i got asked on some interviews what benefits does innodb have against myisam and when myisam is better than innodb

newer
innodb is newer while myisam is older

less memory
myisam uses less memory than innodb and the actual data files are often quite a bit larger for innodb

more susceptible
myisam is more susceptible to data corruption than innodb and usually innodb performs better because it caches both data and indexes

faster
i did a search online comparing myisam and innodb but all of the articles i read judged myisam being faster than innodb on select queries

slower
why is innodb so much slower than myisam in my case

more
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

better crash
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

more optimization
3 a first of all if you haven t done yet change the storage engine to innodb which has row level locking and in newer versions of mysql has more optimization than myisam has

faster
some people have said that for reads myisam is faster but recent improvements in innodb have either alleviated or eradicated this difference

better choice
innodb is a better choice as myisam is really old engine and would fade away in near future

better
as you are no doubt aware from your searches innodb is primarily better than myisam for high volume inserts not counting non-comparable features like foreign keys or full text searches which are exclusive to innodb and myisam respectively while myisam is primarily useful for tables which are read more often than they are written to

faster
use myisam usually much faster than innodb if your data base isnt transaction oriented

better
innodb is a better choice as myisam is really old engine and would fade away in near future

slower
innodb table is a bit slower than myisam tables but i don t think it is a major problem as you told you are using drupal system is that a kind of mult-sites like a word-press system

longer
one thing is that if your inserts are not in the order of increasing primary keys innodb can take a bit longer than myisam

better crash
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

much faster
in general it seems as though the concensus is to primarily use innodb but there are still some areas in which myisam is much faster than innodb

older mysql
the lone exception is myisam which is an older mysql storage engine which does not support transactions is more prone to corruption and generally tends to perform worse than innodb

more resistant
innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam

more strict
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as

more complex
innodb provides more complex keys structure than myisam foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in innodb

better
innodb supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets

more memory
and now i have learned that innodb uses more memory at-least while reading than myisam engine so i am trying to change the default engine of mysql to use myisam

better
myisam is better than innodb when you don t need those advanced features and storage speed is more important than other concerns

infinitely more
there are some situations when myisam is infinitely more efficient than innodb when manipulating large data dumps offline because of table lock

slower
innodb tables are even slower than myisam tables for inserts and the delayed key write option is not available

slower
i am trying to compare the myisam and innodb write read performance but i am suprised that the myisam s read is much more slower than innodb while its write is much more faster this is totally opposite compared to what i have learned

faster
in general it seems as though the concensus is to primarily use innodb but there are still some areas in which myisam is much faster than innodb

faster
the trope about myisam being faster than innodb is a holdover from code that was current in the mid-2000 s

more
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs

more
myisam is more susceptible to data corruption than innodb and usually innodb performs better because it caches both data and indexes

much slower
if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully

better
myisam is actually better than innodb for spatial data btw because it also supports r-tree spatial indexes but not as powerful queries as postgis. if you just need points though innodb or myisam b-trees are adequate

bigger
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts

sometimes better
this is one way in which innodb is sometimes better than myisam

slower
i know innodb tends to be a bit slower than myisam on counting but this is far too long

faster
in general is myisam faster than innodb

better
almost always innodb is a better choice than myisam

faster
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

worse
the lone exception is myisam which is an older mysql storage engine which does not support transactions is more prone to corruption and generally tends to perform worse than innodb

slower
innodb is often slower than myisam being a transactional db engine with acid properties

better performance
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

faster
also note that some mysql engines are faster than others for example myisam may run faster than innodb at expense of the lack of real foreign keys

heavier
i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more

quicker
innodb handles inserts with composite primary keys quicker than myisam

more complex
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

primarily better
as you are no doubt aware from your searches innodb is primarily better than myisam for high volume inserts not counting non-comparable features like foreign keys or full text searches which are exclusive to innodb and myisam respectively while myisam is primarily useful for tables which are read more often than they are written to

usually more sensible
for an oltp type system innodb is usually more sensible than myisam did you check the contention before trying a different engine

faster
have you considered changing to innodb - it has much better concurrency support and in some contexts will run faster than myisam

better
innodb is usually much better than myisam at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because innodb uses row level locking for updates whereas myisam uses table level locking

faster
the engine is myisam i ve heard people recommend switching to innodb but many others said myisam is faster with large amounts of data in terms of counting and innodb better for safe transactions

faster
in a thread i came to know that myisam is faster for reads innodb is faster for writes

better
it is said that if you have a mostly read based application you should use myisam as it is better than innodb

better
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

better
but when myisam is really better than innodb

safer acid
innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks

often faster
myisam is often faster than innodb in terms of raw performance mostly because it is not acid

slower
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out

better
innodb when tuned well performs better than myisam

faster
the script was tested using myisam and it indexes products relatively fast much much faster than innodb

more
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

more complex
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

more
innodb is more reliable than myisam

much faster
note however that for high traffic websites we do modify the joomla core and we also switch the tables from innodb to myisam regardless what others might think here myisam is much faster than innodb

safer
innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks

relatively newer
innodb is relatively newer than myisam and is transaction safe

more disk
innodb consumes more disk space than myisam -- typically 2x-3x

better
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

older
the lone exception is myisam which is an older mysql storage engine which does not support transactions is more prone to corruption and generally tends to perform worse than innodb

longer
one thing is that if your inserts are not in the order of increasing primary keys innodb can take a bit longer than myisam

better crash
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering

faster
myisam has historically been viewed as faster than innodb but for recent versions of innodb that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases

faster
myisam is faster when the query is simple but it s much slower in a high concurrent environment as its table level lock comparing to innodb s row level lock

larger
put another way let s say i start with a new innodb table and insert 20 gb of data assuming that 20 gb incorporates all the excess innodb stuff i realize data stored in innodb is larger than myisam then i delete all data then i insert 10 gb of data

faster
there is a difference between the different storage engines though myisam is faster for a lot of select innodb is faster for a lot of insert update because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes

better engine
tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe default

more sensible
for an oltp type system innodb is usually more sensible than myisam did you check the contention before trying a different engine

better
furthermore i do not have control over the engine √¢ myisam or innodb innodb performs better due to row based locking instead of table as in case of myisam

better
since you don t do updates i think myisam would be better than innodb in this scenario

safer
nothing is 100 safe but innodb properly used is a lot safer than myisam against data loss and corruption

better
newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly

newer
innodb is relatively newer than myisam and is transaction safe

much slower 7x
first question is it normal that innodb is much slower 7x slower than myisam for such usage

less resources
therefore accessing myisam consumes less resources than innodb

more complex
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

less
with innodb there is less time lost from table locking while myisam is faster in table readings

better
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

faster
database performance of the innodb is not necessary faster than the myisam engine

more
innodb is affected by the primary key much more than myisam and it could make a noticeable difference

better choice
almost always innodb is a better choice than myisam

less space
myisam also tends to store data in less space than innodb

more complex
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

faster
in my opinion myisam use to be faster than innodb now they are pretty much the same in speed

faster
myisam table is much faster than innodb but no rollback is possible

faster
myisam has historically been viewed as faster than innodb but for recent versions of innodb that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases

slower
innodb is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than myisam

more
myisam is more prone to locking problems than innodb i believe

faster
out of experience i m involved to a project that uses huge amount of data using mysql and we mostly prefer myisam for data that can be generated it allows to achieve much higher performance losing transactions but generally speaking myisam is faster but innodb is more reliable

slower
oh and just incase you were thinking innodb is slower than myisam - the myisam implementation i tested was twice as slow in all counts

more
innodb is more concurrent than myisam since it provides row-level locking

faster
i ve figure out that even though myisam has locking contention it s still faster than innodb in most scenarios because of the rapid lock acquisition scheme it uses

better
innodb scales better than myisam

more
innodb provides more complex keys structure than myisam foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in innodb

slower
there are several q a for why is innodb much slower than myisam but i could not find any topic for the opposite

more resistant
innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam

faster
after testing it seems that myisam is faster than innodb when using when there is no where clause

better choice
innodb would be a better choice than myisam for a high-write table

2x faster then
select queries in myisam runs 2x faster then in innodb but the updates and insert queries are much slower in myisam

less time
with innodb there is less time lost from table locking while myisam is faster in table readings

faster
now the response i got from my boss is that i need to prove that innodb will run faster than myisam

slower
generally you can have as good performance for reading as in myisam in innodb tables - you just can use count without where clause and you always should have a suitable index for where clauses as in innodb table scan will be slower than in myisam

better
you insert in there but never select from there as far as i know today myisam is better than innodb in this case

slower
innodb shouldn t be much slower than myisam

more
innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam

better performance
i currently have myisam and i would like to stay with it because it had far better performance than innodb in my case but i heard that innodb has acid transactions

better
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

more overhead
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs

more
innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam

more
innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam

faster
you are right because myisam is really faster than innodb

better choice
so for such an application is it will innodb be a better choice over myisam

better crash
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

more
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as

slower
after all innodb shouldn t be slower than myisam when using count + where but that s exactly what is happening here

2x faster
select queries in myisam runs 2x faster then in innodb but the updates and insert queries are much slower in myisam

more resistant
innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam

faster
yes it is an old wives tale that myisam is faster than innodb

higher performance
their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average

more
not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma

newer
innodb is newer while myisam is older

really better
but when myisam is really better than innodb

better
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb

more complex
innodb implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with myisam

faster
innodb not only has the advantages you list but it is also faster than myisam in many benchmarks

faster
myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth

less archived
you will need about six times less disk space to store and memory to process your dataset compared to innodb or about 2-3 times less than archived myisam

slower
edit for the read-performance this link shows that innodb often is actually not slower than myisam

better crash
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

faster
if you are not using transactions while storing or updating tables switch table type to myisam its quite faster than innodb with much less overhead

table much faster
myisam table is much faster than innodb but no rollback is possible

better
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

better
since myisam is better on selecting while innodb is better on writing

more
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

higher
innodb has a higher resource consumption rates then myisam so keep that in mind

higher throughput
innodb delivered 4.6x higher throughput than myisam while achieving

slower
to answer the real question why is myisam slower than innodb i can t give an authoritative answer

engine more
it is possible that the config of your innodb engine is more efficient for your searches than the way you have myisam set up

slower
at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam

more
to our suprise innodb took hours more than myisam

better
1 in mysql engines myisam is better or innodb

more
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

less
therefore accessing myisam consumes less resources than innodb

faster
myisam inserts are going to be faster than innodb so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win

faster
myisam for reads may well be faster than innodb

better
in fact oracle is so sure that innodb is better that they removed myisam from 8.0

actually faster
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

faster
myisam is still widely used in web applications as it has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads

better due
furthermore i do not have control over the engine √¢ myisam or innodb innodb performs better due to row based locking instead of table as in case of myisam

higher resource
innodb has a higher resource consumption rates then myisam so keep that in mind

more
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

not faster
myisam is not faster than innodb anymore for most types of queries

faster
if there are many modifications of the data it s said that innodb works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like myisam

much better
in many discussions and even in mysql documents it has been mentioned that in case of updates innodb performs much better than myisam

more strict
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

significantly faster
myisam is the perfect choice since the database is almost only used for reading and myisam is significantly faster that innodb

much faster
myisam is much faster for reads but since it locks the whole table for writes this is where overall throughput drops compared with innodb

newer
innodb is newer while myisam is older

better
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam

more strict
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

faster
in some benchmarks i see that myisam is faster than innodb but seems i have a little improvement

faster
myisam has proved to be faster than innodb for me

faster
beststat is innodb so i have row-level locking and consindering i do a lot of inserts-updates it should be faster than myisam

often faster
myisam is often faster than innodb but isn t safe to use in a production environment for critical data

slower
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select

faster
myisam is almost 4 time faster than innodb which is not acceptable in the environment we are working as i mentioned earlier that every second is worth many dollers for us

better
this is one way in which innodb is sometimes better than myisam

better
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

more effecient
innodb -- more effecient than myisam because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in innodb

faster
but innodb has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today innodb performs faster than myisam

more
innodb consumes more disk space than myisam -- typically 2x-3x

slower
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam

much more quicker
this is a huge performance boost look like myisam is much more quicker for fulltext in mysql than innodb

better
i have heard that myisam performs better than innodb on read-oriented tables

more efficient
there are some situations when myisam is infinitely more efficient than innodb when manipulating large data dumps offline because of table lock

more complex
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

better
tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe default

slower
if you use a where clause though it changes the execution pattern to use indexes so in general innodb will be slower than myisam on full unrestricted counts where as the performance matches up on restricted counts

faster
i have been told innodb is faster on executing writes but slower than myisam doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research

more
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

better
your table sounds fairly large so i doubt it s being held entirely in memory but it sounds like innodb handles indexes better than myisam anyway plus since you re being so specific it may be caching the result of the query

slightly faster
innodb seems slightly faster than myisam but this is really marginal

faster
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

faster
note however that for high traffic websites we do modify the joomla core and we also switch the tables from innodb to myisam regardless what others might think here myisam is much faster than innodb

faster
innodb seems slightly faster than myisam but this is really marginal

generally less
plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb

less
myisam uses less memory than innodb and the actual data files are often quite a bit larger for innodb

more scalable
innodb is more scalable and myisam doesn t support any of the properties of acid

smaller same
as you know myisam table sizes are about three or more times smaller than same innodb tables

generally faster
myisam generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions innodb has such as rollback... but it has only table locking

higher
their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average

more
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

better choice
mostly innodb is better choice than a myisam

better job
in this area i think innodb s change buffer does a better job than myisam s do it now

faster
even this blog from 2007 shows benchmark results that innodb is on par with or faster than myisam under most workloads

faster
in terms of pure speed it is not always the case that myisam is faster than innodb but in my experience it tends to be faster for pure read working environments by a factor of about 2.0-2.5 times

faster
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries

much more
this is a huge performance boost look like myisam is much more quicker for fulltext in mysql than innodb

faster
also mysql version starting from 5.5 - innodb performs faster than myisam

generally less suitable
plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb

indexes better
your table sounds fairly large so i doubt it s being held entirely in memory but it sounds like innodb handles indexes better than myisam anyway plus since you re being so specific it may be caching the result of the query

really faster
you are right because myisam is really faster than innodb

better
finally even if somehow you could manage myisam to perform better than innodb that doesn t mean innodb is inadecuate at all

faster
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

more strict
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

quicker
there are other optimizations available but general rule is that innodb will be quicker than myisam is even with table growth

smaller footprints
myisam tables have smaller footprints than innodb ones myth

faster
myisam is faster for certain queries and supports fulltext and spatial indexes while innodb is transactional and more concurrent

better
myisam delivers better read performance compared to innodb at the cost of being less acid compliant

marginally better
there may be some exotic corner cases where myisam performs marginally better for certain workloads table-scans or high-volume insert-only work but the default choice should be innodb unless you can prove you have a case that myisam does better

more space
myisam is more space friendly than innodb you can start with that one

more
innodb is more scalable and myisam doesn t support any of the properties of acid

better crash
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

faster
myisam is faster but does not support the use of transactions like innodb does

better
innodb uses row level locking while myisam can only use table level locking that is why innodb has crash revovery is better than myisam

much slower
first question is it normal that innodb is much slower 7x slower than myisam for such usage

usually more
for an oltp type system innodb is usually more sensible than myisam did you check the contention before trying a different engine

slower
first question is it normal that innodb is much slower 7x slower than myisam for such usage

innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

newer
innodb is newer while myisam is older

better
also i can t see your table engine but myisam is better for full text searching rather than innodb

better
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam

more
innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam

slower
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism

longer
myisam supports longer rows than innodb does

more
myisam is more space friendly than innodb you can start with that one

slower
this also affects how it is stored which leads to myisam being slower than innodb on insert due to myisam requiring a full index re-write on every insertion

more prone
myisam is more prone to locking problems than innodb i believe

better
you can also use compression on the tables to keep them smaller but innodb is vastly better than myisam at data integrity

faster
2 - i have read about myisam vs innodb the conclusion for me was that myisam is faster when it comes to read-only whereas innodb is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently

faster
myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

longer
although 4m isn t that many rows with contention and depending on your structure and database engine it may take a while i think myisam alters take longer than innodb because myisam requires whole table locks and handles concurrency less well

better faster
most of the literature that says myisam is better faster whatever then innodb is old literature

newer
innodb is newer while myisam is older

longer rows
myisam supports longer rows than innodb does

infinitely more efficient
there are some situations when myisam is infinitely more efficient than innodb when manipulating large data dumps offline because of table lock

slower
during my tests of innodb v myisam i found that when i did resolve any contention issues the innodb model was 40 slower than myisam

faster
we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts

vastly better
you can also use compression on the tables to keep them smaller but innodb is vastly better than myisam at data integrity

more concurrent
innodb is more concurrent than myisam since it provides row-level locking

faster
myisam is not faster than innodb anymore for most types of queries

better
most of the literature that says myisam is better faster whatever then innodb is old literature

better
but in certain scenarios myisam works better than innodb

also more complex
pbkdf2 also uses a more complex construction in particular hmac over direct digest to make recovering the input password from an output value more difficult

also more
pbkdf2 also uses a more complex construction in particular hmac over direct digest to make recovering the input password from an output value more difficult

a solution i ve used is a simple subclass of uicontrol which allows more customization than subclassing uibutton and less hassle than nsattributedstring et al

finer control
sounds like you want to use some of the inherited uicontrol methods such as sendaction to forevent this offers even finer control than with uibutton

more customization
a solution i ve used is a simple subclass of uicontrol which allows more customization than subclassing uibutton and less hassle than nsattributedstring et al

cleaner
instead of working around the 1 label and image you get in a uibutton it s cleaner to start from scratch with a uicontrol and create your tiles

simpler
using throw new runtimeexception e is simpler to comprehend than throwables.propagate in the scenario where you want to throw an unchecked-exception wrapping a checked exception

lighter
since cakephp seems to be much lighter than zend-framework i would suggest that you take a look at cakephp

more broken
notepad++ which is often recommended are even more broken than sublimetext 2 which i find to be pretty good actually

more customizable
i prefer sublimetext because it s a little more customizable than notepad++ but they re both great options and lighter than dreamweaver

richer
scalacheck s api is also a bit richer than quickcheck s api

slower
for my webapp the integrated visual studio server cassini ist much slower than iis

better performance
while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio

better
cassini was much better than iis express but doesn t properly support the integrated pipeline

slower
what could be the reason that makes iis slower than cassini

server better
from this question i found out that iis server is better than cassini for my purpose but i don t know how to check the default server of my website

much more
what i would suggest is to make sure you are using visual studio 2010 sp1 then install iis express which is an upgrade to cassini and is much more like real iis and then switch your project to use iis express and see if you get the same exception

better
iis express is a web server albeit better than cassini iis express is not your problem

from this question i found out that iis server is better than cassini for my purpose but i don t know how to check the default server of my website

iterate over the primes already found which are less than the square-root of p

narrower functionality
the situation is critical if on some platform libtiff provides a narrower functionality and does not link to libjpeg which will not be available on that platform at all so the above command for linking will fail due to unsatisfied library dependency

con you can encounter issues related to library versions and dependencies macports has more software than homebrew

less
homebrew has less of a stranglehold on your machine doesn t require as much reading as macports

nicer
homebrew is generally a bit nicer than macports as it doesn t require lots of sudo action

luckier
it may be that macports doesn t help i have been luckier with homebrew than macports when installing cgal

the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content

more suitable
this is my first experience setting up lighttpd as i thought it would be more suitable than apache in this case

faster
- if you move towards more static content or go the fastcgi way lighttpd is faster than apache

less ram
nginx or lighttpd in fastcgi mode use less ram than apache and they can handle more concurrent connections

more powerful

it may even use a different server software say nginx or lighttpd that has less overhead than the traditional apache setup

less overhead
it may even use a different server software say nginx or lighttpd that has less overhead than the traditional apache setup

fewer resources
since you ve switched to lighttpd the webserver itself is going to use fewer resources than apache would but apache is rarely the bottleneck unless you ve run out of ram or seriously misconfigured it

even faster
for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache

better option
first of all if it was not for the relative complexity of the expressions here scipy would have been definitely the better option over sympy

4px larger
do i just create a new uiview that is 4px larger than the selected object and and make the selected view a subviews of it

taller
the uiview is taller than the screen so in ib i pulled it out of the scroll view so i could see it all but i never moved it back to being a subviews of the scroll view

smaller frame
i want to add a uiview of smaller frame as subviews to parental view but i am not getting the needed

smaller
because the uiview is smaller it is going to crop out the larger subviews

more
change the contentsize of your scrollview.your uiview size and uiscrollview size is same if the uiscrollview contentsize is more than its subviews size then scroll will happen change the line overviewscroll setcontentsize cgsizemake screenframe.size.width screenframe.size.height-25

more
of course uiscrollview can have more than one content view just as any uiview can have more than one subviews and this case it will be more difficult to render its layer

less
the issue is that once the alpha of the uiview is less than 1.0 i can see all the subviews sides and the one that gets me the most is the outline of an uiimageview can be seen that would otherwise not as it is the same colour as the uiview

more memory
you are seeing a noticeable jump in interface response because subviews do in fact consume quite a bit of memory uiview are very expensive compared to their underlying calayers and as such calling -removesubview not only unloads stress from the gpu but also frees up more memory as the subviews is usually released afterwards

version definitely faster
the subviews version is definitely faster since having the controls loose on the uiview took more like 2 seconds to update

bigger
when using embed in - uiview the new view will be a bit bigger than the subviews

smaller
though earlier uiview and uiscrollview have the same area after keyboard shown the blue uiview becomes smaller but its subviews button text fields is outside its area

more flexible
pytables seems more flexible but i am unclear about what the most direct way of using it to save a full pandas dataframe with multiindex and all

more
pytables seems more flexible but i am unclear about what the most direct way of using it to save a full pandas dataframe with multiindex and all

more
does that mean the the view controller has multiple uiview or that the uiview has more than one calayer

even more
in fact each uiview has even more than 1 corresponding calayer

more
a uiview is no more than a wrapper for an underlying calayer

lighter
this is better than using a second view a bit larger as a calayer is lighter than a uiview and you don t have do modify the frame of myview which is good for instance if myview is a uiimageview

lighter
i am using calayer s because as suggested in documentation calayer s are lighter than uiview and i have hundreds of them

smaller
i want to add a calayer inside an uiview and this calayer will be smaller than the uiview

worse performance
i noticed calayer had worse performance than uiview

more
a uiview is no more than a fancy wrapper for a calayer √¢ bringing uiresponder events animation conveniences among many other things

better
is calayer better than uiview in terms of performance

more
so the difference between the two is that if you assign affinity at the thread level you can assign them to more than one processors and spread the load more than with all threads assigned to one processors

type more usable
sometimes chars type is more usable than int - fixed size chars doesn t take much storage room and you can see enumerated values directly in database fields

better
some suggests storing it in int is better but other suggests tinyint and enum but some others suggests store it in a chars 1 m for male and f for female

smaller
if chars or short happen to be smaller than int on the current platform they are implicitly promoted to int which is a major source of bugs

lower rank
as chars has a lower rank than int it is promoted to int zero- or sign-extended

larger
first of all never send int s and other types larger than chars like that - you will ignore endianness and the recipient might be unable to interpret the data properly

less
while using chars there is probability of getting garbage value as it directly stores the chars but using int there is less probability of it as it stores the ascii value of the chars

smaller
so even as a chars is smaller than a 4-byte int you have to move them one-by-one into the register to do a comparison

less space
if all your int are small it might make sense to store all 5 values in a more appropriate type a chars which will use less space than an int

less
as long as the int is less than 127 then the chars is stored in one byte

higher
int has a higher type precedence than any of the n var chars types and so it tries to convert all of the strings to int s to see if they re 0

array lower
the chars array has a lower memory address than the int i variable

faster computation
there are many options for you like visser suggested you could convert the date time into a long int which allows faster computation or you can keep them as strings or even convert them into chars like what you have done with chars array2

less
then the multiplication part is the same for both variables the operands get promoted to int because the conversion rank of unsigned chars is less than the conversion rank of int and we end up with the equivalent of

greater range
this warning comes up because int typically has a greater range than chars and so some loss-of-information may occur

more bits
depending on what chars and int on your system are to not assume that int has more bits than chars your intermediate sums may be overflowing

more operations
naturally using chars would result in more operations than int

more
thus int is a more restrictive type than chars

always smaller
weren t the case a chars is always smaller than an int and will thus always fit inside an int so it can safely be promoted

more
well the int uses more slots since chars are usually only one byte

larger
wchar_t is just an int type which may be larger than chars

certainly larger
the size of an int is certainly larger than the size of a chars

smaller
this does implicitly at least sort of assume that chars has a smaller range than int so the conversion to int allows at least one value to be represented that couldn t have come from the file

less operations
plain chars having unspecified signed-ness allows compilers to select whichever representation is more efficient for the target architecture on some architectures zero extends a one-byte value to the size of int requires less operations thus making plain chars unsigned while on others the instruction set makes sign-extending more natural and plain chars gets implements as signed

more possible strings
with strings of 6 chars you already have more possible strings than int values log 2 32 log 69 5.23

much more
another thing is that chars 32 consumes much more space 32 bytes 256 bit where an int 10 only is 32 bit long

faster
does a unique index on an int column perform faster than a chars 5

promotions larger
if i remove the operator then the warning is always emitted and that is probably good as the result of the expression after int promotions is larger than unsigned chars

less
so that is a condition saying that p pretending to be a chars pointer needs to be less than 5 int lengths past the start of a pretending to be a chars pointer

larger unsigned
if i remove the operator then the warning is always emitted and that is probably good as the result of the expression after int promotions is larger than unsigned chars

longer
the code could probably be improved a bit by preventing expected being incremented with negative int values coming from random.nextint 1024 by using random.nextint 1024 instead of random.nextint 1024 but i assume no one ever ran into issues because no one uses a shutdown command longer than 1024 chars

conversion harder
the indices to int conversion is harder i need to split the index 4.5 get the number of chars in the 3rd sentence and add up 5

larger
please note that fgetc requires an int well something larger than a chars -- int is customary for its return value eof is a possible return value in addition to any of the values that chars might take

faster
int is faster for where queries from chars

more
if int is 4 bytes and represents 2 bytes the int consumes more memory than the chars -array so you are not initialising the full int -memory to 0 by setting all chars -variables

smaller
c language never performs arithmetic computations withing the domain of chars short or any other type that is smaller than int

number greater
when i add any alphabet in the int number or int number is greater than 4 chars in length the string match should fail but it is not failing

bigger domain
5 is an int which represents a bigger domain than chars

more usable
sometimes chars type is more usable than int - fixed size chars doesn t take much storage room and you can see enumerated values directly in database fields

less
so int that are less than 12 chars are just written normally

higher datatype
here int is higher datatype and chars is lower datatype.

array greater
first the chars array is greater than 8 bytes so we can t use it directly as a 64-bit int

better main
the designers of c thought int main int argv chars argv looked better than main int argv chars argv int

data faster
so i recommend use numbers whenever possible as operation of int data is faster than chars data

type more
usually the chars type has no more than 8 bits while int must have at least 16 bits so every unsigned chars will be representable as an int

easier
reading it into a chars buffer makes it easier to access those four bytes in the int

less
this means that as long as you verify that every java chars in your string is less than 128 int value you are going to get one byte per chars with utf-8

wider
moreover int must be wider than chars hence it can accommodate more than 8 flags which you re not gonna need

smaller
int and chars are numeric types and chars is guaranteed smaller than int therefore supplying a chars where an int is expected is safe so in a nutshell yes you can do that

less space
an even number of chars s followed by an int may well therefore take up less space than a chars followed by an int followed by an odd number of chars s

wider
on mainstream platforms int is wider than chars it has a size of at least 2

slower
so 250 chars long texts are certainly much slower than int ids

faster
if i had to assume a 1 byte chars is compared faster than a 4-byte int

shorter
it has one drawback but i believe it s ok with the question as it compute an int divider to make line shorter than 80 chars the longest line is shorter than 80 chars not exactly 80 chars

bigger
on my system int is bigger than chars and chars is -128 to 128 so assigning a chars with an int outside that range gives a compiler warning

wider
while shifting the types are automatically promoted to int which is wider than chars most often

comparison longer
for example for your case a string chars comparison takes longer to carry out in general considering the int boolean alternative

larger
assuming that utdc_samples is also an int type but larger than a chars then the assignment is fine

more
an int can be more than one chars

less
formally they re promoted to int on a usual machine where chars is less than int and then the arithmetic operation is performed

smaller
for instance on an architecture where the int are 4 bytes and must be 4 byte aligned an int pointer could be two bits smaller than a chars or void pointer

higher precedence
int has a higher precedence than chars so sql server cast - to int implicitly here

smaller
if chars is smaller then int usually it is so the structure mystructv1 can be smaller than mystructv2

simpler
for or int which sounds a simpler case and chars could have been both implemented as member operators or as non-member free operators

usually bigger
int is usually bigger than chars √¢ more suitable for calculations but not so suitable for byte-level manipulation

datatype more
indexing on int datatype gives you more performance than indexing on chars or varchar datatypes

more
if the same chars appears more than once i put a counter on it and place it back into the map incrementing the int frequency

more efficient
if so is there some correlation such as 40 digit double int is 50 more efficient as a uid than using 20 chars string

faster
however int and long were 1.21x faster than chars and short

type narrower
because unsigned chars type is narrower than as it requires fewer bytes int type - implicit type promotion performed by abstract machine compiler and value of variable c is promoted to int at the time of compilation before application of the complement operation

better paradigm
i know that using int is a better paradigm here but the value is a guid with a few chars appended to the front

smaller
i understand that a chars is a smaller size than an int

smaller
weren t the case a chars is always smaller than an int and will thus always fit inside an int so it can safely be promoted

more
this assumes that your int will never be more than 10 chars long

less
in which case the rank of unsigned chars woudl not be less than int and therefore the promotion would be to unsigned int

substantially less space
chars 1 takes substantially less space than an int

faster
working with int is faster than chars

bigger
since an int is bigger than a chars casting unsigned chars to signed int still retains the chars s original value

higher rank unsigned
and int has higher rank than unsigned chars

much wider
normally range of int is much wider than that of chars

better
to base and the meaning of main changes - it calls base f because int is a better match for chars - it s an int promotion rather than a standard conversion

larger
a longer string of int is larger otherwise compare chars in order

bigger
as indicated a standard ipv6 address is at most 45 chars but an ipv6 address can also include an ending followed by a scope or zone string which has no fixed length but is generally a small positive int or a network interface name so in reality it can be bigger than 45 chars

greater
the rank of long long int is greater than the rank of long int which is greater than the rank of int which is greater than the rank of short int which is greater than the rank of signed chars

bigger
int is bigger than chars but the result of your operation is typed int which you re then storing in a chars

less
do note that the size of a chars is less than an int so the conversion from a chars to int doesn t make you lose anything

faster
on most machines int is faster than short chars so there s not much to think about there

smaller
similarly if the score values don t need to be unsigned int make the array smaller by using chars or uint16_t

greater sizeof
this likely means that scanf is overwriting adjacent array elements since sizeof unsigned int is most likely greater than sizeof chars

more
regarding the last portion of your question the number of bits of int is always more than chars so it won t cause a problem

better
imho a chars 1 code is better than an int for employee types

larger
the real sha1 algorithm uses blocks larger than a single chars and state larger than an int but basically that s how it goes

smaller
since unicode is a 21-bit chars set it cannot return anything smaller than an int and it can be argued that technically it should be a long since an int could be a 16-bit quantity

more int_max
it s an int and you cannot print more than int_max chars that way

smaller
unsigned chars is smaller than int which means that fscanf overrides destroys some memory you don t own

more
for example if the string is going to store a decimal-formatted 32-bit int you know that you do not need more than 11 chars to do so

faster
is a search through numbers int faster than chars in an mysql database

less memory
for example if i declare and only use it in a way that it could have and should have been declared since chars uses less memory than int will gcc optimize that or does it not even matter since it will be converted to assembly

smaller
since 8b chars is smaller than 32b int the value is extended to 32b but the sign is preserved when calling printf

smaller
for instance a plain old c-array of 100 000 chars is smaller than the same 100 000 int by a factor of four but if during an enumeration reading out each index involves a cast boxing unboxing of sorts will we see overall lower performance despite the saved memory overhead

less storage
a chars 3 field also uses less storage than an int

less rank
it s stated in the standard that unsigned chars has less rank than int and with this the type of the switch condition will be int which further means

bigger
i know int can hold data up to 4 bytes much bigger than chars but what s the use of providing data types in c if we can use any of them

larger
i believe it was one of the early pdp machines in which a chars was larger than an int

vector bigger
it should at least output that the the preferred width of chars vector is bigger than the int vector

more memory
everyone know int needs aroud 4 times more memory than chars

larger
i am guessing that it happens because the size of int is larger than that of chars as such the memory controller the thing which controls memory in c -i don t know the technical term has to move a larger distance

more data
however an int can hold a lot more data than a chars can this is going to give you a warning about overflow and you should listen to it depending on the implementation chars holds -128 to 127 where as int holds √¢ÀÜ 2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647

lower rank
given 4.13 says chars has lower rank than int this means chars can be converted to int if needed but why is it needed

bigger
you could also get interesting results from getbit if the type of a is an int type bigger than chars and the values in the array have bits set outside the last least significant 8 bits of the number

lower
as chars has a lower rank than int it is promoted to int zero- or sign-extended

more space
int is bigger has more space than chars

smaller
original response in the first program you are trying to print a float but you pass an int chars is a smaller int

larger
the stack array must be an int as the pid can be larger than a chars variable can fit my pid was 25689

more
in java chars is a more specific type of int

higher precision
1 at least for 8-bit chars s signed chars s or int s with higher precision than chars so virtually always

main shorter
i see absolutely no reason to write it like this since int main is shorter 9 non white-space chars vs 15 concise and perfectly valid code

less space
chars 1 takes substantially less space than an int

larger
sizeof int is larger than chars on your system

greater
so for example the value of the chars 3 is 3 greater than the value of 0 so when you subtract these two values you get the int 3

commonly smaller
a chars is commonly smaller than an int

less
for example if i declare and only use it in a way that it could have and should have been declared since chars uses less memory than int will gcc optimize that or does it not even matter since it will be converted to assembly

less
it s stated in the standard that unsigned chars has less rank than int and with this the type of the switch condition will be int which further means

fewer bytes
if you want to convert an int to a chars you ll need to instruct the computer to interpret the bytes of an int as ascii values - and it s been a while since i ve done c but i believe the compiler will complain since chars holds fewer bytes than int

stricter
it s theoretically possible that an has a smaller sizeof than a for example if int has stricter alignment requirements than chars this could be a reasonable thing to do

more
depending on what chars and int on your system are to not assume that int has more bits than chars your intermediate sums may be overflowing

more space
i understand you re after the security by obscurity but be aware that chars varchar columns larger than 4 chars take more space than int does 1 byte

larger sizeof
shouldn t a chars 3 variable be larger than sizeof int

bigger
5 is an int which represents a bigger domain than chars

smaller
when smaller types are involved in an expression with larger types for example chars is smaller than short which mostly is smaller than int which may be smaller than long the involved types are promoted to the larger tyoes

wider range
int has wider range than chars and you should check if your int value is in chars range before converting back

more
int needs more memory than what chars occupies and the conversion cannot be done in a safe manner

smaller then
if chars is smaller then int usually it is so the structure mystructv1 can be smaller than mystructv2

larger range
a narrowing conversion like int to chars if int has a larger range than chars yields some implementation-defined conversion

less
this program is designed to take an int and a name of less than 15 chars and store them in arrays

rank less
for completeness to see that unsigned chars rank is less than the rank of int we can go to section 4.13 int conversion rank which says

smaller
since chars is smaller than int the input will overwrite the variables which is why x has the wrong value

more abstract
in a certain sense int is a more abstract data type than chars short long or long long as you cannot be sure about the bitwidth

larger otherwise
a longer string of int is larger otherwise compare chars in order

easier
this package and my answer here may not solve your problem because reading the numbers directly as chars is an easier way to achieve your goal but i thought i might post this anyway as an information for users who may need to use large int with more than 22 digits

larger
i ve always been taught that if an int is larger than a chars you must solve the byte ordering problem

more disk
how come static chars allocates more disk memory than static int

key faster
int are 4 bytes while chars are only 1 byte so it seems reasonable to believe that accessing a map item at a given chars key is faster than accessing a normal array item at a given int index

more
since you take 32 bit int type input the hex representation is not more than 8 chars

larger domain
java will allow you to assign chars s to int s since int has a larger domain than chars

smaller
a chars is commonly smaller than an int

more
it seems pretty silly that your presumably 16-bit int takes more than twice as many instructions as an 8-bit chars

larger
continuing the int_least8_t example hlp will be promoted to type int which is larger than chars

bigger
an int is a bigger memory area than a chars and when you read you ll pick up other values beside the chars and end up with an effectively random value

less probability
while using chars there is probability of getting garbage value as it directly stores the chars but using int there is less probability of it as it stores the ascii value of the chars

bigger
if you re only dealing with arrays of chars or only dealing with arrays of int it s irrelevant because endianness is a property of int and other types bigger than chars

version better
it seems that the const int version is better optimized than the and the even more surprising const chars version

larger storage
br.read returns a int which has a larger storage capacity than a chars

smaller
it s wrong because chars is smaller than int

greater
when i add any alphabet in the int number or int number is greater than 4 chars in length the string match should fail but it is not failing

faster
zim s advice is excellent and searching on int will always be faster than chars

longer
and int is longer than chars typically 4 vs

narrower type
make this change and your program will run but be aware that casting an int to an unsigned chars might lead to loss of information as the unsigned chars is a narrower type than the int in most implementations

bigger
because int can become arbitrarily large in clojure the resulting number becomes bigger with every chars thanks to the

faster
the damerau-levenshtein algorithm includes many comparisons and int compare much faster than chars

less space
this does not only mean that int consumes less space it also means that chars 36 has about 4 times more different keys

bigger
however accessing a single chars via a pointer to int is also invalid because on most systems int is bigger than chars so you read or write bytes beyond the end of the object

smaller
since chars is smaller than int it has to be converted to an int

type more
sometimes chars type is more usable than int - fixed size chars doesn t take much storage room and you can see enumerated values directly in database fields

wider
this description does not exclude the possibility that for example an int type wider than chars might have a single padding bit that must always be 1

less memory
it will take more lines of code but it will likely still work out faster than tostring ing each number as that requires more computational steps to determine the chars value for each digit and put them together and less memory as int values can be operated on more or less in place so instead of needing a string for every number you need three int variables for the whole loop

less obvious
why did you get 0x38 instead of 0x8 because here 8 is a string not a chars variable a bit less obvious than int is the other of the plain integral types the chars

strings much longer
you will get your data faster comparing chars strings is much longer than comparing two int

typically narrower
note that chars is typically narrower than int but on rare systems chars and int may be the same width

greater
long long int is greater than long int which is greater than int which is greater than short int which is greater than signed chars

less
for types for example chars or unsigned chars that have rank less than int the integral promotion will be performed

values much faster
this is largely due to the fact that comparing int values is much faster that comparing chars values

bigger size
i.e if we use int and chars then union will allocate space for chars which has the bigger size and the int too ll be stored in the same space overriding the last one

faster
the reason it happens is to enable you to work with int which is faster than working with chars values

longer
so my question is is it possible to convert the int to string which is longer than 10-12 chars fixed length if possible mix of chars and numbers which can be reversed to the original int

smaller rank
basically every chars has always a smaller rank than int and they can all be represented in an int and so the overload with unsigned chars is not a better match because it would involve a conversion from chars to unsigned chars instead of a promotion

greater
the compiler may generate warning messages for such conversion as sizeof int is greater than sizeof chars

more
for example a 32-bit int won t take up more than 11 chars to represent in decimal with an optional sign so your particular example won t need more than 44 chars unless i miscounted

easier
it worked in this case in my first part with chars i tried to look at my first part which works fine and i noticed that chars is easier to convert to int basically i don t need to convert it but with string it doesn t work this way i tried to google it but i can t find proper solution

larger
the rest are at least as large as chars and it s hard to imagine how you d make the i o system work correctly if int wasn t larger than chars

larger
although note it s not safe since an int is larger than a chars

more sizeof
senderid and sequencenumber are both int and will take up more than sizeof chars bytes on most architectures

longer
you are allocating sizeof int bytes of memory for your strings which is most likely 4 your input strings read by scanf must not be longer than 3 chars

often faster
far better to use a surrogate key and yes a join on an int is often faster and you can join in delete staments in many databases not use the slower subquery especially since names tend to be longer than a few chars

wider
even if it returned chars since both chars and int are integral types of the same signedness and int is wider than chars an int can always store a chars using an implicit conversion sometimes it s called an upcast but it s not really a cast since it s implicit

more
however im encountering an issue were if the int entered is more than 10 chars long the program will still say that the lenght is 10

larger
int is sizeof int times larger than chars

faster
if you just have 3 possible values use an array of chars and that will copy 4 times faster than int

larger
however if i call the function once with a file call it again with a nonexistent file then call it one more time with the original file the chars string buffer is larger than the int length

always more
regarding the last portion of your question the number of bits of int is always more than chars so it won t cause a problem

larger
the specific reason that you have to pay close attention to byte-order when handling ipv4 address and port numbers is that the structures sockaddr_in and in_addr have data members with int types larger than chars and whose contents are required to be in network byte order

faster
there are many options for you like visser suggested you could convert the date time into a long int which allows faster computation or you can keep them as strings or even convert them into chars like what you have done with chars array2

larger
when you re printing using the default x format the value to be printed is interpreted as being an int much larger than the chars

greater
if there are any ascii control chars or values greater than 127 and it doesn t think its in a utf-8 locale then it will just print int

less
the rank of a chars is less than or equal to that of an int so chars is included in here

lower precedence
since chars types have lower precedence than int types the query is basically the same as

wider
int has wider range than chars and you should check if your int value is in chars range before converting back

smaller size
i understand that a chars is a smaller size than an int

more memory
if int is 4 bytes and represents 2 bytes the int consumes more memory than the chars -array so you are not initialising the full int -memory to 0 by setting all chars -variables

faster
it s going to be a performance memory trade-off anyway because writing one int is generally faster than three chars separately

more restrictive
thus int is a more restrictive type than chars

better
int is better because with chars n you ll be comparing one chars at a time and unless you collate latin1_general_bin then you ll also be doing a transformation when comparing chars

smaller
thus when you use it with objects of type chars which is smaller than int these values are automatically converted to int before the operation happens

faster
if i had to assume a 1 byte chars is compared faster than a 4-byte int

bigger
in you are adding a chars to an int an int can be much bigger than a chars so it chooses the bigger data type int to be the result a.k.a

larger
note that int has a larger range values than a chars so you should check that the value stored in myint will fit into a chars

much smaller
however chars 36 and int 10 are far away from being equal because a int 10 is much smaller than chars 36

smaller
you always have to consider that the id column has any meaning or is it really necessary if you have chars codes using only ascii chars with less than 4 chars length the code will be smaller than the int id column int is stored on 4 bytes bigint on 8 bytes

smaller
if chars is smaller than int which is true on all but some rare embedded systems this difference can be computed with a simple subtraction both c1 and c2 being promoted to int and this difference is guaranteed to fit in the range of type int

lower rank
answering your question a chars is an integer-type of lower rank than int meaning potentially and in practice nearly guaranteed smaller size and value-range and thus pointers to either are different types too

larger
if you copy int larger than chars like short or long you have to make sure to correct the byte order depending on your cpu architecture

typically greater
this warning comes up because int typically has a greater range than chars and so some loss-of-information may occur

stricter
5.2.10 paragraph 7 says that assuming int has a stricter alignment than chars then the round trip of to to generates an unspecified value for the resulting

larger
you can t really concat an int and place it inside a single chars for starters the int itself is larger byte-wise than your entire chars so obviously it can t fit in there

form always more
storing data in the int form is always more reliable than the chars or string

less
plain chars having unspecified signed-ness allows compilers to select whichever representation is more efficient for the target architecture on some architectures zero extends a one-byte value to the size of int requires less operations thus making plain chars unsigned while on others the instruction set makes sign-extending more natural and plain chars gets implements as signed

more space
so if most are just a few chars a varchar 20 key will occupy more space than an int key

less room
for lookup tables with a low volume of rows you can use a 3 chars code as the primary key as this takes less room than an int but the performance difference is negligible

more
a chars is basically nothing more than an int whose value is the encoding of the chars

better
x is of type chars chars to int is a better conversion than chars to

more
i.e string chars allocate more than two int allocate we can use

substantially less
chars 1 takes substantially less space than an int

higher
int has a higher precedence than chars so sql server cast - to int implicitly here

longer
note that if you want to do this with strings of arbitrary length you ll need to work with a big int library like gmp or openssl s bignum - the longest type in standard c long long cannot be mapped one-to-one onto the set of c strings that include strings longer than 8 chars because its guaranteed range includes only 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 unique values

smaller
int values are smaller than chars strings you can fit much more per page than you can with nvarchar and mathematics are more easily done on int

higher
and int has higher rank than unsigned chars

more
and to prevent having int with more than 7 chars modulo can be used like this

larger
is there memset that accepts int larger than chars

more
for one thing an int can easily be more than 1 chars in length which would stop single chars conversion from solving my problem

more
the raw storage of your array assuming a 4 byte int should only be 60mb but since each chars of an int in ascii is 1 byte any int with more than 4 chars are going to be larger than the binary storage hence your 130mb file

more
how come static chars allocates more disk memory than static int

more
100 strings of value x00 take 24 bytes per value too -- but notice that listofstrings is one chars shorter than listofintegers so the 1-byte string takes up 1 byte more than the int 0 and the same amount of space as the int 255

larger
the only way it could fail to be a no-op is if the range of chars is larger than the range of int for example if chars and int are both 32-bit but chars is unsigned.

larger capacity
an int has larger capacity than a chars so the conversion is not guaranteed to work

higher rank
and int has higher rank than unsigned chars

less
this does not only mean that int consumes less space it also means that chars 36 has about 4 times more different keys

greater
your string has 12 chars if you give 10s the length of the sting is greater than the int so there is no white space

type smaller
the chars type is smaller than int and hence can represent less values than int can

not greater
sizeof chars is not greater than sizeof int

smaller
second problem is that every time a new line feed is allocated to the end of chars sequence when the input is smaller than the int n-1

lower
given 4.13 says chars has lower rank than int this means chars can be converted to int if needed but why is it needed

more memory
int needs more memory than what chars occupies and the conversion cannot be done in a safe manner

lower
2 chars has a lower rank than int

smaller
and size of chars is smaller than size of int

more
but still i√¢ m facing issue when the inputs given are showing as #### if the int exceeds more than 4 chars

narrower
if chars as in is a signed chars or an unsigned chars narrower than int 1 of these 2 is almost always the case will be promoted to int

higher type
int has a higher type precedence than any of the n var chars types and so it tries to convert all of the strings to int s to see if they re 0

more slots
well the int uses more slots since chars are usually only one byte

less
another problem what does the arduino string class do if the int is less than 1000 or less than 100 and doesn t require 3 or 4 chars to convert to a chars array

smaller
by allowing an instance of enum to be smaller it takes up less space much like a chars may be smaller than int as is usual

greater
and sizeof int is greater than one and the compiler adds padding for the chars member variable - is the compiler-generated code allowed to change the values of the padding bytes

less
so before calling this method you should verify that all data that come from a user are as they should be if you store an int then that the data passed is an int the string is less than 255 chars ...

larger
java will allow you to assign chars s to int s since int has a larger domain than chars

more
i guess that the original exercise would ask you to get two different int of probably more than 1 chars each

less
now the three chars types have the same rank and a signed type has a rank always less than int

smaller
since chars is smaller than int it would be the same

nothing more
you should consider that in c a chars is nothing more than an alias of an int so casting a chars to int is a no-op

lower rank
1 this time involves an integral conversion since chars has lower rank than int and 2 still involves a floating-integral conversion both of which have the same rank conversion

less
the value sizeof chars is less than sizeof int

higher type
since a chars is a single byte by definition and since int can t be less than one byte and since in practice all bits of an int are value representation bits it s at best only in the most pedantic formal that a chars can be converted up to a higher type than int

now better
this means that num to chars is now better than num to int so the first overload is now a better match and should be selected

larger
an int has larger capacity than a chars so the conversion is not guaranteed to work

therefore larger
the set of strings of 1 or 2 chars is therefore larger than the number of int and any hashcode calculation methodology will produce collisions for strings that are 1 or 2 chars long which qualify as short strings i suppose

wider
that s why even picky compilers do not issue a warning if you shift a chars wider than 7 bits try it - you ll get the warning only if you shift wider than an int allows

wider unsigned
in order for this to work reliably c should have type and unsigned int should be strictly wider than unsigned chars

better conversion
x is of type chars chars to int is a better conversion than chars to

smaller
the chars type is smaller than int and hence can represent less values than int can

faster
does a unique index on an int column perform faster than a chars 5

smaller version
now why chat to int works because every chars is represented as unicode in java so you can think of it as at backend chars is a smaller version of int

more
when i try converting ascii int to keys that have more than one chars i always get an incorrect result

narrower
note that chars is typically narrower than int but on rare systems chars and int may be the same width

larger
loss of precision means that int has a larger value and chars is smaller so you can t fit something which is to large for that space

bigger
yes it is because int is bigger than chars but using chars instead of int would not be safe for the same reason

smaller
however chars 36 and int 10 are far away from being equal because a int 10 is much smaller than chars 36

smaller
chars is guaranteed to be smaller than int

more
as int is having more precedence over chars will be converted to int

lower
so b would not be less than c as the ascii values for the chars in 2000 would be significantly lower than the int value 1055

smaller
now why chat to int works because every chars is represented as unicode in java so you can think of it as at backend chars is a smaller version of int

varchar slower
chars chars varchar is slower then int because integer-integer comparison is easy

smaller
i understand that a chars is a smaller size than an int

smaller
that answer is pretty clear a chars is smaller than an int and when objective-c was designed back in the 80s shaving off a few bytes was always good

wider
an implicit cast is disallowed as an int is wider has a greater range of values than a chars

greater
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be greater than a int one

larger
a narrowing conversion like int to chars if int has a larger range than chars yields some implementation-defined conversion

greater
also assuming sizeof int 4 your strings must not be greater than 4 chars as you have now and 1 of those needs to be a null termination

less sizeof
the value sizeof chars is less than sizeof int

better
the sfinae protected function will be preferred if it is valid because int is a better match than chars for 0

smaller
an int is smaller than a string even if the string is empty because an int is smaller than a reference to chars plus more int for the offset length and hash code

closer
a chars is closer to an int than to a string

higher
note you can encounter failures if the sum between the two int is higher than the maximum chars value available

less
the rank of unsigned chars is less than that of int

more
an int is usually 4 bytes i m thinking i don t really need more than 10 chars so a varchar 10 would do.

faster
running the same test on linux with gcc similarly pegs int and long as similar and both faster than chars although the difference is less pronounced

more
php int maximum value is about 32 bits mine is no more than 5 chars

greater sizeof
i would either cast the chars to an unsigned int if the unsigned int s value is greater than sizeof chars

better
i know that using int is a better paradigm here but the value is a guid with a few chars appended to the front

larger
is there memset that accepts int larger than chars

higher
in this case to int as int has a higher data type precedence than n var chars data types

more
in a certain sense int is a more abstract data type than chars short long or long long as you cannot be sure about the bitwidth

always larger
finally you wrote an int into the memory of the chars object chars n which causes an overflow because the size of an int is always larger than size of a chars

lower
1 this time involves an integral conversion since chars has lower rank than int and 2 still involves a floating-integral conversion both of which have the same rank conversion

bigger
int is bigger than chars typically 4-bytes vs

more
so my guess would be that that chars requires more than 16 bits so it would need to be treated as an int code point

smaller range
this does implicitly at least sort of assume that chars has a smaller range than int so the conversion to int allows at least one value to be represented that couldn t have come from the file

more
though i m having a problem where a const int within the struct basically is cutting off the productname-string if it has more than 32 chars which is quite annoying

higher
but it is a narrowing conversion because the rank of int is higher than rank of chars

less
that means that first chars will be 0 if there wouldn t be anything there int is less then 10 and second chars is digit

narrower
make this change and your program will run but be aware that casting an int to an unsigned chars might lead to loss of information as the unsigned chars is a narrower type than the int in most implementations

less
if you allocate a chunk of memory sufficient to store an int and then realloc for a chars you will always get back the same pointer because sizeof chars is less than or equal to the sizeof int

simpler case
for or int which sounds a simpler case and chars could have been both implemented as member operators or as non-member free operators

bigger
i.e if we use int and chars then union will allocate space for chars which has the bigger size and the int too ll be stored in the same space overriding the last one

smaller
a chars is smaller than an int so you can return it and it will prepend zeroes to make a longer number

more
how can i convert it into an int if the string has more than one chars

bigger
on your platform a int is bigger than a chars so you are walking off the end of the array and undefined read really bad things are allowed to happen when you do that

shorter
if you are talking about compiler implementation yes i think the c standard doesn t impose any upper bound only minimums like chars is 8 bits or more and limits on relative sizes like long can t be shorter than int

faster
does a unique index on an int column perform faster than a chars 5

bigger
int is bigger has more space than chars

narrower range
warning language-lawyering follows. there might be a loophole that allows for extended int types with a wider range than _bool but a narrower range than chars

more
if your int value uses more than one chars and includes the sign as you mention then it is more complex

faster
on some hardware platforms it might turn out that int types work faster than chars types so the selection of the specific type becomes a speed-vs-memory trade-off but once again in many cases when the range of chars is naturally sufficient it might make more sense to use chars instead of int

array lower memory
the chars array has a lower memory address than the int i variable

generally faster
it s going to be a performance memory trade-off anyway because writing one int is generally faster than three chars separately

larger
as int is larger than a chars the memory gets corrupted

easier way
this package and my answer here may not solve your problem because reading the numbers directly as chars is an easier way to achieve your goal but i thought i might post this anyway as an information for users who may need to use large int with more than 22 digits

smaller
primary keys should be short but typical size abbreviations are rarely longer than 4 chars -- xxxl --- which is the same size or smaller than an int on most database engines int typically being 4 or 8 bytes

easier
i assume this is because comparison between int is much easier than between chars strings but i was looking for some literature to back this assessment ideally some database structure book

faster indexing
an int will use less memory space and give faster indexing than a chars

varchar slower then
chars chars varchar is slower then int because integer-integer comparison is easy

lower rank
2 chars has a lower rank than int

less
but there are some exceptions for small int between -5 and 256 and small strings interned strings with a special length usually less than 20 chars which are singletons and have same id actually one object with multiple pointer

smaller
in fact quite a bit of i o depends on eof having a value that couldn t originate from the file which basically translates to a requirement that chars have a range that s smaller than int not just smaller than or equal to as the standard directly requires

key smaller
an int key is smaller in size then a chars field for holding 100 chars

smaller
i tried getsubstring long int but it only works for strings smaller than 4000 chars

more
if so is there some correlation such as 40 digit double int is 50 more efficient as a uid than using 20 chars string

faster
on all of the computers i work with int is faster than unsigned significantly faster than signed chars

higher
here int is higher datatype and chars is lower datatype.

larger value
loss of precision means that int has a larger value and chars is smaller so you can t fit something which is to large for that space

just terser
they are the same they both cast the value to an int one is just terser by four chars

more specific
in java chars is a more specific type of int

value more
if your int value uses more than one chars and includes the sign as you mention then it is more complex

bigger memory
an int is a bigger memory area than a chars and when you read you ll pick up other values beside the chars and end up with an effectively random value

more
as per you requirements your int will have no more than 6 chars 999999 and the encoding should be max 7 chars so a xor of 24 bits will do it

higher
if an symbol along with a random word is detected while being read i want to drop the symbol and replace the word with the int 16 and if a different string of chars is being used along with the symbol i want to set the number 1 higher than int 16

simpler unicode
because int comparisons are more efficient and simpler than unicode chars comparisons

less
if the int turns out to be 38 i need the version string to come out as 380 only one zero was added to the end of the int because i wanted a max of three chars and if the int is less than three chars zeroes will be added to make it three

normally wider
since int is normally wider than chars truncates the value of int being assigned

more precision
chars and int are two distinct types but this works because an int has more precision than a chars

smaller size
i understand that a chars is a smaller size than an int

faster
but for 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors data alignment and bulk data access is key int accesses are frequently much faster than chars accesses and long long 64 bit may be faster still for some systems

smaller sizes
update the reason why int doesn t work in oppose to chars and short is because that when both numbers are added there is a possibility of overflow regardless of being int short or chars while not forgetting integral promotion but because short and chars are with smaller sizes than int and because they are promoted to int in expressions they are represented again without truncation in this line

less
once that is done you can go in and tweak the data types to better fit your needs if desired and you can add your own restrictions to the data such as requiring that an xs int value be in a range of 0 and 50 or an xs string value be less than 10 chars long - there are dozens of other possibilities but that should give you the idea

wider
this creates the possibility that even on a system where chars is only 8 bits wide and so int is wider than chars chars constant notations can exist which provide int values wider than chars

greater range
that does leave one loophole though it s one that would generally be quite horrible that chars and short have the same range size_type is the same as unsigned short and int has a greater range than chars short

fewer
if you want to convert an int to a chars you ll need to instruct the computer to interpret the bytes of an int as ascii values - and it s been a while since i ve done c but i believe the compiler will complain since chars holds fewer bytes than int

more
in c an int is considered true if it is any value other than 0 and all three of those printf calls print more than 0 chars so it will run the first one which returns a value logically equivalent to true so it will stop execution of that line and go onto the next

larger byte-wise
you can t really concat an int and place it inside a single chars for starters the int itself is larger byte-wise than your entire chars so obviously it can t fit in there

greater
that does leave one loophole though it s one that would generally be quite horrible that chars and short have the same range size_type is the same as unsigned short and int has a greater range than chars short

bigger
since int is bigger than chars an pointer could require less information to indicate what it points to

larger
the max size of an int is much larger than a chars so your cast may truncate the value

more descriptive
since sql server doesn t support named constants chars is far more descriptive than int when used in stored procedure and views as constants

less then
that means that first chars will be 0 if there wouldn t be anything there int is less then 10 and second chars is digit

much smaller
you should probably always use an id number that way if you change the type name you don t need to update the user table it also allows you to keep your datasize down as a table full of int is much smaller than one full of 45 chars varchars

shorter
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be shorter than a int one

wider
since int is normally wider than chars truncates the value of int being assigned

more restrictive type
thus int is a more restrictive type than chars

much more space
another thing is that chars 32 consumes much more space 32 bytes 256 bit where an int 10 only is 32 bit long

form always more reliable
storing data in the int form is always more reliable than the chars or string

more
even half as many int are bound to require more than 3000 chars or bytes

larger
since int is larger than chars this allows eof to be somewhere inside the space of numbers expressible as int while being outside the set of chars

id only lower
it takes a pathname and an arbitrary int id uses only lower 8 bits so a chars is usually used and generates a probably unique key_t

faster
i think the conversion to builtin int types for the binary-and operation is likely to make it much faster than working chars by chars because python s int is written in c rather than python

more
i can write code that successfully returns the int of a single-character string however when it comes to ones that contain more than one chars i can t because of this type error

bigger
but safe does not mean useful as int is bigger than chars usually we do the inverse to save some memory

less overhead
int values have less overhead than chars values

smaller
like other said it happens to work because the internal representation of an int on your machine is little endian and your chars is smaller than an int

smaller
however an explicit cast is required in your second case where there is potential to lose information since a chars is smaller than an int

less memory
the only reason i can think of is the objective-c designers micro-optimising storage because the chars will use less memory than the int

larger
on some platforms an int might be no larger than a chars

greater
the firs one is more common and works on all systems where the size of an int is greater than the size of a chars

typically greater range
this warning comes up because int typically has a greater range than chars and so some loss-of-information may occur

larger
your int is larger than your chars - you get the a value + some random data following it in memory

lower
value8 is promoted to int assuming the conversion rank of unsigned chars is lower than the conversion rank of int usually the case on most platforms

wider range
putting chars into int is ok - both are int and int has wider range and chars will fit

more
the last thing that you need to know is that whatever the int equivalent of the chars 1 is the actual value is unimportant it is 1 more than the int equivalent for 0

comparison faster
as the so link in your question suggests int comparison is faster than chars comparison and yield faster fetch

fields faster
i m not an expert in the inner workings of mysql but it intuitively feels that retrieving and sorting int fields is faster than chars fields i just get a feeling that a z is more work that 0 1 and seems to feel much more familiar from a computing perspective in which 0s and 1s are the standard on off flags

larger
both of them are wrong because they will cause out-of-range access if sizeof unsigned int is larger than sizeof chars

bigger
int is usually bigger than chars √¢ more suitable for calculations but not so suitable for byte-level manipulation

greater sizeof
sizeof chars is not greater than sizeof int

more
a multi-character-constant is a literal int uses the character-literal-syntax with more than one chars and has an implementation-defined value

usually wider
the type int is an int which is usually wider and so can keep all the possible values a chars can keep

less
my original solution was naive - it didn t deal with the case when the int hash is less than 100 base 36 - meaning it would print less than 3 chars

more
this is made more confusing because of the the names of chars and wchar_t you shouldn t see wchar_t as a chars but more as a int which size isn t dependent on the architecture but on the size of the biggest locale and on the value of weof

greater
my question is how come when the order of declarations are reversed as seen below the int variable i is still at a memory address greater than the chars array

more space
if the file is in text format you may be able to fit it in memory just by converting things to int as you read them in since an int stored as chars may take more space than an int stored as an int depending on the size of the int and the type of text file

larger
br.read returns a int which has a larger storage capacity than a chars

more
the second case does the same thing since a signed int is more than capable of holding the full range of unsigned chars values in this implementation

more
chars and int could be the same size and chars is unsigned with a positive range more than int

better
although outer foo chars is a better match for the call foo c name lookup stops after finding outer inner foo int outer foo chars is hidden and so the program prints inner

more
chars and int are two distinct types but this works because an int has more precision than a chars

higher address
we know that chars will have a higher address than the int because once again the standard says so

longer
it would probably be more consistent to use the bits from the lowest value to the highest value and 1 must be cast to uint64_t to avoid arithmetic overflow on int for strings longer than 31 chars if int is 32-bit wide

more
string.substring int startindex int length might help if you need to split into chunks of more than one chars

wider
putting chars into int is ok - both are int and int has wider range and chars will fit

higher data
in this case to int as int has a higher data type precedence than n var chars data types

larger
in most cases int is a lot larger than chars

less storage
if i remember correctly int take up less storage than chars so you should go with int

more memory
typically int take up more memory than chars so i will end up with a larger value than c after they are both incremented

longer
auto is one chars longer than int so the lexer definitely has to do more work

bigger
since an int is 32 bits wide four times bigger than a chars when the pointer is being decremented it is printing out every fourth chars in the reverse of the string

better bet
well then an int field may just be a better bet than a chars 50

bigger
it should at least output that the the preferred width of chars vector is bigger than the int vector

more space
for example an int might occupy more space than a chars or it might be that the chars lives at an address where no int can ever live.

greater
it allows string and int values which is correct but i want to require my text to be greater than 4 chars long

higher
so as per my knowledge the size of the int remains higher than chars so when i am assigning the int variable to chars pointer it must point only first byte of the int variable because cc is a chars pointer

larger
the basis being that an int is larger than a chars and as such there is no chance of loss of information in the conversion

hash less
my original solution was naive - it didn t deal with the case when the int hash is less than 100 base 36 - meaning it would print less than 3 chars

faster collections.default
i ve written chars counter c extension to python looks like 300x faster than collections.counter and 150x faster than collections.default int

larger
before this happens the value of a in this expression is promoted in int so the result can be larger than a chars

less space
this data setter script is generated automatically i chose to do it int by int to take less space than chars by chars in my .c file

larger
as mentioned in other posts senderid and sequencenumber are both of type int which is likely to be larger than chars so these values will be truncated

much easier
i assume this is because comparison between int is much easier than between chars strings but i was looking for some literature to back this assessment ideally some database structure book

larger
realloc allocates chars but your array is int which are almost certainly larger than chars

far more descriptive
since sql server doesn t support named constants chars is far more descriptive than int when used in stored procedure and views as constants

greater
this will work if the range of int is greater than that of unsigned chars

less
in our case then we have decltype chars + chars is int because chars s conversion rank less than int so both are promoted to int before the call to operator+

same larger
let s assume for a minute you re using unsigned chars same applies to larger int of course

narrower
converting to chars assuming a chars is narrower than an int will keep the lower-order bits and lower-order bits are lower-order bits no matter how they are stored in memory

larger sizeof
both of them are wrong because they will cause out-of-range access if sizeof unsigned int is larger than sizeof chars

stricter alignment
it s theoretically possible that an has a smaller sizeof than a for example if int has stricter alignment requirements than chars this could be a reasonable thing to do

much larger
the max size of an int is much larger than a chars so your cast may truncate the value

terser
they are the same they both cast the value to an int one is just terser by four chars

larger range
note that int has a larger range values than a chars so you should check that the value stored in myint will fit into a chars

smaller
if you want to point to more than one int you would need to define an int array which is four times smaller than your chars array - make sure your sizes are correct

larger unsigned
you are using int buffer to initialize cv mat with unsigned chars elements that explains why values are written at each fourth element int seems to be 4 times larger than unsigned chars on your machine

datatype more performance
indexing on int datatype gives you more performance than indexing on chars or varchar datatypes

larger
we have the following stackoverflow answer for reference which describes the case where chars can be larger than int which backs up the assertion in the discussion above

larger
the following assumes that bool is a synonym for chars or a similar type of size 1 and int is larger than chars

more
i thought does that mean id can be any int between -128 and 127 no more than 4 chars

wider range
a int type as a wider range than a chars type see this data type range table

more
if the int s can be more than 1 chars use this else see below simplification

value more
if your int value is more than one digit you can never expect a single chars to hold it

far more
since sql server doesn t support named constants chars is far more descriptive than int when used in stored procedure and views as constants

stricter alignment
5.2.10 paragraph 7 says that assuming int has a stricter alignment than chars then the round trip of to to generates an unspecified value for the resulting

greater sizeof
the compiler may generate warning messages for such conversion as sizeof int is greater than sizeof chars

array bigger
dr printf uses the stack overwriting some of the space pointed by str but since the int array is bigger in memory than the chars array it is far ahead in the stack and doesn t get overwritten

larger
your limit is in fact less than that since even if the int are unsigned most tokens in practice would be larger than one chars and many tokens require whitespace separation between them

less
writes should be a int which can only contain 0 to 9 and be less than 10 chars

more precedence
as int is having more precedence over chars will be converted to int

statement
any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsed optimized compiled and then execute

more
my question is how can i execute more than 1 prepare statement

execution faster
prepare execution is faster than direct execution for statements execute more than three or four times because the statement is compiled only once while statements execute directly are compiled each time they are execute

more convenient

keras provides a simpler quicker way to build and train models in tensorflow at no performance cost since the models are still being run by the same tensorflow engine

faster
actually on intel sandybridge-family at least mul imul 64bit 64bit 128bit is faster than imul mul 32bit 32bit 64bit

slower
so a 128bit adder will be slower than a 64bit add

more
perhaps 128bit distributed-system internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a system call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit

faster
128bit transactions tend to be faster than 64bit which tend to be faster than 32 bit

faster
in a benchmark test the 128bit intrinsic function performs faster than the 64bit intrinsic

larger
and i ll just add to previous comment if 128bit number has prime factor larger than 64bit then it certainly has a factor less than 64bit

math faster
in a few more years there might be an architecture where 128bit math is faster than 64bit but i don t think any exists today

i ll just add that if the 128bit number is prime or has a prime factor larger than 64bit then there will be no solution to your problem

in my testing the slow-down from using tensorflow ranges from about 1.5-3.0 times slower than using theano but its performance will depend on your application

and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn

less arguments
if you subclassing has less arguments than a superclass and you could make them optional in the superclass just add placeholders in the subclassing

more
in enhanced er modelling subclassing inheriting from more than 1 superclass is called multiple inherited

presumably more memory
if new member fields are declared in the subclassing then yes a subclassing presumably uses more memory since it has all the fields declared in the superclass plus all the fields declared in the subclassing

higher altitudes
yes but if you think of your diagram as a topographic map the subclassing have higher altitudes than the superclass

more specific
however they are not the same because the subclassing has more specific functions and data members that accomplish a more specific task that the superclass

less methods
you cannot have a subclassing with less methods than a superclass

more values
so what this says is that provided your subclassing doesn t have any more values than the superclass used to determine ordering implementing is reasonable

less
if you subclassing has less arguments than a superclass and you could make them optional in the superclass just add placeholders in the subclassing

a subclassing is more flexible and is treated as an entire object which responds to all superclass methods plus it s own

no longer
this breaks the inherited and the subclassing is no longer an instance of the superclass

superclass defines more general features of the objects of its subclassing

actually more restrictive
even in your original post the subclassing is actually more restrictive than the superclass so doing something like

more specific
if the subclassing is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclass __init__ method

more
watch out you can t query a superclass if you have more than 1 subclassing then something like in jql

less acts
these relations naturally arise when you impose restrictions on what you can handle--then if a subclassing means that the method can handle less acts as a superclass of since can handle everything that the subclassing can handle and more

less
hence your subclassing is accepting less classes than the superclass contract promises

more
for example you want to use abstract-class in such a case that each of the subclassing is a more specific type of its abstract superclass fruit apple orange banana grape strawberries etc. and you want to use non-abstract superclass in a relationship such as dad and son

weaker access
the subclassing overridden method cannot have weaker access than superclass method

more
if we are creating an object of a subclassing and invoking the method of superclass and if subclassing extends more than one class which superclass method should be called

more selective
the fact that the subclassing is more selective only actually writes about what it writes is new functionality especially in light of the fact that the superclass promises nothing

more
in other words if a subclassing is more accessible than its superclass then the access modifier of the superclass loses effect

in this case superclass is bigger than subclassing that s why the second statement is correct

more stringent
the superclass has a more stringent constraint on a property content blank false than the subclassing content nullable true and i am using tableperhierarchy false

fewer arguments
with explicit superclass calling your subclassing can accept more or fewer arguments than its superclass and can decide itself what to pass when calling the superclass

so i inspected the compiled firebasemessagingservice which was the subclassing of com.google.firebase.iid.zzb and had zzae intent method as private but its subclassing firebasemessagingservice had protected access i know that subclassing cannot have weaker reference than its superclass so i guess there is something wrong with firebasemessagingservice library

more
shouldn t a subclassing interfaced be able to take in more than the superclass interfacec and use the same method

lower visibility
still you cannot inherited from a as superclass cannot have a lower visibility than subclassing

bigger interface
you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have

narrower subtype
however if the subclassing returns a narrower subtype of the superclass method return this is called a covariant return type and is allowed in java since jdk 1.5

template better
paulw11 s comment helped--the time profiling template is better suited for this task than the system trace instrumentation

so my question is beyond instrumentation and the profiling using memory leaks which tells you the location of creation of the leaky object but not the root cause are there any other tools i could run that could give me any more info than instrumentation re tracking down the root cause point

you just set the div with border-radius so that it is a circle and background-color is the more transparency color in the circle

greater
works because ceil a b is always one greater than floor a b except when a b is a whole number

idx lower
so floor idx is the lower element and ceil idx is the higher

idx lower element
so floor idx is the lower element and ceil idx is the higher

always higher
on the other hand if what you want to do is not rounding but elimination of fractions into one direction then you have std ceil that goes always higher and std floor that always goes lower

greater
the floor times the ceil are greater than the floor xy...that s very much possible

higher
now if floor is higher than 0 or ceil is lower than 0 on any axis it means that there just as many tiles outside of the camera scoop

slower
why is memcpy so much slower than memmove or hand rolled copy on the server

slower
why does memcpy perform slower than memmove on my system

faster
on some arm platform im working on memmove was 3 times faster than memcpy for short unalligned load

more
note that memmove has more overhead than memcpy because it has to determine which direction of copying is safe

more efficient
as an aside my c c++ is rusty but is not memcpy more efficient than memmove if you know you don t have overlapping memory

faster
the question is about is there really any platform where memcpy is faster than memmove

cache friendlier
in addition as mats petersson said memmove is cache friendlier than memcpy

more overhead
note that memmove has more overhead than memcpy because it has to determine which direction of copying is safe

slower
memcpy is still a little bit slower than memmove

slower std
std memmove may be very slightly slower than std memcpy emphasis added because it has to first check whether the source and target ranges overlap

more sophisticated
as already pointed out in other answers memmove is more sophisticated than memcpy such that it accounts for memory overlaps

more
as already pointed out in other answers memmove is more sophisticated than memcpy such that it accounts for memory overlaps

slower
memmove on the laptop runs slower than memcpy but oddly enough runs at the same speed as the memmove on the server

slower
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions

slower
while memmove will be only slightly slower than memcpy due to the assumptions it needs to make about the source and destination in memcpy they cannot overlap it should still be far superior to any standard loop

slower
and it said memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy

2x faster
edit memmove is 2x faster than memcpy on the server

more efficient
memcpy is more efficient than memmove. in general use memmove only if you have to

slower
bad news is that the asmlib version of memmove is slower than the glibc version it is now running at the 300ms mark on par with the glibc version of memcpy

more
memcpy is more efficient than memmove. in general use memmove only if you have to

faster
if you know buffers cannot overlap memcpy is fine and may in any given library use optimizations that allow it to be faster than memmove

faster
from reading other so questions such as this or this gives the impression that memcpy should work faster than memmove and intuitively this should be so

greater
it is entirely possible that in most implementations the cost of a memmove function call will not be significantly greater than memcpy in any scenario in which the behavior of both is defined

faster
so in what platform and how memcpy can be significantly faster than memmove if there is none why providing two similiar functions instead of just memmove and lead to a lots of bug

it s not necessarily true that the matlab fixed-point arithmetic provides less precision it can be used to provide more precision than ieee floating-point types

i m not too eager for using swt though since i m more familiar with swing

uglier api
i find swt to be an uglier api than swing in general though but not really a deal breaker

better
in java if you want a graphic user interface you can use swt or swing and swing is better than swt

faster
swt is claimed to be faster than swing although in modern versions swing is also fast enough

more simple
swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui

simpler
even though i liked many design aspects of swt and it is simpler than swing imo swing is the one to learn because imo it has far far better documentation examples etc

slower
swt became slower than swing because it uses proxy to os widgets

smaller
my problem is this i don t want the jlabel or the jscrollpane to stretch to the size of the jinternalframe if the jlabel is smaller than the jinternalframe

but a friend told me to begin with flask as it s simpler and will help me when i start learning django as django is more complicated than flask

simplier
current task looks like flask is ok for it since it is smaller and simplier than django

more
flask is more focused on simplicity instead of functionality while django has more functionality

better integration
but if the use of mongodb is a must then i suggest that you reconsider using django in the first place because mongodb has a better integration with flask through mongoengine

more out-of-the-box
django is very batteries included meaning that it comes with much more out-of-the-box than say flask and to me a large part of that the user auth system

more light
our team use django as our frame before but now we use flask as our frame because it is more light than django but we still use django template.

more complicated
but a friend told me to begin with flask as it s simpler and will help me when i start learning django as django is more complicated than flask

more comfortable
i m building an application in both bottle and flask to see which i am more comfortable with as django is too much batteries included

easier
both frameworks are fairly easy to implement flask is much easier than django imo although django has a built in authentication layer that you can use albeit more difficult to implement in a client server scenario like you need

smaller
if you are looking for the latter then flask is a micro framework that is considerably smaller than django

more lightweight

tooltip text is more scrollbar is displayed to scroll through to

more
all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo

significantly faster
i ve also noticed that qtwebengine is significantly faster and more stable that the old qtwebkit based widgets

much worse
unfortunately qtwebengine has much worse and poorer integration with the rest of qt facilities than qtwebkit

density less
if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi

ntfs is much more complex and time consuming due to the more complex nature of this filesystems

actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc

more tricky
if you need to load from a well-defined filesystems fat or ntfs this is more tricky you have only 450 bytes of space because 60 of the 512 bytes are used by the filesystems internally for code that interprets the data of the filesystems finds the file containing the code and loads it into memory

simpler ones
although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job

much cheaper
the addition is much cheaper than other operations like modulo and division and array access

higher
the modulo has a higher operator precedence than the addition operator therefore it will happen before the addition

better
the result of the addition was better than the modulo the by 0.0070000 milliseconds over the course of 2 million or 200 000 iterations

slower integer
integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

higher precedence
note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

higher operator

modulo can also cause a divide-by-zero and it has a higher precedence than addition

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

slower
division and modulo are indeed costly hardware operations whatever you do this is more related to hardware architecture than to languages or compilers perhaps ten times slower than addition

slower
then you can process any length number using very few division remainder modulo operations which is important because they are much slower than addition

higher precedence
multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

higher precedence
the modulo has a higher precedence than addition

more tightly

eta to answer your question in more general terms let s say we had the number of subjects and levels set up in advance increasing the number of factors is more complicated unless i m mistaken because then it would no longer be a two-dimensional matrix

size asymptotically worse
however it still performs worse by initially a factors of 3 but as the matrix size increases asymptotically worse by a factors of exactly 2

lower
finally note that by default ichol references the lower triangle of the input matrix and returns a lower triangular factors

smaller model
consider a model with lots of factors or nonlinear terms like bs ns or poly the model frame is much smaller compared with model matrix

if your in the market for a templating engine twig a new templating engine used by symfony is much better than smarty imho

better
if you use twig which i like better than smarty - although i still prefer self-restraint+plain php most ide s that support django templating should work with it since the syntax is nearly the same

not less then
minimum 1.6.0 is not less then range maximum 1.0.0 inclusion is

less
this obviously means that range is less than its minimum of 1

not less
minimum 1.6.0 is not less then range maximum 1.0.0 inclusion is

smaller
a range is contiguous when there is no value one smaller than the minimum and no value one bigger than the maximum and there is no gap within the range

less
i have hinted at my analysis of the problem finding the common range of depth values across all datasets and you should be able to track through how i have implemented this in excel to cater for cases where some datasets might contain depth values which are less than the minimum of the common range or which are greater than its maximum or possibly both

greater
the smallest most negative value that does not cause a range error is the one greater than the minimum exponent minus the number of bits of mantissa

much closer
for any particular set of hyperparameters this range is much closer to the minimum response than to the maximum

longer
to summarize the problem given time range t1 and t2 on day d how can i determine the remaining time left in d that is longer than the minimum time block m

more
the objective function is guaranteed to be finite and contionuous in the interpolation range along with its first and second derivatives and has no more than one minimum in this range if it has no minimum it is monotonic

larger
if the 32-bit float range is larger than -1..1 then you need to find the minimum and maximum values and calculate a scale factor that gets the samples within the int16 range

lower
the cause for an integer overflow is when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value

wider
for example the language standard only mandates minimum range for types like short int and long but they may be wider than the minimum requirements

greater
the reductive point here is the expression can actually be simplified to just the range that has the greater minimum value and the lesser maximum value

higher
145 the output is like √¢ ¬∫√¢ √¢ √¢ ¬∫√¢ √¢ it doesn t reverse when the range is higher than 145 it works fine in gcc for borland turboc the minimum range must be 65 otherwise the program prints strange values instead of reversing it

greater
how about for integer values you specify a range and a predicate that specifies the value must be greater than minimum less than maximum instead

less
the unfortunate side effect is that half your circle will be cut off as it extends into the range that is less than your minimum value

better idea
using settimeout for such purposes is better idea than setinterval as you don t have to clear them and they won t get crowded - if your fight takes longer than period then this won t run into next fight

better
if so then you can just pop lines off the array using settimeout which is better than setinterval for most animations

better
also settimeout is a better approach than setinterval as you explicitly reset it on each round trip

more aesthetic experience
also in my experience at least settimeout offers a much more aesthetic experience than setinterval or requestanimationframe

better
but settimeout would be better than setinterval because with setinterval if your previous ajax request is not complete and you start another request there will have multiple requests which would sooner be problematic

less efficient
keep in mind that using setinterval is less efficient for this case then using settimeout which doesn t require comparing times at all as it schedules the alarm to occur at a particular time as setinterval will use more processor cycles to both schedule a check and then to compare the times

more appropriate
also i advise you to take a look at javascript s setinterval since it is more appropriate than settimeout for what you want to do

less
i read that settimeout is less cpu resources intensive than setinterval

better approach
also settimeout is a better approach than setinterval as you explicitly reset it on each round trip

less cpu
i read that settimeout is less cpu resources intensive than setinterval

more
setinterval is more useful than settimeout here as it recurs automatically and you don t need to keep setting it

better
i understand from searching on so that setinterval is a better way to approach this that settimeout which i was using initially but i haven t figured out how to specify that the function needs to repeat

much more
setinterval is much more suited for countdown timers and things you need to run continually since settimeout only runs once and you need to keep on calling it

better
settimeout is better than setinterval here because setinterval will start at every 5 secs but settimeout will start once each time your job is done and wait for 5 seconds which will make your script adaptive to server response timings

less
keep in mind that using setinterval is less efficient for this case then using settimeout which doesn t require comparing times at all as it schedules the alarm to occur at a particular time as setinterval will use more processor cycles to both schedule a check and then to compare the times

more useful
now a routine to initiate once per second - settimeout is usually more useful than setinterval

bigger
it seems that settimeout has bigger priority than setinterval which could be delayed

safer
i think using settimeout is safer than setinterval

simpler
as for me settimeout is simpler than setinterval in this case as you won t need to clearinterval in the end of the array

better solution
it uses settimeout however settimeout is a better solution than setinterval because it will only queue a new one if the previous one is complete

often better
also setinterval is often better replaced by settimeout

usually more useful
now a routine to initiate once per second - settimeout is usually more useful than setinterval

cleaner
i find setinterval is a little cleaner than chaining settimeout calls

usually more
now a routine to initiate once per second - settimeout is usually more useful than setinterval

more relevant
settimeout is more relevant than setinterval since the first method just waits for a delay and executes a logic whereas the second function is meant for repeating a logic on periodic intervals

better way
setinterval would be the better way than settimeout

more
and im not shure about this statement javascript likes settimeout more than setinterval which gives a little performance boost

better
using settimeout is considered better than setinterval because of the screwy ways that js s event loop works

better way
i understand from searching on so that setinterval is a better way to approach this that settimeout which i was using initially but i haven t figured out how to specify that the function needs to repeat

timer more preferably
the use of one settimeout timer is more preferably than several setinterval timers

more accurate
well setinterval and settimeout essentially try to do the same thing but for your case setinterval method will be more accurate than settimeout

bigger priority
it seems that settimeout has bigger priority than setinterval which could be delayed

timer more

less
from here you also need to take into account if the user inputs a value higher than the max year of the data and also less than the minimum

first i run a query to find the min and max for each security id then find the difference between the min and max and finally find a value that is 10 more than the minimum like this

lower
my question is can we set max stack size lower than the minimum stack size which may be 4 kb for the goroutines

less
all numbers will always be equal to or greater than the minimum value or equal to or less than the max value

less
now you are iterating exactly like your example with one change to know what is the next set you are moving to you have to replace every number in the current set with the next number in the array and replace the max option that less than the minimum you are saving

price less
i m simply checking the values of two input textboxes and alerting the user if the max price is less than the minimum price but they re evaluating backwards

smaller
the minimum requirement and smaller than the max requirement

value greater
4.if minimum value is greater than the current value in array than add difference of than in ans add the difference with current value update max from left

less
i m simply checking the values of two input textboxes and alerting the user if the max price is less than the minimum price but they re evaluating backwards

why is the max time which happens on the first iteration of the loop 2-4x longer than the minimum time

greater
if it were possible to find such a cut then max-flow min-cut would not be true the max flow of the network would be greater than the minimum capacity of an s-t cut

higher
in this example i would want to flag the following records in my data 2 lower than the minimum for x and 4 higher than the max for y

if i is rather little just iterate and keep i minimum datas insert every new data in a binary tree of the i most little datas if it is less than the max of these datas

and regarding your first question it is definitely possible to encrypt decrypt messages directly using rsa there are only technical and performance reasons aes is much faster than rsa why rsa is used only to encrypt a session key and aes is used to encrypt decrypt the messages themselves

while 256-bit aes might sound less secure than 4096-bit rsa they might actually be quite similar from the offered protection

there are two reasons for that performance aes is faster then rsa and resources aes is less resource hungry than rsa

faster
the aes key is encrypting much more data but is much faster than rsa encryption

much more computationally
note however that doing so means that each encrypted chunk has its own padding and that rsa is much more computationally expensive than aes

less user-friendly
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes

more
asymmetric key encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric key encryption ex aes

more so
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation

faster
so the 115 seconds will be reduced to 3-4 secs plus the encryption decryption time used for aes which is much faster than rsa

more secure
asymmetric encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric encryption ex aes

less
there are two reasons for that performance aes is faster then rsa and resources aes is less resource hungry than rsa

slower
as far as efficiency rsa is going to be orders of magnitudes slower than aes so the trade-off you make is that you give up simplicity you give up the simplicity of using aes in favor of some rsa chunking in return for poor performance you get the slower performance of rsa.

faster
execution of aes is more faster than rsa for same key sizes

much more
note however that doing so means that each encrypted chunk has its own padding and that rsa is much more computationally expensive than aes

encrypt faster then
it shows that rsa encrypt is faster then aes encrypt

faster
there are two reasons for that performance aes is faster then rsa and resources aes is less resource hungry than rsa

faster
the whole purpose of using aes to secure the communication or any symmetric key encryption is that it s a lot faster than rsa or any public key encryption

faster then
there are two reasons for that performance aes is faster then rsa and resources aes is less resource hungry than rsa

much slower
one of the reasons to do so is that rsa is much slower than for example aes

much slower
like you heard asymmetric cryptography like rsa is much slower than symmetric cryptography aes but it does have it s advantages simpler key management a single private key to protect

less
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

less secure
how is aes less secure than rsa in this scenario

more faster
execution of aes is more faster than rsa for same key sizes

much faster
and regarding your first question it is definitely possible to encrypt decrypt messages directly using rsa there are only technical and performance reasons aes is much faster than rsa why rsa is used only to encrypt a session key and aes is used to encrypt decrypt the messages themselves

more
execution of aes is more faster than rsa for same key sizes

less strenght
in your particular case an rsa key of 2048 bits has a lot less strenght than an aes key of 256 bits

larger
considering most rsa moduli are at least 1024 bit this will be much larger than an aes key

key less
but if you use public key encryption to encrypt messages you are a limited to small messages -- a 1024 bit rsa key encrypts less than 128 bytes and b going to pay in performance because public key encryption is much more costly than symmetric key encryption such as aes encryption

more
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation

less safe
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

safer
use daemons mode and then simply touching the wsgi script file when an atomic set of changes have been completed isn t that hard and certainly safer than a systemd which restarts arbitrarily when it detects any single change

slower
interpreted-language tend to be but not always are significantly slower than compiled-language

slower
mostly interpreted-language are a bit slower compared with compiled-language but i guess the difference is almost negligible in coffeescript javascript because of node.js

slower
interpreted-language execution speed are slower than compiled-language true but once there is need for more speed you can call in compiled stuff through gems or micro services

slower natively
it should be noted that interpreted-language are inherently many time slower than natively compiled-language

slower
this is a good question but should be formulated a little different in my opinion for example why are interpreted-language slower than compiled-language

less common
this is usually seen in dynamic interpreted-language but is less common in compiled-language

probably easier
while java could be described as a compiled and interpreted-language it s probably easier to think of java itself as a compiled-language and java bytecode as an interpreted-language

slower
an interpreted-language will typically run one to two orders of magnitude slower than a compiled-language

smaller
my guess is that in interpreted-language the efficiency benefit in using switch statements is indeed smaller than in compiled-language

more overhead
especially in an interpreted-language like php where classes add more overhead than a compiled-language

slower
naturally interpreted-language will run slower than compiled-language as compiled code can be ran blindly by the cpu where as compiled code needs to be checked ran line by line

slower
while ruby and python are both interpreted-language and operation-for-operation slower than compiled-language the reality is in executing an application only a small portion of cpu time is spent in your code and the majority is spent into the built-in libraries you call into which are often native implementations and thus are as fast as compiled code

significantly better
performance of programs in compiled-language is significantly better than that of an interpreted-language

surely easier
an interpreted-language surely makes it easier but this is still entirely possible with compiled-language like c

slower other
python is an interpreted-language so by definition is slower than other compiled-language but the drawback in the execution speed is not even noticeable in most of applications

slower
and perl like any interpreted-language is much slower than a compiled-language

much slower
and perl like any interpreted-language is much slower than a compiled-language

faster
in my general programming experience compiled c c++ programs generally run faster than most other compiled-language like java or even compiled python and almost always run faster than interpreted-language like uncompiled python or javascript

faster
that being said a compiled-language like c will almost always be faster than an interpreted-language like javascript

better
are compiled-language better than interpreted-language or vice-versa

less
this is usually seen in dynamic interpreted-language but is less common in compiled-language

faster
from what i know a compiled-language such as c++ is much faster than an interpreted-language such as javascript

slower
php is an interpreted-language so will run a little slower than a compiled-language

less performant
interpreted-language are inherently less performant than compiled-language - c will generally outperform python - some operations more than others

better performance
writing in a compiled-language java or c++ in your examples would almost certainly give better performance than an interpreted-language like php

slower
this makes interpreted-language generally slower than compiled-language due to the overhead of running the vm or interpreter

more performant
then c which is one those languages closer to the processor level is very performant and generally speaking compiled-language because they turn your code into assembly language are more performant than interpreted-language

slower
fact is that interpreted-language like php are always slower than a compiled-language

faster
a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code

this redeclaration allows a cleaner way to access and mutate the property internally without resorting to fragile ivar synthesis which is becoming an antiquity now that the compiler does it for you

also be aware that if the height of the printable area that is page height minus top and bottom margin is less than the height of your cell content then it s impossible for the browser to avoid breaking it unless it can somehow warp the fabric of space maybe firefox has a -moz- property for that

greater
you ll need to set the top margin for whatever item you want under it to be greater than the height of your navbar in order for it to show up correctly

larger
sometimes when enough content items is added this div height is larger than windows and part of div content is not visible at all it stays bellow page margin

larger
also you need to be careful about your content - in the fiddle you used h4 and p tags and these have a default top bottom margin set by the browser - if this margin is larger than the space available in the percentage height div it will push the content out of vertical alignment

smaller

#footer s height is more than 800px so the #container should lose its top margin value by touching #footer and continue scrolling the page without that floating div

.footer minus
i have use height 100vh for .container and pulled .footer up by minus margin

smaller
i assume margintop can t be solved since im setting margin top to -820 in order to get at a point of top 275 therefore screens smaller than 1200px height the div will go much higher...

lower
this may be ommited once height is lower than available - thus negative margin may work

more
by default browsers add a margin to the body causing the body to actually take up more than 100 height 100 plus whatever the margin is

top greater
however an algorith could be something like if the new margin top is greater than the height of the current note and the difference between the offet of the current note anchor and the following note anchor is less than the height of the current note than subtract the height of the current note from the new margin

your listview item s height is looking bigger because your are applying 17dp padding and 4dp margin at the top and 7dp padding and 4dp margin at the bottom of the textview ...so its taking total 32dp extra space excluding your textview

the first row has a height that is much larger than the margin bottom of its .content div so that the margin-bottom is contained and should not effect anything outside of its container

the margin will be greater than the height of the iframe

less
it is treating the floated ul as position absolute but only when its height is less than or equal to the negative top margin on its containing parent

bigger page
you cant see 45 barcodes because their margin is bigger than page height

smaller
the problem with your logic is that it doesn t incorporate the maximum distance the child is allowed to move in the top direction it will jump in 50 pixel steps and in case the newly calculated child height is smaller than the parent it just stops where it would also need to limit the margin to the maximum similar to what you are already doing for the bottom direction

actually greater
css height 100 gives an element height that is actually greater than 100 by the size of the margin

greater

easier
i have heard that configobj is easier to use than configparser even though it is not a built-in library

faster
the reason i wanted to investigate this was because both c and ocaml were significantly faster than haskell for this program

more momentum
haskell has more momentum these days but there are plenty of good parsing libraries for ocaml as well including the peg parser generator aurochs menhir and the glr parser generator dypgen

fewer
haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction

less code
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor

more intuitive
you will also likely find the performance characteristics of your ocaml code more intuitive than haskell because of haskell s lazy evaluation

higher level
haskell has higher level bindings to llvm than ocaml the haskell ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and haskell has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components

closer
ocaml is closer to c++ because of it s imperative and oo features but i recommend you learn haskell as it is more functional more mindbending and has more resources

zipwith friendlier

little more
the bad we use a break that is little more than a tamed goto something like goto the end of the loop

cleaner solution
to any seasoned developer of a c-like language break will both read better as well as provide a cleaner solution than goto

better
nevertheless in my opinion break is not much better than goto its both not a good programming style

worse
the idea of saying break out of the nth nested loop is worse than a goto from a structural perspective

worse
but break is no better or worse than goto

more restrictive
it is the equivalent of a goto but is more restrictive in that labels may be used only in break or continue statements

simpler
if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks

if udp payload size is bigger than mtu size udp will silently segment the packet

smaller
ideally your udp frames are smaller than the mtu for your architecture say 1500 bytes so the messages won t get chopped up in transit

bigger
note that udp packets bigger than the mtu s at every hope between your hosts will be split by ip

bigger
they are easily generated for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu

larger
when send a udp datagram larger than the mtu size only the last fragment of the udp datagram is putted out to the destination

greater
udp packets greater than the mtu size of the network that carries them will be automatically split up into multiple packets and then reassembled by the recipient

bigger
udp uses datagrams chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the mtu but that s a different story

larger
what would happen if my udp package is larger than mtu

smaller
to send large blocks of data via udp you need to chop them up into pieces smaller than the mtu for the network segment across which you re transmitting them

less
in real life udp packets size usually is equal or less than mtu size

larger
my lwip can send udp packets to pc but my pc would fail to reassemble when the udp packets are larger than mtu

larger
basically while sending udp packets larger than mtu ip fragmentation can occur if it s supported on your platform but not all platforms support it

datagram larger
ever since i did sockets programming on a pdp 11 it s been the case that ip fragmentation will take care of the case where an ip datagram such as a udp datagram is larger than the mtu for the segment allows

faster
this is because quicksort is generally faster than heapsort unless the call depth becomes to deep

actually worse
worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

usually faster then
in practice however quicksort is usually faster then heapsort

slower
quicksort time complexity is typically o n log n but it s worst case is o n 2 which is avoided with the switch to heapsort since heapsort is always o n log n but slower than quicksort so it s only used to avoid o n 2

better big-o
heapsort has a better big-o than say quicksort yet quicksort performs much better in practice

worse
in theory quicksort is worse than heapsort

worse
however quicksort s worst-case performance is significantly worse than heapsort s is

suddenly worse
for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory quicksort becomes suddenly worse then heapsort and mergesort

better choice
in short - if all we care about are comparisons heapsort is a better choice than quicksort

way quicker
after several tests i found out that my heapsort is way quicker than quicksort i think it should be the other way around my selection sort is also faster than insertion sort

faster
if i do heapsort i can create the stack while i m sorting but would this be faster than a quicksort and then build the stack afterwords

better
can anyone explain why heapsort performs better and under what circumstances quichesort would be better than both quicksort and heapsort

faster
in their respective worst cases heapsort is faster than quicksort

higher overhead
heapsort has higher overhead than quicksort but its worst case is o n log n vs

slower
the reason heapsort is slower in practice than quicksort is due to the better locality of reference in quicksort where data elements are within relatively close storage locations

usually faster
in practice however quicksort is usually faster then heapsort

slower
because heapsort is actually slower than quicksort for each n

better
heapsort has a better big-o than say quicksort yet quicksort performs much better in practice

better
why it is said quicksort has better constant factor than heapsort and therefore quicksort is better than heapsort in average

less
so for even small inputs quicksort does less work than heapsort and is physically faster for every n

better
it is a variant of heapsort which is particularly suitable for the sorting of very large amounts of data if a relatively high cost per compare operation is needed and on average better than quicksort

slower
however heapsort is slower than quicksort in the average case in the sense that heapsort performs c n log n whereas quicksort has d n log n performance with d being significantly smaller than c the numbers c and d are constants

faster
the difference is large enough that the constant factor in front of the n log n term in quicksort is lower than the constant factor in front of the n log n term in heapsort which is one reason why quicksort is much faster than heapsort

faster
when you say something like heapsort should be faster than quicksort what makes you say that

much faster
the difference is large enough that the constant factor in front of the n log n term in quicksort is lower than the constant factor in front of the n log n term in heapsort which is one reason why quicksort is much faster than heapsort

lower
the difference is large enough that the constant factor in front of the n log n term in quicksort is lower than the constant factor in front of the n log n term in heapsort which is one reason why quicksort is much faster than heapsort

better constant
why it is said quicksort has better constant factor than heapsort and therefore quicksort is better than heapsort in average

actually slower
because heapsort is actually slower than quicksort for each n

less work
so for even small inputs quicksort does less work than heapsort and is physically faster for every n

slower
in the event that the quicksort starts to degenerate it uses heapsort which is o n log n worst-case but slightly slower than quicksort on average to guarantee o n log n worst-case runtimes

faster
so for instance heapsort is faster than quicksort in the worst case but slower in the average case

worse
worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

smaller sets
i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort

worse
from what i heard quicksort should have better average case performance but from my tests it performs 4 times worse than heapsort for array of random integers

higher
heapsort has higher overhead than quicksort but its worst case is o n log n vs

suddenly worse then
for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory quicksort becomes suddenly worse then heapsort and mergesort

better
in short - if all we care about are comparisons heapsort is a better choice than quicksort

each iteration in quicksort is a lot simpler than heapsort

more efficient
average asymptotic order of quicksort is o nlogn and it s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops

faster
for example quicksort is faster than heapsort in general although their time complexity are the same

better
asymptotic analysis reveals order of growth of heapsort in the worst case is big-o n logn which is better than quicksort s big-o n 2 as a worst case

more comparisons
you can indeed show that on average quicksort will do more comparisons than heapsort roughly 1.44 n log 2 n for quicksort versus n log 2 n versus heapsort

faster
what makes quicksort faster than heapsort in practice is its constant that was ignored by big o analysis

generally faster
this is because quicksort is generally faster than heapsort unless the call depth becomes to deep

slower
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

faster
for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort

significantly slower
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

also better
quicksort also has a better cache access behavior than heapsort

quicker
after several tests i found out that my heapsort is way quicker than quicksort i think it should be the other way around my selection sort is also faster than insertion sort

also better cache
quicksort also has a better cache access behavior than heapsort

higher
in other words the per-comparison-overhead of heapsort is higher than the one of quicksort

somewhat slower
however heapsort is somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort

less efficient
in fact the heapsort algorithm works this way first arrange a random order into heap order and then obtain a sorted order somewhat less efficient than quicksort on average

worse
in theory insertion sort and quicksort are worse than heapsort

slower
from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin

directly faster
technically accessing the ivar directly is faster than using accessor but there are very few situations in which it will make a significant performance difference and would probably be a case of premature optimization

faster
nonatomic properties don t use locks but direct ivar is faster because it skips the accessor call

cheaper
i see that the microcontroller used in commercial devices are much cheaper than the avr or pic

mbprogresshud has more features than uialertview so it might be better suited and more easily adapted for your purposes

more features
mbprogresshud has more features than uialertview so it might be better suited and more easily adapted for your purposes

better solution
i should also mention that crypt has this built-in and may be a better solution than md5

better practice
in ... for-loop it s consider better practice to loops trough it with a regular for

faster
the other advice i have is that a for-each loops is faster than a for-loop

much closer
the way you are using the kotlin for-loop is much closer to java s foreach loops for i indexes

slower
the foreach loops is slower than the for-loop yet most people don t rewrite all of their code to use the for

slower
max_size must be big enough because a for-loop is slower than lapply you want to do as little loops through the for as possible but not too big or the list extension overhead will make the program slower

more time
since i am using two for loops it is consuming more time and is affecting the execution time of my entire program which already had a for-loop

better
usually if you re going to consume all the elements of the iterator in a single loops it is better to use the for-loop approach and it will be better using the enhanced for-loop that already uses iterator behind the scenes

more
in a language like c a for-loop is more or less syntactic sugar for a while loops

simpler
to my mind a for-loop is simpler to understand than traversing the list backwards with a while loops

greater
so i decide instead of writing out chucks of code for each of the 10 possible health point not to mention there are other player stats that will be done in the same format i decided upon scraping together a for-loop with two if-else statements to attempt a loops to fill each grid element as long as the health value is greater than the for-loop s i

faster foreach
why simd for-loop only 14 faster than foreach loops

always more readable
lastly whenever you want to iterate x amount of times a for-loop is always more readable than a while loops that uses a counter variable

more
can anyone explain why the while loops is taking more time than the for-loop even though the looping of i and j is almost same

shorter
according to benchmark both sefan and the while loops answers take the same ammount of time fruity the while loops answers take a bit shorter with the for-loop answers in second but the multiple loops do answers take far longer

probably better
thus your for-loop is probably better expressed as following while loops

preferably faster
i prefer using for-loop instead of foreach loops for-loop is preferably faster than foreach loops when you do not have to do something to each element and can solve your problem by just using the index as follows

more readable
also the for-loop is more readable than the while loops because it puts all loops variable manipulation in one place

more expensive
it s worth pointing out that in general the foreach loops is more expensive memory-wise compared to the for-loop see here for details

more flexibility
a c-style for-loop has more flexibility but ultimately you can write an equivalent loops with python s while or c s while for that matter which touches not only on the √¢ ≈ìone obvious way√¢ principle but also √¢ ≈ìsimple is better than complex√¢ amongst others

better
a for-loop fits better to your requirements than a while loops

more
a for-loop should be used don t you think what loops makes is more clearly stated in the for-loop

much simpler
using for-loop is much simpler if you use condition as limit for breaking loops

more convenient
you should use a for-loop which is more convenient to loops in an arrays

more
note that the for-loop based on the string assignment a_string runs one time more than loops based on the inline assignment a_inline -- notice the last number -3.46945e-18

more efficient
my view is that option 1 is clumsy code and involves unnecessary creation of an arrays even though the for-each loops is more efficient than the traditional for-loop in option 2

better then
then you should achive them with a counter and maybe a for-loop is better then while loops

less
they are functionally identical however it can be argued that the for-loop is less error prone because all of loops functionality is right there together

better
your while loops would be better written as a for-loop

always more
lastly whenever you want to iterate x amount of times a for-loop is always more readable than a while loops that uses a counter variable

better
your while loops always runs a fixed number of times so from a stylistic point of view you would be better off with a for-loop

more
i m working on an app to load an amount of images from sd card using asynctask + for-loop i ve test the app on my galaxy nexus the app working perfectly but it will crash if i use more than 33 loops

easier
2 second loops is and easier for-loop to read

faster
but according to this answer a for-loop is executed faster than the equivalent while loops

bigger
i have the impression that the implementantion has something to do with a for-loop and some kind of adaptive delay that gets bigger as loops count increases

slower normal
if you are using any js loops then for each loops is slower than normal for-loop you might wanna take a look at this

more
also a while loops seems more appropriate and self-explanatory in this situation than a for-loop

faster
this conclusion would follow from a logic if an unrolled loops is faster than a for-loop executing a lot of unrolled loops should be faster than executing a lot of for loops

more sense
a while loops makes more sense in this situation or a for-loop without initialization

slower
the while loops with decrements was approximately 1.5 times slower than the for-loop

better c#
here i started above testing with the aim that c for-loop performance will be better than c# loops but it goes exactly opposite with my understanding and gone with this question and agreed...but when i increase the upper range of for-loop the c performance goes well as compared to c#.

more operations
i suspect your curly braces aren t in the correct place as per scheff s comment the scope of the page variable is contained within the for-loop and you are attempting to do more operations after loops is over

more
salu is used for-loop counter so when you nest them more salu pressure is done and becomes a bottleneck when there are more than 9-10 loops nested maybe some intelligent algorithm using same counter for all loops should do the trick so not doing only salu in loops body but adding some valu instructions is a plus

much more
i think using for-loop is much more easier than using foreach loops to do this

more
a for-loop is more natural for this than a while loops

header actually more
here the for-loop header takes actually more time than loops body thus profiling results could be distorted.

really more
each line can do one of three things it can call a function which modifies it s argument start a while loops which is really more of a for-loop or assign a variable

bigger range
the result amazed me in the way that as loops goes over bigger range the performance of c# decreases as compared to c..for smaller range c# shown well performance over c....but as upper range of for-loop increases the c# performance degrades as compare to c..

strictly more powerful
the class of problems you can solve with while loops is strictly more powerful than those you could have solved with the strict for-loop found in pascal

faster
the for-loop is faster than the while loops when n 1000000 each takes roughly 0.105544 and 0.2389421

better thought
a while loops is better thought of as a looping version of an if statement than akin to a for-loop

faster
the decremented while loops is still faster than the for-loop or the incremented while loops with length upper limit comparison by a fair margin

more
a c-style for-loop has more flexibility but ultimately you can write an equivalent loops with python s while or c s while for that matter which touches not only on the √¢ ≈ìone obvious way√¢ principle but also √¢ ≈ìsimple is better than complex√¢ amongst others

easier
i find lapply loops easier than a for-loop in your case as initializing the list and using the counter can be avoided

much easier
even if you use a lowly for-loop it s much easier to loops over the elements of a list than it is to construct variable names with paste and access the objects with get

slower
the only browser where the while loops was slower than the for-loop was in opera

closer
in practical programming languages the distinction between the two is a bit blurred but is important to know that the c java for-loop is closer to a theoretical while loops while the pascal for behaves more like the theoretical for-loop

more appropriate
also if you can do the above you can probably just as easily turn your code into a for-loop which seems more appropriate given your desire to a break out of loops b use the operator to cause side effects

wider
the scope of the variable in the test of the while loops is wider than the scope of variables declared in the header of the for-loop

more
now i went into this script there are for loops which are adding some values to the classpath for there are more than one for-loop

more
that means you don t know how many iterations you re going to need so a while loops is more suited to this task than a for-loop

nicer
rewriting the while loops as a for-loop is nicer and makes it less likely to get an infinite loops

faster
so why while loops is faster than for-loop and why need bunch of lists

more
a for-loop is more sppropriate than a while loops

more suitable
for-loop is more suitable for any countable loops

faster
to explain why a for-loop is faster than a for in loops is basically understand the underlying data structures used to store the data in memory

more control
i think you can best use the for-loop this gives you a little bit more control over loops

more
additionally you should reset i each time you go through loops and a for-loop makes more sense than a while loops especially if you re using c99 as i can be declared within loops

better fit
which loops is a better fit do while or a for-loop

better
in this case i found while loops is better than for-loop because if i want to achieve the same in for-loop i have to assign the value of counter to another variable

nothing more
a for-loop is nothing more than a glorified while loops

more
its really strange that the same doesn t work with a while loops as is said that a while loops is more fundamental that a for-loop

more natural
a for-loop is more natural for this than a while loops

more
but the the foreach loops takes more time than a the for-loop

slightly longer
the only difference in the two loops is the one if statement in the second double for-loop and loops is slightly longer but in the game the second for-loop is only rendering 3 things as there are only 3 platforms being rendered at this point int time

more
my view is that option 1 is clumsy code and involves unnecessary creation of an arrays even though the for-each loops is more efficient than the traditional for-loop in option 2

more time
can anyone explain why the while loops is taking more time than the for-loop even though the looping of i and j is almost same

clearer
as an aside i would suggest a while loops would be a bit clearer than a for-loop without a next clause

more
a for-loop is more appropriate than a while loops in your code

header actually more time
here the for-loop header takes actually more time than loops body thus profiling results could be distorted.

slower
in example sendp method included in for-loop which is slower than making other loops to send packets

slower
update i made some changes to my code but was already suspecting what others here have already pointed out sure the enhanced for-loop is slower but outside of very trivial tight loops the cost should be a miniscule fraction of the cost of the logic of loops

more
a while loops is more readable than a for-loop

more
since i am using two for loops it is consuming more time and is affecting the execution time of my entire program which already had a for-loop

generally more
if you need to do something a set number of times a for-loop is generally more concise than a while loops

faster
also the native for-loop is faster than any other jquery loops method

imo more complicated
a while loops is imo more complicated to read than a for-loop

greater
the for-loop is using i as a global variable so if your instance.set_marker function is also using i as a global variable and sets its value to something greater than 6 loops will exit

slower
a basic for-loop is slower than a for - loops with simplified test condition

better
note using apply functions instead of a for-loop is better but it depends on the actual purpose of your loops

slower
can you explain me why in this case the parfor loops is slower than the for-loop

more
the incrementor in the for-loop is more of a while 1 endless loops

faster
for-loop is faster then foreach and foreach is faster then for in loops

more
on the other hand for-loop is more like counter based where you want to specify for how many times should loops happened

slower
i would expect a while loops to be slower than a for-loop since it needs to test a condition before each iteration

more
a while loops or do...while loops is more appropriate here than a for-loop because you do not know how many times the user wants to execute loops

faster
on windows the while loops above is 20 faster than the original for-loop in google-chrome in ie and firefox both loops perform the same

generally more concise
if you need to do something a set number of times a for-loop is generally more concise than a while loops

much more easier
i think using for-loop is much more easier than using foreach loops to do this

faster
so we can see that an optimised while loops is faster than a for-loop by 2 operations however it uses more stack space

better
which loops is a better fit do while or a for-loop

slightly slower
the other option is to use a foreach loops which is slightly slower than a for-loop but works almost equivalently for all practical purposes

more sppropriate
a for-loop is more sppropriate than a while loops

faster
i just wanted to point out my answer since i know for-loop is faster then loops

more appropriate
a while loops or do...while loops is more appropriate here than a for-loop because you do not know how many times the user wants to execute loops

slower
therefore the parfor loops simply must be slower than the for-loop because it has to transmit data to the workers for them to operate on

there better way
but certainly wrong syntax in the for-loop is there better way to code it so that after loops i can get

larger
although both approaches are o n the for-loop has a larger constant because of loops overhead

more
again same error but while loops clearly survived more than for-loop

more
for looping over lines in files you can use a for-loop which is more readable than while loops

more sense
a while loops makes more sense to me than your use of a for-loop

still faster
the decremented while loops is still faster than the for-loop or the incremented while loops with length upper limit comparison by a fair margin

faster
is for-loop is faster than while loops

more clearly
a for-loop should be used don t you think what loops makes is more clearly stated in the for-loop

more flexibility
to achieve the actual goal you maybe able to use plain for-loop which provides more flexibility in controlling loops instead of using while

more readable
a while loops is more readable than a for-loop

faster speed foreach
arraylist - for-loop is about more than 2 times faster speed than foreach loops

more
for-loop is more suitable for any countable loops

simpler
this is one of the few cases where a while loops can be clearer and simpler than a for-loop

slower
however arrayfun is just a for-loop in disguise and is often slower than writing loops explicitly

easier
secondly you will find a for-loop is easier than a do loops for implementing the logic as you don t need to keep track of loops counter manually

more
in a for-loop of more than 100 loops

better faster
if you won t be changing the string in loops it is better faster to store the value in and then include it in the for-loop

usually faster
a for-loop is usually faster than a while loops and it is more difficult to build an endless loops than it is by using a while loops

faster
having said i am really not sure why you are getting unexpected behavior i ran your code both in eclipse and intellij ide and i always got for-loop approach as faster than while loops

faster
one place where the enhanced for-loop is faster than a naively implemented traditional loops is something like this

better
you need here while loops better than for-loop

astronomically slower
in my tests i found that one of the loops i tested titled for-loop is astronomically slower than the other loops

typically several more
i noticed some time ago that a for-loop typically generates several more machine instructions than a while loops

faster
a for-loop is faster than a foreach loops

better as
in your case for-loop is better as changed in loops value is numeric

better
if you won t be changing the string in loops it is better faster to store the value in and then include it in the for-loop

syntax cleaner
the range-based for-loop syntax is cleaner and more universal but you can t execute the code in loops for a specified range different than from begin to end

faster foreach
i prefer using for-loop instead of foreach loops for-loop is preferably faster than foreach loops when you do not have to do something to each element and can solve your problem by just using the index as follows

better
if i have to use the value of counter in my program then i think while loops is better than for-loop

slower
the multiprocessed loops is slower than doing the for-loop

slower
foreach can simplify the code in a for-loop but it is a heavy object and is slower than a loops written using for.

actually faster
hey guys can anyone tell me why my code in this jsperf seems to indicate that a for-loop is actually faster than a while loops

3x faster
says that enhanced for loops is 3x faster than the regular for-loop well that great and its easier to write anyways but what if i need the index

faster
as the simple for-loop is faster than a foreach loops

better
this is why a regular for-loop is better to use for this scenario rather than a foreach loops

generally faster
a single for-loop is generally faster than using 2 nested for loops to traverse the image with x y counters

faster
this is happening because of speed of for-loop which is faster than your time .as loops iterates in time of less than miliseconds and generates values.you can only call it when you want to insert single value to database and don t iterate for values

faster foreach
because i heard that for-loop is much faster than foreach loops

slightly slower
the for-loop is slightly slower than the foreach loops

slower
is the foreach loops slower than the for-loop

more time
finally we concluded after we put print statement inside for-loop that it will take much more time than loops in the first case without print statement

more advantages
for-loop is widly used and has more advantages over while loops but ther are some cases when while loops is perferable

cleaner
this is a use case where a for-loop is cleaner to use than a while loops

faster
i ve done a small experiment as will be shown below and it looks like that a while loops is faster than a for-loop in perl

much easier
and last if you know the number of loops it is much easier and better to read when you use a for-loop instead of a while loops

clearer
really a while loops would probably have been clearer than a for-loop on reflection

imo more
a while loops is imo more complicated to read than a for-loop

bigger
the result amazed me in the way that as loops goes over bigger range the performance of c# decreases as compared to c..for smaller range c# shown well performance over c....but as upper range of for-loop increases the c# performance degrades as compare to c..

better
imho loops looks better with a for-loop iterating in the right direction

slower
based on this not created by me the while loops is 22 slower than a for-loop in general

more time
i have an expensive for-loop that is taking more time than it should due to dynamic casting overhead inside loops

tighter
the while loops seems tighter than a for-loop from previous answer but look up for vs while logic

slower plain
it might be better than a for-loop in the terms of readability maintainability but keep in mind that linq usually slower than plain loops tl

more
i m binding a grid view inside a for-loop which executes more than once.now when loops ends the data in grid view is the data binded at the last run of for-loop i.e all previous binds in the for-loop over overwritten.i dont want this .i want new rows to be inserted at each run of the for-loop ..plz help somebody

about more
arraylist - for-loop is about more than 2 times faster speed than foreach loops

better
i found a simple condition where using while loops is better than for-loop

more
a for-loop is more natural than a while loops but you requested no for

more
a while loops makes more sense in this situation or a for-loop without initialization

more convenient
also as an aside objective-c has a foreach loops that is more convenient than manually setting up a for-loop with a counter

slower
however the while loops remains a little slower than the for-loop

better
that is because that style of loops is a better fit for what you are doing than the for-loop you used earlier

neater
putting the whole thing in a for-loop makes it neater and ensures that the iterating isread is called each loops

more
also as an aside objective-c has a foreach loops that is more convenient than manually setting up a for-loop with a counter

faster
the reverse while loops is generally faster than a for-loop as well

better

more time
here the for-loop header takes actually more time than loops body thus profiling results could be distorted.

more
i have an expensive for-loop that is taking more time than it should due to dynamic casting overhead inside loops

much slower
if the above is true doesn t this mean that the foreach loops is much slower then the common for-loop since it involves making copies of each element of the arrays

easier
further as a for-loop it is easier to read as everything initialization loops condition expression to be executed after each iteration are all on one line

better
using a while loops we can control the flow of i better than a for-loop

faster
i did this with for-loop too and while loops was clearly faster than for-loop again

faster
even if a foreach loops were faster than a for-loop there are still operations being carried out that wouldn t be in your manual example

much faster
i did test it a while ago with the result that a for-loop is much faster than a foreach loops

less
i personally think the while loops looks less clean than the nested for-loop

generally better
the conclusion of the article is that using for-loop is generally better and faster than the foreach loops

more
now assuming that your inner loops is more complex and the simple for-loop is slower let s look at how much memory we save by avoiding broadcasted data in a parfor with 4 workers and a dataset with 50 million rows for about 760 mb in ram

neater
note my use of a foreach loops here which is much neater than your for-loop for this kind of thing

bigger n
the main problem i know is the while loops the logic behind it is not correct because last didah is always bigger than n for-loop counter

more
as others have stated the python for-loop is more like a a traditional foreach loops in the sense that it iterates over a collection of items without checking a condition

more
i came across a situation where i need to implement a for-loop with more than one loops control variable

faster
the while loops runs 3000 times faster than the for-loop

quicker
in theory the while loops is quicker because the for-loop looks up the length attribute of foo every time though loops but in real-world use it s going to make an immeasurably small difference

more appropriate
a for-loop is more appropriate than a while loops in your code

more appropriate
also a while loops seems more appropriate and self-explanatory in this situation than a for-loop

better
0 a do while loops that pre-decrements count --count and compares to zero is better than a for-loop that compares two variables

more
also the for-loop is more readable than the while loops because it puts all loops variable manipulation in one place

more sense
additionally you should reset i each time you go through loops and a for-loop makes more sense than a while loops especially if you re using c99 as i can be declared within loops

more simpler
loops in c++ are most basic than python the for-loop is more simpler it is based on the three expression initializer expression loops test expression and the counting expression

faster
and normal for-loop is faster than for-in loops

faster then
i just wanted to point out my answer since i know for-loop is faster then loops

larger
alternatively you could initialize i outside of the for-loop but then it s scoped larger than loops itself

slower
you could also use a for each loops to handle this though that type of loops is slower than a standard for-loop depending on application

better
i think that instead of a for-loop is better a while because when you find your item can break loops

larger
a becomes 10 while it is still inside of the for-loop and gets larger than 10 when the while loops goes for a second run

less clean
i personally think the while loops looks less clean than the nested for-loop

better
but is there any specific situation when while loops is better than for-loop

more complex
now assuming that your inner loops is more complex and the simple for-loop is slower let s look at how much memory we save by avoiding broadcasted data in a parfor with 4 workers and a dataset with 50 million rows for about 760 mb in ram

more time
but the the foreach loops takes more time than a the for-loop

larger constant
although both approaches are o n the for-loop has a larger constant because of loops overhead

slower
a loops using a callback function like the standard foreach was approximately 10 times slower than the for-loop

faster
some people use array.prototype.slice to do that but i m not a fan and i think a for-loop is faster in most browsers - but either way i have nothing against for loops and the slice often feels like a hack to me

more
it s worth pointing out that in general the foreach loops is more expensive memory-wise compared to the for-loop see here for details

more
i am adding views dynamically to linear layout in a for-loop of more than 100 loops

typically several more machine
i noticed some time ago that a for-loop typically generates several more machine instructions than a while loops

faster
i think in terms of performance using a single for-loop is faster am i right 3 linqs will be eventually converted to 3 loops

version slower
the nested loops version is the slower of the two due to the extra the interpreter overhead of the for-loop

much faster
in some cases hand-writing a for-loop is much faster than the equivalent accelerate functions because the compiler can optimize your loops better than the function

slower
if you are using any js loops then for each loops is slower than normal for-loop you might wanna take a look at this

more
to achieve the actual goal you maybe able to use plain for-loop which provides more flexibility in controlling loops instead of using while

strictly more

the for-loop question is more of someone building a loops with exit criterion inside the actual loops

more

more
you should use a for-loop which is more convenient to loops in an arrays

cleaner
xrange will give you an iterable object that won t use memory as you iterate a for-loop is cleaner than a while loops + counter if you ask me

way better
recently i ve stumbled upon a parralel.for loops that performs way better than a regular for-loop for my purposes

faster
even if the hypothesis of the while loops being faster than the for-loop were true and it s not the loops you d had to change optimize wouldn t be the outer ones but the inner ones because those are executed more times

more fundamental
its really strange that the same doesn t work with a while loops as is said that a while loops is more fundamental that a for-loop

not less
the problem is that when the program first gets to the for-loop 9 is not less than 0 so the value is false and it skips loops

faster
loops recur is faster - it s one of the most efficient constructs in clojure done correctly it should match the speed of an equivalent for-loop in java code

easier
instead of using a while loops it is easier to use a for-loop

more readable
for looping over lines in files you can use a for-loop which is more readable than while loops

more natural
a for-loop is more natural than a while loops but you requested no for

the other option is to use a foreach loops which is slightly slower than a for-loop but works almost equivalently for all practical purposes

more
a while loops makes more sense to me than your use of a for-loop

cleaner
your loops would be cleaner as a for-loop

somewhat slower
foreach or for-loop is somewhat slower than an equivalent while loops or tail recursion the benchmark i linked to above shows a 15x performance difference with 1000+ iterations though it will likely depend on the version of scala and the version of the jre...

much slower then
if the above is true doesn t this mean that the foreach loops is much slower then the common for-loop since it involves making copies of each element of the arrays

then you should achive them with a counter and maybe a for-loop is better then while loops

slower
-in the same laptop but using the hpc cluster of my department with 30 workers the parfor loops is much much slower than the for-loop and than the parfor loops using the local cluster with 12 workers

faster then
for-loop is faster then foreach and foreach is faster then for in loops

usually better
as for your question a for-loop is usually better when you want a piece of code to run a certain number of times and a while loops is better when the condition for the code to keep running is more general such as having a boolean flag that is only set to true when a certain condition is met in the code block

opera more columns
the problem is that when there is some fixed height opera generates more columns than specified in column-count instead of adding scroll

bigger available
try with 1 column-count and as text get bigger than available height it will auto split in to second column - columns 1 150px

slower
its the multiplying that historically was slower than the add

slower
as of a few years ago multiplying was 3x slower than add

higher precedence
moreover i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

more
then i think it would be the problem of precedence in most case they are left-to-right and i think multiplying would be calculated first because in c multiplying is more prior than add instruction by one level

higher precedence
can someone explain this behaviour multiplying operator has higher precedence than add operator

more expensive
multiplying is still somewhat more expensive than add on modern computers and compilers go to some effort to replace them with one or two shifts+add instructions

cheaper
add sub are cheaper than multiplying better throughput and lower latency

more tightly
where multiplying binds more tightly than add

higher precedence
with extra braces because multiplying has a higher precedence than add - assuming these are both percentage discounts

lower resolutions
you can add higher and lower resolutions by multiplying or dividing them by 2

higher

i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

faster
add is faster than mul but if you want to multiplying two general values mul is far faster than any loop iterating add operations

operator higher precedence
can someone explain this behaviour multiplying operator has higher precedence than add operator

higher
in the above example the instance of exprbinopadd is a child of the instance of exprbinopmul although precedence of multiplying is higher than precedence of add which results from the proper consideration of the parentheses

operation more clock
the multiplying operation uses more clock cycles than the add on many processors

more time
functionally a multiplying will always take more time than an add because it combines a true multiplying along with a true addition step

more prior
then i think it would be the problem of precedence in most case they are left-to-right and i think multiplying would be calculated first because in c multiplying is more prior than add instruction by one level

throughput lower
for example fp add throughput is lower than fma or multiplying on intel before skylake 1 vector per clock instead of 2

operation more
the multiplying operation uses more clock cycles than the add on many processors

more
where multiplying binds more tightly than add

slower
on a cpu with a fast multiplier multiplying may only be on the order of 4 times slower than add but on normal hardware it s 16-32 times slower for a 32 bit operation

faster
however multiplying is faster than adding even though less clock cycles are used to add verses multiplying according to what my particular cpu s datasheet says about the instructions being used

higher precedence
multiplying and divide have higher precedence than add and subtract

operator higher
can someone explain this behaviour multiplying operator has higher precedence than add operator

higher precedence
to give multiplying and divide higher precedence than add and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992

more times
instead of explode use preg_split and then use s+ s spaces + 1 or more times as delimiter

field
awk uses a comma surrounded by 0 or more spaces as field delimiter

field
it checks for one or more spaces as field delimiter and also tabs

more
this is happening because i am trying to separate out the search terms based on spaces since spaces comes more natural to users then comma separation or pipes or any other delimiter

more
to split the string with regular expression saying spaces one or more spaces one or more as delimiter

more
i know by giving spaces delimiter will not work as there will be split the wrong information and there will be some road name with more than spaces so in this info will be split up in wrong column

more natural
this is happening because i am trying to separate out the search terms based on spaces since spaces comes more natural to users then comma separation or pipes or any other delimiter

more
as luiggi mendoza commented splitting by s+ instead of would resolve any issue with the number being delimiter by more than one spaces

more
the -match operation removes those lines that don t start with an sha1 hash and the -replace operation collapses adjacent spaces into a single delimiter so that convertfrom-csv won t create empty fields when there is more than 1 spaces in a row

more
you are using the wrong delimiter since your text file may contain more than one spaces character between tokens

more
the pattern in scanner is supposed to be a regular expression that describes all the characters you don t want included in a token repeated one or more times this last part is because the words may be delimiter by more than one spaces punctuation etc.

more
if you want to allow the integers to be delimiter by more than one spaces for indentation purposes or so and depending on the way you want to handle tabs and other non-newline whitespace you can use a more complex delimiter

more
so by using s 3 i am telling the csv processor that the columns in a row are delimiter by more than 3 spaces

more
your actual delimiter looks more like comma followed by a spaces to me

more
the alternative is to write slightly more complex c code which can split on either spaces or tabs note that you can pass strtok more than one delimiter

just
if you want to allow for more delimiter than just spaces tab you can add additional separators when using split

better
since i provided a getline example above your read loop can be much better written with fgets as follows

far more flexible
getline is far more flexible handling the allocation of space for you with fgets it is up to you

far more
getline is far more flexible handling the allocation of space for you with fgets it is up to you

harder
if you cannot tolerate that use getline it s harder to use so use fgets if in doubt

safer
one more edit if you want to use getline instead which you asked about in the comments - and it s even safer than fgets since it will increase the buffer size as needed you would change to change the code a little bit

slightly more
in my experience avassetexportsession is slightly more performant than using avassetreader and avassetwriter for a straight forward format a - format b type conversion however that said it s probably not by enough to be too concerned about

this overlap is somewhat forced when the draggable is bigger than the droppable

more
how can i make the droppable to not accept more than one draggable div

more
it s just a hunch but maybe it s only a matter of the size of your draggable being too big and being over more than one droppable item

larger
i was able to remove the unwanted behavior described above by turning the droppable into the parent of the element and added a margin padding that is slightly larger than the draggable snaptolerance

smaller
perhaps you find it strange since the target droppable s size is much smaller than the draggable

more
without draggable seems more like it but then i can t use the droppable

smaller
and the size of the draggable div s should be smaller than the droppable div so that they fit in the droppable container

this means that your draggable is the full width of the container which is much wider than the droppable and thus can t possibly intersect by 50

image bigger
it works nicely but from the rich ui perspective it s boring so i was wondering since the draggable image is bigger than the droppable how could i do assuming it s possible to have the droppable container suck the bigger image until if fills its dimensions

higher z-index
for draggable set higher z-index than droppable so that draggable will always be visible over droppable

smaller
but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable

bigger
i have a draggable parent element ice cream wrapper which is bigger than the droppable one teeth

bigger
it seems like the draggable element including the margin is bigger than the droppable element and therefore the dropped status is set although the element does not seems to touch the upper droppable yet

smaller
when i made dimension of draggable div smaller than droppable div then drop event triggered successfully

less
alternatively you could set a width on your draggable which is less than twice the width of your droppable area or combine a set width with one of the above options for a better user experience

the draggable is covering more than one droppable element and at this point there are multiple event.target.id s being covered

in terms of performance py4j has a bigger overhead than both of the previous solutions jython and jpype because it relies on sockets but if performance is critical to your application accessing java objects from python programs might not be the best idea

shorter fact equivalent
my experience is that designers can use whichever they prefer usually and most agree that verilog is easier to use and the code is shorter fact than equivalent vhdl

more feature-rich
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

if you want to check that a number is between the min and max of the range you would likely want to check that it is both higher than the min and lower than the max

more
if i is less than min and more than max

greater
thats really simple try to set i max an then count i down with the condition that i must be greater than min

value lower then
you get these exception if max value is lower then the min value

less
there are algorithms that will never predict a value greater than the max or less than the min

less
the max value set to min value + 100 while this should only happen when max is less than min max min like i said above

value larger
when the min value is larger than the max value the max value gets reset to a value 100 larger than the min value

actually lower
but i can t get this to work when the max is actually lower than the min

greater
if i change the min textbox to be greater than max the control would be correctly marked as invalid

greater
my code should make sure the user doesn t select a min value greater than the max value or a max value smaller than the min value using this code

less
i m seeing is that if you use the slider and move it to either end min or max it appears to display a value which is the step value greater than min or less than max

bigger
if min is bigger than max i just return a random character from the entire range

higher
no variable will give a number that is lower than min or higher than max and there is always an equal number of variable such that for all n between min and max inclusively

more
since you are equally distributing the max number of occurences can t be more than the min + 1

more results equal
this results in thousands of term stats with unequal min max values as well as even more results with equal min max values

less
while the user is dragging a node check if its position exceeds either max or is less than either min

heap larger part
in the first iteration the min heap holds the larger part and the max heap

less
note this works as long as the min is less than the max and the max is greater than equal to nomin+ 2 noincrement

greater
on the right side we have two groups where the left group s max is greater than the right group s min 4 4 1 2 6 2

greater
one option is whenever min is changed if it is greater than max change it to equal max like this

ps i set max split size is lesser than min initially i set by mistake and i realized

greater
this program takes in the max and min that the data can be and throws out data that is less than the min or greater than the max

larger
however i m getting a attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter. error when i m trying to plot the normalized data

greater
if i now change max to be greater than min the min textbox validation state does not get cleared down presumably because min hasn t changed and therefore doesn t get validated again

greater
however your current code does the opposite continuing to run when the productindex is less than the max or greater than the min

less
problem i dont want to allow user to enter max value less than min value and so on

greater
you re comparing every value from min with every value from max until you hit a value of min that is greater than a value in max and 55 from min is greater than 22 from max so test will be set to true

larger
it s interesting that this works since the documentation states that max must be larger than min but it looks like -1 is treated more like an empty or null value

greater
if both are selected then max price value must be greater than min price

less
here is a dynamic solution that works for any range of numbers where min is less than max

smaller
and i need to check for every item if min is always smaller than max

smaller
my code should make sure the user doesn t select a min value greater than the max value or a max value smaller than the min value using this code

less
i want to have validation that min price should always be less than max price and max price should be greater than min price

less
but why when i tested this it s alert max less than min

bigger
max is much bigger than min maybe i can minus the gc workers

do note that sliders won t render if max is not greater than min

less
during the playback of the file audio is monitored in the receive direction and if a period of non-silence which is greater than min ms yet less than max ms is followed by silence for at least sil ms which occurs during the first analysistime ms then the audio playback is aborted and processing jumps to the talk extension if available

value greater
in addition i noticed that you also have a possible exceptional scenario for your full constructor when the min value is greater than the max value

greater
this will only return error if the deepend is less than the min and greater than the max which could never really happen testing your code -

greater
the last operation in the case where max is greater than min is called self assignment

length more
the max length is one more than twice the largest min found above

less
ie the range includes min but excludes max and values greater than max or less than min wrap around in a circle

greater
2 check to see if any max is greater than the next entry over s min

always lesser
min is always lesser than guess and max is always greater than guess

higher
i m going to revert to my original implementation of resetting max to no maximum if the user selects a min higher than max and vice versa

always less
if min is always less than max then you can also do

less
copy all events from table2 with created_at strictly greater than max created_at in table3 and strictly less than min created_at in table1 into table1

smaller
now when you have both max and min you can simply get the index of first element greater than min and last element smaller than max from your minheap

less
list.remove max is first run your program goes through the while loop again but min and max will keep the same values they had on the first pass through the loop and as nothing remaining in list is greater than max or less than min the variables won t be changed and so python will end up trying to run list.remove min

less
note that the min param can be assumed to be always numerically less than max

less
note that you can t let max and min be the same value or lett max be less than min

less
if a and b are opposite sign they cannot overflow - the one greater than zero would need to be greater than max or the one less than zero would need to be less than min

lower
it s higher than the min and lower than the max

more
max is more or less arbitrary i could have used min as well

lower
however during debugging i discovered that the min x values area always lower than the max x values regardless of positions and sizes of the rectangles

higher
4- you then need to loop over max to check if any rating is higher than any min

more
then when you are creating each element of the array also check whether it is less than the min or more than the max

value more digits
but it can happen that the max value has more digits than the min value

lower
take each value and compare it to your current min and max values- if it is higher than the max or lower than the min replace that and then add the value to a running total for average purposes

less
change that so your first condition will execute if either getnumber min is true and min is greater than 0 or both are true and min is less than max

less
otherwise once max has replaced min once a value can never be both greater than max and less than min

greater
looks like either the segment exists and it s smaller than what you asked for or you re trying to create a new one but it s smaller than the system min size shmmin or greater than max shmmax

less
you can select min if you want or you could limit your allpossibleids to be less than the max table id

less
one possible error is that the max value is less than the min value

less
1 how would you validate that min is indeed equal or less than max

less
from there you can use having to make sure the max review of the first user is less than the min review of the other user

smaller
the dis min max part sets a range of min and max values this distribution can come up with which means it will never generate a value bigger than max or smaller than min

since max is larger than min one of the two will always happen

more
which means minimum of min repetitions but not more than max repetitions

greater
my other thought was a recursive cte with the first query pulling the min date for each patient then a union where the table date was at least 30 days greater than the max of each patients cte date but you can t have a max in the join statement

greater
main problem why i cant adopt those solution is that every of my random values has different range and i need the values to be uniformly distributed withing the range no frequency occurances at min max for example which happens if i cut off the values which are less greater than min max

smaller
your interval for variable i is probably wrong max is smaller than min

number smaller
if the max number is smaller than the min number the number in the max text box will be automatically changed to the same number as the min number in the min text box

greater
the syntax is min max where min is zero or a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

greater
if not we test whether the entered value is less than the min value if it is then we set the value to the min value and if not implying that the value must be greater than the max we set the value to the max attribute

value larger
keep in mind that if your new min value is larger than either the current slider value or max value it will not render until the remaining two are updated accordingly

higher
after this you can compare if the value is lower than the min or higher than the max

bigger
you can check whether the new number is smaller than min or bigger than max and change them if needed

format_int in binary case it loops 4 times then 4 times more than hex and dec cases

representation better
it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers

easier
hex is easier for most people to convert to and from binary in their heads since binary numbers are usually expressed in blocks of eight because that s the size of a byte and eight is exactly two hex digits but hex notation would have been clunky and misleading in dennis time implying the ability to address 16 bits

way more
unfortunately using hex consumes way more space and takes significantly longer i m dealing with 500gb of data and around 1 2 million records so i would really like to get the straight binary method to work

encoding far more readable
hex encoding is far more readable than binary that s why sublime uses it

much more
and because hex is much more readable and useful than binary - it s often used and shown

more readable
hex encoding is far more readable than binary that s why sublime uses it

much more
as others have pointed out hex is much more convenient than binary anyway - you just need to remember how each of the hex digit 0-f looks in binary and replace groups of 4 bits with a single hex digit

better
base64 is usually used in instances to represent arbitrary binary data in a text format it has a 33.3 overhead but that s better than say hex notation which has a 50 overhead

conversion usually faster
this is still accepted by calls like inet_addr and has several advantages all fields are fixed width there are only 8 characters to update and the binary to hex conversion is usually faster than binary to decimal

encoding far more
hex encoding is far more readable than binary that s why sublime uses it

numbers larger
those hex values seem a bit odd they re powers of two in decimal but in any case 0x128 the 0x is a standard prefix for hex numbers is the larger of the numbers in magnitude and its binary representation is 100101000

string significantly longer
a hex string is significantly longer than the corresponding binary string

somewhat more readable
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc

just less verbose

even simpler
the conversion from hex to binary is even simpler since you can simply expand each hex digit into the corresponding binary for example 0xa4 - 1010 0100

representation better way
it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers

friendlier most
i ve been using images to store data since editing binary data through paint.net is much friendlier than most hex editors

faster

more
converting between decimal and hex is more involving and at least to me it s been easier if i have to do it in my head to first convert the decimal into binary representation and then the binary number into hex

side greater
if the right side the binary side is greater than or equal to the hex side then you print true if not then you print false

more convenient
as others have pointed out hex is much more convenient than binary anyway - you just need to remember how each of the hex digit 0-f looks in binary and replace groups of 4 bits with a single hex digit

alot shorter
one important reason is because hex is alot shorter and easier to read than binary is for humans

just less
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can

somewhat more
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc

ejml looks really good it works almost 2x faster than jama on my data.

more expensive
as i said this may increase the speed especially in an environment where modulo is more expensive than simple subtraction but you would want to actually benchmark it to be certain

slower
the reason is that the modulo is slower than subtraction

faster division-based
that is essentially the one case in which repeated subtraction 0 or 1 times a special case of repeated subtraction can be and commonly is but not necessarily faster than division-based modulo

way smarter so
i mean i think realloc is way smarter so why do we even need malloc

worse
realloc is worse than malloc in that you will need to have the old and new pointers valid during the realloc

often more memory
malloc often gives you more memory that you ask and stores the actual value in a special location that realloc can access at a later time

faster
a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

more memory
that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair

way smarter
i mean i think realloc is way smarter so why do we even need malloc

faster 2nd
the justification of realloc is that it s faster than 2nd malloc manual copy free

often more
malloc often gives you more memory that you ask and stores the actual value in a special location that realloc can access at a later time

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy

svn is better than cvs

wondering mainly if svn uses less disk space or more than the same in cvs

easier
part of the point of svn was to make the use of branches and merging much easier than in cvs

better
svn was supposed to be better than cvs but in some areas that didn t work well

more useful features
the other distributed tools are a lot faster svn is slow as hell even cvs can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than svn are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in svn takes years

more comparable format
the first one can be solved by using svn +ssh which is the more comparable format as cvs uses its own protocol as well

better
that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs

better
svn is better than cvs because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features

better enviroment
for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it

bigger
in this case i converted the cvs to svn and found the file size on the hard drive it was on my own laptop at the time but it was much smaller in svn than in cvs but there could have been some compression applied i dont know but everything on the web said svn would actually be bigger than cvs

simply much better
just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints

question i√¢ m seeing some compromise in mp3 quality my converted mp3 is lower file size when compared to wav but my audio quality is little poor than wav wonder if i can increase the quality of the mp3 file

less memory
for using a fileformat i thought mp3 uses much less memory than wav because all the formats are based on wav but just compressed

larger
wav files are about 3 times larger than mp3 files so it would need 1.8gb additional space to do the conversion

file much easier
either way applying gain and or attenuation to time-domain sample data as in a wav file is much easier than trying to apply these effects to frequency-domain data as in an mp3 file

smaller
you should definitely pick mp3 because they are about 10x smaller than wav files of the same duration

better
if you ask if a uncompressed wav which contains pcm data is better than mp3 then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data

this solution has the disadvantage that if the other factor is not constant the compiler and you can t reasonably avoid the division int_max n to be done at runtime and division is normally more expensive than multiplication

heavier
division may be heavier than multiplication but a commenter pointed out that reciprocals are just as fast as multiplication on modern cpus in which case this isn t correct for your case so if you do have 1 x appearing somewhere inside a loop and more than once you can assist by caching the result inside the loop and then using y

slower hardware
you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate them on the fly that would be slower than hardware division

more accurate
in fact if the intent is to divide by 22 10 or some other real value that isn t necessarily exactly representable in binary floating-point then half the times the multiplication is more accurate than the division because it happens by coincidence that the relative error for 1 x is less than the relative error for x

more expensive
it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

which one is faster is indeed a cpu-specific issue or at least how much faster is cpu specific yes division is typically seen as slower than multiplication

slower
division is about 10 times slower than multiplication

faster
in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine

busier place
both operations are done down at the floating point unit fpu level and even in the world of integral alus the division circuit is a far busier place than a multiplication circuit

faster
i wonder why everybody missed that multiplication is much faster than division

faster integer
in many processors integer multiplication is vastly faster than integer division

more expensive
is division more expensive than multiplication in c++

more expensive
this solution has the disadvantage that if the other factor is not constant the compiler and you can t reasonably avoid the division int_max n to be done at runtime and division is normally more expensive than multiplication

cheaper
i always thought a multiplication is computationally cheaper than a division

higher precedence
does multiplication has higher precedence over division or it is other way round

usually easier
from what i read on the net multiplication is usually easier to compute than division

cheaper
following advise i received multiplication is cheaper than division i revised one code line and interestingly enough 71.2 dropped to 1.7 but the if statement just below shot up to 64.8 √¢ i just don t get it

if the numbers are huge dividing x by b might be better√¢ division is usually slower than multiplication but getting out of the huge-number domain early might help more than avoiding division

faster
therefore i conclude that division is faster than multiplication

faster
most optimizing c compilers optimize it out to a multiplication operation which is much faster than division it can be done only if the divisor is constant though

worse
so division is always a bit worse than multiplication

less time
multiplication takes less time then division so you can try this

much slower
i found out that integer division is much slower than multiplication unfortunately

more
in fact if the intent is to divide by 22 10 or some other real value that isn t necessarily exactly representable in binary floating-point then half the times the multiplication is more accurate than the division because it happens by coincidence that the relative error for 1 x is less than the relative error for x

division is about 20 faster than multiplication

fewer
it has to do with the fact that multiplication is itself done by means of binary shifts and additions - far fewer than with division

faster
as to why multiplication is faster than division and when the divisor is fixed this is a faster route

costlier
well if it is a single calculation you wil hardly notice any difference but if you talk about millions of transaction then definitely division is costlier than multiplication

if your watch doesn t have usb support moto 360 and other induction only charging you need to enable bluetooth debugging slower than through usb though

i had previously sent those commands via bluetooth but the connection fails too often to be useful and is slower than usb

more difficult
interfacing with usb is more difficult than it sounds it would be harder to build something which would interface with that and measure millivolts than with bluetooth because the pic processor you use for analog to digital sampling and usb client would in fact have to either act as usb host or usb otg on a phone which is far more complicated than being a usb peripheral

connection far more reliable
on the other hand a usb connection is far more reliable better supported and of course has the inherent advantage of speed and since it is well supported does not suffer from all the pitfalls bluetooth connectivity does

easier debugging
x86 allows easier debugging - edit and continue is not supported when running in 64bit mode

considerably slower
x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack

machines much stronger
pax s aslr implementation for 64bit x86 machines is much stronger than linux s default 64bit aslr implementation

wider
no intel or amd x86 manuals ever guarantee atomicity of anything wider than 64bit except for lock cmpxchg16b so this talk of sse vector loads stores being atomic on some cpus isn t something that you can reliably take advantage of or detect when it s supported

also more visually
to me the path without x86 is also more visually appealing and indicates that it s a modern application - adapted for 64bit operation where necessary

more
reason why double can t be declared volatile it s 64bit which makes it more than the word size on x86 which prevents it from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly

more memory
however my tests have shown that on a 64bit system an anycpu prefer 32-bit application which i confirm runs 32-bit can allocate more memory than an x86 one

higher internal
the difference is in the first number which shows the rounding of the intermediate calculation so the problem happens because x86 has a higher internal precision 80 bit than the arm 64bit

slower
faster than on x86 32bits but slower than x64 64bit

platform much more
the x86_64 64bit platform is much more than twice the width of the x86 32-bit

also more
to me the path without x86 is also more visually appealing and indicates that it s a modern application - adapted for 64bit operation where necessary

furhter complicated
in addition x86 is furhter complicated because there are generally separate documentation manuals for 32 bit and 64bit processors i m not familiar enough with arm to comment here

easier
x86 allows easier debugging - edit and continue is not supported when running in 64bit mode

better
however if you don t have specific reasons to use anycpu then you could still use x86 because in some cases the performances are better than 64bit code

fiddlier
on arm it is not or rather 32-bit os on 64bit uefi is technically possible only would still require the operating system loader to be 64bit but even fiddlier than on x86

more
x86 doesn t support higher precision than 80 bits but if you really need more than 64bit for a fp algorithm most likely you should check your numerics instead of solving the problem with brute force

faster 32-bit
64bit amd and later intel machines run faster than 32-bit x86 machines because when amd designed the new instruction set they added more cpu registers and made sse math the default

furhter

if that is so you might find that timsort runs faster than quicksort

less comparison
if it is true then timsort will always take less comparison than quicksort because on real life data there is some pattern except data is truly random

however the tables are huge and the union all i read its faster than distinct takes forever to execute even with just two tables let alone 6

keep in mind that union will return a distinct list - duplicates will be removed but it will perform slower than using union all which will not remove duplicates

slower
union distinct is slower than union all but you may need it for de-dupping.

faster
union all is generally faster than using distinct or grouping

a side note since you want all rows using union all is faster since it does not need to perform a distinct to eliminate duplicates

more protection
however using a salt offers more protection against rainbow tables precalculated hash tables so they re still worth using

probably faster too
you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique salt is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the hash over username

sha-512 higher level
salt sha-512 offers a higher level of security and implementing a scheme where you stretch the hash is even better do some high number of iterations of sha-512 - starting with the password+salt of course

probably faster
you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique salt is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the hash over username

also more
prepending a salt is also more powerful than directly setting the seed values because in addition to changing the internal state of the hash if the salt is not a multiple of the digest block size then it can also perturb the alignment with which the input is fed into the hash function

not more secure
so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords

harder especially
most attacks involve generating hash for common passwords so for reasonably complicated passwords it becomes harder especially with salt some people use usernames as salt others use randomly generated numbers

not more
so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords

harder
i don t know how safe could it be and how difficult is for the hacker to determinate the technique i use the thing is that the result has the same length as the hash and is harder to determinate a salt so if for any reason in the history hacker uses a rainbow table and catches a probable result it will be the wrong

larger
likely not as cheap as xor against n values but seems like there s possibility for better quality results at a minimal extra cost especially if the data being hash is much larger than the salt value

longer
you can safely store the salt in the db because working out a string from its hash is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the salt and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

field better
restructuring of the database to just add an salt field is better option or the only one really if your going to do it properly but you could use your currant hash field to store the salt as other person posted

nothing more
this salt is nothing more than a random arbitrary string that you concatenate to the passwords and it will make your hash password unique

trimmed
example the salt field might only allow a 64 characters while the generated salt might be longer therefore when you save the salt it gets trimmed which ultimately changes the hash password

field better option
restructuring of the database to just add an salt field is better option or the only one really if your going to do it properly but you could use your currant hash field to store the salt as other person posted

the more randomness and more characters your salt has the better for the hash but anything that s several characters long and random works

also more powerful

more
in this situation storing password hash and the salt is more secure than storing the credentials encrypted or not because an attacker would have no way of getting the password back even if he manages to get his hands on both the hash and the salt

more secure

note that the test bean has a very special design as the getter returns a more general type number than the setter requests integer

more efficient
if we put our filter in between these calls either in getter or setter setter is more efficient as it is called only when filters change we modify original filtered list with our filter and return it back through the getter

the setter complexity can be higher than the getter and thus validate a unit-test

textureview will display opengl-es rendering but is much more flexible than glsurfaceview and will follow the normal layout hierarchy in android which allows views to be moved on the display

better
the remote server is set up to allow very few maximum concurrent clients generally nginx handles many concurrent clients better than apache since it doesn t need to fork a new process for every request so if it becomes an issue you might want to look into switching web servers

better
i aways heart that nginx performs better than apache server

faster
there seems to be a consensus that nginx serves static content faster than apache

faster
nginx √¢ without any optimizations done √¢ is much faster than apache

faster
as an added benefit nginx can also serve static files much faster than apache and nginx also uses much less ram and can handle much more connections

faster
for example nginx is much faster than apache

more traffic
apache s design is thread per client while nginx uses the reactor pattern meaning - nginx can handle much more traffic than apache as a web server about 50 times the number of requests

better
i recommend you to use nginx as an reverse proxy since the configuration is easier and the performance is much better than apache

more efficient
next you ll find that the threading model of nginx is much more efficient than apache s for what you re doing

more
apache is more flexable then nginx but it comes with a high price in performance

faster
nginx is faster than apache and the configuration is easier

easier
for me apache is easier to use but i prefer nginx as it is much faster

better option
id love to know how to solve this since using nginx sometimes is a better option than apache and having this issue with fuelphp framework and not being able to use this two great tools together is awful

better
nginx s static file performance is better than apache

mod_php much more
apache mod_php is much more stable and cleaner while nginx will often deliver http bad gateway error coded in 502

much faster
i am not an expert in deployment but in my experience nginx is much faster and more friendly to django compared to apache

faster
i know nginx has lower memory footprint and little faster than apache in serving static files

slower
i would really like not to run both apache and nginx i did switch everything to apache yet found it loaded my proxies slower than nginx

faster
i have configured tomcat with apache web server in past and never slowness problem before and practically speaking nginx is said to much lighter and faster than apache web server

better
nginx + gunicorn is likely to work better than apache + modwsgi at this point in time

faster
when i was googling info on nginx it appears to be faster than apache and works well in serving static pages

better
although this thread is more than a year old it still merits from the fact that no one mentioned about the not so recent innovations of nginx lighty and other web servers which scale much better than apache at higher concurrency and consume lesser resources

worse
i m about to try apache but most write ups suggest that this is worse than nginx at this job

easier
nginx is actually quite a lot easier than apache in my opinion

more
apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features

less resources
also when your setting up the server i would say start with nginx it s uses less resources than apache

more flexible
also nginx s configuration is much more flexible than apache and by having it on the front end it gives you a lot of flexibility

more
apache is more friendly configuration wise htaccess htpasswd rewrite rules etc nginx is fast in regard to static assets

more
apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features

lower
i know nginx has lower memory footprint and little faster than apache in serving static files

quicker
nginx is quicker though honestly you ll struggle to see the difference except for very high volume sites and has quickly become the web server of choice for a lot of people if you don t have any specific need for apache for your code

more performant
nginx is more performant than apache in most cases with high-levels of requests

much more efficient
serving static files with nginx is much more efficient than with apache

better
nginx is better suited than apache as it is light and single threaded vs apache thread per request in most normal setups

less
also when your setting up the server i would say start with nginx it s uses less resources than apache

more efficient
serving static files with nginx is much more efficient than with apache

slower
we have a few clients who have very high traffic sites running apache slower than nginx with varnish in front of it and they get way more traffic than you are saying with little to no performance problems

faster
not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content

better
now back to the question my guess based on reading tests published here would be that the proper multi-thread apache architecture should scale better than nginx on multi-core cpus

faster
paradoxally it does not mean that apache is faster than nginx it just means that on 1 2 3 .

much more
serving static files with nginx is much more efficient than with apache

faster
nginx is faster than apache handles slow clients better and is generally easier to use

more popular
apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features

less
nginx uses less memory than apache given the size of your setup i would definitely recommend that

faster
i will add that i ve often heard that nginx is faster than apache for serving static files to the point that it s sometimes worth using nginx for static files and reverse proxying to apache for dynamic content

faster
very fast static assets nginx is faster than apache at serving static assets css js images ... and uses very little memory to do so

much more
next you ll find that the threading model of nginx is much more efficient than apache s for what you re doing

also nginx uses a lot less memory than apache

lighter
nginx is very fast much lighter than apache

mod_php much more stable
apache mod_php is much more stable and cleaner while nginx will often deliver http bad gateway error coded in 502

sometimes better
id love to know how to solve this since using nginx sometimes is a better option than apache and having this issue with fuelphp framework and not being able to use this two great tools together is awful

faster
and finally from my experience nginx is faster than apache

better
i have no idea what i m doing so i dove nose-first into nginx -- which i had never used before -- because someone told me it s better than apache at dealing with lots of small tasks and requests -- not that i would know how to turn apache into a proxy mind you

more efficient
in fact nginx can use select instead of epoll if you compile it with the --with-select_module option and i bet it will still be more efficient than apache

more flexible
also you should consider using nginx as server that s more flexible than apache

usually better performance
note that in any case for increased security and fast static file css js delivery you might want to add a reverse proxy layer nginx usually provides better performance but apache works as well before the nodejs python server

faster
i have recently read that nginx is faster than apache

faster
for example nginx is considered faster than apache and a nodejs application is considered faster than a php application

faster
nginx is faster and lighter but many people find it easier to work with apache because of .htaccess support nginx does not have an analog due to performance concern

still faster
nginx is still faster and i might choose it but apache isn t asleep

more clean
the syntax for nginx configuration is different but more clean than apache

better
16 cores apache would scale better than nginx while nginx would process more client requests

less memory
nginx uses less memory than apache given the size of your setup i would definitely recommend that

more complicated
i am not going into how to do rewrites on nginx because it is much more complicated than apache

better
also what makes nginx better than apache in this case

less resource-hungry
i m new to nginx and want to try it out since it apparently is much faster and less resource-hungry than apache but i can t see why this would be such a hard thing to achieve

faster
nginx works great by itself and will likely be much faster than apache

more straight forward
the switchover to nginx really had little to do with the rewrite rule and more to do with getting away from apache 2.2 default upstream version for centos however with nginx rewrite rules are more straight forward than apache s imo

more experience
i also know there is nginx and haproxy although i have never used either of them and have a lot more experience with apache

much more efficient
next you ll find that the threading model of nginx is much more efficient than apache s for what you re doing

better
nginx with its own mod_wsgi seems to perform even better than apache but hey you didn t ask about that

more popular
apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features

lower
nginx uses an event based non blocking single thread and the memory usage is relatively much lower than apache

better
i will say that nginx tends to handle heavier loads better than apache though so take a look at that

better performance
tornadoweb and nginx are popular web servers for the moment and many benchmarkings show that they have a better performance than apache under certain circumstances

more efficient
nginx or other server is not much more efficient than apache

easier configuration
any one of the reverse proxy systems can likely do this nginx is popular too and generally has easier configuration than apache but i ve never used it with https

faster
you can serve it from for example nginx varnish which are usually faster than apache

faster
is nginx + php-fpm is suppose to do server operations much faster than apache + mod-php due to efficient usage of memory and other resources

more picky
nginx is more picky about case of file names than apache

faster
i read that nginx is faster than apache and i want to try it with some of the projects and leave the others with apache

more busy
it seems your apache is more busy than your nginx

better
how can nginx performs better than apache

typically faster
nginx is typically faster than apache but with a low request server it hardly matters

more
nginx is more picky about case of file names than apache

hi everyone i need help with this i ve already set up nginx + php and it works great faster than apache my problem is how to setup a multiple projects in one ip

sometimes better option

easier
but doing that kind of things with apache is rather painfull and is easier with nginx

faster
nginx will definitely work faster than apache

better
i want to move to nginx since it s better than apache

easier
nginx can be configured to only respond to requests matching a predefined pattern far easier than with apache

more friendly

faster
i ve read that nginx is faster for static pages but there are questions about its performance with php compared to apache s performance with php

more flexable
apache is more flexable then nginx but it comes with a high price in performance

significantly more complex
however my experience is that configuring it in apache is significantly more complex than configuring it in nginx and even with worker it still is not quite as efficient with nginx

more
it seems your apache is more busy than your nginx

lower memory
i know nginx has lower memory footprint and little faster than apache in serving static files

better
nginx also happens to be better than apache at writing logfiles interestingly

faster
for static file serving i found nginx performance lot faster than apache

less memory
also have a look at nginx for example it is fast and uses less memory than apache to handle client connections

better
i think you would like lemp e stands for the nginx and for a lot small projects it would be better than apache

better
why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

less memory
servers like lighthttp and nginx can handle large amounts of traffic in much less memory than apache if you can sacrifice apache s power and flexibility or if you just don t need those things which often you don t

better solution just
i ve heard it suggested that i use nginx as a reverse proxy in front of apache and node.js is that a better solution than just nginx

better
apache made a claim that apache 2.4 will offer performance as good or better than nginx

better
uwsgi is better if you are using nginx i find nginx far better than apache personally

significantly more
however my experience is that configuring it in apache is significantly more complex than configuring it in nginx and even with worker it still is not quite as efficient with nginx

simpler
i ve been attempting to upgrade to php 7.1 using phpbrew and elected to install it with nginx as i read everywhere that it was simpler than apache not that simple in my humble opinion

better
4 i d like to understand why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

better
nginx is better at handling requests since it does not spawn a new process for every request unlike apache

better
if you want to use something in front of it though i suggest you use something like nginx better than apache since nginx is also asynchronous like node and it s performs really well at serving static files

much faster
for example nginx is much faster than apache

lower level
apart from that you might want to give xuggle a try - it works on a much lower level than vlcj but this should give you much more control over what s happening and unlike jmf it s a good actively maintained project.

far more
but avro offers far more than just doing away with the need for your own writables although that is in my view a considerable plus it offers fairly efficient serialization the choice between serializing against generated entity classes like thrift requires or using a so-called genericrecord structure instead and not having to have tagged data

greater
this is the case here because strlen hello is greater than 3 your last strncpy argument

source greater
however if strlen source is greater than n then strncpy will simply copy the first n bytes and will not terminate the string dest with a null byte because there is no space for it

more ram
performance i did some test with simple game similar to swing copters and found that game created with libgdx consumes 15-20 more ram on ios device that the same game created with cocos2d-x but then i used apportable to run cocos2d-x game on my android device and found it almost not playable

tools more
however i ve noticed that running the vb6 tools is becoming more and more painful over time so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to vb.net 2008

application more expensive
biggest of all is that adding new features to your vb6 application is more expensive than it would be if the application was in a better language like c# or vb.net

certainly easier
getting your project migrated to vb.net is certainly easier when you keep the old vb6 controls

lot easier
avoiding them by modifying vb6 is lot easier than fixing the issues in vb.net

more precise
can i safely assume that vb.net result is more precise than vb6 and discard the vb6 result completely

more strict
none of the .net libraries are there and there are some syntax differences as vb.net is more strict than vb6 is

better
vb.net is a better language than vb6 use its com capabilities to save you from writing endless sketchy vb6 code

much more complex
vb.net appears much more complex then vb6 and the learning curve is tough

better language

better use
if you don t already know vb6 there s little point in learning it now - your time could be put to much better use by learning vb.net c#

more
especially as vb6 is becoming more and more of a distant memory and the vb.net language takes on a life of its own in conjunction with the core .net framework advancing

more feature rich
quite apart from the fact that the language vb.net is far more feature rich than vb6 the fact that you have developed in vb.net means that you have made extensive use of the .net class libraries including system.security.cryptography that you give as an example

far more feature
quite apart from the fact that the language vb.net is far more feature rich than vb6 the fact that you have developed in vb.net means that you have made extensive use of the .net class libraries including system.security.cryptography that you give as an example

result more precise

version less
yes they are different but you can hardly say that the vb.net version is less capable than the vb6 version

much more
vb.net appears much more complex then vb6 and the learning curve is tough

better
fortunately vb.net finally ended all that and is completely pixel based you can still alter you viewport scaling but .net seems to handle that much better than vb6

rubby easier
also developing enterprise application is such new languages java c# vb.net rubby is easier that vb6 because they rely on frameworks every body can write c# java code that function but it requires tricks good practices and some of imagination to write vb6 strong and rehusable code

far more

result more
can i safely assume that vb.net result is more precise than vb6 and discard the vb6 result completely

better
i assume the same control in vb.net would be datagridview and i m fairly sure that you can probably make it look better than in vb6 but if you want really good looking ones you might want to look at thirdparty grid controls

stronger
which will never be true have in mind that the and-operator binds stronger than the or-operator

higher precedence ||
as far as i know the and-operator has the higher precedence than || or-operator in most of the languages

datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds

larger
note that diffseconds can cause an overflow when the difference becomes larger than int32.maxvalue error the datediff function resulted in an overflow

datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds

slower
an icmp packet has a header that is 20 bytes and is probably going to be slightly slower than udp

in fact icmp especially the ttl excceeding message has even less limitations than udp on nats for the error message can be sent from every corner of the internet and routers with nat cannot be aware that these messages are not the true ones

slick2d is made to work with lwjgl 2 lwjgl 3 however is way newer than slick2d and therefore slick2d does not support using lwjgl 3

way easier
you could use slick2d it is way easier to use and works with lwjgl

easier raw
i think reductio will make this easier but with raw crossfilter this would look something like

in outlook.com hotmail it looks closer to the results shown with gmail

associations always better
using two one-to-many associations is always better than relying on many-to-many relations

easier
i ve created an application with this library instead of jgraph because i thought that jung is easier to learn than jgraph for newbies even if it provide less features

here more
following my comment on your original post here s some more information that will help you get through this

better
since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests

more
i need a query to get results from stackexchange dataset in such a way that it returns me 100 top reputation users with not more than 3 post body of post for each user

safer
post request is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs

more appropiate
get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

better
as far as security goes post is much better than get as the data is sent behind-the-scenes rather than embedded in the url making it the typical protocol for login info

request better
as it s widely known that an asynchronous post request is better since the user won t get a perception that the app has crashed while it s loading the long process

more
however if you want to get more than one post rather use functions mentioned above i think the most important thing is to grab them in one db query and not in ineffective way one-by-one

not more secure
post is not more secure than get as it√¢ s also send unencrypted

more
anyone knows how to bypass this problem and get more than 100 post

more
another post outlines some more details on this how to get master-master replication with subversion

less secure
since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests

script more
for eps is the same situation the post script is more readable but you should apply all necessery transformations on object before get its size

more lightweight
more over it seems that get requests are more lightweight than post under high load

more
i had the idea to switch automatically between get and post for example if cookie set because get is more fast and cache able and post is more save

more details
these steps were taken from this blog post which contains more details about how to investigate and what output you ll get

more letter
post has one more letter in it than get so it s less compact

less brute
i also found a post that suggests a less brute force method to get the urlroutingmodule to catch the combres.axd route

more
while the post method can be submitted with forms or ajax calls and it is pretty safe at least more than the get

more tidy
maybe i would mostly always choose post over get it s more tidy and refreshing and going back issues with post method are a thing from the past in any major browser they just ask you if you want to resend the data don t they

faster response
we provide a number of support resources which may get faster response than post on third party sites including the virtuoso users mailing list public support forums and confidential support cases

more
this blog post explains more on how to get an access token on android

more secure
standard post request is not more secure than get one

method faster
you should check this thread why get method is faster than post

because faster
i used get because is faster than post if you need it just to get a list of element for suggestions

more secure
you can feel like post is more secure than get all you want but it s a false premise

more light weight
other than that accepting a get request might be - depending on the server side rest framework - slightly more light weight than post requests

presumably more
but using post instead of get presumably adds one more level of protection for xsrf types of attack it does not you need some form of explicit xsrf protection token with post or with get

more
i get somehow category repeated if it has more than 1 post eg

more
it is just an example that shows a scenario in which get is more secure than post but i don t think it would be a good idea to choose get over post from this attack reason

faster type
is type get faster than type post cause i am curious how both work

request not more
standard post request is not more secure than get one

more secure
post is more secure then get and data transfer size limits are also there

more secure
as powelljf3 said post is more secure then get though it can still be gotten to

more
get is more vulnerable than post as it can be transmitted and stored

more
when i try to get more than 100 post it returns

more
there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable

more options
post gives you more options and dosn t have a limit on parameter query string length like get the only negative is post is slower by a couple of milliseconds to create the request

also more
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

slightly less
the only scenario in which post is slightly less susceptible is that many websites that aren√¢ t under the attacker√¢ s control say a third-party forum allow embedding arbitrary images allowing the attacker to inject an arbitrary get request but prevent all ways of injecting an arbitary post request whether automatic or manual

more appropriate
as suggested in the comments since you are saving data post is more appropriate than get

parameter longer
i noticed once the length of a get parameter is longer than 400 bytes or 2000 bytes for a post parameter g-wan returns 400 error

more
on an unencrypted connection post is no more secure than get

larger more
for example on the blog page of my current project i have two widgets in the sidebar one for latest tweets and one for latest music news however as you can see on this page the content of the blog post all test posts... are much longer than the height of the two widgets and would of course get larger as more post are added

much better
as far as security goes post is much better than get as the data is sent behind-the-scenes rather than embedded in the url making it the typical protocol for login info

more secure
it is just an example that shows a scenario in which get is more secure than post but i don t think it would be a good idea to choose get over post from this attack reason

lower limit
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post

better
using post over https is better than using get and http

always faster
get is always faster than post

broader
a post has broader application and is generally used to send persistent data to a server in fact prescriptively get should not be used for this purpose

more secure
firstly post can seem more secure than get

also more
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

shorter
i have simplified the app so the post is shorter but the basic problem is that if i get test in workouthandler - it cannot recognize methods in wardenstrategies or loginhelper unless i also include those files in the handler they are already included in app.rb

more
characters post is more robust and secure than get

more
stick with post on any action that does more than get data avoid xss-issues

higher overhead
post has a higher overhead marginally if we re honest but it all adds up but it doesn t become part of the url so can t be seen by say a casual observer over the user s shoulder - whereas get can

more secure
why everybody here is saying post is more secure than get when used over https

more advantages
post has a lot more advantages than get

more suitable
actually if you would like to retrieve specific task with all its details get request would be more suitable than post

request more different
here i don t like that the body of the post request contains more different fields then the body returned from the get request - but maybe this is not a problem

more
post has more capacity it can transfer more data than get

simpler
get is simpler and faster than post and can be used in most cases

safer
one more thing some guys would misunderstand that post is safer than get as user can not see the sent data

more
using post is more secure than get in the sense that data shown into the url in get request but not in post

shipping longer
the problem is that the post shipping takes longer than the call get alert then shows me the session variable not updated

more
not able to get more than 100 post in single rest api call for the linkedin company updates

more
i try it and i get all the categories and not just the ones with more than 1 post in them

earlier
i am using custom delegate methods but when i run this the get request is performed earlier than the post so i cannot get the key before the get is done

better
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure

much more
the post get may fix the problem - get is much more lax with security than post

safer
get method is not safer than post data never trust datas coming from the client side

better
i believe post is better than get

larger more
so i have a post system and i want the box to get larger as more post come in

more
using post allows for more data to be transferred since get will append the values to the url itself

more secure
using post is more secure than get in the sense that data shown into the url in get request but not in post

far easier
while users can manipulate post it s far easier to manipulate get

less secure
get is basically for just getting retrieving data a get should not have a body so aside from cookies the only place to pass info is in the url and urls are limited in length get is less secure compared to post because data sent is part of the url

more performant
get is more performant as it is idempotent and does not contain a message body where as post does

more
hence post is more secure than get

method faster
why get method is faster than post

larger
post requests can be much larger than get requests as get requests are limited by the maximum length of a url

easier
from a hacker s point of view a get forgery is much easier than post forgery at the first you only post a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked

request relatively harder
for example post request are considered more secure than get request as creating a post request is relatively harder than creating a get request

more secure
i am asked to apply to all the actions of one mvc project for security reason says post is more secure than get which i disagree with

request more
here i don t like that the body of the post request contains more different fields then the body returned from the get request - but maybe this is not a problem

more
what i m trying to get is a page that displays 20 users per page will have pagination with the fallowing info it should show only users that have more than 2 post published

older
curl commands seem to work as do some other post commands from older code but when i log out req.body all i get is

cleaner
also you can determine if someone is submitting a form or getting the form by checking if _server request_method post which is cleaner than using a get url parameter though i guess there s nothing wrong with the other approach...

method better
but i believe sending data using curl with post method is better than get method

better
get is better for some cases but it seems to me you should use post instead

more appropriate
get is more appropriate than post for queries because of its safe semantics

better method
get is a better method in this case than post

method faster
it is said that get method is faster than post but i don t know why is it

also more
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking

worse performance
post has worse performance than get

method not safer
get method is not safer than post data never trust datas coming from the client side

slightly less secure
after that is done you can go into security details where get is slightly less secure than post - see the comments for details.

more
i know there can be problems with posts_per_page but nothing is working i ve searched a lot to get the query to display more than one post

more
in effect post is no more secure than get

more
i normally use something like this tag.object.annotate num_post count post .filter num_post__gt 2 to get tags with more than 2 post

safer
post requests are no safer than restful requests which are no safer than get requests

more recent
if a post has a more recent reply i want to get the replies created_on value but also get the post post_id and subject

more
i have been trying get data out of new reddit post but theres limitation where you cant get data from more than 100 post

more
param should be params and therefore your data is not being serialized which would explain why the server is rejecting your post since post requires more privileges than get presumably

more secure
post data isn t inherently more secure than get data

more clarification
hope you get the more clarification by this post

more vulnerable
get is more vulnerable than post as it can be transmitted and stored

harder simple
although putting data with post method little harder than simple get

deeper
i m trying to get deeper with post and pre incrementors but am a bit stuck with the following expression

safer
regarding your question about safety -- the answer is post is absolutely no safer than get

more
i need to create a menu based on that list but cannot simply list all post and get it because it is a busy blog and has more than 2000 post

larger
to answer part of your second question with .net if the post is larger than maxrequestlength part of the .net configuration but smaller than maxallowedcontentlength part of the iis configuration you can create a custom http module to get at the portion of the post that came through

better
i am aware that a post is better for this kind of thing but my question is is this expected from a get request

request not more secure
standard post request is not more secure than get one

more
when i want to get more than 54 post i receive this error

more
additional options are to show this via a timeout so it s only shown when the post takes more than a short time and to use some form of fadein not sure if possible with a dialog then you don t get the annoying flash on the times it s very quick

more
get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

more information
the post at has more information on how to get that access token

better
speaking of get request types you should also know that get requests tend to perform better than post

wich more sense
note that doing this will get the values via post var instead get wich makes more sense since you are sending via post your form

request more appropriate
but do also remember that in your case get request looks more appropriate and as balusc says its not good practice to use post for bookmarkable page-to-page navigation

more secure
in effect post is no more secure than get

more secure
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

less secure
however in the comparative table i linked get is listed as less secure than post

slightly less susceptible
the only scenario in which post is slightly less susceptible is that many websites that aren√¢ t under the attacker√¢ s control say a third-party forum allow embedding arbitrary images allowing the attacker to inject an arbitrary get request but prevent all ways of injecting an arbitary post request whether automatic or manual

easier

also a post request would be better than a get if you re sending json

less

better
when get is better than post

more appropriate
on that base a get is more appropriate then a post

smaller
a get request will be slightly smaller than a post although using websockets would give a more accurate figure

simpler
as a pragmatist i m inclined to use get because implementing it is way simpler than post

request marginally less secure
the get request is marginally less secure than the post request

more
this post is more to get advises and ideas rather than solving a problem

more
if a post has a more recent reply i want to get the replies created_on value but also get the post post_id and subject

much smaller
you ll hit problems with larger submissions and file-uploads as the size limit for a get is much smaller than a post

post get method doesn t have the same lenght limit you can use post to send more data than with get

more
i m able to query my database below to get the result that i want but i don t want to have to iterate through all of the author objects just the ones that have more than one post

although post is more secure as compared to get when ssl is present

faster
i run the ab test several times with same results post is faster but get is lighter

more
you can feel like post is more secure than get all you want but it s a false premise

less
other than the fact that get has one character less than post i doubt there is any performance difference

better
if you are curious though rather than just trusting a book or a blog post it is better to make a simple example and take it apart - you get it straight from the horse s mouth and you learn a whole lot more

faster
get is simpler and faster than post and can be used in most cases

slower
but generally post is slower and would be bigger in size than a get request

more secure
post isn t more secure than get

also more secure
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

much more
i m sure there s a work around to use get for emails but the alternative post is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to get around

easier
in my opinion the second way to achieve this is better because using get is not thats ecure in my opinion.it s easier than using post

more secure
post is absolutely not more secure than get as to man in middle attacks

more
usual way with tagging is to get objects by tag but if tags are used by few applications it may give more than post

worse
one reason post is worse for security is that get is logged by default parameters and all data is almost universally logged by your webserver

sorry that this post is more of the and for further information... type than a direct answer which i think has now been given-- i just thought it was helpful not to get things lost inside comments

better choice
instead i m using post which isn t exactly bullet proof but still a better choice than get in this case

not better

i am using custom delegate methods but when i run this the get request is performed earlier than the post so i cannot get the key before the get is done

more performant
ajax calls using get are more performant than post according to yahoo

slightly faster
get is slightly faster because the values are sent in the header unlike the post the values are sent in the request body in the format that the content type specifies

more
i want to get all the users that has more than one post but

lower
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post

more
however there s one thing we haven t considered yet - what if you never get more than 5 post

more capacity
post has more capacity it can transfer more data than get

much more
this means the amount of data you could pass by using post verb is much more than by using a query string and a get method

better
in this case post may be better than get anyways

faster
get is always faster than post

request marginally less
the get request is marginally less secure than the post request

more semantically
if you use post when get is more semantically correct it is less communicative of the intent of your request since post usually means you are sending a payload

last to address other answers while you should use post data when modifying something it is in no way more secure than get

the get is usually faster because it has no encapsulation sends data via url usually with a 255 character limit as post exists encapsulation by being sent by the body of the http request

i wouldn t call post more or less secure than get

presumably more level

edit taking into account what was said in the comments though it looks more secure and is recommended by w3 see touheed khan s answer post isn t more secure than get and as riggsfolly said

higher
there is a default limit of post method which is 2mb which is way higher than get

less data
supply more data upon post and receive less data upon get

more users
here s the solution for post variables as well which is probably trickier for more users than the get solution

post is more secure then get and data transfer size limits are also there

more safe
however post is a bit more safe than get because get could be stored in the history

much easier
using get is much easier than using post for most of developers

so it is considerably less then what facebook states in their documentation at least looking by the date however by count it seems you get more than 50 post

more
also it seems that my view gets called more than once according to the log outputs and that is normal except it should be a post then redirect to a get but it seems to have more than one post request

easier
another reason but rather a minor one is that get is easier to exploit that post as there are more ways to trigger get request than to trigger post request

as suggested in the comments since you are saving data post is more appropriate than get

safer
post request are safer than get but that does not mean are invulnerable

more frequent

higher
if you have both post and get params with same name and if you using then it will take post variable only.because post has the higher priority than get

more secure
in my opinion post requests are not more secure than get requests and the data can be easily intercepted

much more lax
the post get may fix the problem - get is much more lax with security than post

better
yes generally post is a better way of submitting data than get

data more secure
using post data is more secure than get because with get the details would be in the query string portion of the url

better
also post is generally considered better than get for ajax calls as it doesn t have the same string length limit slightly more secure too

less secure
the get request is marginally less secure than the post request

better
i think whoever said post is better than get when using passwords meant that the passwords would be part of the url in the get request which would obviously be bad

more secure
for example post request are considered more secure than get request as creating a post request is relatively harder than creating a get request

you can t get a patent any more because with this post i will claim prior art -

better way
yes generally post is a better way of submitting data than get

not more
post is not more secure than get as it√¢ s also send unencrypted

safer
i just want to know if i use post method for login api then is it safer than get method

better
sometimes get is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of post warnings

more compact
is post more compact than get since get requests have to be url-encoded

more info
however i ve searched for a couple days and am not getting a definitive answer and i need a better understand of this so i know no better way to get more info than to post here

more secure
using post prevents this particular attack but is this actually any more secure than using get

more
note that i am assuming a user can get invited to more than one post which seems logical

more
if the post has more than 9 pictures related to it i only get data from the first 9

more
you can also chose to get more than 25 post at once

more
you can t get more than 20 post if you are a sandbox user

safer
use post its safer than get if you use rest

safer
post is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs. also data is not displayed in the url

more images
i m trying to get cloudinary direct uploads working on a rails app using carrierwave and accepts_nested_attributes_for to submit one or more images with a post

more secure
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking

forgery much easier
from a hacker s point of view a get forgery is much easier than post forgery at the first you only post a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked

more secure
post is not any more secure than get

worse
post has worse performance than get

more details
another post outlines some more details on this how to get master-master replication with subversion

safer
however post data are not much safer than get data anyway

this blog post is more detailed but unfortunately does also not mention where to get the product key

more secure
post is more secure than get this is just a quick example

easier
get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post

higher priority
if you have both post and get params with same name and if you using then it will take post variable only.because post has the higher priority than get

simpler http
this would make things considerably easier as the android library has native support for json serialization and making http get requests to restful urls is much simpler than http post requests it s not a huge deal but just less stuff you have to worry about

safer
and apart from common misleading information where post is safer than get it is not

easier
get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post so suitable checks for existance and ownership of the record would be important

less secure
first off get is no less secure than post

better option
sometimes get is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of post warnings

quicker
a get is a bit quicker and than a post in an ajax scenario

more
as powelljf3 said post is more secure then get though it can still be gotten to

more
i think using post is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via get

more safety
a post request would not provide any more safety than a get request any half-decent web debugging tool can forge post requests

script more readable
for eps is the same situation the post script is more readable but you should apply all necessery transformations on object before get its size

better
and i think post is better than get

probably easier
have a look at this post it is probably easier to get the selected radio button by changing your itemscontrol to use a listbox with the existing datatemplate

wich more
note that doing this will get the values via post var instead get wich makes more sense since you are sending via post your form

more data
i don t want to use the get request since it says in the guidelines of a restful api that it should use post for this purpose plus i might want to send more data than get can handle

more secure
on an unencrypted connection post is no more secure than get

more often
get is more often used on unsecure type of datatransactions like for example a searchform and post is used when you want to make more secure things like a login form

maybe i would mostly always choose post over get it s more tidy and refreshing and going back issues with post method are a thing from the past in any major browser they just ask you if you want to resend the data don t they

more secure
post is no more secure than get over the http protocol

result earlier
the problem i have noticed is that sometimes the jquery post result is retrieved earlier than the load of the .js file has been completed so i get an error and of course the jquery plugin doesn t work

more secure
using post data is more secure than get because with get the details would be in the query string portion of the url

safer
both get post user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by post method and that don t make it safer than get method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url

less secure
after that is done you can go into security details where get is slightly less secure than post - see the comments for details.

more secure
using the post method isn t necessarily more secure than get

more fast
i had the idea to switch automatically between get and post for example if cookie set because get is more fast and cache able and post is more save

better
but i believe sending data using curl with post method is better than get method

less safe
some people say get can be less safe than post -- but to the seasoned user this doesn t make any significant difference because they can intercept and modify headers of the request

better
i don t recommend sending such parameters via url get it is better and safer if you use post form method

shorter
generaly get is shorter than post

older code
curl commands seem to work as do some other post commands from older code but when i log out req.body all i get is

better
because post method storing capacity of response is better than get response

less subsequent
an initial get request to a page usually costs less than subsequent post anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it

more elegant
i think using post is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via get

request longer
so if your get request is longer than 255 bytes it s advised to use post requests instead

more secure
post is not more secure than get as it√¢ s also send unencrypted

smaller limits
get requests have smaller limits than post in the specs

broader application
a post has broader application and is generally used to send persistent data to a server in fact prescriptively get should not be used for this purpose

faster
get is faster than post

older
just for the record the tipc addressing scheme is several years older than distributed erlang

faster
so congratulations - you can pat yourself on the back your avx routine is indeed about a third faster than the sse routine tested on haswell i7 here

more time
buf1 buf2 and buf3 is small enough to located in l1 cache and l2 cache l2 cache 1mb .both of sse and avx is band width limited but with the datalen increase why do the avx need more time than sse

more
and simd math libraries for sse and avx however they seem to be more sse than avx2

version considerably slower
i have code that does the same thing but the avx version is considerably slower than the sse version

faster
i expected avx to be about 1.5x faster than sse

faster
the question is avx scalar is 2.7x faster than sse when i vectorized it the speed up is 3x matrix size is 128x128 for this question

slower
i have code that does the same thing but the avx version is considerably slower than the sse version

newer
also note that the fact that the avx are a newer than sse doesn t make the avx faster whatever you are planning to use the number of cycles taken by an function is probably more important than the avx vs sse argument for example see this answer

faster
for small buffers hot in l1d cache avx can copy significantly faster than sse on cpus like haswell where 256b loads stores really do use a 256b data path to l1d cache instead of splitting into two 128b operations

clearly faster
now for sse is clearly faster and for the smaller values it s nearlly as fast as avx

more
the underlying reason for this and various other avx limitations is that architecturally avx is little more than two sse execution units side by side - you will notice that virtually no avx instructions operate horizontally across the boundary between the two 128 bit halves of a vector which is particularly annoying in the case of vpalignr

scalar faster
the question is avx scalar is 2.7x faster than sse when i vectorized it the speed up is 3x matrix size is 128x128 for this question

faster
so the avx version does indeed appear to faster than the sse version both for the original implementations and the optimised implementations

faster
as expected the performance got better with both and avx 2 faster than sse 4.2 but when i profiled the code with papi i found out that the total number of misses mainly l1 and l2 increased a lot

the other suggestion keep repeating until x stops changing does not work either because for non-perfect squares x will alternate between the floor and the ceiling of the root √¢ because of integer mathematics the term n x will alternate when x is slightly smaller or slightly larger than sqrt n

more complex algorithm
timsort is used by python and java for their sort methods and is rather supernaturally fast but it s a more complex algorithm than mergesort which matters if you re working in something like c - so if you just need something that works pretty well and is simple go with mergesort

fread ... is extremely fast 10 - 100 times faster than read.table ... or read.csv ... for large datasets

faster
you might want to give the data.table package a try check out the fread function which is much faster than read.table

more time
interestingly for 1 million rows per file the optimised version of read.csv and read.table take 422 and 430 more time than fread whilst without optimisation this leaps to around 1500 and 1005 longer

faster
fread performs faster and more efficiently than read.table but read.table produces less no errors on the same data set

faster base
for reading large csv files you should either use readr read_csv or data.table fread as both are much faster than base read.table

more work
the subtraction case is going to require a little more work than addition in this code

slower
this is a hold over from older compilers and interpreters on old chip architecture that would do addition slightly slower than subtraction

slower
here it is conceivable that subtraction is slower than addition

better
a111 addition is equal or better than subtraction

bigger
i was thinking that there could be an issue if the result from the addition is bigger than what 15 bits can represent 32767 or if i get a negative number in the subtraction

higher precedence
the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does

it s possible though that software could mess things up by making subtraction slower than addition - but that s unlikely

smaller
have a look at sift and surf and at vlfeat which has a good sift implementation and also implements mser and hog and is much smaller than opencv

code longer
but as the inline code gets longer the savings for inlining become smaller so maybe you could just have a hard limit on the size of the code - any code to be inline must be smaller than the limit

keyword less
in reality the inline keyword has less to do with inlining code and more to do with allowing legal violation of the one definition rule

more
templates will be inline in the standard meaning of inline which is more related to the one definition rule than to actual code inlining

bigger
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once

more
i m well aware that inline is more of compiler decision than of user going so far as even to inlining non-specified inline-functions so the user control is almost negligible

better
if your compiler can do this then writing functions in a way that the compiler is able to inline is better than manually inlining the calls yourself

keyword more
generally speaking the inline keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about inlining

larger
callee is too large message is printed by c1 when the size in bytecodes of the method being inline is larger than maxinlinesize 35 multiplied by nestedinliningsizeratio 90 on each next level of inlining

keyword more now
generally speaking the inline keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about inlining

generally faster
a similar argument can be made for inlining functions inline is generally faster but will remain in the same big-o complexity class although there is an additional size tradeoff inlining makes your compiled program larger if the code was being used in many places

more
the keyword inline is more about telling the compiler that the symbol will be present in more than one object file without violating the one definition rule than about actual inlining which the compiler can decide to do or not to do

put is designed for file uploads moreso than post which requires doing a multipart upload but then it comes down to what your server can do as to which is more convenient for you to implement

more secure http
http put isn t inherently any more secure than http post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server

newer format
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

definitely better
while png is definitely better that gif occasionally there is a use case for needing to stay in gif format

larger
jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics

larger equivalent
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

smaller
gif is smaller because it s based on an colour palette of 256 colours rather than the separate rgb values for each pixel or group of pixels in jpg and png

larger
i m not sure if this matters but the gif is significantly larger than the png files

less
i used gif because its file size 2.1kb was considerably less than png or jpeg in this case

newer
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

smaller
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time

format better compression
according to wikipedia the png format provides better compression than gif

generally smaller
but in that regard it is replaced by png which is generally smaller supports alpha transparency where gif pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque and most importantly gif images are limited to 256 colors

better alpha
png gives you better alpha result than gif

never worse
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression

better
png gives you better alpha result than gif

format substantially less
the gif format is substantially less capable than png

slightly better
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

smaller
one thing to note is that gif supports a smaller palette than png - only up to 256 colors

much better
png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time

better competition
png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif

better compression
you can then use imagecopy to insert each gif image including the background and imagepng to generate png output which is better for line art than jpeg offers better compression than gif and can support more than 256 colors

file wider
wewtaco i noticed that your png file has wider dimension than the gif file and i am guess that could be a reason the black bars are showing up

significantly larger
i m not sure if this matters but the gif is significantly larger than the png files

usually better
many people don t know about 8-bit png which is usually better than gif in size.

smaller
but keep in mind that the gif color palette is way smaller than png

better
for example png has better support for transparency than gif or jpeg

larger
it will always be a web format which basically comes down to jpg png and gif with gif being very unlikely because of its limitations gif can contain 256 colors at most and is generally larger than png

smaller palette
one thing to note is that gif supports a smaller palette than png - only up to 256 colors

better compression
png achieves better compression than gif because it applies a pre-filtering step before the lossless compression deflate roughly equivalent to lzw. see wikipedia s explanation of png filtering

wider color
png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not

more
i ve noticed however that jruby is more sensitive to memory leaks than mri

faster
jvm hosted languages are generally going to be faster than traditional mri ruby and both java and scala are generally faster than jruby when it comes to raw cpu capabilities

faster
for example jruby is faster than mri jruby 1.7 is faster than jruby 1.6 jruby 1.7 running on hotspot is faster than jruby 1.7 running on j9 jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.7 is faster than jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.6 jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.7 with the c2 compiler is faster than jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.7 with the c1 compiler and so on

heavier
the jruby runtime alone is already pretty heavy much heavier than mri

better
for longer-running applications like a web application rubinius or jruby will generally perform better than mri

slower
so it seems like the opposite - mri 2.3 gets 2-5x slower than jruby 9.1

faster
and it sounds strange but jruby scales very well and it s faster than mri with java 7

faster
mri has a gil so why is it faster than jruby in handling requests

more rubyspec
in fact on windows jruby passes more rubyspec tests than ruby meaning mri or yarv itself

slower
this really surprised me because i expected mri to be slower than jruby

faster
does this mean that the old adagio about jruby being faster than mri ruby is gone

2-5x slower
so it seems like the opposite - mri 2.3 gets 2-5x slower than jruby 9.1

better
i know that rails jruby handles concurrency better than mri but i don t know how to do it

better performance
with these options jruby on rails gives about the same or better performance than mri

more performant
once the jvm has warmed up rails requests under jruby are usually significantly more performant than under mri both in terms of raw execution speed and garbage collection

faster
sometimes mri is faster but with the right parameters and warmup jruby was 3 to 3.5 times as fast on my system for this particular

faster
lastly if you are frequently finding yourself running long running process i advice you to try jruby which is works much better with long running processes due to jvm lot faster than mri

faster
in my experience xlib via mit-shm extension was significantly faster than sdl surfaces not sure i used sdl in the most optimal way though

way better approach
you could try using c-types with ff which is a regular dll being called by javascript in your add-on this is way better approach that using xpcom because if the interfaces you use in there can change in each ff version indeed you will have to do multiple dlls each for your add-on supported ff versions

stricter
2 however coalesce requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than nvl which will first attempt an implicit conversion

more portable
the coalesce function is used here because it is more portable than nvl or ifnull

more efficient
coalesce is more efficient than nvl as it only evaluates the second argument if the first is null whereas nvl evaluates both arguments every time

simpler
the ansi standard function coalesce is simpler than using nvl and decode which should be obsoleted anyway

from the count you will get the number of sequence and those which have more than 2 put those in a different series and then add that series in the dataframe

i m not sure if this is the answer but states that if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate

worse
i m concerned this is going to get worse as we put more tests into the specflow project

slower
since most data-storage mechanisms in-ram in a database etc. get a lot slower as you put more data in them you should ensure you re only timing your http access and not looking at overall crawler throughput including storage

more difficult
from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes

even with 32 levels of recusions it will never explode in a rectangular draw area whose diagonal is shorter than 2 32 pixels the limit would be reached only if you are splitting a virtual bezier in a virtually infinite space with floating-point coordinates but you don t intend to draw it directly because you won t have the 1 2 pixel limitation in such space and only if you have set an extreme value for the flatness such that your minimum square sine constant parameter is 1 2 32 or lower

one way would be to fill the diagonal elements with something lesser than global minimum and then use argsort -

but goto is rarely used in modern coding it is not likely to perform any better than a do-while loop after compiler optimizations are applied and it has limitations on how it can be used

greater
also it seems like a for-loop is of greater cost to the compiler than a while-loop

faster
and now we know that for-loop is faster than while-loop

cheaper
the reason for the second case much slower on sorted data is that a while-loop is cheaper than the equivalent for-loop when there are zero iterations

it seems gson is more faster than jackson the average time of gson is about 2ms while jackson is about 16ms does i make mistake when using jackson

more
try this lib that s a good one with the jackson we use only in the server side because jackson is more slow in the android than gson at least in our test

faster
take a look at the jackson json parser it s faster than the one in android and faster than gson and supports streaming

since i am more familiar with jackson here are some aspects where i think jackson has more complete support than gson apologies if i miss a gson feature

slower
deserialization performance is similar with gson over 9x slower than jackson and fastjson about 0.5 faster than jackson

faster
gson is not particularly fast but the jackson library can almost compete with most binary serializers jackson is 2-4x faster than gson in most situations and 10-20x faster on utf-8 because it has special code for utf-8

faster
under some conditions gson has proven to be a lot faster than jackson there also exists jsonp and json.simple

better
also i want to know if google gson is better than jackson for json parsing

faster
in my case i found jackson little faster than gson i used default serialization because so far i don t have a need to customize serialization

slower
according to the performance results at for serialization with databind with strings gson.tojson myobject gson is over 10x slower than jackson

more slow
try this lib that s a good one with the jackson we use only in the server side because jackson is more slow in the android than gson at least in our test

less powerful
going to go ahead and say that gson is a lot more user friendly albeit less powerful than jackson

gson is faster with smaller documents and jackson is faster with large documents

further more gson really seems to be faster than jackson json

after searched in google found that jackson has better performance than gson i plan to replace gson with jackson in my project but i got a diffrent result when run test code

more
jackson is more suitable if you have a complex deep json tree because gson creates a lot of temporary objects which leads to stop the world gcs

less features
note also that gson comes with less features out of the box than genson or jackson

slower
i looked at gson metrics and it seems slower than jackson

jackson is faster but the api is 37x more complex than the gson api

i ve seen questions like this come up before and the general consensus is that jackson is much faster than gson

less memory
unicorn does not use less memory than passenger

better benchmarks
also vert.x has little bit better benchmarks than netty

lighter
also pygtk is lighter than wxpython but i ended up bitting the bullet and using wxpython for the same purpose recently it is heavy but it didn t have any affect on the script performance

better
finally if soappy just isn t working for you try suds it s better documented than soappy

less powerful
btw why do you want to use fakeiteasy it looks to me less powerful than moq

nicer syntax
fakeiteasy seems to have an overall nicer syntax than moq like the strongly-typed way the former deals with passing parameters to a constructor of a faked class

using this hint we can try to guess that a fixmap must correspond to a dictionary data type in c# since a map is more or less like a dictionary of key-value pairs

more
data structure to implement reverse functionality of a dictionary that is more than one key map to a common value using python

more
the difference between a map and vector is a like an array while a map is more a dictionary of key value pairs

slightly better
map is slightly better because the shared dictionary has around 480 entries instead of around 450 but it s still inconsistent and not all 500 as expected

worse
i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations and√¢ in at least some implementations√¢ leaves some optimisations to the user that dictionary already has

slower std
for suitably large examples of each dictionary overcomes the constant factor by which it s slower than std map and will actually do operations like lookup insertion etc

slower
std map though is actually implemented in a way that many operations are slower than dictionary as its size gets large

much more
i know this question is a bit older but in es2015 there is a new data structure called map that is much more similar to a dictionary that you would use in c#

if what you are making is a map from one word to another you might be better off with a dictionary

c++ std map behaves more like a python defaultdict than dictionary

implementation faster
the immutable dictionary implementation is faster but no less pure in usage than the map implementation

better
i recently moved from autotest to guard for a reason it works better than autotest and it has a lot of available guard

in other words guard is more a generic framework for every process which needs to do something triggered by a file change autotest is restricted to running tests

model less
i guess one of them is that the push model is less coupled then the pull model

safer force
tortoise now has an option push new branch that may be safer than force pull or push

more scalable
i have found that pull is more scalable than push

better
is the performance of pull better than push in this scenario

request more
i create new branch add those new features and than i once again made pull request but now the features i implemented in the master branch are also in my new branch so my second pull request has more features than i want to push to the original project

better
alone push is better in the accepted answer can t quite work as a push-operation in some class can require a new pull at the pushed object

better
the reason the pull model works better than the push model in this case is as follow

more idiomatic
there is a certain irony here given that within xslt push stylesheets are generally more idiomatic than pull stylesheets

better rebus
if in-order processing is required a much better design would be to use another message processing library that supports a pull model which i think would fit your scenario much better than rebus push model

more
i have found that pull is more scalable than push

far more
why do you think that push is far more scalable then pull for starters

model definitely easier
a heartbeat mechanism pull model is definitely easier to implement but a push model is far more efficient

better
pull subscriptions perform much better than push subscriptions in a wan scenario

how are push notification better than pull notification on iphones

cheaper
i guess i m just surprised that the documentation recommends the approach of querying presumably continually in my case versus keeping a tailable cursor open i would have thought that push would be cheaper than pull

better option
generally a pop-up is a better option for a login dialog and a pop-up would allow you to easily navigate to the main page

more
i am using jquery ui dialog to show more than one pop-up on one page each pop-up will have its own id and it will be triggered by an anchor with a attribute

more
feed dialog is more intrusive in the sense that it has a facebook pop-up window

z-index less then
because of datebox pop-up z-index is less then your box mean dialog box s z-index it shows behind pop-up panel

better
use floating divs instead which looks like a modal dialog but are better than the pop-up

more intrusive
feed dialog is more intrusive in the sense that it has a facebook pop-up window

i realize this is an older post but we just ran into the same issue and resolved it by setting the z-index of the bubble pop-up to something higher than the dialog window

according to the postgresql which i gather greenplum is based on documentation for sequence manipulation functions it should return the value most recently returned by nextval in the current session.

better
greenplum and other similar solutions should work a bit better than postgresql depending on your data sets and use cases

definitely more
if the code doesn t run on php 5.2+ then you can t use a current phpunit versioning which is definitely more of a concern and my first general recommendation is to find any issues an php 5 upgrade might bring

greater
so just change your versioning to something else which must be greater than the upgrade versioning so that again first condition will be false and system will not check further and will connect without using tls

number always greater
for example if you start with a table and trunk adds column a and the branch adds column b then you merge trunk to branch - you cannot realistically upgrade to the versioning with both unless the branch versioning number is always greater than the trunk s upgrade script and that doesn t work if you subsequently merge trunk to the branch

higher
i am wondering what happens when i release a upgrade that has a higher target sdk versioning then the previous versioning of my app

lower
if product3 is installed and installed versioning is lower then upgrade

further
you do want to upgrade no further than versioning 2.1.6 at the moment as it s the latest one that supports rails 2.3.x

bigger jumps
btw - i went back and did the upgrade again with bigger jumps between versioning actually ran the site after each upgrade and it went perfectly

better idea
if you think that writing two apps for both versioning is a better idea then should i write app on wp8 first and at the end remove special wp8 features to downgrade it for wp7.5 or maybe i should write wp7.5 app and then add some wp8 features to upgrade it to wp8

more acceptable
and if somebody is running a 6-month old versioning with a known bug upgrade becomes a more acceptable answer if they are 12 versioning behind

newer
however if that upgrade includes myself say i have a package named server and part of the upgrade includes a newer versioning of server then the upgrade fails

newer
running pear -v gives me versioning 1.7.2 when i run pear upgrade pear it says my versioning is newer than the current noe which is 1.9.0 if ran pear upgrade -f pear to force an upgrade it downloads the files and installs successfully but i still have versioning 1.7.2 and cannot install phpunit

more
i heard that i should upgrade beatbox to something more than the versioning 21 to be able to access the forecastingitem object so i tried apt-get update upgrade beatbox but i still get the error

less
if you have six versioning less than 1.10 upgrade it

earlier
however if you have a current production mysql versioning that is earlier than v5.7.7 then the removal of this restriction on views should only be one of the criteria being assessed while making a decision as to upgrade or not

setup older
but during upgrade setup launches the older versioning setup bootstrapper ui

older
also i can not use custom dimension because my piwik versioning is older and i can not upgrade it now

number easier
using compatibility as the central point in the versioning number makes it easier for users especially if te product is a library to judge whether or not they can expect a smoothe and safe upgrade or not

older jackson
by looking at various blogs i understand glassfish versioning 4.1 has older jackson library 2.4 which does not have this method and need to upgrade jakcson versioning 2.8

if your server versioning is older it is highly recommended to upgrade postgres anyway to use jsonb efficiently

if your versioning is older than that it won t work and you ll need to upgrade

less
you are using a method to bind click event in your case is live and this has been removed in the latest jquery libraries from 1.9+ onwards so make sure your versioning is less than 1.9 or better to upgrade the library and use the recommended method for it .on to delegate the event event delegation syntax is little different with .on

higher
this will restart the site and when it runs for the first time after that it will see that the dll versioning is higher than the one in the config files and the db and will kick off the upgrade procedure

more
you want to make sure the code will work when users upgrade more than 1 versioning and that the update statement only runs the one upgrade it is needed

higher
if you are running that versioning or higher or after you upgrade follow these steps

probably better
as painful as it s going to be for both of us to perform the upgrade it s probably better to commit the time now and get the code up to the latest versioning than to try to find an older versioning that reduces the effort

somewhat earlier
if the code is to be distributed consider compiling that java class with a target jvm versioning that is somewhat earlier than the latest √¢ otherwise some users will be forced to upgrade their jvm to run your software and some of those won t have admin rights to do that.

lower
if i enable this then any setup is ran every time it will be asking for upgrade either it is on lower versioning over higher versioning or higher versioning over lower versioning

older
windows installer rollback will work as you request if you use 1 a minor upgrade or 2 a properly sequenced major upgrade that uninstalls the older versioning after successfully updating all files

actually newer
upgrade actually installs newer versioning of the packages you have

newer older
also don t forget to upgrade the gradle plugin to 1.5.0 or newer as older versioning are not supported

less
if you have six versioning less than 1.10 upgrade it

newer browser
these locations will convert when they go to windows 7 perhaps or because the application they use internally is upgrade and needs the newer browser versioning

longer
by default psycopg2 uses its own versioning of libssl and it seemed to keep a dependency on an old versioning of the library which no longer existed after my upgrade

less
and looks like your php versioning is less then 5.5 so upgrade your php versioning 5.5 and it will work

more
code upgrade require system downtime and if you have a large cluster that cannot run more than one versioning of code at once you ll need to take the entire cluster down at once

itext versioning is 5.5.x but i guess we can upgrade it if the task would be easier with newer versioning

higher target
i am wondering what happens when i release a upgrade that has a higher target sdk versioning then the previous versioning of my app

greater then
i am using installshield 2011 and what i want to do is on an upgrade to install all the files that are equal or greater than then versioning that is already installed

sequence much simpler
the upgrade sequence is much simpler i have a hard link in the app that points to the latest versioning of the apk the donwload starts and automatically laucnhes the install

less likely
the dbi versioning is less likely to be the source of the trouble but it would still be good to upgrade to the most current versioning

newer
at least if the php versioning is newer and not including the deprecated functions like the extension in the error message i recommend to upgrade to a newer typo3 versioning and find a way to replace the extension ph_nextgenmenu with a newer one or edit it manually to use the typo3 sql api or the newer php functions directly

greater

more simple older
to upgrade your plone site from 4.3 to 5.0 you can check this link section upgrading plone 4.x to 5.0 the migration should be more simple than older versioning like 3.x or 2.x

number bigger
if the apps versioning number is bigger it s an upgrade and you now need to save that as the last installer versioning

higher
if blackberry device software versioning is higher than os 6 then continue the app otherwise prompt user dialog showing upgrade os first and exit the application

slower previous
since the upgrade the content authors are complaining that the experience editor performance is much slower than previous versioning

older
if your versioning is older than 5.0.0 run pip install --upgrade notebook to upgrade

less
if kernel versioning is less than 2.6 then we recommend to upgrade it

worse
the problem was the same on both versioning though perhaps a bit worse after the upgrade

better
if you re using older versioning it is better to upgrade and avail benefits of c++11 features as much as possible

less then
and looks like your php versioning is less then 5.5 so upgrade your php versioning 5.5 and it will work

actually newer
apt-get upgrade actually installs the newer versioning

better approach
upgrading a language or service can often have disastrous or unexpected consequences thus sandboxing alternate versioning seems the better approach plus it makes projects immune from os upgrade

better last
you can safely upgrade to trunk its better than last versioning anyway

easier
does anyone know if the upcoming v8 versioning is easier to upgrade or if its easier to upgrade from a certain previous versioning compared to earlier versioning

probably more
no problem mnt i mentioned possible compatibility between the method tried in 4.25 my solution and 4.00 your versioning but keep in mind the gap in time between these versioning is probably more than two years of upgrade and also a jump between backend databases versioning oracle 10g to oracle 11g r1.

more
and if somebody is running a 6-month old versioning with a known bug upgrade becomes a more acceptable answer if they are 12 versioning behind

a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory

even more
if you don t mind the libc allocation functions realloc is even more efficient it wont copy the data on a shrink just mark the extra memory as free and if you grow the memory and there is memory free after it will mark the needed memory as used and not copy either

more complicated
dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does

slower
a fairer comparison would be comparing stringstream to the printf sscanf line of functions which would be slower than strtod but still faster than stringstream

slower
the reason why the vpn is slow is well because your vpn is likely 50 to 100 times slower than your lan local area network

poorer performances
first step would be to investigate why a processors with hyperthreading simultaneous multithreading could lead to poorer performances than a processors without this technology

greater
in computer 1 the eigen3 performance is worse because the number of total processors virtual + physical - √¢ due to hyperthreading is greater than the number of physical processors

more
you may find that hyperthreading helps more on code that is using large amounts of memory so that the processors is regularly blocked on fetching from memory

better older
more modern processors handle hyperthreading better than older processors

more logical
a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors

between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle

trac s issue tracking is little better than bugzilla s...i know a lot of folks love trac but i find it very inflexible

quicker
not sure about the overhead of calling gethashcode a few million times but comparing two ints is probably going to be a lot quicker than the equals object method

implementation much more expensive
in the equals method only if you re certain the ensuing equals implementation is much more expensive than gethashcode which is not vast majority of cases

faster
1 is comparison via gethashcode check if the hashcode of both objects are the same faster than equals

faster equivalent
even though gethashcode itself should be fast it s not mostly faster than equivalent equals

quicker
gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique

more specific
equals on the other hand can test accross a larger number of fields - ie its test is more specific than gethashcode comparisons

slower
if you do not implement gethashcode union will call equals which will work but is slower than gethashcode

more tolerant
override both methods but make gethashcode more tolerant than equals that means make unequal objects have the same hash code and not the opposite

faster
and that is for performance reasons assuming that a gethashcode implementation should always be much faster than an equals implementation

faster
would an arrays be faster than a for-loop in this case

here more efficient
the for-loop here is more efficient for 2 reasons a you don t have to construct a temporary arrays of tuples like with zip and b it returns false as soon as a non-match is found

less
in such a simple arrays you shouldn t be concerned about memory usage but the for-loop consumes less memory than foreach because foreach uses an internal copy of the arrays

less time
i am just starting to learn about the streams and parallel in java and i was wondering why a normal for-loop takes less time than intstream paralleled at adding items to an arrays

faster
iterating pair-wise you d normally do something like but iterating over an arrays is faster than using a c-style for-loop

faster
thus the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must

faster
i tried this code with my the big arrays it is around 10 to 20 times faster than a for-loop solution and around 200 times fast than the old code

bigger
it turns out i had a hard coded maximum index in my for-loop which was bigger than the arrays i was trying to assign to

less
but the for-loop is not reading writing the last part of the parent file which is less than the arrays size

here more
the for-loop here is more efficient for 2 reasons a you don t have to construct a temporary arrays of tuples like with zip and b it returns false as soon as a non-match is found

probably closer
try catch inside for-loop is probably closer as long as you don t mind the unassigned values left in the arrays

quicker
to my knowledge and research so far - javascript s native for-loop is quicker than arrays map for iterating through the arrays

faster
the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only be accessed once per iteration

less
okay so after telling the user to enter the size of the arrays the arrays was assigned to lets say 5 therefore in the first for-loop the program is checking if i is less than the arrays size so it can only be entered 5 times as that is the size of the arrays

worse
so then i think to go with that approach i would end up with a for-loop and loads of add calls but surely that is even worse than the arrays copy isn t it

faster
it returns a byte arrays of all the pixels which can be iterated much faster than a for-loop with a call to getpixel inside nested inside another for-loop

more handy
this is a scenario where a traditional for-loop is more handy than just iterating over the arrays

faster
i completely failed to check that assertion and just jumped into the analysis of how the enhanced for-loop is faster on arrays than lists

slower
in this case instead of generating two large matrices with the row and column indices you can use a for-loop on the rows of your arrays it s slower but not as slow as a double for-loop

nothing more
looping with a for-loop is nothing more than a basic iteration of an arrays using a for-loop

less
i am just starting to learn about the streams and parallel in java and i was wondering why a normal for-loop takes less time than intstream paralleled at adding items to an arrays

ndx less
on the last iteration of the outer for-loop ndx is one less than array.length so when you call arrays ndx+1 that is equivalent to arrays array.length which out of bounds since arrays start indexing at 0

more
in your code on line in the for-loop does no more point to an arrays --the compiler has no information about the length of the variable that it s pointing at whether it is an arrays a single chars or an int or something else-- but it is just a plain pointer presumably a pointer pointing to a default int

smaller
to use this in a loops you can write a simple for-loop which always checks if the index stil is smaller than the arrays length

more
the longer the arrays gets the more iterations your for-loop will need

less memory
in such a simple arrays you shouldn t be concerned about memory usage but the for-loop consumes less memory than foreach because foreach uses an internal copy of the arrays

shorter
in this case if any element in arrays is shorter than 11 symbols will become big and for-loop will stop executing

easier
with one arrays one can do which is easier than a for-loop

shorter
because if the first word in arrays is shorter than second one you need second for-loop

longer
the hits arrays is longer than numtotalhits so your for-loop limit should be numtotalhits instead of hits.length

better
also with the for-loop it s considered better to limit the scope of the iterating variable i and to use println you need system.out not just system and you need a string java arrays do not override tostring so something to output the numbers the user entered after loops like

better
but when looping through an arrays it s better to use a regular for-loop

better
the questions should i use for-loop or is it better to do it recursively next insert will be called after previous is done should i check if saved.length datalength and then return the arrays or is there some better way how to do it

less
so when you go up an arrays 0-9 you want the top of a for-loop to be less than the arrays length when you are going down the arrays 9-0 you want the lower bound to be less than or equal to the bottom of the arrays otherwise you will start out trying to access at 10 the arrays length and get an outofrangeexception

less
when i try to access it with a for-loop where its index is less than the arrays length i get the following error message typeerror function object is unsubscriptable

method faster way
when you know both objects are arrays method is a faster way to check equality than for-loop

better speed
use a for-each loops to go through a range it s not as fast as using a variant arrays but keeps things simple and offers better speed than a for-loop

less
if the length of the arrays is less than 8 a regular for-loop summation is performed

much more reliable
i ve used it for convenience a for-loop is much more reliable for converting an htmlcollection to an arrays

more
next i can use 3rd 4th and 5th level of arrays means more than for-loop statement will be assign

more
im going to have a second for-loop that makes more arrays and names these arrays as the strings from my previous arrays

faster
the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only be

slower
when summing an arrays over a specific axis the dedicated arrays method array.sum ax may actually be slower than a for-loop

smaller
as mentioned above as you remove items the arrays gets smaller so a for-loop is probably not the best solution

still more times
but the outer for-loop still runs 9 more times pushing temp which is already a set number onto the numbers arrays

more
this is a scenario where a traditional for-loop is more handy than just iterating over the arrays

faster
it is clear without any performance tests that native javascript for-loop is faster but there is no big difference for small arrays like 10-20 small items

usually more
an arrays usually offers more information for alias analysis and after some optimizations the same code will be generated anyway search for-loop strength reduction if curious

faster
for example sometimes a for-loop is faster than the built-in arrays methods in some browsers

more suitable
a for-loop is more suitable to iterate through the arrays

more
but modifying the arrays is more work than a simple for-loop again

more
a for-loop is more adequate than a do while for simply iterating an arrays string

better
edit using an enhanced for-loop is a lot better than using arrays

still more
but the outer for-loop still runs 9 more times pushing temp which is already a set number onto the numbers arrays

much larger
above is a simplified version of my actual code where the c arrays is much larger so i have to use a for-loop to get every index

typically more straightforward
in its implementation foreach executes a closure over every element in the arrays this is typically more straightforward and transparent alternative to old-fashioned for-loop

more adequate
a for-loop is more adequate than a do while for simply iterating an arrays string

more
a for-loop is more suitable to iterate through the arrays

more point
in your code on line in the for-loop does no more point to an arrays --the compiler has no information about the length of the variable that it s pointing at whether it is an arrays a single chars or an int or something else-- but it is just a plain pointer presumably a pointer pointing to a default int

probably better
i suppose the first option is good for small arrays but a for-loop is probably better practice as the amount of code would remain the same regardless of arrays size

probably closer as
try catch inside for-loop is probably closer as long as you don t mind the unassigned values left in the arrays

better
but you will have loops the outer arrays in order to get it to work which would be better done with a for-loop so you reference both at once

more iterations
the longer the arrays gets the more iterations your for-loop will need

faster
this is the reason why working with the higher-dimensional arrays ends up being so much faster than the for-loop -based code

longer
note that this is one of those cases where matrix division of large arrays takes longer than a for-loop

more
but i don t want to use a for-loop as my json arrays has more than 3 entries and if i request a lot of data in short time it takes long time till the for-loop goes through every entry

usually better
in my opinion a for-loop is usually better for doing something a specific number of times and if you re just iterating over every item in an arrays foreach is usually more straightforward

more
the only way to copy arrays that is more efficient than for-loop coding is system.arraycopy

far better
but then normal for-loop is far better for arrays than using for-in which is actually for object

much better
notice that besides using the filter method or not even with a plain for-loop is much better for performance create a new arrays from scratch instead of mutate the current one multiple times

more efficient
the only way to copy arrays that is more efficient than for-loop coding is system.arraycopy

greater
also change your logic in the for-loop to be not since i will not ever be greater than the arrays length

usually more information
an arrays usually offers more information for alias analysis and after some optimizations the same code will be generated anyway search for-loop strength reduction if curious

much more
i ve used it for convenience a for-loop is much more reliable for converting an htmlcollection to an arrays

less
i fixed this by adding after the for-loop and before the return statement which fixes the problem but if the for-loop is written to continue while i is less than the arrays length and when the arrays only contains a the length is one and i is 0 shouldn t it also pop a

method faster
when you know both objects are arrays method is a faster way to check equality than for-loop

more work
but modifying the arrays is more work than a simple for-loop again

4x faster even
running a quick benchmark it seems that the for-loop is 4x faster even in the worst case where you have to replace every single time and you construct a new arrays to hold the replacements

better
since it s an arrays it s better to use a for-loop with a counter variable i which starts from 1

typically more
in its implementation foreach executes a closure over every element in the arrays this is typically more straightforward and transparent alternative to old-fashioned for-loop

much better
you can use array.prototype.find method to check if the element exists in arrays which is much better than perform a traditional for-loop

simpler
note that you should check if index is within arrays bounds in such cases and that system.arraycopy is more efficient and arguably simpler than a for-loop for copying arrays

better
but for the arrays it is better to use for-loop as shown by alnitak than for-in

4x faster
running a quick benchmark it seems that the for-loop is 4x faster even in the worst case where you have to replace every single time and you construct a new arrays to hold the replacements

more
that suggests another aspect where a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods that is more static type checking although it is undesirable here

directly technically faster
edit as willeke has pointed out accessing a properties directly is technically faster than doing so via an accessor via self

nothing more
a properties is nothing more than syntactic shorthand for a get set accessor

more
it means a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods getter setter

easier
i recomend to use dtmilano tool androidviewclient that is easier to use than monkeyrunner

slower
i need to perform several device.touch events as fast as possible however androidviewclient seems to achieve those significantly slower than monkeyrunner

much easier
networkx is much easier to deal with and usually performance is good enough but for large brute force algorithms like this igraph will probably be at least an order of magnitude faster

faster
i probably feel fseek might be bit faster than fread as fseek changes the pointer position to the new address space that you have mentioned and there is no date read is happening

faster
so i guess fseek should be much faster than fread

more
in such a case passing by value may no required actually passing anything at all -- the value that s passed is basically little or nothing more than a placeholder for this is the object

you may also find that opencover will work better than partcover as it has 32 and 64 bit support as well as supporting .net2 and .net4 - and copes much better with target processes that spin off more processes to do the actual testing

a dawg has better memory performance if the strings have many common suffixes but they are more expensive and difficult to build and update so start with a trie

higher precedence
multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

more
generally the division is more costly than addition i think but not much difference in this case

higher precedence
multiplication and division are higher precedence than addition so they get done first - before the implicit conversion to string for concatenation

more expensive
the first difference is that division is much more expensive than addition

higher
since division has a higher precedence than addition 5 2 gets evaluated as a integer division returning 2 as an integer

less work
in addition to that the crossing off may be less work than a division don t know about python it is for c arrays

operator higher order
the division operator has a higher order precedence as the addition operator

higher precedence
the division operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator + so you need to enclose the sum with brackets before dividing

more
so even disregarding that division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small

higher precedence
since division has a higher precedence than addition 5 2 gets evaluated as a integer division returning 2 as an integer

operator higher
this happens because the division operator has higher precedence than the + addition operator

higher precedence
multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

slower
2.the division by 2 can be done by bit - shift operation is it really slower than addition

more expensive
so even disregarding that division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small

so if your code has tough data dependency problems addition is about 12 times faster than division

faster
an addition is faster than a division and a multiplication

operator higher
the division operator has a higher order precedence as the addition operator

higher precedence
division has a higher precedence than addition or subtraction so it s really this

it could be done via division which is much slower than addition or it could be translated into a bitwise and operation as well and end up being just as fast as the version

much slower
it could be done via division which is much slower than addition or it could be translated into a bitwise and operation as well and end up being just as fast as the version

slower
it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition

higher precedence
the division has higher precedence than the addition so what you re calculating is sumaverage1+ sumaverage2 5 which is integer division which is probably not what you want

slower
division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

higher precedence
finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

far more
best example the division it an an addition are both o 1 but usually the division takes far more cycles time to execute than the addition

longer
the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

faster
for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

more expensive
if you are doing physical simulations things like division or square roots are going to be way more expensive than addition

simpler
knuth writes that fibonacci search is preferable on some computers because it involves only addition and subtraction not division by 2. but almost all computers use binary arithmetic in which division by 2 is simpler than addition and subtraction

higher
division has higher precedence than addition

operator higher

it works great in google-chrome and safari haven t tested ie but i m sure it s somehow worse than firefox

more forgiving
but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery

more problems
please especially test on safari because it has some more problems than firefox and google-chrome

taller
i saw that the discrepancy was because in safari the text element is taller than in firefox and includes a slight amount of whitespace on top that doesn t show up in firefox in firefox the top of the text element is exactly when the text starts

more anti-alisaing
in particular a font may be rendered quite differently between the various browsers and operating systems in current use - safari and macos use more anti-alisaing than firefox or ie but ie9 has a new feature called cleartype which also affects font rendering

even worse
i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better

weaker invariant
protected functions maintain a weaker invariant than the public one before and after each call

less accessible
since package protected is less accessible than public the code is reducing the accessibility of the foo method

more restrictive
otherwise there is still the possibility to change a public access to a protected or package private access which will be much more restrictive than public

easier
what is the true rationale behind all the private and protected stuff when we can just make our life as a programmer easier by using public for everything

less
since package protected is less accessible than public the code is reducing the accessibility of the foo method

more permissive
for public inheritance it means that all the accessible members of base class that is the public and protected members can not be at a level more permissive than public

closer
protected is closer to public than private

less accessible
change it to public to make it more accessible or perhaps better protected to make it less accessible than public but more than private read more about that here

less
oh i see you need a constructor that has more access than protected but less than public

higher
public is higher than protected so there s no problem

more
so a protected is more restrictive than public and private is more restrictive than protected

much more
therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public

better
reason i once heard that protected is better for hibernate performance but all i can find on the web is hibernate can access public private and protected accessor methods as well as public private and protected fields directly

more sense
therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public

more restrictive
protected is more restrictive than public

access more
the theory is that someone extending your class with protected access knows more about what they are doing than someone who is merely using it with public access

more restrictive
so a protected is more restrictive than public and private is more restrictive than protected

better
that means private is better than protected protected is better than public etc ..

more
protected is more restrictive than public

more limited
from a software engineering point of view as soon as you make a function protected you expose it to other users of course much more limited than public exposure but still much more exposed than private and you create expectation about some stability of the api

more restrictive
so a protected is more restrictive than public and private is more restrictive than protected

actually closer
furthermore protected is actually closer to public than to private

better
it s not perfect but i guess that a protected method that does not check parameters is better than a public method that does not do it

if your range were sorted in some manner then you could look at the extreme ends if the end s min is greater than the targetmax then say look at the range 1 4 backwards from the end etc.

less
if max and min are independent variables the extra subtraction for max-min will waste time but if that expression can be precomputed at compile time or if it can be computed once at run-time to test many numbers against the same range the above expression may be computed efficiently even in the case where the value is within range if a large fraction of values will be below the valid range it may be faster to use because it will exit early if value is less than min

i m working on slider that updates 2 text boxes with values the slider is in a limited range so it doesn t give values lower higher than min max

as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication

operator higher precedence
note that the exponent operator has a higher precedence than multiplication and division just like in mathematics

not faster
the misunderstanding is that incrementing the exponent is not faster than doing a multiplication

this is analogous to the way you can compute exponent using successive squaring much faster than by repeated multiplication

however with really very small parameter 2 in your case exponent is faster than multiplication

operator higher

slightly larger
it seems like if the uiimage is slightly larger the ciimage is double the size whereas if the uiimage is slightly smaller this isn t the case

heavier
will hide the exception-handling and since dealing with exception-handling is heavier compared to a simple if t why isn t the normal new t not considered less good practice considering we will have to use try-catch to check if a simple allocation succeeded and if we don t just watch the program die

better
so here the unchecked exception-handling is better to use in order not to copy and paste all that ugly try-catch block rethrowing an exception-handling and add the throws clause to the method

more
try-catch rsources is fine for some cases but this is the old way and works better when you have more than 1 exception-handling in a block

actually slower
try-catch is actually slower if there really is an exception-handling thrown

more
in general try-catch is more robust does not require you to define an exact position of where to test could be a block and provides info about the exception-handling

more robust
in general try-catch is more robust does not require you to define an exact position of where to test could be a block and provides info about the exception-handling

more sense
also note that using keyup or input makes far more sense than keydown otherwise the previous value will only be evaluated on the next event occurrence

earlier
as you can see the keyup events of numpad5 and numpad6 occured earlier than their keydown event

better
edit keydown is a little better than keyup for the element bind now enter key fails silently-ish

earlier
the events seem to not follow strict sequential rules second keydown comes earlier than first keyup so the timer gets initialized multiple times

better
also if you notice i ve changed the keyup event to keydown which is better in my opinion cause when the user holds their finger down on a button the code wouldn t be fired if it is on the keyup event

earlier first
the events seem to not follow strict sequential rules second keydown comes earlier than first keyup so the timer gets initialized multiple times

more
then the right events to do it is keyup more than keydown since the value isn t yet in the field at this moment or on change

just better
they have their differences better stick to one i prefer for this example to use keydown just plays better with me you can use keyup

smoother transition
in my test keyup gives a smoother transition as compared to keydown

more
keyup is more preferable than keydown because keydown may occur multiple times if user keeps it pressed

smoother

this tiny overhead on add is vastly outweighed by the savings on lookups since all programmers should know and understand that case-insensitive compares are vastly slower than case-sensitive especially with unicode - the cpu can t just do a block compare of data but must check each pair of characters specially even using a table look-up this is vastly slower

the panels itself is larger than the form and is scrollable autoscroll true

more straightforward
on the other hand you may want stable sorting in other contexts as well and so if you have the stable_sort function defined this approach would still be more straightforward than filtering out the numbers with each sign and recombining them

more complicated
considering sorting is more complicated than summation median filtering will cost longer time

more
sorting is more important to me than filtering so if i have to have both sorting and filtering target the same representation of the data i ll just give up on filtering working

less expensive
filtering is a lot less expensive than sorting

cheaper
if your author field is selective and sorting is cheaper than filtering

faster
in terms of your speed query i d propose that your pseudomedian filtering is faster because it doesn t involve sorting

faster
you d still have to filtering to get a range though it ought to be faster than sorting at least

longer
but right now the sorting step is taking way longer than the filtering step so i would like to combine them in some way

slower just
if almost all elements fail the filtering then it s considerably slower than just sorting everything since you ll end up selecting thousands of times

more important

more general
nsstring is more general as it leaves you the oppertunity to create another subclass of it that could add the altering functionality without using the nsmutablestring s implementation why ever you would want that to do

more
note also that using nsmutablestring is more efficient than creating a new nsstring each time a letter is added

note also that using nsmutablestring is more efficient than creating a new nsstring each time a letter is added

more things
all-in all the reason is that nsmutablestring is able to do more things than nsstring and can do anything nsstring can hence the direction of inheritance

posting qevents to qobject is faster than using signal-slot invocations because there are no copy constructors called and there s no marshalling done except directly by you upon construction of a qevent

occasionally the stdout needs more than a write method fflush is another common one which stringio will handle

frequency lower
i guess that these lines have shorter output so the fflush frequency is lower i used the stdout line to print a deliberate help message

r-tree are substantially faster than quadtree for window queries like inside contains covers etc

jtextfield is more than 1 line height and jlabel is not in left side

always easier
because copying text result from jtextfield is always easier than retyping it from jlabel note that jlabel is not focusable

further to this i m still opting for scoreloop and i can confirm this behaves the same regarding one score per user but it offers a lot more functionality and does seem to respond much quicker than openfeint did for me

lower overhead
also take a look at silex as this has lower overhead than symfony and works with symfony forms

greater
index for children will always be greater than the parent as shown in the vector above

more
this does not work if any parent has more than one children

greater
check if any of the children are greater than the parent node

height greater
if children height is greater than parent i need to set height of children to parent

more
use router-outlet in the parent component and make more than one children route in the routing file

less child
how would i go about creating a formula by which to traverse a data tree stored as a one dimensional array in which the root has k children and where each child has one less child than the parent

more stable
this really helps keeps parent branch more stable than children

id lower number
the above query only works if the parent id is a lower number than all the children

more
so in this labelling scheme left children are 2 i+1 more than their parent where i is the height of the child while right children are 1 more than their parent

wider
just calculate the parent width and children container width using jquery and if the parent is wider than children container make a transform across x axis to shift all thumbnails to the left

higher
i m trying to stop dragging the children div when his position is equal or higher than the parent position

node lower id
this class assumes that nodes have numeric values for id and pid and parent node has lower id than its children which is common in tree structures

larger
so the problem i have now that the parent div height is larger than his children s height

larger id
are the nodes in order like in your example where the children have a larger id than the parent

node smaller value
where the parent node is a smaller value than that of its children

more
please notice how the family cell stretches to house more than one parent rows and the parent cell streches to house more than one children rows

elements larger
how can i achieve that my container will adjust the height accordingly of the children items when the height of the children elements is larger then configured minheight of their parent element

node always smaller
min heap in which parent node is always smaller than its children

lower
because the parent has lower z-index than the .modal-backdrop everything in it will be behind the modal irrespective of any z-index given to the children

higher z-index
the parent establishes a stacking context and the children have higher z-index than the parent and cover the parent up so that s all fine

less
a heap is a data structure that maintains only the property that all parent are less than their children or all parent are greater than their children

higher
this is because the secondary sorting orders by id and if the parent id happens to be higher than any children the parent may not show up on top of the children

smaller
i want to prevent the two divs to be placed under another if the parent width becomes smaller than the children combinded width

bigger
as a general rule of thumb i keep the parent bigger than the children

larger
to prevent children divs to become larger than the parent you have to set an overflow

higher
as we use less i was thinking about using a condition where i could specify that if the height of the children is higher than the parent s height the background-color is different

greater
both children are greater than the parent

more
this way it is not ok if the parent has more children let say they are input s

larger
max heap in which parent node is always larger than its children

more
there are also different types of trees -- i am going to assume that you are using a normal old tree any number of children no more than one parent one root node

width smaller
i want to prevent the two divs to be placed under another if the parent width becomes smaller than the children combinded width

always lower
i will assume that this data structure represents a tree and that nodes are numbered so that the parent always has a lower index than the children

less
the reason we only traverse a tree from the parent to the children is because we are usually searching for a specific node and as long as the binary tree is implemented such that all left children are less than the parent and all right children are greater than the parent or vice-versa we only need links in one direction to find that node

less
if the actual size of the parent s list of children is less than the parent s expected number of children originally read from the file push the parent back onto the stack

#wr more
since the parent #wr has more children #con_bottom does not fit

greater
i think that in short the second answer to that question covers it all the heap constraint which is that children are greater than their parent does not completely specify the heap so there is usually more than one possible arrangement

worse
because of this i m not sure if traditional crossover algorithms will work well for instance i tried ordered crossover and the children it created were generally worse than its parent

longer
it looks like the parent will become a zombie too if children aren t handled and a child runs longer than the parent

greater
i have an issue when the player is small the children combine width is greater than the parent width

thinner
the parent element has overflow scroll and when the parent become thinner than the children i don t want the children to break line but the parent to overflow them horizontally

higher
i thought of using before and after pseudos to display top-to-bottom and bottom shadows on the containing element but these pseudos display within their parent element and positioning parent z-index higher than these children has no effect

more
you can check for each of those divs if it s parent has more than 3 children

wider
also if you don t want the boxes to wrap when the page is too small for them to fit on one line you will need to add white-space nowrap to the parent or make sure the width of the parent is wider than the two children

higher
and since the children in your home block start their own stacking context one level higher than the parent your home li can never be above the items inside it

larger
note that children nodes have value larger than the parent

often larger
the widths of the children is often larger than the width of the parent

deeper
it selects all direct children children exactly one level deeper than the parent

smaller
in a heap when there is any change in the heap insert delete update then the heap is restructured in a way such that the common priniciple is maintained in above case the parent remains always smaller than its children

less
i d say that the array must first be built into a heap using a typical buildheap function which starts at half the length of the array and calls a minheapify function to ensure each parent is at least less than its children

always lower index
i will assume that this data structure represents a tree and that nodes are numbered so that the parent always has a lower index than the children

more
if your table represents id_1 is a parent of id_2 then both a parent can have many children and children can have more than one parent this is known as a many-to-many relationship

higher opacity
i understand that children cannot have a higher opacity than their parent but is there a possible workaround for this

greater
that tree is a binary tree in the sense that each node has only two children but the child nodes aren t less or greater than their parent node

greater
simply put a max heap is a heap where the value of the parent is greater than the value of any of its children

div better yet
now since the pseudo-element is below all of the floated children the parent div happens or better yet seems to contain the floated children as well - which is really what you want

header bigger
the table can contain two or more headers where the parent header gets a bigger colspan and the bottom header conforms by giving the equivalent amount of columns i.e index 4 has two children indexed 1 and 2

smaller
i understand the heap is a structure that the parent node is always larger or smaller than its children nodes

more
but if you re dealing with children that have more than one parent then you re dealing with graphs and for that reason mysql it s not suitable for you

earlier
i guess the reason you observe this behaviour with just a guess it could be wrong is because the parent process is terminated earlier than its children so your terminal s prompt is printed before some of the children s output

more n
in the same breath i would also like to be able to run a specific number of child processes at any given time say for example n children running concurrently whenever one exits the parent process starts another child if needed but has no more than n children at any given moment

more
i believe that some parent will have more than 2 children

node lower
this class assumes that nodes have numeric values for id and pid and parent node has lower id than its children which is common in tree structures

more
i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do

smaller
assuming that the parent has a smaller id than any of its children and that the default value of the parent column is null could you order them this way

more
presumably you know that it is precisely that no node has more than one parent or more than two children

less
this works because a parent thread will always have an id which is less than its children

more
as harypyon suggests storing the children is a more efficient way of viewing this problem than storing the parent and then computing the children

higher rate
i subscribed to the main canvas sizechanged event and applied a scale transform so that the canvas and its children would shrink and grow in a zoom like fashion when the control is resized which is working but for some reason the parent canvas is shrinking at a much higher rate than the children making the children fall off of the canvas at a certain point because of the scale rate

smaller
this assumes that the id of the parent is smaller than the id of the children as is the case with the sample data in the question.

larger
specifically you compare the new root with the left and right children and keep swapping if the parent is larger than at least one of the children until the heap property is satisfied

more
in other words if a parent row can have more than one children when sending the fields to each child the parent data will be duplicated in each children

width smaller
of course there are a few other small details to take care of such as make sure the children width is smaller than the parent make sure the left and right margins and paddings are equal etc...

lower z-index
now the children have a lower z-index than the parent

better
do you keep the parent if they are better than the children

higher opacity
use rgba instead on the container div to set the opacity as the opacity properties is inherited by all children elements even text nodes meaning a descendant of any kind can t have a higher opacity than its parent

smaller
the naming of parent and child classes sometimes is counter intuitive as we often think as children as being smaller than the parent but in programming the child is the same as the parent but with extra funtionality

more
this gives me but when i loop through it i get duplicated parent when this parent has more than one children

smaller
min heap in which parent node is always smaller than its children

greater
once you have chosen a root node it is already easy to construct a bst taking into consideration the fact that left children are less than the parent node and all right children are greater than the parent node

bigger thread multiple
whenever a top parent reply tile goes out of the viewport it is disposed as expected but when trying to bring it back into view it scrolls right to the top and looks very jumpy even worse whenever a bigger thread with multiple children tries to come back into view it doesn t scroll at all

id lower
the above query only works if the parent id is a lower number than all the children

more
let s again use parent and children but like in real life children do have more than 1 parent

more
manytoone if you plan to have a tree as a parent can have more than one children

smaller
you need to just change the siftdown function so that the parent is always the smaller than the children

process earlier
i guess the reason you observe this behaviour with just a guess it could be wrong is because the parent process is terminated earlier than its children so your terminal s prompt is printed before some of the children s output

higher opacity
children can t have a higher opacity than their parent as their opacities multiply

greater
you allow children on either side of a node to contain keys that are neither less than nor greater than the parent

worse
by promoting the mating of more similar parent the children are less likely to be much worse than the parent because the parent just were compatible

wider
also the inner children div have to be wider than the parent div for the scrollbars to work

lower index
i will assume that this data structure represents a tree and that nodes are numbered so that the parent always has a lower index than the children

greater
there are relatively simple solutions if the parent always have an index greater than the children but that is not the case here

node always larger
max heap in which parent node is always larger than its children

more
if an element has only 1 child then the child is placed below the parent on the same x co-ordinate if the parent has more than one child then the children are placed with equal spaces apart and the parent needs to be in the middle above the children to two equal length lines join to both the children from the parent

larger
when you zoom in google chrome some zoom levels cause the children elements to be larger than the parent element

less
i suppose that once we start adding elements from h2 as children to elements of h2 then we will have to start checking whether that child is less than the parent and if not we swap them

less
the where clause basically includes only the parent who have less than 4 children or who do not have any children at all b.employee_id is null

view not larger
again if the parent view is not larger than its children the expansion suffix does not make any difference as well

more content
i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do

less
ultimately i want to filter all parent objects that have less than 2 children

node smaller
where the parent node is a smaller value than that of its children

higher
when opacity on a parent container the #contentborder div in this case is set to less than 1 any children inherit that and cannot be higher than the parent

smaller
if still not then think of it as a min heap represented in array guarantees that parent is smaller than its child but says nothing about are all children arranged in sorted order left to right

always smaller
in a heap when there is any change in the heap insert delete update then the heap is restructured in a way such that the common priniciple is maintained in above case the parent remains always smaller than its children

more
in that case the update is done directly on the child table parent has more children .

less
as with all the cases when weight is involved be sure that the needed space for width for the 2 children is less than what the parent can offer otherwise you will have things off screen

smaller id
assuming that the parent has a smaller id than any of its children and that the default value of the parent column is null could you order them this way

still larger
new h i is guaranteed to be the smallest of the old h i s children which is still larger than old h i s parent

smaller
also it seems this is only the problem when there are a lot of duplicates the heap doesn t seem completely capable of staying in order the parent is smaller than the children

smaller
in case 1 the node at which we stop is the local min because i it s smaller than both of its children and ii it s smaller than its parent which is the precondition of our deciding to check this node

better
in inheritance the father should not access the methods of the children it is better to inherit and implement new methods that have nothing to do with the parent in the child class

bigger
my children views have their height set to wrap_content i know that the behavior of wrap_content is to fit the content size unless its bigger than the parent

easier efficient
i would prefer the 1st one since maintaining 1 value of parent is easier efficient than maintaining list of all children

lower z-index
because the parent has lower z-index than the .modal-backdrop everything in it will be behind the modal irrespective of any z-index given to the children

element always higher
but my code only works if the parent element is always higher on the list than the children and i want to make that work universally

less
also if you are willing to change your layout a bit you could achieve this through weight and linearlayout note however that this will work only if the desired combined width of the 2 children is less than what the parent is willing to offer

more efficient
as harypyon suggests storing the children is a more efficient way of viewing this problem than storing the parent and then computing the children

smaller
in min heap a single insertion is o logn in the worst case as that cost is only incurred if the heap property that the parent value should be smaller than the children is violated

more
a parent part can have multiple children and a child part can belong to more than 1 parent

higher rating
you may need to also add another bit to the child2 join to remove the possibility of parent having a higher rating than the children

header bigger colspan
the table can contain two or more headers where the parent header gets a bigger colspan and the bottom header conforms by giving the equivalent amount of columns i.e index 4 has two children indexed 1 and 2

more
i wrote one query but it will fails if a particular parent has more than 10 children

directory trickier
also removing the m from a parent directory is trickier than it might seem so we need to make sure we move from the bottom of the tree the files first and not rename the directories till we re done with all the children

larger
again if the parent view is not larger than its children the expansion suffix does not make any difference as well

more
this query lists all parent sharing the same children where there are more than one parent

bigger
i ve thought in using a pairing function but that makes children exponentially bigger than parent so after a few splits there is an integer overflow

smaller
of course there are a few other small details to take care of such as make sure the children width is smaller than the parent make sure the left and right margins and paddings are equal etc...

node greater
the heap property that the parent node is greater than it s child nodes 2i + 1 and 2i + 2 using zero-based arrays holds for all nodes that have children

always greater
this is a draft i made and where i m stuck at - from the fact that we have distinct elements and the heap property we know that the parent is always greater than its children

greater
the reason we only traverse a tree from the parent to the children is because we are usually searching for a specific node and as long as the binary tree is implemented such that all left children are less than the parent and all right children are greater than the parent or vice-versa we only need links in one direction to find that node

more
notice that a children choice solution can have more than one parent and that choice can be either an array or one element.

larger
by the properties of the binary search tree you already know that all children have to be larger than the parent 15 therefore using one of them instead of the 25 is valid

smaller
why is the parent smaller than the children on narrow screens

greater
if children height is greater than parent i need to set height of children to parent

more
what if a parent has more than 100 children

larger sizehint
i was expecting the parent widget to have a little larger sizehint than the children layout

z-index lower
the problem here is the parent z-index is lower than the mask so any children are always behind the mask

greater
it looks like all the children have an id greater than the parent

greater
this children height can be greater than the parent container

wider
i have a collapsible panel that was designed in a way that the children green are wider than their parent red

more then
what i want to do is to search for all parent who has more then n children in other words i would want to get all user records that had an activity more then n times within given period of time eventtimestamp

less
just remember in a nested set all children s left values are greater than and right values are less than the parent

more
of course two parent can generate more than two children

smaller
assuming that the binary tree follows that all left children are smaller than their parent and all right children are larger than their parent you could use this property of the tree to reduce the amount you need to search through

more
i have one parent resource which can have more than one children of one attrbiute and one than more children of other attribute

view larger
suffix expand if the parent view is larger than the combined size of all its children additional space is available then the space is proportioned amongst child views with that suffix

am passing the word asdasdasd to the text area with the id source and triggering the click event.after that trying to check whether the result value which is wrapped under the newly created span tag or not.for that am checking whether its parent with the id result_box has more than one children

lower value
the max-heapfiy method of a heap bubbles up the max to the top such that any particular node s children all have lower value than their parent

bigger
ok if we say that the parent is always bigger than the children because it is above them we write

more
it can handle parent with more than two children and with a more complex input data set we could leverage the graph approach to do even more cool stuff

larger
edit in other words if the parent is larger than the total width of the children that s fine

higher
the z-index for the children should be higher than the parent

smaller
as long as each parent is smaller than its children - it will work

larger
make sure that the parent container has a width and that this width is at least larger than the children elements

node always greater
the max heap is an array that could be more easily represented with a binary tree where the parent node is always greater than it s children and every time you add a child you added it towards the left so that every time the tree increases it s height it is a full tree

more
basically you make your cells float with 20 width so 5 per row and height 100 of the container then you can change this height if the parent has more than 5 children cells

bigger
here s what it looks like if the parent is bigger than the children

bigger height
for some reason the second children class .main-body lightseagreen color of a column-layouted flexbox container .content-main plum color has a bigger height than its parent which i do not want it to

higher z-index
however if for example you have two parent sibling elements where one has a higher z-index than the other no descendant of the parent with the lower z-index will ever have a higher z-index than children of the parent with the higher z-index even if you set the former s children to z-index 500 or something like that

more
each parent can already have more than 1 children

also -webkit-filter
if any of the children also has -webkit-filter npx the filter gets applied twice once for child and once for parent

more
can children have more than one parent

more
an item can have multiple children and can also have more than one parent

always less
in a heap the parent is always less than all of its children or greater than all of its

faster
children is faster than find for example just like parent is faster than parent

less
however if the keys are not comparable how are we supposed to tell whether the children are greater or less than the parent

less
left children are less than the parent node and

less
unless the rounding goes the other way in which case your grandchild has less width and or your parent has less room to hold its children

higher z-index
since parent have a higher z-index than its children you need to change the default browser stacking behavior

smaller
then i thought of putting each integer from s into a binary search tree and searching for first occurence where one of children is smaller than query and parent is bigger than query but i don t know if this will work

bigger
ok so your parent are fixed width the children are bigger than the parent element also min-width 150px

lower
if the parent has lower z-index than the modal everything in it will be behind the modal regardless of the children s z-index

lower index
parent are always at a lower index than their children so it is ordered

lower id
this class assumes that nodes have numeric values for id and pid and parent node has lower id than its children which is common in tree structures

div better
now since the pseudo-element is below all of the floated children the parent div happens or better yet seems to contain the floated children as well - which is really what you want

higher vertically
tip when i place parent blue here higher vertically than children orange here and i notice the bird body with raised wings pattern of a parent on either side then i recognize a many-to-many relationship exists between the parent

greater
all right children are greater than the parent node

greater
the heap constraint which is that children are not greater than their parent does not completely specify the heap so there is usually more than one possible arrangement

more
if any parent has more children than there are parent the application crashes if any of the excess children are selected

more depth
then children have one more depth than their parent and children s path starts with the parent path

however not larger then
if the parent however is not larger then its children you won t notice any difference between those alignments

more
unfortunately this doesn t work as children can t have more than one parent

less n
i have a simple parent has_many children relationship and i m trying to get all parent that have less than n children

more
problem a parent can have more than one children and parent table is dependent on child table

lower
you could do something similar using the score values in sorted sets giving children a score just lower than the parent

smaller
here a number of methods are described to fix the parent which collapses to smaller than its floating children

less
i used to think heaps have this property but it just seems that the only requirement is for the children to be less than the parent

smaller height
if you have children that have a smaller height than their parent floats will bring them to the top whereas inline-block will screw up sometimes

more
children can belong to more than one parent

always greater
im trying to take an array of type t and switch its values around so it correctly corresponds to the rules of a heap where the parent is always greater than the 2 children

more
what i want to do is to search for all parent who has more then n children in other words i would want to get all user records that had an activity more then n times within given period of time eventtimestamp

always larger
as you are always swapping it with the larger of the two heap property means that the parent is always larger than its children

higher z-index
you would think that you could simply increment each element s z-index by two but that does not work due to the fact that children elements cannot have a higher z-index than their parent if the parent s z-index is set

greater
but its parent is greater than or equal to w so at some level of the tree one of the children of the greatest element is w

more
get all the parent that have more than two children

easier
i would prefer the 1st one since maintaining 1 value of parent is easier efficient than maintaining list of all children

lower
i don t want to hide overflowing part by overflow hidden i want to force parent div.alert height to be not lower than its children

higher
i ve tried a bunch of other things as well one of them being hook elements with insertafter but stay in parent - jquery which worked perfectly but if the position was higher than the children inside the parent it didn t know what to do with it and causing a lot of unwanted behavior

more
if one parent has fewer or more than two children the tree is not binary

div wider
in other words if the parent div is wider or narrower than a multiple of it s children unused space remains within the parent div

less
in case of min heap when you insert the element which is less than some nodes in the tree the data structure now doesn t follow heap condition in case of min heap value of parent should be less than its children so you have to shift up and up

however not larger
if the parent however is not larger then its children you won t notice any difference between those alignments

because in this case both the parent element and children elements are belonging to a same stacking context #root in your demo and negative z-index order let children stay lower than parent in the z axis

smaller
what if both children are equal and smaller than the parent

less
if the left children must be strictly less than their parent then duplicate keys form a linked list that works like a single node since you can t have any left children in it

smaller
when the browser window is smaller than the min-width the child elements are the correct width but the parent keeps getting smaller causing the children to overflow

greater
they seem to be trees in which each parent is strictly greater than its children

more
the myfile can have one parent and parent can have more than one children

more
if a parent has more than 2 children

higher id
this is a very simple case which will do that asuming your children always have a higher id than their parent

lesser
the invariant here however is that the parent s index must always be lesser than its children

higher z-index
as a side note the children can t have a higher z-index than their parent so everything inside .codbg is -1 behind the page then you need to fix the tab images the problem is not that they re behind the background it s that they re transparent and look darker on top of a darker background

wider
if there are two rectangles and the parent is wider and than it is high then the children should be placed next to each other

larger
assuming that the binary tree follows that all left children are smaller than their parent and all right children are larger than their parent you could use this property of the tree to reduce the amount you need to search through

smaller value
if a node has two children then the left child has a smaller value than the parent and the right child has a bigger value

greater
a heap is a data structure that maintains only the property that all parent are less than their children or all parent are greater than their children

larger
pushing and popping any item on a heap simply updates the elements in it in such a way that there is no node where its children are larger than the parent for max heap

less
the invariant is that each parent is less than both its children

greater
if smallest state of all children is greater than parent s state then update parent

wider
code is almost working but children divs are a bit wider than parent and i am getting a wrong value of offsetwidth

more certain
i don t know react so can you make any parent element with reactid not accept more than certain children

strictly greater
they seem to be trees in which each parent is strictly greater than its children

bigger
my children views may be a different width but it not be bigger than parent view

fewer
if one parent has fewer or more than two children the tree is not binary

more
the problem i have is that some children have more than one parent but because in order to use the recursive parent nicely i need to group the results by id i only see distinct entries

higher id
i can order by id but this doesn t feel reliable as even though i know in this case that children will have a higher id than their parent i can t guarantee this will always be the case in every circumstance i want to use a cte

always bigger
ok if we say that the parent is always bigger than the children because it is above them we write

higher
all children will have higher z than parent

worse
when such individuals are subject to crossover their children are likely to be worse than either parent

bigger
the children iframe will always be bigger than parent div and parent div overflow will be hidden

higher z-index
by giving .artist-container a higher z-index you are placing it higher in the stacking order than the child image though children always have a higher z-index than their parent

bigger
the result you are getting is also a valid heap - each parent is bigger than its children

more
on mac os x dwarfdump shows this relationship with indentation - children dies are indented a little more than parent dies

higher
is there any option to prevent parent element be overflowed by children element when children element position is absolute and hight of children is higher than parent

node always larger
i understand the heap is a structure that the parent node is always larger or smaller than its children nodes

elements larger then
how can i achieve that my container will adjust the height accordingly of the children items when the height of the children elements is larger then configured minheight of their parent element

smaller
when the children s line-height is smaller than parent s it looks like the children s line-height is ignored because parent s line-height will hold up the line box when the children s line-height is smaller

less restrictive
this would generally be the wrong inheritence structure if your saying what i think you are the reason being that children should not be less restrictive than parent

smaller
insertng in search binary tree you need to keep track that children are stored in the specific order child smaller than parent on the left and greater or equal on the right and parent has at most 2 children

greater
this is a draft i made and where i m stuck at - from the fact that we have distinct elements and the heap property we know that the parent is always greater than its children

more
disadvantages again if a parent can have a row that relates to more than one children data will be duplicated as there will be one row per each of them so there is a limitation in this solution

less opaque
as for inheriting opacity - children cannot be less opaque than parent but could be more

less room
unless the rounding goes the other way in which case your grandchild has less width and or your parent has less room to hold its children

smaller
your fixheap2 fails to consider the case where both children are valid but have keys smaller than the parent s

smaller
and the reason why the subtree isn t reached is because you only call heapifyhelper for the children if one of the children is smaller than the parent but when you call heapifyhelper 1 the two children of the node 5 are 9 and 11 both larger than the root value

wider
just calculate the parent width and children container width using jquery and if the parent is wider than children container make a transform across x axis to shift all thumbnails to the left

smaller
children smaller than parent

more
here a child will be having more than one parent and a parent has more than 2 children

larger
as you are always swapping it with the larger of the two heap property means that the parent is always larger than its children

lesser
however it is not possible to rotate in the current situation since both children end up in becoming lesser than a parent

faster
to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics

slower
using getfrontbufferdata in directx method is slower than gdi itself

slower
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

smaller
if you are talking about someone else s there is no promise that they will render larger than the screen since would be wise to clip their painting to what is visible and they may be further constrained by other factors such as the size of a directx surface which is smaller than the gdi limit

here in so i found a lot of questions asking something similar and the answers normally said you can use cglib or asm or javassist is better than cglib or bcel is old and is dying or asm is the best because it gives x and y

way better
the javadoc of javassist is way better than that of cglib

significantly slower then
note that javassist is significantly slower then for example cglib because it reads in class files directly instead of using reflective access in order to avoid class loading

slower
also javassist is recognized to be slower than cglib

significantly slower
note that javassist is significantly slower then for example cglib because it reads in class files directly instead of using reflective access in order to avoid class loading

this makes for example javassist or proxetta significantly slower than cglib which simply reads the methods via the reflection api and overrides them

more control
both a renderscript and opengl are used for getting high performance graphics and animation s.but still opengl is the best option to get high performance graphics because it is well documented and you will have more control over the glsurfaceview .but in renderscript some of the classes are depreciated in the current versions .its almost not possible to make a rssurfaceview to transparent

i am however no cpython guru and can get so much more out of ironpython than cpython as i can easily leverage the .net platform on which i am far more at home

if there s any heavy application logic as opposed to all of the work being networking files database ironpython is much faster than cpython at a few things and much slower at a few others so you probably need to profile and perf-test before you go too far down either path

it s possible that jython and ironpython are much faster than cpython as well as they are backed by heavily optimized virtual machines jvm and .net clr

faster
ironpython is faster than c# in certain areas but not faster than cpython however you can link ironpython to any language thus over coming problems but then again you can do the same with cpython

better
one of the largest benefits of ironpython is that it has effectively no gil - meaning that if you are both writing python code and it is multi-threaded - you can often get performance that is better than cpython without having to spawn multiple process and pickle objects across the boundaries

slower
it seems ironpython is just slower than cpython for reading text files

ironpython and jython are also jit-compiled although using the more generic jvm and .net jits so they tend to be faster than cpython for this kind of work as well

faster
i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython

worse
so if you want to use django or something like that it s probably not smart to use ironpython because it isn t really cross-platform doesn t work with some frameworks and it performs worse than cpython

version not more
the memcpy version is not more complex or more dangerous than the strncpy version

version not more complex
the memcpy version is not more complex or more dangerous than the strncpy version

even if underlying implementation is not so different memcpy is much faster because it does not have to check what it s copying strncpy will stop when it ll copy the end of string character null

faster
memcpy will always be faster than strncpy for any real world situation even in the corner case i spoke before look page_copy_fwd_maybe

probably faster
which is more efficient is up for debate but based on cpu bulk instructions which can copy an entire block of memory in one instruction memcpy is probably faster as strncpy would check each copied byte for a nul character

better
if you compute the length of the string for unrelated reasons or have the length of the string from other resources it s unclear to me whether memcpy is better or worse than strncpy

slower
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
