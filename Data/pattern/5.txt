usually from the business tier i can return a typed dataset or datatable which can be serialized for transport over asmx
53
which means that unreferenced memory will be freed up whenever the runtime feels like it typically not unless there s a reason to run since it s an expensive operation to execute
72
i want to format my existing comments as rdoc comments so they can be viewed using ri

73
in practical terms it means that the names used in external references will not be mangled like normal c++ names would
169
maybe it should be calculated on-the-fly or maybe you would like to use a different type for the backing store
170
this seems to have automated deployment capabilities from source control to production
175
the only requirement is that this should be done programmatically
234
can this easily be emulated in sql server 2005
265
should project level references be excluded from checkin
332
my philosophy would be to go ahead and make both structures accessible to the client in a polished way just under the assumption they would be used in tandem
555
they can be read from disk sniffed in network traffic lifted by a cross-site scripting attack phished from a poisoned dns so the client sends their cookies to the wrong servers
633
i have been unaware of the issues until now on using managed code to interface to mapi although the c++ code in the component should be unaffected by this error as it is unmanaged
650
i would like the version property of my application to be incremented for each build but i m not sure on how to enable this functionality in visual studio 2005 2008
695
that could be implemented through triggers or application code
717
i wrote a windows service using vb that read some legacy data from visual foxpro databases to be inserted in sql 2005
750
what i was thinking of can be achieved using list comprehensions but i thought that there was a function that did this in a slightly neater way

797
for anon users the dates could be displayed as utc or gmt or some such
885
to allow a function to modify its arguments they must be passed by reference
938
i found a discussion that indicated the text needed to be preceded with e as such
971
the player is even extremely skinnable and can be controlled with javascript
1069
on the downside source deltas can t be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are a lot of code changes in the repository
1130
if that field is a non-key field doesn t contain unique entries then the entire table space must be searched at n block accesses
1130
whereas with a sorted field a binary search may be used this has log2 n block accesses
1171
yes i should have been a bit clearer on what i mean by efficiency
1248
jeff your code is nice but could be clearer with constants as suggested in code complete
1266
thus the object on the heap cannot easily be changed in c# without creating a new boxed copy of a new int value
1376
the application will only be deployed on windows machines
1462
not only are strings likely to double in length on translation the entire ui may need to be inverted hebrew
1528
i know about icustomtypedescriptor and icustompropertyprovider but i m pretty certain those can t be used in silverlight
1619
honestly these days any self respecting web host that supports python and mysql ought to have mysqldb pre installed
1773
for example none of those numbers nor likely any combination of them can be used to tell you exactly how many such processes can run at once in a given amount of free memory
1936
if i use the viewdata parameter my post parameters will be changed to get parameters
1993
i m sure i could use ruby to extend emacs if i wanted to but emacs was designed to be extended with lisp so it seems to make sense to use it in that situation
2036
a this file will be added to version control after commit
2036
a+ this file will be moved after commit
2036
d this file will be deleted after commit
2067
in some cases the model can also be used to turn a data source into a higher level abstraction as well
2099
the same can be done in nunit excpet the attribute names differ slighty
2328
so again i need a way for the page viewstate to be updated on callback after the ajax method is fired
2379
so when using icallbackeventhandler you have two obstacles to overcome to have updated state management for callbacks
2538
but you could have invented monads
2538
in fact faced with various problems in functional programming you would have been led inexorably to certain solutions all of which are examples of monads
2538
note that monads let you do more than handle side-effects in particular many types of container object can be viewed as monads
2554
a small pitfall is like in java that objects passed by value can still be changed using their inner methods
2554
but when needed parameters can also be passed by reference using the ref keyword
2560
other alternatives are quicktime windows media player or even silverlight microsoft s flash competitor which can be used to embed several video formats
2598
basically if your site still works with javascript turned off then anything you add with javascript can be considered progressive enhancement

group by forces the entire set to be populated before records are returned since it is an implicit sort
2723
any random project folder can be expected to find at least one folder name project old and one named project
2754
when the setter is called such a validation service should be utilized to sanitize input into the object
2804
this is great for the visual appearance of the application because you can size the window however you want and the image will always be displayed using its best fit
2867
there is an issue with this method in that you already have to have accepted the rsa finger-print
2901
you can however pass an applicationcontext instad of a new form to application.run method and applicationcontext can be used to launch several forms at once
2928
one way to solve this is load the configuration in _global.asax.cx.application_start_ if the configuration is invalid you will be notified of this with the means of an exception
2928
your site won t start and instead you will be presented detailed exception information in the yellow screen of death
2933
python works on multiple platforms and can be used for desktop and web applications thus i conclude that there is some way to compile it into an executable for mac windows and linux
2980
these can be run by any user running os x
3045
this piece of data one of the columns gets updated in spreadsheet a but needs to also be updated in spreadsheet b
3152
extension methods that relate to basic data types int string etc or generics that have a wider application could be packaged and distributed across projects
3290
you could add some ajax-y goodness that reads a hidden form filed value requests a verification key from the server and sends that back along with the response but that will never be populated if javascript is blocked disabled
3290
you could always implement a more traditional captcha type interface which could be disabled by javascript and ignored by the server if the scripted field if filled in.
3308
you could try it is more for gui testing rather than a data layer testing application but does record your actions which then can be played back to automate tests across different platforms
3318
the collect method which can be applied to any enumerable object
3388
this can be configured to fill your database with sensible looking test data
3511
according to bodmas multiplication should always be done before addition therefore 17 is actually the correct answer according to bodmas and will also be the answer which your calculator will give if you type in 2 + 3 x 5
3610
when you view the log right click root of project tortoisesvn show log you can see the bug id that each checking corresponds to 1 and you can click the bug id number to be taken to fogbugz to view that bug automatically if you are looking at the actual log message
3776
that way each of these forms can be laid out in its own designer instantiated one or more times at runtime and added to the empty area like a normal control
3776
once they are added they could be flipped through using hide show or bringtofront sendtoback methods
3824
if server software like iis and apache couldn t run requests in parallel it would mean that every page request would have to be dished out in a queue fashion...likely making load times unbearably slow
3913
you can get an idea of how many rows are going to be scanned and what indexes are going to be used with explain syntax
3929
the blobs can be accessed using either a database connection or over the filesystem

i personally though it could be called overkill use a free single user license version of source gear fortress which is their vault source control product with bug tracking features
4171
worked awesome for me and have heard nothing but goodness about it
4234
so my company stores alot of data in a foxpro database and trying to get around the performance hit of touching it directly i was thinking of messaging anything that can be done asynchronously for a snappier user experience
4270
your ruby 1.9 example can be shortened a bit further
4384
here long would be printed haven t checked it myself because the compiler choses widening over autoboxing
4403
the appropriate --defaults-file setting can be found using the services manager
4420
leave password blank nothing after the colon you will be prompted when launching it
4597
you could also use managed c++ to write .net gui applications but i ve read in a few places that managed c++ wasn t really intended to be used in this manner
4614
the first parameter of the method needs to be prefixed with this in the signature
4639
.net versions can be installed side-by-side so it won t disrupt any legacy apps
4646
unfortunately the statement .net versions can be installed side-by-side so it won t disrupt any legacy apps isn t entirely true
4678
md5sum should be installed by default on most unix type machines and wikipedia s md5sum article has links to some windows implementations
4725
also i want to add even if you find places where lisp will make sense you will probably not convince anyone else that it should be used over java c++ c# python ruby etc
4922
here long would be printed haven t checked it myself because the compiler choses widening over autoboxing
5224
your httpservletrequest object has a getparameter string paramname method that can be used to get parameter values
5278
andalso operator makes sure that only if the left side was true the right side will be evaluated very important since ifx is nothing x.go will crash
5278
y must be initialized in order for y.dodance to be able to execute
5292
when using the operator both expressions will be evaluated every time regardless if one or both evaluate to false
5329
in our current system however we only have a single type of change request and just use a field to indicate whether it is a bug requirement change etc this field can be used to build report queries
5332
btw i think everyone agrees that tables should be used for tabular data
5337
a change request needs to go through a cycle in which the impact and effort has to be estimated for that change and then it has to be approved for implementation before work on it can begin
5340
it generates an xml file which can then be used to build the gui in a number of different languages
5352
environmental differences can be handled by having different versions of the relevant files in the trunk
5374
i would have thought this would be an easy one to google but i ve been unsucessful
5403
i agree that in this case wether it is to be considered a design flaw or a implementation flaw depends on the actual reason for why it fails to live up to expectations
5494
external incoming requests will be using the host header portal.mycompany.com and be forced to use ssl
5607
with identity page fill factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100 - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one
5719
as others have mentioned lists and tuples are both containers which can be used to store python objects
5754
in contrast to the real world memory allocation cannot be told where to allocate but will find a suitable spot with enough room and report back the address to the allocated memory
5831
basically compare two files designated old and new and produce a patch file that can be used to upgrade the old file to have the same contents as the new file
5831
the most naive algorithm i have made which only works for files that can be kept in memory is as follows
5963
pk generation can be decentralized each client generates it s own pk without risk of collision

i see the command msinfo32.exe can be used to dump a whole load of system version information which we might as well archive
6104
nodes represents objects to be rendered transformations controls groups .
6120
set a threshold score such that any matchscore threshold will not be considered a match for a given companyname
6144
if you now make copies of your changed files do a fresh checkout then subversion will lose track of how your changes should be merged back in
6452
in fact depending on how your executables are built you might be forced to install the framework and the service packs
6567
if you were to iterate the first reference you would get a class cast exception because once you hit the foo instance the foo could not be converted to string
6598
also if you re writing a library or something that might be reused using the gc mode locks anyone using the code into also using the gc mode so as i understand it anyone trying to write widely reusable code tends to go for managing memory manually
6612
i should have made it clear in my original question that i was looking specifically to plot real-time data
6658
what i would like to see in new tests though is flexibility in the way the test can be written natural assertions grouping and easily distributed test executions
6671
a suggestion from their documentation is to mark some subset as checkin tests which should be run whenever you check new files in
6679
furthermore the platform dependence regarding the separator character can be gotten around using file.separator file.separatorchar or system.getproperty file.separator
6686
nearly all of them can be used on any html element except for one or two
6899
i know that this can be done using server side cursors ie

if so - perhaps this can be exploited to implement a singleton mutex - which can in turn be used to guard the creation of the real singleton..
6955
objects of pod types 3.9 with static storage duration initialized with constant expressions 5.19 shall be initialized before any dynamic initialization takes place
7043
the wish interpreter should be installed by default on ubuntu
7077
it appears that the guidance in this area may have changed as stylecop now enforces the use of the c# specific aliases
7147
openvpn can of course be run on linux although i can t really offer any experience in doing so
7274
it is in java but could easily be adapted to any language
7303
this was available in vs 2005 with moss extensions but has to be run off windows server with a full moss installation and the correct permissions set
7327
i am not sure why would you say that unit tests are going be removed once refactoring is completed
7482
it hammered some points in that i should consider and it might have swayed my views a bit
7487
it makes a lot of crap that needs to be filtered out
7547
this can be done via sql enterprise manager or like this
7679
however it should also be pointed out that geotools is a large library so if you re looking something small quick and easy it s likely not the way to go
7681
could be used to seek for a known byte sequence representing the desired character representation in utf-8.
7729
the entire file must be transferred before playback can begin
7790
to clarify - this book is geared toward eclipse 3.1 and since i haven t done any rcp development of my own i m not sure how much things have changed

7957
standby allows a database to be brought up for read-only access between transaction log restores and can be used with either warm standby server situations or special recovery situations in which it is useful to inspect the database between log restores
7978
i m a not-designer as well and don t have much artistic sense and honestly cannot be bothered spending days weeks creating a ui for an application
7990
the output could be called a report i suppose but a reporting engine is not necessary
8034
recovery with standby is the ability to restore the database up to a parital date like norecovery above but to allow the database still to be used readonly
8081
basically what you get is a bunch of standard query operators that can be applied to any ienumerable of type t
8142
i just read up on a performance of linq and there is a huge amount to be gained by using compiled linq
8196
otherwise python ships with headers that can be used in c and does a fairly good job documenting the c python api
8353
yes it can definately be done using either merge replication or sync services

8451
cannot be paged to disk
8468
it doesn t have to be curried but writing another function assuming this function is being used in other instances with other variables would be a waste
8476
once the data is in your program it is liable to be paged out
8480
the flags attribute should be used whenever the enumerable represents a collection of flags rather than a single value
8637
the downside to this method is that it requires javascript and if you don t have javascript enabled your comment will be marked as spam however i do review comments marked as spam so this is not a problem
8654
given that you know the accuracy of your measurements you could have the 0.000 text be rendered in less than a thousandth of a second
8740
wouldn t it be simpler to use the built-in php ftp functionality than trying to roll your own

tables in an attached database can be referred to using the syntax database-name.table-name
8865
however this approach is not suitable in cases where the execution time of the tick code is not acceptable error in the timing of the tick since the timer will be disabled not counting during that time
8896
i m happy to be corrected on any of this but to answer your question - yes i have tried
8896
i think it would need educated intervention rather than my unsanitised experimental approach before i could be confident
8940
although the second nic won t be used by linux it is certainly recognised as a nic eth1
8941
could this be done in .net 3.x using extension methods
8987
scalar-valued functions can be called from .net as follows
9013
whole .net programs can be prototyped in ps as well as little oneliners to test functionality of methods...etc
9013
i agree with some of the posters above i consider anything done to setup build envrionments or work with data for dev tasks can be done with ps if not faster easier better but just as well
9049
regions must never be used inside methods
9049
they may be used to group methods but this must be handled with extreme caution so that the reader of the code does not go insane
9074
it seems you re going to be stuck rolling your own
9094
if you essentially talking about a large text field which could be stored as file my preference would be for db storage
9104
i could have sworn that this was possible years ago but i can t find anything that tells me either way now
9144
honestly i doubt that you ve got a lot of incoming developers who suck with c++ but would be awesome with python anyway
9279
i know the same thing can theoretically be accomplished using changedfiles or rsync but i ve always found the tutorials for both tools to be lacking and or contradictory
9372
this problem was however supposed to have been fixed in service pack 1 for vista
9413
the following function print is an example of a function which could be passed to func as a parameter because it is the proper type
9488
it can be achieved by using code snippets some are already built in try typing svm and hitting tab-tab
9537
i would have thought adding versions onto 2.0 would have made more sense altho i suppose it also is hard to get people to get their head around the fact that there are different versions of runtimes compilers and languages

to optimize storage space only document diffs should be kept just like source control software
9687
any field can be searched at anytime and in combination with one or more other fields
9751
but im afraid that if there are too many emails sent they will be marked as spam
9846
but i was also thinking since i was using mvp that i could also do the computationally expensive stuff in native c c++ code while the gui would be done with .net forms or qt or whatever
9859
speaking about the pessimistic model the left client connected for n days scenario could be avoided by setting lock expire date to say one day before lock start date
9950
as a starting point i d be tempted to add tracing log messages at strategic points within your application
9963
i have also learned that indexes need to be treated just like code files and put into source control
10020
notice that the tables of the database opened with open are available using main.tablename any attached database can be given any name at all otherdb in the example above
10103
edit as thomas danecker points out even though the access of the field is atomic s_initialized should really be marked volatile to make sure that the locking isn t broken by the processor reordering the reads and writes
10157
i would also be tempted to put a cancel button on the progress dialog and add a timeout otherwise if the update gets stuck or takes too long then your application will have locked up forever
10280
i guess you could always push the amount of threads available in the pool up but there would be little point in incurring the management costs of a thread that is never going to be given back to the pool
10286
any time you can easily partition processing into smaller jobs each of which can be processed independently worker threads and therefore a thread pool make sense
10286
thread pools do not make sense when you need thread which perform entirely dissimilar and unrelated actions which cannot be considered jobs
10348
given the list of mutexes that are held and a rough idea of the state that they protect assign a locking order mutex a should always be taken before mutex b
10478
i ve found a lot of stuff on google that seems to be focused on writing wysiwyg editors but that isn t what i want and most of it worked in ie but not in ff2 or 3
10600
so the answer should probably be presented in tiers for the size of the application but i m wondering about people s experience with choosing where the disk drives used by the database should reside
10760
integration testing might be performed by utilities such as cruise control
10830
if the column_datetime field is not indexed and is unlikely to be or the index is unlikely to be used then using datediff is shorter
10901
our codebase contains alot of legacy archaic code which must be kept operational
10949
do you write or rewrite once you discover the need for the clone all your unit tests for the class so that they can be invoked with either a virgin object or with a clone of it
10993
the paymentplan to the customer would be mapped using a bag which uses the details table to establish which customer id s mapped to which paymentplans
11002
i should have made that point in my original post - sorry
11064
there s also a practical limit on how long a sql string can be executed - aliases make this limit easier to avoid
11069
do you write or rewrite once you discover the need for the clone all your unit tests for the class so that they can be invoked with either a virgin object or with a clone of it

the database will be clustered with shared fiber channel storage
11251
xmlhttp should only be used client side because it uses wininet which is not supported for use in server service apps
11333
gpl is clearly one of the most popular open source licenses out there and also one of the few that on the face of it can t be applied to asp.net mvc applications
11359
it seems like windows performance logs and alerts might be used for this purpose somehow but it was not immediately obvious to me

since we are looking at doing our wiki in sp i need to know why we shouldn t do it for a group of 6 automation-developers to document the steps in various automated processes and the changes that have to be made from time to time
11532
are there features or apis built into php that will allow me to analyse my codebase - for example reflection token_get_all
11562
thus efficiency can be gained by overloading std swap with a custom type specific implementation
11617
and of course if you are using a modern language you ll probably be forced to use them for some things because they re baked into the standard libraries
11720
so a new virtual machine would be created from a template is fine with the os installed and some base software installed --- a new web site would be created in iis and the web app build output copied to a location on the virtual machine hard disk and iis configured correctly the vm would start up and run
11738
being able to have enum types have values other than int the default
11783
since i m sure it ll be asked the reason for the empty method is a preprocessor directive

if this format is correct the bytes must first be converted to utf-8 characters
11842
the pid can be found either in the task manager view- select columns... or visual studio s attach to process
11854
for example several objects have a damage counter but to make this easy to use in an object list polymorphism could be used - except that would imply an is a relationship which wouldn t be true
11884
if the object can be serialised to xml and can be described in wsdl then yes it is possible to return objects from a webservice

the data should stay cached until iis recycles your application pool
11907
this may be considered syntax but vb.net is case in sensitive while c# is case sensitive
11935
this can be accomplished using multiple inheritance
12046
it seems to be to be wasted effort to include that in your test if you don t actually need to
12185
it s a repository for singletons that can be exchanged for testing purposes
12229
as for the actual question i d say xml is probably ok as plenty of people will be used to using that for configuration
12243
in case it helps most of this functionality will be revealed via web services and we re a microsoft shop with all the latest gizmos and gadgets
12293
you end up doing some unintuitive tricks to optimize the queries that leave you wondering if it would have been more time effective to write the query by hand in the first place
12331
from my understanding subsonic and asp.net mvc can be redistributed for either an open-source or commercial license and you should be fine just as long as you don t use some sort of viral gpl license that needs to gpl everything
12349
although the error message said the specified module could not be found this is a little misleading -- it s not that it couldn t find php_curl.dll but rather it couldn t find a module that php_curl.dll required
12384
like stu said the go statement is client directive not a sql keyword and only seems to be respected by isql wsql osql etc clients and the sql agent
12505
additionally users should be shown the manuals prior to release and asked to preform tasks based upon the documentation to ensure that it is clear enough
12557
lastly lists are not hashable so the type of mapping done with dictionaries hash tables in perl associative arrays in php must be done with tuples
12638
so basically i m building an app for my company and it needs to be built using ms access and it needs to be built on sql server

it seems like everyone is trying to find the java way to do it like you re doing it in php instead of the way it ought to be done in java
12925
closures can be used for any number of reasons one of which is to reduce the sope of helper functions or values
12956
these images can be made clickable too to allow drill down from the screen shot
12961
it s also worth noting that starting with jdk 1.6 update 7 there is now a bundled profiler called visualvm which can be launched with jvisualvm
12995
it can generate documentation in html postscript pdf and man pages so you don t need to be stuck with sandcastle help files
13070
ref the parameter with the ref keyword will be passed by reference
13089
dates can be converted to http valid dates rfc 1123 by using the r format string in .net
13089
http dates need to be gmt not offset - this can be done using the touniversaltime method
13092
the function will be called with each member in the array passed as its own argument
13100
any changes to the value of an out or ref parameter will be passed back to the caller
13185
back to my first cs 101 i started with notions of what an algorithm was by building a tequila sunrise a step by step process that could be repeated at any time with the right ingredients that will result in the same output from there we move on to basic math functions using scheme like ehaskins was saying.
13195
i think your best bet is to write the best mime handler you can parse a message throw away everything that s not text plain or text html and then force the command in the incoming string to be prefixed with command or something similar so that you can find it in the muck
13224
i ve included a mobile web form in my asp.net project i thought that it could should be seen just for my mobile users but i realize that it can also be seen from any browser i don t see problem there cause i could diff the access using httpbrowsercapabilities.ismobiledevice true and transferring to the appropiate aspx page but it results that when i access to the web form from my mobile device it is identified as ismobiledevice false and sends me to another page
13408
scripts are created to migrate all customer data to a new database if needed and then only that customer s connection string needs to be updated to point to the new location
13409
for those who haven t read the book slack is what google s 20 time is you re given some slice of your day week month year on which to work on things that are not necessarily directly related to your day-to-day job but might have an indirect benefit obviously if you work on stuff that s totally not useful for your job or your company your manager probably won t think very well of the way you spent the time -p
13412
20 of the day should be used for private projects and research
13423
my hope is that someone familiar with webobjects might have done this already and have some insight that would save me some time
13470
would the expression be changed in any way if the were removed
13521
it uses webdav to communicate with http servers and can be configured to connect to private servers
13537
i was wondering how this could be accomplished and looked around a bit and saw someone say that it could only be done by either
13541
it s like having the cake and eating it too the speed factor is there since when using the enter key no unnecessary tabing must be done to get to the correct field and using the enter key next to the numeric keyboard makes it really smooth
13582
for example there was a recursive function call the developer had created in the cake project which instantiated the entire cake object every recursion and this would have taken out the server had it gone live under load
13607
i missed two important points first this will be used cross platform including homebrew on a sony psp
13746
if the future really will be written in labview c++ programmer won t have much trouble crossing over
13757
without such control you have to rely on the server to provide a listing which 1 may be disabled for security reasons 2 is non-standardized in its format 3 will be like lubos said fragile to parse scrape
13806
i have successfully hooked createfile with the detours library from msr but createfile never seems to be called with file i am interested in snooping on
13817
its still slow compared to debugging with eclipse pdt with xdebug
13832
does anybody have vb nant tips
13844
well i think you might have missed the r or miscounted the backslashes.
13941
i know that there s a function that can be used in cocoa apps nsbeep but i don t think that has much anything to do with this
14034
i don t do any dts type work or anything like that so there might be some use cases for using trigger there but if anyone in any of my teams says that they might want to use a trigger they better have prepared their arguments well because i refuse to stand by and let triggers be added to any database i m working on
14039
i think they re fine for house cleaning tasks like populating audit data created by modified date etc and in some databases can be used for referential integrity
14051
i used a trigger as a temporary fix to add an extra dummy byte a space to the end of the data solving our problem until a proper solution could be rolled out
14053
it s arguable how much test duty should be carried out by the dev in the third example but i argue that it s most efficient for the dev because all of the related minutiae from many layers of documentation and code are already in her short-term memory
14058
databases expose themselves via tables and keeping tables and rows consistent can be done with triggers
14065
if these two steps cannot be done try using a weakreference they are usually perfect for these situations but they come with overhead
14135
a script can be called to move the files into production
14147
an interesting article shows how this might be done and this shows how hook scripts can be used with subversion
14181
for example a unit test might have guybrush threepwood move toward a door pathfinding open the door use command fail because he doesn t have a key in his inventory feedback pick the door key pathfinding + inventory management and then finally opening the door
14232
this can be used to generated stubs to execute from php and you can then go about rewriting the .net code into php in an incremental fashion
14259
fit for example uses html tables that can be written in word
14261
don t be afraid of mxml
14265
visual c++ express edition will need to be configured to build for windows platform
14273
inheritance should only be used for polymorphism when it makes sense from a modelling point of view
14312
an own appdomain can also be used to filter assemblies and types that you don t want to load
14360
lighting or light s need not be enabled to use those corresponding light values inside cg
14379
declare a callback function that shall be called whenever the scroll wheel is scrolled

by the way this is always the answer for code that is out of your hands as long as you do not have en decryption hardware sent with it
14504
i want to set tab stops for my indents and lining up function signatures and rows of assignment statements which could be specified in points instead of fixed character positions
14515
we use nunitlite although i think we did have had to add some code to it in order for it to work
14549
linq can of course be used to call stored procedures
14577
the stored procedure builds up a result set in a #temporary table which is all ready to be returned except that one of columns isn t terribly human readable it s an alphanumeric code
14656
i am considering all get requests that we wish to be cachable be requested over http with the body encrypted using asymmetric encryption where each client has the decryption key
14656
anytime we wish to perform a get that is not cachable or a post operation it will be performed over ssl
14908
the engine is usually very open and there are a lot of algorithmic tweaking to be done that can dramatically affect performance
15082
remember though that any public-facing method property or field can be accessed via reflection or in a derived type in a seperate assembly
15091
java and .net programmers are pretty much a commodity now so can be offered for less cost
15119
for an idea what might be involved take a look at this tutorial from adobe for photoshop
15139
edit yes gears and cookies can be used for local storage but you can t easily get access to files and other objects the user already has around
15171
i m thinking specifically python scripts to be called by cron
15277
particularly seeing as the sprocs probably aren t in source control and therefore can t be accessed via web-based scm browsers and so on
15323
that said i am sure there are many smarter people out there than me that may have tried this with greater success
15372
if you require the size for other calculations where the number of elements may not be known you can use sizeof a 1 and multiply by your required element count
15388
so there might be a reason why a new codec would be installed in windows without .net inherently knowing about it
15412
now don t get me wrong - i believe srp to be the key to most good oo designs but i feel there are cases where this principle can and should be broken just like database normalization rules
15457
in my opinion it is not so important to follow specified standards when you make these drawings that just complicates things and results in fewer figures being made
15600
you might get back a response which could clearly be shown to contain every row in one or more tables which is probably not what they want
15712
there were some excellent suggestions already but i just wanted to mention that perl can also be called can call to c c++

this will force the project to be rebuilt if any of the others change and you won t have to mess with any other pre post-build events
15798
how can that be done in python
15810
they ll still be there show all files in solution explorer but they won t be included when building the project
15838
the practice of programming be improved using any of c s native utilities if i set the i variable to be a register variable

a much bigger performance improvement can be achieved by using better algorithms for example keeping the list sorted and doing a binary search
15904
a simple linked list can be used for this
15951
the visual studio 2005 and 2008 3-month trial editions are fully-functional and can be used indefinitely forever by setting the system clock back prior to opening vs
15954
how can a sdbm hash function such as this be implemented in c#
16049
the functionality of reduce can be done using function recursion which i guess guido thought was more explicit

for this particular use case a fitting library i imagine allowing users to define mathematical functions guassian lorentzian etc. as python functions which can then to be passed an interpreted by the compiled code fitting library
16248
i d like to implement a way of recording the version of a project within code so that it can be used when testing and to help track bugs
16320
i ve seen projects where the classes in the db layer have just static functions in them and other projects where those classes need to be instantiated to get access to the member functions
16324
the webserver at hostone.com can be configured to redirect easy in apache not sure about iis etc
16369
it should have modify permissions and these may need to be reapplied if you are overwriting files
16463
formatting is easier to optimize for the compiler although the second will probably be refactored to use the concat method which is fast
16463
however this could be amended in future versions
16504
it can be applied in-line like this evaluates to 50
16514
lambda functions should not be confused with anonymous methods
16514
anonymous methods can t be read and so the logic can t be translated out as it can for lambda functions
16515
i started with labview about 2 years ago and now use it all the time so may be biased but find it ideal for applications where data acquisition and control are involved
16568
it would also be interesting to see how this can be achieved using the native functionality of the following databases
16643
however his can easily be stripped away using the trim command in php
16662
both are licensed as gpl+exceptions to state explicitly that applications which merely use the openjdk libraries will not be considered derived works
16680
the interesting thing with c# s lambda syntax though is that on their own their type cannot be infered you can t type var foo x y x y but depending on which type they re assigned to they ll be compiled as delegates or abstract syntax trees representing the expression which is how linq object mappers do their language-integrated magic
16727
how can this be coded in gwt
16746
thus when debugging you can get the debugging feed when you want to see completed transactions you go to the transactions feeds etc
16758
i also have been following the thoughts of stephen walther on mvc and i think this post is great to repopulate the fields with the data submitted for it to be changed before submitting it again
16816
to be honest in java there is not really an argument against overriding equals
16825
this could be implemented in c# as a treenode base class with a derived leaf class and a derived treenodewithchildren class and if you want even a derived emptynode class
16853
sample usage can be found on this blog post
16855
you will be given a choice of vs2005 or new instance of microsoft script editor choose that and give it a go
16926
what i need is a tool that parses my html and spits out a stylesheet with all the possible elements ready to be styled maybe even with some defaults

read from the input stream looking for the pattern used to indicate the file should be separated while writing to the current output file
17068
iis6 compression - most likely you need to specify file types to be compressed like .jpg .png .gif types etc
17120
before leveraging cruisecontrol to it s fullest extent you need to create an automated build script that can be run by msbuild or nant
17204
this can be done either by having your assert handler support a callback mechanism or your test asserts contain a try catch block
17263
i really am interested in why people believe shell scripts should be avoided in mission-critical applications but i can t think of a compelling reason
17292
the brand really depends on the platform most likely php rails asp but most of them can be found by typing cms into google
17313
cannot be initialized to null or to a
17316
the one propertygroup is where all the configuration happens and things can be customized like excluding certain projects from the build or adding new test assembly masks
17365
command line options for mutt can be shown with mutt -h
17389
cc can simply be replaced by bcc if you wish to send blind carbon copies
17389
similarly symbols such as signs will need to be written in hex code
17417
this can be resolved by using a more advanced integrator such as verlet
17505
encapsulation would only be broken if this could be caused from outside the class if your would proclaim i m a friend of class foo .
17521
y must be initialized in order for y.dodance to be able to execute

also be sure to store or be able to calculate the mimetype for each file so it can be served correctly back to the browser with the correct http headers
17732
there s a discussion going on over at comp.lang.c++.moderated about whether or not assertions which in c++ only exist in debug builds by default should be kept in production code or not
17732
an assertion is error pure and simple and therefore should be handled like one
17732
since an error should be handled in release mode then you don t really need assertions
17737
but in this context it should be pointed out that linux is not completely posix compliant
17782
if however you have changes that may be submitted to main from a dev branch or little tweaks by someone on main then do the former
18000
then i deployed clr stored proc to my target database from visual studio and used this tsql to execute from ssms logged in with windows authentication
18104
could anyone recommend any tools that can be used for this
18115
if you think about it the base object has to be instantiated in memory before the derived class can be appended to it
18172
the application is often used on wireless mobile workstations in large hospitals and i m assuming connectivity can be lost either momentarily or for several minutes at a time

filter would be awesome for this
18448
it seems wcf could ve been an option but i prefer not to upgrade from .net 2.0

it s a lot easier to build data models using visual studio 2008 that can be used for linq to sql if there are proper foreign key relationships
18837
if you happen to have a file that matches .sh in the current working directory the wildcard will be expanded before find sees it
18873
for example the idea of a customer may consist of a main record in a customer table combined with all of the orders the customer has placed as well as all the customer s employees and their contact information and some of the properties of a customer and its children may be determined from lookup tables
18941
the current compatibility still has much to be desired but this should eventually become usable in all browsers
19042
without using diagrams we would have had to take the time to go one by one through the students code files looking for problems
19096
this needs to be ported to .net
19138
expressions can be evaluated to get a value whereas statements don t return a value they re of type void
19138
function call expressions can also be considered statements of course but unless the execution environment has a special built-in variable to hold the returned value there is no way to retrieve it
19150
thus expressions can be used in statements but not the other way around
19152
yield can be used to replace a normal return in a function
19152
they may be used in place of a list comprehension to save memory list comprehensions create a list in memory that is destroyed after use if not assigned to a variable but generator expressions can create a generator object.
19224
this blurring of expressions and statements occurs in all the c-derivatives c c++ c# and java which still have some statements like while but which allow almost any expression to be used as a statement in c# only assignment call increment and decrement expressions may be used as statements
19302
i was under the impression that events should always be fired from virtual onxxx methods that take an eventargs parameter
19393
you can use the deprecated carbon apis with other languages like java but new applications for osx really should be developed in objective-c
19396
yes recycling every few hours would help hide the problem but they ought to be debugged and fixed properly .
19422
work but they need a sequential scan of all the table because the random value associated with each row needs to be calculated - so that the smallest one can be determined which can be quite slow for even medium sized tables
