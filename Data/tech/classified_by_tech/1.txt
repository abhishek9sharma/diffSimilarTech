i am really fond of technologies that java offers - particularly spring framework and wicket and i am quite familiar with java from others projects and assignments before

11471

i m not yet very familiar with wpf but i see this as a question about sorting and filtering collections

12184

there s nothing wrong with xml it s reasonably human readable as much as yaml or json or ini files are but remember its intent is to be read by machines

12313

we ve gone through so much pain with tfs msbuild using tfsdeployer custom powershell scripts etc to get it to do what we were able to do with nant out of the box

12937

imperative languages like java and c# solve a certain set of problems pretty well but it also helps to think in a functional manner sometimes such as with haskell and lisp

25171

i also install safari and opera but mostly just use them for testing and benchmarking since their dev tools aren t as robust as firefox and they aren t as buggy as ie

25275

i am not familiar with ruby on rails but the following is untested php code

33438

but some of the data i have to show on some forms has to come from text files and by text files i mean human-readable files they can be csv tab-delimited or even a key value pair per line since my data is as simple as this but my preference of course is xml files

i m not familiar with bazaar but git doesn t track file renames

ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

i remember when i first started learning emacs it was after i was already very comfortable with vim and i was in the same or similar boat that you were where i knew how to get a lot done in another editor so as i started using emacs it was always painfully slow

86497

we can say that we re stuck with js but is it really so bad with jquery prototype scriptaculous mootools and all fantastic libraries

88862

i ve had a lot of success with pdflib it s a very powerful library with php and c c# perl etc bindings

91888

specifically it can be used for variable names that clash with reserved keywords you can t use params but you can use params instead same with out ref any other keyword in the language specification

112832

on the other hand there are many php frameworks out there such as cakephp symfony and codeigniter that take a load it as you need it approach

116326

i think it is hard to quantify software compatibility but i d say code written for solaris is quite forward compatible with opensolaris kernel

116490

kernel modules in particular will be very compatible between solaris and opensolaris

122424

both of which are perfectly possible with perforce but the git workflow has some advantages. so although tributary development would be distributed and not refer to a common revision sequencing we d still maintain a master git repo that all changes would need to feed into before a build was created

c# readonly and java final are nowhere as useful as c++ s const there s no way you can expose readonly complex data a tree of nodes for example in c# without tremendous work while it s a built-in feature of c++

149122

i m not familiar with oracle but in mysql you can use use|ignore|force_index see here for more details

161332

it aims to be totally compatible with .net so you d end up using c# and asp.net just the same

161821

i am really comfortable with svn but for the current e-commerce project i am doing on django i decided to work on git i am using git in svn-mode that is with a centralised repo that i push to and pull from in order to collaborate with at least one other developer

164073

i know with myisam tables you can get the table def update time but thats not so true with innodb and i ve found its not even reliable to look at the .frm file for an idea of when the definition might have been modified..

169405

if you re already familiar with ant and want the dependency management that comes with maven you might take a look at ivy

174959

you do need a ruby enabled server such as apache running eruby erb

176465

that being said output buffering might be just a tiny bit faster as the space allocated for the input is fairly large by default 40k according to this

177844

as far as i can tell vhdl vs verilog gets just as religious as ruby vs python or java vs c#

181973

happily you can use sql dcl begin transaction commit transaction rollback transaction etc to acomplish things not possible with dao nested transactions

197760

i m not overly concerned with the core-language of the package unless i d need to hack on the code for the system itself in which case i m reasonably comfortable with php perl and .net though i could probably pickup an other language s as needed
