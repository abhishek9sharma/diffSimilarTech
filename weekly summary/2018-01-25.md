### 1. Identify sentences using patterns

1. Preprocess: I use [work by cjxuan1995](https://github.com/cjxuan1995/mining_analogical_libraries/blob/master/DataPreprocessing.py) with slight changes.

2. POS Tag:
   * Tagger: `nltk.pos_tag()` (NLTK Default POS Tagger)

   * CV (comparative verbs): based on [83 key words and key phrases proposed by Bing et al](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/related%20papers/comparative-lexicon.pdf)

     ```python
        cv = {"beat", "beats", "prefer", "prefers", "recommend", "recommends",
           "defeat", "defeats", "kill", "kills", "lead", "leads", "obliterate",
           "obliterates", "outclass", "outclasses", "outdo", "outdoes",
           "outperform", "outperforms", "outplay", "outplays", "overtake",
           "overtakes", "smack", "smacks", "subdue", "subdues", "surpass",
           "surpasses", "trump", "trumps", "win", "wins", "blow", "blows",
           "decimate", "decimates", "destroy", "destroys", "buy", "buys",
           "choose", "chooses", "favor", "favors", "grab", "grabs", "pick",
           "picks", "purchase", "purchases", "select", "selects", "race",
           "races", "compete", "competes", "match", "matches", "compare",
           "compares", "lose", "loses", "suck", "sucks"}
     ```

   * CIN (comparative prepositions):

     ```python
        cin = {"than", "over", "beyond", "upon", "as", "against", "out", "behind",
                "under", "between", "after", "unlike", "with", "by", "opposite"}
     ```

   * APP: tags

   | No.                                      | Pattern             | Number | Original Examples       | Good examples                            | Bad examples                             |
   | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
   | [0](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/pattern/0.txt) | JJR * CIN * APP     | 569    | better than uber        | vb.net shouldn t be much slower than c# (`c#-to-vb.net`	`vb.net-to-c#`) | does anyone have an even better solution than this one |
   | [1](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/pattern/1.txt) | RB JJ * CIN APP     | 212    | more stable  than yahoo | its test framework is as good as nunit but you can t use its code coverage tools or anything else | the size of the set could be as big as n n-1 2 for example if x 1 2 4 ... 2 n |
   | [**8**](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/pattern/8.txt) | **RBR JJ CIN APP**  | 60     |                         | technically ruby is more sophisticated than java or c# being closer to smalltalk in terms of oo purity and closer to lisp in terms of meta-programming facilities | but i get the impression you re actually more concerned with performance which isn t really the preserve of unit testing at all |
   | [2](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/pattern/2.txt) | CV * CIN APP        | 32     | prefer over ola         | my opinion is that vb is more productive then c# it seems it is always ahead in terms of productivity tools such as intelisense and i would recommend vb over c# to someone that asks | and how do you recommend dealing with this in the logic of the site |
   | [3](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/pattern/3.txt) | CV VBG APP          | 26     | prefer using opera      | *i recommend trying netbeans if you re on windows* | it seems to prefer making web applications that look like applications instead of web applications that look like websites |
   | [4](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/pattern/4.txt) | CV APP              | 509    | beats youtube           | instead of j# i would rather prefer ikvm to convert my jars to .net assemblies as well as access java apis in c# | i d recommend testing it for yourself    |
   | [5](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/pattern/5.txt) | VB VBN * APP        | 1216   | be compared facebook    | this may be considered syntax but vb.net is case in sensitive while c# is case sensitive | worked awesome for me and have heard nothing but goodness about it |
   | [6](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/pattern/6.txt) | APP * VBZ * JJS     | 249    | airdroid is the best    | in linux and os x popen really is your best bet as dmckee pointed out since both oss support that call | which is the best                        |
   | [**9**](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/pattern/9.txt) | **APP * VBZ * RBS** | 138    |                         | the distro which is most developer friendly in my opinion is gentoo | no guarantees that this code is best practice |
   | [7](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/pattern/7.txt) | APP * VBZ * JJR     | 494    | qs is better            | another option is vmware fusion which is much better than parallels in my opinion + windows xp + sql server management studio | note this will probably not work if delay is more than 9 hours long |
   | [10](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/pattern/10.txt) | **APP * VBZ * RBR** | 433    |                         | sql express is also more install and forget than oracle | the shorter names makes it more readable to me as well |

5. Problems:

   * `python beats java`: *beats* is recognized as NNS instead of VBZ

   * `this`, `any`, `using` and `option` are APPs

   * Pronoun: `it s a lot lighter weight than xml` (Post ID 16551: `There's a lot of people who will push JSON. It's a lot lighter weight than XML`.)

   * One entity in the question and another in the answer

   * The original paper focused on reviews from Google Play

   * List: (Post ID 2033)

     ```markdown
     **by value**
     	* is slower than by reference since the system has to copy the parameter
     	* used for input only
     **by reference**
     	* faster since only a pointer is passed
     	* used for input and output
         * can be very dangerous if used in conjunction with global variables
     ```


### 2. Identify sentences using similar techniques & classify sentences using patterns

1. Extract techniques from [cateInGroups_freq100_v2.txt](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/data/cateInGroups_freq100_v2.txt) and store in [a *pkl* file](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/data/pairs.pkl)
2. Results of identifying sentences which contain similar techniques:
   * [tech_sentences.txt](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/tech/tech_sentences.txt): 5606 / 510513 sentences, post id from 0 to 99999 (58889)
   * [tech_sentences_2.txt](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/out/tech/tech_sentences_2.txt): 6213 / 360102 sentences, post id from 100000 to 199999 (67567)
3. Classify sentences
   * use all tags: [592 / 11819 sentences](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/tree/master/out/tech/classified_by_tags)
   * use similar tech: [499 / 11819 sentences](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/tree/master/out/tech/classified_by_tech)

### 3. Summarizing comparative opinions

1. Topic analysis

   * a list of keywords for each topic ![1](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/weekly%20summary/2018-01-25-1.png)
   * make use of Word2Vec to expand keywords
2. Preference analysis
   * increasing comparative, neutral comparative, decreasing comparative
   * positive/neutral keyword, negative keyword
   * current app, opponent app
