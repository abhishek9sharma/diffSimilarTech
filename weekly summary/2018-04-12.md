1. sim = 0.7432854250391989  `3des` & `aes` 

```
['slower']
furthermore 3des is much slower than aes
['faster']
should be as fast as 3des aes turned out to be much faster than 3des in software typically 5 to 10 times faster
```

2. sim = 0.45999880742131927 `rsa` & `aes`

```
['safe']
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa
['asymmetric', 'secure', 'symmetric']
asymmetric key encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric key encryption ex aes
```

3. sim = 0.7259699106878483 `compiled-language` & `interpreted-language`

```
['performance', 'programs', 'better']
performance of programs in compiled-language is significantly better than that of an interpreted-language
['examples', 'better', 'performance']
writing in a compiled-language java or c++ in your examples would almost certainly give better performance than an interpreted-language like php
```

4. sim = 0.6262004983552482 `tcp` & `udp`

```
['nat', 'easier']
as such traversing a nat through udp is much easier than tcp
['nat', 'traversal', 'harder']
but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over tcp which is a harder problem than udp
```
