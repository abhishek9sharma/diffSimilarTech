1. `TECH * * * * (* *) TECH **` if there only two `TECH`s
2. `* * TECH * * * * TECH * *`

**Good example**:

`concurrent,use,better`

with correct locking for **safety** reasons and **heavy concurrent** use `postgresql` performed **better** than `mysql`

**Bad example**:

`first,answer,more,compliant,standard,group,clause`

following the first answer it appears that `postgresql` is **more compliant to sql standard** than `mysql` so it needs a group by clause for each selected column you want to display with your aggregated function
