**1059** tech pairs: [relations.txt](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/relation/relations.txt)

**8924** pattern 0,7,8,10 / **13037** [comparative sentences](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/relation/sentences_.txt)/ **1295662** sentences containing similar techs

Post ID from 0 to **29,000,000**

| No   | Pattern           |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| 0    | JJR * CIN * TECH  |
| 8    | RBR JJ * CIN TECH |
| 7    | TECH * VBZ * JJR  |
| 10   | TECH * VBZ * RBR  |

**Tech1** is **JJR** than **Tech2**

**Tech1** is **more JJ** than **Tech2**

**Tech1** VBZ (e.g. uses, has) **more NN** than **Tech2**

**Example**:

46614

post	get

pattern10		pattern8

**post** is also **more secure** than **get** because you aren t sticking information into a url

**Problems**:

1. *compared to* and several similar tech pairs

853042

ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection

pattern7

compared to **ienumerable** and **icollection** **ilist** performs much **better** for large or dynamic **lists** because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

2. several aspects

2336560

gif	png

pattern7

compared to **gif** **png** offers **better compression** **larger pallette** and **more features** including transparency

3. extract aspect

34338

phpunit	simpletest

pattern0		

i found **simpletest** was even **easier** than **phpunit** to *set up*

### 2. Topic analysis
