ant	maven
pattern3	
they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant

12586
rss	feed
pattern4	
the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number

25701
jdom	xom
pattern4	
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom

27440
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
better performance can be bought with more ram and cpu and more appropriate database design and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-x than agonizing over which to pick mysql or postgresql and specialist tuning from expensive dbas

27529
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
hard to compare mysql and postgresql

34295
emacs	aquamacs
pattern4	
if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like

i prefer phpunit now but when i started out i used simpletest as i didn t always have access to the command line

34566
equals	gethashcode

web browser print dialogs default to portrait so for every print job the user has to manually select landscape

44638

54817
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
pattern4	
this seems like an object state invalid scenario to me so i d pick invalidoperationexception over argumentexception the parameters are valid but not at this point in the objects life

54817
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception

postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
however the observation of database-locking stands - if you have particularly onerous updates sqlite performance won t match mysql or postgresql

64644
vim	emacs
pattern4	
i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim

if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

84239
distance	polygons

in most cases what you really want to say is union all as it does not do duplicate elimination think select distinct between sets which can result in quite a bit of savings in terms of execution time

85414

i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox

87006

162785
post	put
pattern3	
you could put the text into an invisible span and read that spans width but basicly this looks like someone trying to sabotage your site and therefore i would recommend banning post with words longer than a certain lenth for example 30 characters without spaces allowing links to be longer

162991
swt	swing
pattern4	
i will probably choose swt swing or qtjambi for the ui controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation

167539
getdate	dateadd
pattern4	
select dateadd dd 1 getdate will return a current date + 1 day

167922

pattern4	
i personally prefer merb over ruby-on-rails as it adopts more ruby conventions

171958

179294
post	get
pattern4	
further i recommend to use post wherever possible avoid using get for form submits - if some users want to simulate a form submit via get make sure your application supports the desired parameters either via post or via get but when you submit the page yourself via a button or js prefer post over get

i would certainly recommend perforce for a number of reasons already covered in other answers but i m not in a position to offer a comparison with svn having never really used it

192156
coalesce	isnull
pattern4	
other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull

194197
lxml	elementtree
pattern4	
i actually prefer lxml as it has api like elementtree but has also nice additional features and performs well

194489
xstream	xom
pattern3	
if you decide to roll your own xml configuration i d recommend using xstream with customized serialization options or if you just need to parse some xml take a look at xom

195398
postgresql	mysql
pattern4	
at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks

195415
postgresql	mysql
pattern2	
you could then compare these with mysql and postgresql

197210
mouse	keyboard
pattern4	
this will not remove the key binding from vmware but you could set the option to grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press in the vmware preferences

199835

if you re shaky on recursion at all i highly recommend learning scheme or lisp

294103
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
pattern4

vim	emacs
pattern4	
as for an editor if you like cli stuff then emacs or vim is the way to go i prefer emacs

330657
post	get
pattern3	
security wise i prefer using post than get as it gives at least some opaqueness as to what is being passed as a parameter and not anyone can just edit the url and play around

330918

does hibernate hql queries support using select min max count and other sql functions

338537

pattern4	
so far i found that we can buy typemock to mock the sharepoint objects and then use any free mocking framework moq

369779
entity-relationship	diagram

i would choose between ilist and ienumerable and wouldn t consider array at all

396838
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari

406323
google-chrome	safari

448892
mp3	flv

select dateadd d getdate 8 - dow getdate

467696
vmware	virtualbox
pattern4	
it was developed with only various versions of windows in mind and from my experience there s always some sort of problem running any linux distro under it. i would recommend vmware as suggested above or alternatively virtualbox which has worked very well for me in the past it runs certain linux distros best though i can t remember which ones

ever since reading what paul graham has to say about lisp i ve been intending to go back and pick scheme up again and see if it ll improve my programming in general

599070
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
pattern3	
if your long term goal is to migrate to using maven to manage the entire build process which one might intend to do for new greenfield projects then i heartily recommend using maven pom.xml files to manage dependencies on behalf of ant build.xml files
